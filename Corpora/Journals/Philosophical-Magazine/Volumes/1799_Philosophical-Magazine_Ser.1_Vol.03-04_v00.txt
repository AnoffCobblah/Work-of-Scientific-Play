 I.   Description   of the Volcano in the Island of St. Lucia. By
     M. Cassan.           From New Transactions of the Swedish
     Academy of Sciences, Vol.        XI.
  M<.ORE         volcanoes   are   to be found    in the West India
 islands than in any other part        of the globe ; and from the
 frequency of earthquakes, the        abundance of hot springs, &c.
in   these islands, there is reason to conclude that those sub
stances which are the cause         of them still exist.      On account
of the great quantity       of sulphur produced by        the  mountain
where this crater is situated, the name of la Souffriere has
been given to it and to the whole adjacent district.                 The
mountain       itself forms a part of     a high ridge, which runs
across    the whole island from north-east to south-west, and
encloses the crater like a bason,       which can    be reached     with
out great difficulty.       Those who visit    it must put on      thick-
soaled boots, as the earth, before they have got to the distance,
of two miles from        the town, becomes     exceedingly hot j and
they must carry nothing          of metal with them,       and particu
larly silver, because their splendor is destroyed by the vapour.
The sulphurised hydrogenous smell, which                 still increases,

4)                     Description    of the Volcano
begins at the distance of little more than half a mile front
the town.       But however strong this smell may be, it seems
not to be prejudicial, for the inhabitants in the neighbour
hood enjoy the best health and attain to a considerable age.
Though this district is mountainous and exposed to inunda
 tions, it is very fruitful : its sugar canes produce the richest
 sugar, as the districts around Etna and Vesuvius produce the
 most celebrated      wine.      The nearer you approach          the crater,
 the more numerous you find the volcanic productions.                    You
 pass over various rivulets, the water          of which     has a sulphu
 reous smell, and the scum seems to contain saline and ochery
 matter.      You   soon after arrive at the side         of the mountain
 which    rises over the volcano towards the south-west.                  The
 road lies across the declivity of the mountain, which is ex
 ceedingly steep;       so  that the traveller on one fide         fees a ter
 rible, almost perpendicular,          abyss filled   with abundance of
 vapour from boiling water by which                 he is furrour.Jed,    and
 as  it were   enveloped     :  on the other     side he is enclosed     by   a
 high steep rock, yet one can ride without danger to that part
 of the mountain which encloses the volcano on the east side ;
 but when you arrive there, you must procure                    a guide, and
 descend     the mountain,        by a very steep path, between low
 thick brusti-wood.           Throup-bout the whole way vou must
 beat on both        sides  with a stick, in order to guard            against
 being bit by snakes.          Scarcely have you reached the bottom
  of the mountain when you find             the heat     of the   atmosphere
  considerably increased,       and the earth hot under the feet.         The
  sulphureous vapours which here surround the body soon oc
  casion an abundant perspiration, and the sulphurised hydro
  genous    smell is so powerful as to oblige many persons to re
  turn.    The valley which        encloses   the volcano is about sixty
  fathoms long, fifty broad, and lies sixty fathoms higher than
  the level of the     sea.    It appears as     if  the volcano had long
  ago formed the       hollow,     in which it    is  situated,   by splitting
  the mountain that surrounds the cavity, and by its eruption
  calling to   a distance     on one side those parts which covered
                                                                           the

                         in the Island     of St. Lucia.                          9
 the centre or focus.           In looking down into the crater              great
 care must be taken that the ground, which rings below the
 feet, does not sink,       which would        expose the legs to the dan
ger   of being burnt.           For this     reason     it  is usual   to  send a
guide before to point out the places that are secure, especially
when the weather is changeable ; for people may then be
speedily surrounded          by vapours tbat almost obscure              the sun.
 It  has   also been remarked, that during rain the vapours                    are
more abundant and thicker than at other times.                        It is diffi
cult to fay with any certainty what is the nature of the soil
to be pasted over in order to enter the crater ;                    but it seems
 to consist    of  decomposed       remains, or the scoriae of different
minerals,       and particularly      of pyrites, which           however have
 changed     their nature.        As you     advance       farther, the surface
of the    earth    appears     more and more covered with sulphur,
and you find       a   number of small spiracles, from which arises
a   burning vapour, and which are covered on the sides with
sublimed sulphur that has a very beautiful appearance.                         All
these apertures         may be considered           as so many apparatuses
for distillation, which nature has prepared,                  in order   to purify
the sulphur.          If  you strike your stick against the ground in
this spot, it occasions a vent of that kind, through which the
vapour     issues  with a strong        hissing     noise, and     so hot that it
raises the thermometer ten degrees above the boiling point.
 From    these apertures,       whether the work of nature or of art,
it appears that the whole surrounding district below the sur
face is silled with boiling water ; but this water does not
proceed from rain or from springs                  in the crater, but, in all
probability,      from the mountain which                 rises above the vol
cano on the eastern side.             This is    the more credible, as the
top of this mountain ends in               a  kind of funnel, which is          of
great width, and consists of very marsliy ground.                         Several
small streams        issue   from    it  also   at   different heights, and,
after   traversing      the   surface   of the crater,        pursue their way
through      the valley and discharge             themselves      into the sea.
The water of all           these streams is exceedingly warm, and is
                                        B   a                             covered

4               Description  of the   Volcano in St.  Lucia.
covered      with  a  multitude of air bubbles,       so that it sparkle*
like champagne.           These bubbles exhibit all the phenomena
of oxygen       gas, which probably is disengaged from oxydes of
various kinds with which it was combined in the earth.
What among the phenomena of the crater excites most won
der are, twenty-two large basons, full          of boiling water   ; some
of which        are twenty feet     in diameter, and which maybe
considered       as monstrous cauldrons placed over the most vio
lent fire.       The ebullition is so strong that water bubbles of
 four or five feet in height are thrown up, which raise the
 thermometer far above the boiling point ; but this however
 is the cafe only in those where the water is from one to two
 feet  in depth, though the depth in general amounts to eight
 or ten feet. You may walk round the edge of them without
 any danger, and contemplate at leisure this astonishing quan
 tity of boiling water.         It is of a black colour, oily, covered
 with    scum at the edges, and diffuses a vapour which obscures
 the atmosphere.          From this ebullition     and high state of the
  thermometer, we might be induced to believe, that there is
 a great quantity of heat in these basons ; but if you put
 your hand into the water, you find the heat less than that of
 boiling water. The ebullition also may proceed only from
 the vapours which rise from the bottom of the excavations
 with     so   much strength      that they give the water a boiling
 movement        ; and, in the like manner, the rising of the ther
 mometer ought to be ascribed to these vapours also.             The   sur
  face  of   the ground is   of a  pale yellow colour, and besprinkled
  with   a  multitude of small siiining crystals, for the most part
  crystals of sulphur.       The upper part of the crater, towards
  the south-east,     rises exceedingly steep, and is covered       with   a
  great number osother crystals lying in          a kind of earth, which
  is partly calcareous, and partly of an unctuous nature like
  clay.     Among      these crystals   there  are some shaped like flat
  needles, and which are real crystals of fulphat of lime. Others
  exhibit all the properties      of fulphat of alumine      ;  others ap
  pear  like fulphat of iron, greatly      supersaturated with the acid;
                                                                        and.

and others     like ferruginous pyrites covered with an efflores
cence by the        action of the atmosphere         and      water.    The
above-mentioned substances must be considered                  as the  prin
cipal causes     of the violent commotions which           appear in this
crater.     They    are supplied from a large      stratum       of pyrites ;
and from the violence of the combustion, we may conjecture
that it must be very deep.             It  is probable     also that this
stratum is of considerable         extent, for very hot springs           are
found at the distance of         a mile both to the north and south
of the volcano.        Such    substances accumulated           in different
parts of the earth, when accidentally combined with other
substances,    such as air, water, and inflammable bodies, pro
duce earthquakes         and   other convulsions of nature. Though
the internal re-action of these substances              on one another
seems     to  threaten      danger,   it however     occasions       no da
mage to the colony, because they have immediate commu
nication with the atmosphere, and the whole soil is pene
trated    by water      so  that it cannot     take   fire  :    neither are
coal,    bitumen,     or such inflammable         bodies      found in the
 neighbourhood.

 rains in the five preceding months, are lessened, and some of
 them dried up,        a  number of people are employed to go in
 quest  of elephants.
     At this   season the males come from            the   recesses    of the
 forest into the borders and outskirts thereof,
                                                              whence     they

 make nocturnal excursions               into the plains in search of food,
 and where they often destroy the labours                    of   the husband
 man, by devouring               and    trampling    down      the     rice,  sugar
 canes,     &c. that they         meet    with.    A   herd or drove of ele
 phants, from what           I   can learn, has never been          seen to leave
 the woods     :   some     of the    largest males often stray to a consi
 derable distance       ;   but the young ones always remain in the
 forest under the protection           of the Palmai, or    leader     of the herd,
 and   of  the larger elephants.           The Goondahs, or          large males,
 come out singly, or in small parties, sometimes in the morn
 ing, but commonly in the evening; and they continue to
 feed all night upon the long grafs, that grows amidst the
 swamps      and    marslies, and of which they are extremely
 fond. As often, however, as they have an opportunity, they
 commit      depredations on the rice fields,                sugar canes,       and
 plantain trees       that are near, which oblige the farmers to
keep regular watch, under a small cover, erected on the tops
of  a few long bamboos, about 14 feet from the ground                         : arid
 this precaution is necessary to protect them from the tigers,
 with which this province abounds. From this lofty station
the alarm is soon communicated                    from one watchman               to
another,      and    to the neighbouring            villages, by means          of a
rattle with which each is provided.                   With their        shouts and
cries, and noise of the rattles, the elephants are generally
scared and retire. It sometimes, however, happens, that the
males advance even to the villages, overturn the houses, and
kill  those who unfortunately come                in their way, unless they
have had       time       to   light    a  number of fires : this element
seems to be the most dreaded                 by wild elephants, and a few
lighted wisps of straw              or dried grafs        seldom      fail to stop
their progress.         To    secure one     of the males,      a  very different
method is employed from that which                       is taken to secure a
herd   :  the    former is taken by Koonikees,                  or female ele
phants trained for the purpose, whereas the latter is driven
into   a strong    enclosure       called a Keddali.
                                                                                 As

                Method of Catching Wild Elephants.                           7
    As  the hunters know the places where the elephants               come
 out to feed, they advance towards them in the evening with
 sour Koomkees, which is the number                 of which   each hunt
 ing party consists    :  when the nights are dark, and these are
 the most favourable for their purpose, the male elephants are
 discovered by the noise they make in cleaning their food, by
 whisking and striking it against their forelegs, and by moon
 light they can fee them distinctly at some distance.
    As   soon as    they have determined on the Goondah                  they
 mean to secure, three      of  the Koomkees are conducted silently
 and slowly by their Mahotes (drivers) at a moderate               distance
 from each other, near to the place where he is feeding                ;   the
 Koomkees advance very cautiously, feeding              as they go   along,
 and   appear    like wild elephants, that have strayed from the
jungle.      When     the male perceives       them approaching,         if he
 takes the alarm and is viciously inclined, he beats the ground
with his trunk and makes            a noise,  sliowing evident marks of
 his displeasure, and that he will not allow them to approach
 nearer  ;  and  if they   persist,   he  will immediately attack and
 gore them with       his tusks   ;  for which reason they take care
 to retreat in good      time.      But mould he be amorously dis
 posed, which is generally the cafe,            (as these males   are sup
 posed  to be driven from the herd             at a particular   period by
 their seniors,    to prevent     their having connection with             the
 females   of that herd,) he allows the females to approach, and
 sometimes     even advances      to meet them.
    When, from       these appearances,      the Mahotes judge that he
will  become     their prize', they conduct two of the females,
one on each side close to       him,   and make them advance back
 wards, and press gentlv with their posteriors against his neck
and slioulders : the third female then comes up and places her
self directly across his tail ; in this situation, so far from sus
pecting any design against his liberty, he begins to toy with
the females      and   caress theni    with his trunk.       While thus
engaged, the fourth female is brought near, with ropes and                     .
proper assistants, who immediately get under the belly               of   the

  third female, and put           a flight cord       (the   Chilkah *) round hi*
  hind legs     :   should    he move,        it is    easily broken ; in which
  cafe,   if he   takes no notice        of this slight confinement, nor               ap
  pears    suspicious      of what was going forward,                    the   hunters
  then proceed to tie his legs with                 a strong     cord (called Bun-
  dah   f), which is      passed    alternately, by means of a forked stick
  and   a  kind of hook, from one leg to the other, forming the
  figure of 8; and as these ropes are short, for the convenience
  of being more readily put around his legs,                       6 or 8 are-gene-
  rally employed, and they are made                    fast   by another cord (the
  Daugbearee         J), which      is passed     a few turns perpendicularly
  between his legs, where the folds of the Bundahs intersect
  each other.          A strong cable (the Phand §) with a running
  noose, 6o cubits long, is next put round each hind leg imme
                                                  "
  diately above the Bundahs,                 and    again above        them, 6 or         8
  additional Bundahs, according to the size                        of  the elephant,
  are made fast, in the fame manner as the others were                             :   the
  putting on these ropes generally takes up about 20 minutes,
 during which the utmost                 silence    is observed,       and the        Ma-
  hotes, who keep flat upon the necks of the females,                          are co
  vered    with dark coloured cloths, which                     serve to keep them
  warm, and at the same time do not attract the notice of the
  elephant.        While      the     people are busily employed in tying

the legs of the Goondah,             he   caresses   sometimes      one, and
sometimes    , another,     of the    seducers     (Kootne), examining
their beauties     and   toying with different parts, by which his
desires are excited     and his attention diverted         from the hunt
ers,  and   in   these amorous dalliances he is indulged by the
females.     But    if his  passions should be so roused, before           his
legs are properly secured, as to induce             him   to attempt leap
ing on one of the females, the Mahote, to insure his own
safety and prevent him gratifying his desires any further,
makes the female run away, and at the fame time, by raising
his voice and making          a noise,    he deters the Goondah          from
pursuing   :   this however happens very seldom, for he is                   so
secured by the pressure        of  a Koomkee       on each side and one
behind, that he can hardly turn himself, or                  see any of the
people,  who always keep snug under the belly of the third
female, that stands across his tail, and which serves both to
keep   him    steady and to prevent his         kicking any of the peo
ple who are employed in securing him ; but in general he
is so much taken up with his decoyers, as to attend very little
to any thing else.         In  case  of accidents, however,        should the
Goondah      break loose, the people upon the first alarm can
always mount on the backs of the tame elephants, by a rope
that hangs ready for the purpose, and thus get out of his
reach.    When his hind          legs are properly secured, they leave
him   to himself,      and    retire to a small distance       :  as soon   as
the Koomkees leave him, he attempts to follow, but finding
his legs tied, he is roused to a proper sense of his situation,
and retreats towards the jungle ; the Mahotes follow at a mo
derate distance from him, on. the tame elephants, accompa
nied by   a  number       of  people    that had been previously sent           -
for, and who,      as   soon as the      Goondah      passes   near a stout
tree, make a few turns          of  the Phands,       or long cables that
are trailing      behind him, around its trunk:                his    progress
being thus stopt, he becomes            furious, and exerts his utmost
force to disengage himself;          nor will he then allow any of the
Koomkees       to come      near him, but is outrageous              for some
                                                                         time,

    time, falling clown and goring the earth with his tusks.                 If
   by these exertions the Phands are once broken,              which   some
   times is effected, and       he escapes into the thick       jungle, the
   Mahotes dare not advance            for fear of the other wild ele
   phants, and are therefore        obliged to leave       him to his sale ;
   and in this hampered situation, it is said,            he is even unge
   nerously attacked       by the other wild elephants.              As the
   cables are very strong and seldom give way, when he has ex
  hausted himself by his exertions,            the Koomkces      are again
  brought near and take their former positions, viz. one on
  each side and the other behind.               After getting him nearer
  the tree, the people carry the ends of the long cables around
  his legs, then back and about the trunk of the tree, making
  if they can, two or three turns, so as to prevent even the
  possibility of his escape.        It would    be almost    impossible to
  secure an elephant in any other manner,                as he  would tear
  up any stake that could at the              time    be driven    into the
  ground, and even the noise of doing it would frighten the
 elephant    :  for these reasons, as far       as I  can learn, nothing
 less than a strong tree is ever trusted to by the hunters.              For
 still farther security,     as well  as to  confine him from moving
 to either side, his fore -legs are tied exactly in the fame man
 ner as the hind-legs were, and the Phands are made fast, one
 on each side, to trees or stakes driven deep into the earth.
 During    the process    of tying both     the hind and fore-legs, the
 fourth    Koomkce      gives   assistance where necessary,       and    the
 people employed cautiously avoid going               within reach of his
 trunk;    and when he attempts          to seize them, they retreat      to
 the opposite side     of the Koomkees, and          get on them,    if ne
cessary, by means       of the rope above mentioned, which hangs
ready for them        to lay hold of.       Although by      these means
he is perfectly secured and cannot escape, yet as it would be
both unsafe and inconvenient to allow him to remain in the
verge   of  the  jungle,   a  number of additional ropes are after
wards put on,      as ssiall be  mentioned, for the purpose of con
ducting him to       a proper station.       When      the Goondah      has

 supplied,     as soon       as he  is taken, the Koomkees are again
 brought       near, and a strong rope                (Pharah*)        is then       put
 twice round his body, close to his fore-legs like a girth, and
 tied behind his shoulder ;             then the long end is carried back
 close to his rump and there               fastened, after a couple           of turns
 more have been made round his body. Another cord is next
  fastened to the Pharah, and from thence carried under his
 tail like a crupper (Dooblah t), and brought forward and fas
 tened by a turn or two, to each of the Pharahs, or girths, by
 which     the whole is connected, and each turn                      of these cords
 serves to keep         the rest in their places.               After this    a  strong
 rope (the Tooman J) is put round his buttocks and made fast
  on each side to the girth and crupper, so as to confine the
 motion of his thighs              and prevent his taking a full step.
 These smaller ropes being properly adjusted,                      a couple of large
 cables    (theDools §) with running                 nooses are put around his
 neck, and after being drawn moderately tight, the nooses are
  secured from running closer,                and then tied to the ropes on
  each side forming the girth and crupper already mentioned ;
  and thus all these ropes are connected and kept in their pro-

 Pharahs in their places.

 Two of    them are put round the neck of the elephant, and fastened                to the
 foremost Pharah      or girth,   one on    each side,   in such a manner as to pre
 vent the nooses      fiom being drawn too tight          or coming too far forward :
 and this is effectually done      by the Dooblah ;        for, whenever the elephant
 draws baok,       the Dools pull the crupper forward, which             must   gall  him
 very much,      and prevent him    from using all the force he might otherwise
  exert, in order to free himself.

 per places,       without any risk of the nooses of the Dools be
 coming tight,  so as to endanger the life of the elephant in
 his exertions to free himself. The ends of these cables are
 made fast to two Koomkees,                  one on each side of the Goon-
 dah, by a couple of turns round the belly, close to the shoul
 der, like    a   girth, where      a   turn is made, and it is then carried
 across the chest and fastened to the girth on the opposite fide.
 Every thing being now ready, and                          a passage    cleared       from
 the   jungle, all the       ropes are taken from his legs, and only the
Tooman remains round his buttocks to confine the motion                                 of
his hind legs: the Koomkees pull him forward by the Dools,
and the people             from behind urge him on.                    Instead of ad
vancing in the direction they wish, he attempts to retreat
farther into the jungle           ; he exerts     all his force, falls down and
tears the earth with his tusks, screaming and groaning, and
by his violent exertions often hurts and bruises himself very
much ; and instances happen of their surviving these violent
exertions only        a few      hours, or at most           a    few days.      In    ge
neral,    however, they soon become                     reconciled to their fate,

may be conducted from the verge of the jungle                            as soon as a
passage is cleared.              When      the elephant is brought to his
proper station and made fast, he is treated with                           a   mixture
of severity and gentleness, and in a few months        docile)             (if
he becomes  tractable, and appears perfectly reconciled to his

yet he never or at          kail    seldom attempts           to hurt the females
that have ensnared           him, but on         the       contrary seems pleased

attend for that purpose.

 III.   On the Materials used             for Manufacturing Cajl Iron.
     By Mr. David Mush et of the Clyde Iron Works.
     Communicated         by the   Author.
   A HE        operation of extracting crude or cast iron from the
 ores is one of the least complicated processes, in the art of
 fusion.       Simply    the materials are thrown            into the furnace,
stratum super stratum, and crude-iron is the result.                         Ex
 perience no doubt at first tutored the manufacturer, and
 taught him by repeated lessons the just proportions                       neces
 sary for the production           of certain qualities of iron.
      The materials       used   for the manufacturing of crude-iron
  in this ifland,        before    the   application     of pit-coal, present
  themselves      in the following order :         Charcoal of wood of dif
  ferent kinds, primary ores of iron, with various proportion*
  of argillaceous or        calcareous     iron stones.     Since, charcoal or
  coaks made         from pit-coal, argillaceous ores of iron, with
  small     proportions of Lancashire and Cumberland ores.
  Calcareous stones for          a  flux or solvent.
      In  speaking     of  some   of these    separately,   I  shall not confine
   my observations        to their application to use          in the island of
   Britain    alone ;    but treat      of them     as   connected with the
   operation of fusion for the production of cast-iron in general.
       Charred wood is almost universally used throughout the
   Continent,       as  fuel   for the production of cast-iron.             From
   its great abundance in the northern countries, the discovery
   of pit-coal would be deemed os little advantage for many
   years    to   come *.        The     extensive    woods in Siberia          and
   Sweden afford         a   constant    supply   of   fuel   to the    numerous
   iron works        in those countries.          The necessary regulation*
    which     the   respective governments of each country have
    thought proper to enact, will in all probability preserve,
    during their existence, the necessary supply of fuel for the
      * Pit-coal  has been discovered in Siberia   of various qualities and in great
   abundance, sit for the samo pi rposes to which it is applied in this coumiy.
                                                                            manu

 14                        On the Materials used
manufacturers*.            If   the    woods receive necessary care and
attention after the first cutting,              they will replace themselves
at periods       from    15    to    18 years.          The charcoal         used     in
Siberia is all made from the pine and larch, the country af
fording no other varieties of timber.                     In Sweden         the ma
nufacturers are supplied             with      a considerable         proportion      of
harder woods, which is greatly in favour of the manufacture.
    It has been already noticed, in a former paper, that the
fuel used in      Britain at an early period, and so far down as
the beginning of the present century, chiefly consisted of
wood.         The kinds of wood               used     for this       purpose     were
various     ;  but char of hard wood, such                 as   oak, birch,       ash,
&c. &c. was always preferred to that made from pine, holly,
sallow, &c. &c. At the small remaining number of char
coal furnaces now in this country,                    the oak has still the un
doubted preference.              Its firmness        and   continuity       enable     it
in    the blast furnace to support              and convey principle            to the
iron      contained in      a   larger portion of ore,               than   charcoal
made from softer wood.                The    same properties also enable               it
for a time to sustain          a heavier        pressure   of air from       the dis
 charging pipe      :  this facilitates the reduction of the whole,
 and     greatly augments the weekly produce in iron.                             The
 mode      of preparing charcoal of wood for                   the blast-furnace,
 though extremely simple, is yet capable of being greatly
 misunderstood, so as to occasion a considerable waste of
 wood in the process.               The following          is the detail        of an
 operation which         I have     seen successfully          tried, and which
 was productive of excellent                 charcoal.        It    is the    fame      I
 believe      as is followed        at    the two        charcoal       furnaces in
 Argvleshire.
     First of all, a plot of ground is raised               a  little higher than
    *  In  Sweden there is a law                    the manufacturers      of iron   to a
                                      restricting
certain annual produce ;      and this quantity is always         in proportion    to the
ground     attached  to the work.       In this    manner    the wood is enabled to
replace itself at certain intervals ; and each work is insured of an annual
though moderate supply.       The   more extensive and unpeopled tracts of Sibe
ria, render such exactitude in the execution of the laws less necessary.
                                                                                    the

the surrounding surface        :    this is made slightly convex.             The
burner commences            by placing        in the centre        a   circle of
sticks, transversely    inclining, and crossing each other near
their tops.    Around these are built successive circles of wood
of various    sizes,  from    i    to 10 inches diameter;          but care is
always taken to place those of similar diameters in the fame
circle. A round of beams, of the largest nature, is immedi
ately followed by one so much smaller as                    to fill up the      in
terstices between     the larger diameters, that no more air may
be admitted than is necessary to excite               gradual combustion.
These are again followed by pieces of an increasing diameter.
THis mode of ranging the large and small sizes is continued
till  such time as the pile is deemed             sufficiently large.          The
total width may then measure from 20 to 30 feet.                        The last
layer   is  commonly composed               of  small   brush-wood.           The
whole is then covered with turf, the grassy side towards the
wood ; a coating of earth is then applied all round the
bottom of the pile, and firmly beat to prevent the unneces
sary admission     of air.      A     small  funnel,    or opening on the
top, is preserved by the transverse position of the first layer
of wood; this      is generally about 18 inches deep, into                  which
the    burning     fuel  is introduced.           Combustion         is in this
 manner first conveyed to the top of the pile, and is continued
by feeding the small craters with              pieces  of wood for 4 or           5
days.      When the interior part of              the   fire next the top is
deemed      sufficiently    kindled       and   spread     over    the       whole
diameter,    a  row of holes is opened          a few   inches below, each
about two inches diameter.               The hole      at the     top     is then
entirely ssiut up, and the sire, now completely spread, slowly
descends to where the air is admitted by means                    of   the small
apertures.      When this        is observed by the burner,             which is
known by the disappearance              of  smoke and vapour, they are
immediately stiut up, and            a second   row opened 6 or         8   inches
under the first.      In this manner          the fire is conducted to the
foundation of the pile, and the whole mass exposed to pro
per combustion.         The intention of the operation is to bring
the whole pile to a       state    of complete ignition, but in             such a
                                                                         manner

                             On the Materials used
 manner that no greater a portion of it may undergo com
 bustion than is necessary to produce that effect.                   Hence the
 necessity for guarding against too free an access                 of air during
the process.         As   soon as the operation is           ended, which may
last for 10 or 14 days, the whole is more closely covered up,
 and kept     so  till such     time   as   the char is deemed       sufficiently
 cool to be fit for drawing              :    it  is then separated from the
 earth, and carried away in bags or in waggons. Those
pieces of wood not sufficiently charred are by the workmen
 called brands, and are commonly used for fuel to the next fire.
    The    loss   of weight in charring wood is inconceivably
great.      In the large way it is almost impossible to ascertain
it  to any degree       of  exactness.         The qualities of wood       are so
various, and the tendency which some have                        beyond others
of parting with their juices,              even when exposed to the same
temperature, render it at best but                   a  matter of dubiety.      I
shall however insert a few which                      I have charred      in the
small way,         and the results          obtained      from them;       before
weighing they were all exposed to the same temperature for
a considerable time, and thoroughly dried.
    It  is however worthy              of remark, that         the  produce in
charcoal      in the small way,              does not give        an invariable
standard     whereby to judge of that obtained                 on a large scale,
where ignition is caused by the admission                        of external air
into contact with the wood.                  In   the large way the quantity
of char      afforded     will    depend     more upon the hardness and
compactness        of   the texture        of wood, and the skill of the
workman,         than on the        quantity of carbon it contains.           In
the following tables          I  have simply expressed the existence           of
the alkaline principle, in the various aslies obtained from the
combustion of 1 pound of wood avoirdupoise weight : this
may be of       use to those       who wish to make experiments upon
the formation of pot-am.              It will    also be observed,    that there
are   some      woods that yield            a   much     larger proportion     of
carbon than oak         :  these,    however, are either too scarce or
too valuable to be applied to the manufacturing                      of iron in
this country.

    The    advantages that charcoal possesses, beyond those                 of pit-
  coal, for the manufacturing of crude iron, are derived from
 the purity of its component parts, and the superior quantity
 of unalloyed carbon it affords to the iron. This principle
 is presented to the metal free from the combination of clay,
 lime,    sand,    and sulphur;         with which pit-coal frequently
 abounds..       A   determinate quantity of charcoal by measure,
 will   smelt anil convey principle to three times the quantity
 of iron that can          be done by the fame measure               of pit-coal
 coaks.       Its   greatest    and    most    useful    property,      however,
 seems to be developed           in the refinery fire, and similar bar-
 iron operations;          where it manifests          in the    most      evident
 manner its        superiority     over     pit-coal,    by shortening the
 tedious    processes    of  the forge,     diminishing       the waste,       and
 affording    a  much superior quality of iron for all the pur
 poses   df  subsequent manufacture.

    No sooner      had the consequences         of  the general diminution
us wood, for the          purpose   of making charcoal,           been felt by
individuals,       whole interest it was to support the fabrication
of iron, than their violent prejudices              were laid aside against
the use os pit-coal,         and this mineral combustible substance
was brought forward, and established               as the basis     of   a  profit
able and useful manufacture.
    Pit-coal    has hitherto been better          known,      and     its useful
ness made        more subservient         to the purposes       of life    and   of
manufacture in Britain^ than in any other country.                            This
valuable fuel is generally found in strata of various dimen
sions,    and of various inclinations            from the parallel of the
horizon.        It is also found, though seldom, in vertical masses
irregularly      diffused,    and    less   extensive     than    the former.
Regular strata widely extended are found from                   2 to   lo  feet  in
thickness: those most commonly met with are sronij to6 feet*.
   * There is   at Dysart  in Fifedire a regular    stratum of coal upwards of
14 feet  thick, and  is the thickest ever heard   of in this country.

   The pit-coal in Scotland may be arranged under the fol
lowing classes, of each of which there are many varieties :
splint coal, free coal, and bituminous coal.                  To   the former
a just preference        has always been given,             for the superior
effects it produces       in  the blast-furnace.        Free coal seems to
partake of the nature of the splint and the bituminous coal,
and is frequently found interspersed with small layers of splint.
It   ought therefore to be considered             as  the medium state of
the mineral.        Under bituminous         coal may be arranged the
lighter varieties, known by the names of candle-coal, parrot-
coal, &c.        These hitherto have been deemed unfit for the
manufacturing of crude iron in any profitable sliape.                   .
    As in this place I mean only to convey a just idea                   of the
materials used in the smelting process,              I /shall not enter into
a  comparative view of the relative effects which the various
qualities of coal produce,             when     used   in the smelting or
casting-furnaCe      ;  but Confine my description to that quality
which      can be      used    for manufacturing         crude   iron to ad
vantage.       Of   this kind there are two varieties;                the pure
splint and a mixture of splint and             free coal, generally com
posed of alternate strata of each.              Both these       possess   their
advantages       derived     from    local construction        ;  the former
being the most         preferable, where      a  superiority of mechanic
 power affords       the furnace        a heavy and unremitted            supply
of air.     The latter will      be found to possess equal advantages,
where a deficiency of power in the air machine conveys to
the furnace but a sparing column of blast.                    The purer and
the more approaching to splint is the coal, the more capable
will it   be of supporting unshaken a current of highly com
pressed aif, and of conveying the carbonaceous principle to
the iron ; which stamps its utility and value.                   On the con
trary, the softer and        less  connected the coal, the        less  capable
is  it of  resisting the force      of the blast,     and    of supporting a
certain proportion of ore           till such time    as   the metal which
it contains imbibes            the  coally principle,      so essential to    its
                                       C  a                             existing

jo                       On the Materials used
existing    as melting pig-iron    ;  and which is always effected
previous to separation— of course before the mixtures ought
to come in contact with the blast.
     To  these general data, the following quality       of coal found
in different    places  in England and Wales claims exception.
This coal is composed of a very small proportion of bitumen,
and contains more carbon than any                 of the Scotch coals
hitherto discovered.        To the purity of the splint-coal it unites
all the softness       and combustibility of wood. The effects
produced by it in the blast-furnace,           either as to quantity or
quality of cast-iron, far       exceed    any thing in the history      of
 the manufacture of that metal with charcoal.                At    present
 there is one furnace      in Wales that yields 60 tons of pig-iron
 npon an average weekly.
     In preparing pit-coal for the blast-furnace, well under
 stood    among manufacturers by the term coaking,               flat sur
 faces are appropriated.        These are firmly beat and puddled
 over with clay,     so  as  to  pass  the necessary cartage without
 furrowing or loosening the earth. These spaces form squares,
 more or less oblong, and are called hearths ; upon which the
  pieces   of coal  are regularly placed      inclining  to each other.
  Great care is taken to place each piece upon the ground
  layer on its acutest angle, in order that the least surface pos
  sible may come in contact with the gronnd.              By this means
  large interstice?    arc preserved for the admission      and    regular
   communication of the air necessary to excite and effect com
   plete  ignition.
      The quantity of     coaks rharred in      one heap or hearth, is
  various at different, and even at the fame works.                  Forty
   tons of coals is amongst the smallest sires, and some hearths
   again will admit of 80 or 100 tons.           The length of     the fire

   and   heights are also subject       to no determinate      ltandard    j
   but are from 30 to 50 inches           high,   and from 9 to 16 feet
   broad/.   1« building each sire, they reserve a number of vents
                                                                  reaching

reaching from top to bottom,                 into which the burning fuel
is introduced.          This   is immediately covered by small pieces
of coal     beat hard into the aperture             :  these repress the        kin
dling    fire from ascending, and oblige it to seek a passage                     by
creeping along the bottom, which is most exposed to air.                          In
this progress the fire of each vent meets, and, when united,
rife gradually, and burst forth on all sides at once.
    If the coal contains pyrites, the combustion is allowed ta
continue       a Considerable     time after the disappearance of smoke;
the sulphur then becomes disengaged,                    and part    of.it is found
in flowers upon the          surface   of the     heap.      If  the coal is free
from this hurtful           mixture,     the fire is covered up in a short
time after the smoke              disappears; beginning            at the foun
dation, and proceeding gradually to the top.
    The length of time             necessary to produce good coaks de
pends upon the nature of the coal to be coaked, and the state
of the weather.            In 50, 60    to 70 hours the sire is generally
completely         covered     over   with    the    ashes    of char formerly
made    :    the coaks, thus entirely secluded from air, soon cool,
and in 12 or 14 days may be drawn                         and wheeled to the
 furnace.
    It is  with pit-coal, in a great measure, as with wood, in
 the  process of charring. Coals do not always afford a weight
of  coaks in proportion to the quantity                  of carbon in    the coal.
 It depends       more upon the capability of the coal to                 resist the
waste occasioned           by combustion, supported              by external air,
 than upon the real quantity of carbon inherent in the coal ;
 as  may be      seen   by comparing the loss of weight which coals
 undergo in the large way, and the results obtained from the
 fame     coals, by burning them unexposed                    to  external air in
 the small way.
    The     loss   sustained in      coaking coals fit for the purpose of
 manufacturing,          or melting iron, is found to be nearly as
 follows     :

      This    great weight thus lost is chiefly carried off in smoke.
 If   a vessel is placed, filled with cold water, in the midst of one
 of    these massy columns                of vapour,     before the sire has pene
 trated to the surface               of   the heap, a considerable               quantity of
 tar will      condense upon its external surface                       :   this will con
 tinue to increase till such time as the water assumes the tem
 perature of the smoke.                       At many iron works from 300 to
  rooo tons of         coals are thus weekly reduced                    to cinder.       What
 a   prodigious quantity of bituminous vapour, surcharged                                  with
 tar ammoniac and oil, must for the present be lost ! !

      These experiments were performed on coals found imme

    The substitution of pit-coal in                the blast-furnace,             in  place
cf    the charcoal       of wood,     first introduced to general use those
numerous          strata   of argillaceous iron              ores      found stratified
along with the other secondary formations of our globe. The
intimate connection which nature had imposed upon these
two mineral substances, by the plentiful formation of them,
almost always          within convenient reach of                     each     other, has
been       successfully    traced     and    beneficially developed                in their
mutual application to the manufacturing of cast-iron.
    Had nature not formed this immense store of iron so con
genial to the         use  of pit-coal combined in its present form,
 the application of cast-iron to the various branches of ma
 chinery, and to the vast variety of useful and ornamental cast
ings constructed           for the conveniences and elegancies, had
been       greatly retarded,       if not hitherto altogether kept back.
 At     present     it is by many believed— nor has any attempt in
 the large way ever contradicted it — that primary ores                             of iron,
 such as the Cumberland                 and Lancastiire ores,               are incapable
 of affording cast-iron sufficiently carbonated, when                               smelted
 alone with pit-coal coaks, to be re-melted to advantage                              in  the
 manufacturing of castings *.                  Certain it is that a larger por-
    *   I have not heard of any attempt to produce carbonated cast-iron from
these ores in the large way.        The    universal    diffusion of iron-stones renders
this superfluous;       especially as the use of Cumberland             aud   Lancashire   ore
can    only extend to the neighbourhood,           or at most        can   only be used     by
strangers whose works: are within the reach of water-carriage.                     Their   ad
vantage therefore would only be            local, and their utility restricted by the
expence or carriage, of freight, or of both.            As to     the quality   of iron they
contain,     I have not   a scruple   in asserting, that       it can be called into ex
istence by     means of the assay-furnace sufficiently           carbonated,     even  to ex
cess, for any purpose.         From   these   ores  I  have obtained reguli         of super-
carbonated crude iron covered with numerous                 specks of plumbago.           The
fame results being obtained from iron-stones             in the fame manner, though
with     a different application  of solvents,am I not        at liberty     to deduce, that
similar effects could be produced         in the large way, by varying             the treat
ment and proportion         of materials;      Vide Assaying          of Primary Ores by

    Those iron-stones with which Britain              so  much abounds,          ¦
and which are now universally used for the production                         of
cast-iron with pit-coal,        are commonly         sound     in horizontal
strata, subject to the same acclivity and declivity          with the other
stratified    substances     under the       surface;    their inclination
from     the   horizon varying according to the nature of the
ground, and the disposition        of the imbedding         and incumbent
strata.    Such variety is exhibited, that strata of iron-stone are
found descending        I  yard in 24,     I  in 12,   1  in 8, and some
 times   1  in 4.    Let    AB    (Plate   I. Fig. 7.)     represent    a  line
drawn parallel to the horizon, and               CD   a stratum      of iron
 stone.     Suppose the horizontal       line continued for 24 yards           :
 at that distance      the iron-stone will be found to have de
 scended one yard       of perpendicular      measure,     at the termina
 tion of the lines    AB, AD;         and   if  the fame line is supposed
 to measure 4 or 8 yards, it        will represent those strata that are
 arranged at     a  more disadvantageous         declivity.      From this it
 is obvious, that where the acclivity or declivity of the metals
 is small, the most extensive and regular fields of iron-stone
 are to be found, and vice versa where the metals lay more
 on edge.
     Iron-stones are generally found imbedded in schistous clay
 more or less compact, but which moulders away when ex
 posed to air.     They    assume two different forms         :  regular con
 nected    strata called bands, and strata       of detached      stone found
 in distinct   masses, from the size      of   the smallest bullet to the
 weight of     several hundred pounds.            Those of the small and
 middling     sizes,  and which generally wear a flat ovular form,
  are called ball-stones :      those   of   greater weights arc       bv the
 workmen denominated lunkers.
     Both these species of iron-stone frequently accompany coal
 and limestone.        In the former cafe they are commonly in
 cumbent,       and found almost      in immediate contact with              the
                                                                          coal :

coal    :  little extra labour is therefore requisite to bring down
the stone ; and the double purpose of obtaining both mate
rials is thus advantageously            answered.
    When ironstone in bands accompanies limestone: it is
most commonly             of an inferior quality.        Its component parts
are chiefly calcareous, and the quantity of iron it contains is
small. Ball ironstones found near to lime are of a much su
perior quality,          and for the most part contain a considerable
proportion of iron.
     Thus      stratified  in the vicinity of lime, many ironstones           are
found with various impressions               of marine remains        ; and   not
 unfrequently compact and entire shells, univalve and bivalve,
 are found in the heart of the band.                 It is however still more
 difficult      to conceive how shells could be deposited,                distant
 from lime, imbedded in ironstone, incumbent on coal, at the
 great     depth of 80 yards          from the surface.          In our neigh
 bourhood, at this depth,             a small   band of ironstone is found
 completely covered and interspersed with distinct muscles of
 an ordinary size..
     Among the great variety of rich              ironstones     found in    Lan-
 casture, the Rottenburn            stone challenges particular attention,
  for the beautiful specimens            it affords   of  vegetable    decompo
  sition and impression.            This   stone consists    of  a band and an
 accompanying             ball.   The former abounds with             sine speci
  mens of the ramification of trees, ssirubs,               See.  In the   process
  of decay,       and the substitution     of mineral in     place   of vegetable
  substance, the more ligneous parts and the bark are distinctly
  preserved from          thi heart of   the shoot.     The former      are found
  of  a   proper thickness,        consisting    of pure calcareous earth,
  encircling        the   central parts, which commonly have been
  displaced       and occupied by the same compound                as the  general
  mass.        As   the external parts       of the   vegetable    seem to have
   been laterally formed, it is presumed that they have withstood
   the decomposition            of the   softer  parts, and have only been
   displaced       afterwards by      a filter which has contained calca
   reous      earth in solution.          This iron-stone contains 371b.

    The  stratum    of   detached      stone is externally marked         with
vegetable impressions,      from the size of trees to small branches.
The exterior     appearance      of this    stone greatly resembles wood
dug from     a morass    or bog, with knobs or excrescences of va
rious sizes.    These stumps arc from 9 to 18 inches long, and
are oval or round of various diameters : they split length
ways like    a piece   of wood,      and their internal surfaces exhibit
the most perfect traces of their original formation.                   In molt
 of them   the fibres, as    in wood,      are seen running lengthways,

 and  a piece   of  the filament        still in   a vegetable    state.   The
 fame piece    of stone afforded a confused            coagulation of mine
 ral and vegetable        substances.        In   the assay this ball-ston?
 viclded me 405 percent, of iron.
    Another variety of iron-stone, which we have in this coun
 try, and which will be deemed no               less   curious by the mine
 ralogist, affords maltha, bitumen, mineral pitch, &c.                     This
 combustible is found in the heart               of  large flat rounded balls
 of iron-stone, occupying          a  number of interstices, and resem
 bling  a cement for the frittered pieces of stone.                 It is com
 monly found attached to pure calcareous spar, which has al
 so found its way into these vacuities.                I observed that where
 the spar was thickest, the bitumen was proportionally thin:
  in some places it totally disappeared,            and the chasm       became
 entirely silled with spar      :   this led me to conjecture, that the
 destruction of the bitumen             was effected by the filter which
  had deposited    tlic lime it held in solution            ;  and   that even
 at the time the stone was dug, nature was employed                      in this
  progressive   and tedious     operation.       I  have found some piece*
  of plant along with the bitumen, which resemble that from
 which soda is made ; those, though preserved in shape, were
  equally inflammable with the pitch.                  The distillation of 437
  grains afforded mC a        rough light charcoal, which weighed
                                                                            only

only   49 grains ; this, when exposed to sire in contact                 with
air, burnt without a residue        ;  hence   I  conclude it to be pure
carbon. This iron-stone in the assay-furnace              yields 36 pounds
of iron in 100.
   All  these strata  of iron-stone      bear   the most evident marks
of the agency of water. It is not so difficult to conceive
how regular strata of iron-stone should be formed by the de
position of water     :  but how such huge masses, broken off,
detached,    rounded and impressed with various external shapes,
abounding with the forms of substances                  formerly foreign,
now transposed, and forming part             of the    same mass ; regu
larly deposited in strata, sometimes incumbent,                  sometimes
decumbent to lime, coal, and              their own species,      is a work
of  real admiration ; in attempting to solve           which, conjecture
must    supply the place      of certainty,      and analogy must serve
in place   of strict demonstration.
   The manner       and   disposition     of the Rottenburn       ball iron
stone resembles more an          irregular diffusion of wood, felled
into lengths,     and afterwards changed to            stone  ;  than a re
gular stratification, deposited        by the decomposition of wa
ter, or the escape of an acid.
   The phenomena attending water depositing matter in solu
tion, and of transforming the nature of vegetables, wood, &c.
I have   frequently and satisfactorily observed.           Within the      last
four months     I haveobtained      strata  of an  inch thick, whose      sur
face, exposed to the action        of   the water, displayed       an entire
covering of calcareous crystals           of  an ice colour, so small as
not to be distingtiislied by the naked eye.                The fracture of
 such a thickness presents from 12 to 15 various-coloured
strata successively deposited ;       chiefly lime, with       a small por
tion of fine silex and magnesian earth.              By  exposing   it a few
days to dryness,     it acquires consistency and firmness             almost
equal to limestone.         Heat     is requisite   to disengage     this   se
diment.      Its affinity in this     cafe is greatest to wood,        less to
iron, and least of all to lead.          Pieces of wood boiled in this
water become softened        :  the liquid penetrates to the heart of
                                                                            the

  the piece, opens the pores           of the wood, and admits the par
  ticles of matter.        By this accumulation of weight the wood
  finks, and in 15 to 18 days a soft slime is formed over all its
  surface ; this gradually hardens into a crust, and diffuses it
 self inwards      :  during the progress of formation                 the (limy
 matter which is next to the wood receives the impression                        of
 the fibres, and communicates              their form to the mass.         Hence
 impressions       are conveyed        to stones,      which     are afterwards
 formed when in         a  compact state.
     I am afraid it will be thought that                  I  have exceeded the
 limits   I  proposed     to myself;      but the few particulars          I have
 related concerning the deposition               of matter from water may
 tend to explain some part            of  the    phenomena attending the
 formation of        some iron-stones.           I   shall probably on a fu
 ture occasion        give    some     further     observations concerning
 the effects of this water, and the progress it makes in substi
 tuting one species of matter in the room of another, and iu
 the formation       of strata.
                            Working of Iron-fane.
     When iron-stone         is found near the surface,           it is only  ne
 cessary to unbare the soil and the super-incumbent                       earths   :
 the stone then presents            itself like    a  pavement more or less
inclined,       and is easily raised by the application of wedges,
bars, &c. &c.         But   as  all secondary strata descend, according
to the declivity imposed upon them by nature in their forma
tion,    it  is obvious that, in proportion             as the excavation ex
tends     at right     angles   to the      line of level, the stone be
comes       gradually     buried under an accumulating                  depth of
earth, till such time as the expence                     of throwing this off
exceeds       either the value of the stone,                or the expence       at
which it could        be procured by a different mode              of operation.
It therefore becomes             necessary      to    make perforations        by
means of horizontal galleries, extended                     under the soil,      so
as to   fall in with the declivity of the strata             : these catch the
inclining      stone for a stretch      of ico      to 240 yards, according
to the existent circumstances of the mine.
                                                                            These

                   for ManufaSur'mg             Cast trail*              &q
    These galleries are       in Scotland called the barrow roads.
Whenever       the miner        has arrived at the extremity of his
working, he turns round, and commences an excavation on
his right and left hand, proportioned to the rife and dip of
the stone, to the extent of several yards on each 5 the ac
companying       (hist    and rubbish        are   packed   into   the va
cuity behind him        :  should  there remain any superfluity un
packed, it is wheeled to the mouth of the gallery along with
the iron-stone.        In this manner the miner returns,                and
brings along with him the whole iron-stone contained in
100 to 240 yards       in length,    and    in  20 to 30 yards    in width.
The height of        the gallery is commonly so small, that the
miner is obliged to perform his work upon his side : the
wheelers are likewise obliged to push the barrow on all fours.
This   species  of working is        called under cover ; and the at
tainment    of   a  band of good         iron-stone,    though only four
inches thick, will sufficiently defray the expence of the ope
ration. It is here also obvious, that this operation can only
be carried a certain length            in   the   fame   gallery, till such
time   as the expence of wheeling out the stone must exceed
the value of that share of labour generally appropriated to it.
A    more economical method is therefore indispensibly requi
 site.   This is effected by sinking a pit 160 to 200 yards far
ther on the fame line of level.                When the iron-stone is
found, the miner          sets off another gallery, or barrow road,
towards his former working, and continues till he meets the
termination of his old waste : as formerly, -he now begins hi*
retreat, and carries with him a similar portion of iron-stone
 from each side of the gallery.           The quantity of iron-stone     by-
 weight obtained from such a working, depends entirely upon
 its extent and the thickness of the band. A square yard of
 iron-stone containing 9 cubical feet, as it lays stratified, will
 weigh from 1850 to 1900 pounds weight.                     The other fide
 of the pit is next perforated,          and the    fame operation com
 pleted.    When      the iron-stone is thus exhausted,          another pit
 funk at a similar distance         from the termination         of the  se
                                                                       cond

  cond gallery in the first, opens up a new field of supply.- In
 this manner iron-stone is continued to be raised, till such
  time   as the f   eld is totally exhausted.
     These extensive excavations commonly collect a consider
 able quantity       of water, which would       soon impede the pro
 gress   of the workmen        : various means have been contrived
 to remove      this consequent      obstruction.    These have chieflv
 consisted in running a counter gallery as far to the declivity
 of the metals as possible, and of passing the water into it by
 means of filtration,        or communications       betwixt gallery and
 gallery.     Where      a sufficient quantity   of running water    pre
 sents itself,    water-wheels have been applied, to extract the
 water from one general reservoir by means of pumps.
     Strata of iron-stone are from          i an inch to 12 inches in
 thickness. Those of 3, 4, 5 and 6 inches are most com
 monly      met with ;      they    are  also   reckoned to contain      a
quantity and quality        of iron superior     to larger bands.    Ball
 and    lunker     iron-stone,    however large, contain always a
 superior    quantity of iron, and are easier reduced m the
blast-furnace.

    From the Transactions of the Society for the Encourage

 iVlANY years            ago having observed some seeds which had
got accidentally amongst raisins, and that they were such as
are generally attended with difficulty to raise in
                                                                England
after coming in the usual -way from abroad, I sowed them in
pots,   within    a framing;     and as all    of them grew, I com
missioned     my sons, who were then abroad, to pack up all
sorts   of  seeds    they could procure in absorbent paper, and
send some       of them surrounded         by  raisins, and   others by
                                                                  brown

brown moist sugar ; concluding                     that the former        seeds    had
been             by a peculiarly favourable Jlate of moifture
            preserved
thus afforded to them.   It occurred, likewise, that as many
of our common               feeds, such as clover, charlock,             &c. would
lie dormant for ages within the                      earth, well preserved            for
vegetation whenever they might happen to be thrown to the
surface, and exposed to the atmosphere,                  so these   foreign       seeds
might        be equally preserved,          for   many months at    leaf, by the
kindly covering             and       genial moisture that either raisins or
sugar afforded them               :   and this conjecture was really fulfilled,
as not one       in twenty of them failed             to vegetate ; when those
ofthe fame kinds, that I ordered to be sent lapped in common
parcels, and forwarded with them, would not grow at all;
I observed, upon examining them all before they were com
mitted to the earth, that there was a prevailing dryness in
the latter, and that the former looked fresh and healthy, and
were not        in   the least inserted by insects,       as was the cafe with
the others.           It    has been tried repeatedly      to convey seeds (ot
many plants difficult to raise) closed up in bottles, but with*
out success ; some greater proportion of air, as well as a pro
per       of moisture, perhaps, being necessary.
       state                                          I should
also observe, for the satisfaction of the Society, that no dif
ference was made in the package of the seeds, respecting
their being kept in husks, pods, &c. so as to give those in
Sra'tjins    ox sugar any advantage over the others, all being sent
equally guarded by their natural teguments.                         Whether any
experiments of this nature have been made by others,                              I   am
totally ignorant;             but     I think   that, should this mode of con
veyance be pursued still more satisfactorily than                    I   have done,
Very considerable             advantages        might result from   it.

    Vegetable      Matter     into    Manure.          By   Mr. Brown              of
   Derby.        From the Transactions              of the Society for the
   Encouragement of Arts, &c.                    Vol.   XVI.
I BEG          leave   to    communicate          to   the Society,        and,     if
thought worth notice, by them to the world, a composition
for manure.         Fearful it would not answer the purpose so
fully  as  I  could wisti,      I deferred     it from    year to year ; but         I
now find, both by numerous trials made by my friends, as
well as myself, the very great utility of the composition, as
well   as its cheapness,        with   the capability       of its being made
in   any situation and in any quantity.                 The mode of making
it  is as simple as,     I  trust,   it will be found productive.               It  is
 nothing more than green vegetable                   matter,     decomposed        by
 quick or fresti-burnt lime.            A layer of the vegetable matter
 about a foot thick, then a very thin layer of lime, beat small,
 and so on ; first vegetable, then lime, alternately.                      After it
 has been put together a few hours,                   the decomposition will
 begin to take place       ;   and    unless    prevented,      either by a few
 sods, or a forkfull      of the   vegetables at hand,         it will break out
 into  a  blaze, which must at all events be prevented.                            In
 about twenty-four hours the process will be complete, when
 you will have       a  quantity of       asties   ready to lay on your land
 at any time you wish.             Any     and all sorts      of   vegetables,       if
 used green,      will  answer the purpose          ;  say weeds    of   every de
 scription.       They will doubly         serve the farmer,         as   they will
 not only be got at        a small     expence,       but will in time render
  his farm more        valuable, by being deprived               of  all   noisome
  weeds.
     But   if   this composition answers the purpose,                   as  I flatter
  myself it will,     a  very short time         will   see almost    everv weed
  destroyed,     which supposing to be the case,               I  have made my
  calculations with clover, grown for the purpose;                   for instance,
  J will  take    one   acre     of clover, which         at one cutting         will
                                                                           produce

                   Hints for a    Theory  of the Earth.                  33
produce from fourteen to eighteen tons of green vegetable
matter, and about. three tons of lime: this, when decomposed
by    the above process,     will yield ashes sufficient to manure
four acres, the value     of which I estimate at something under
four pounds; the clover, according to the value of land here,
I   will fay two pounds, which, take the average of the king
dom, is too much.         The lime I will also fay two pounds;
but that will vary, according to the distance it is to be
fetched; Take them together, I think will be about the
average value.       Now    if this is the cafe, and    as  far as  I  have
been able to try it     I find so, how valuable must it be to the
community in general         ! If it answers the purpose,      I shall  feel
myself much obliged by the Society making it as public                    as
 they possibly can:
    The   vegetables should be used as soon after            they are cut
as possible, and lime as fressi from        the   kiln  as the distance
will allow of;     as  on those two circumstances depends               the
 goodness    of the composition.

 those that must be studied to found on observation              the basis

him often forget others:              sometimes       he is discouraged        by
bad weather,       or becomes        absent     through fatigue ; and the
neglect produced by all these causes gives rife to deep regret,
and even frequently oblige him to turn back ; whereas if he
has a collection of memorandums on which he can from time
to time cast his eye, he will be reminded of all those objects
which ought to engage his attention. This collection, con
fined at first,   will  be extended         and   improved in proportion
as he acquires ideas,          and may furnish hints              to travellers
who, without being         versed in geology, with to collect,             in the
countries they visit, observations that may be useful to those
who    study that science      *.
   Agreeably to these principles              I have    always prepared        for
all my journeys      a list  of   those objects, for examining            which
that journey was intended.              I  propose here, however,        a  more
extensive plan.       I wish to direct the         traveller, and even the
sedentary philosopher,         in all the researches which ought to
engage their attention,         if   they are desirous       of contributing
towards the progress          of   a   theory of our globe.            I do not
flatter myself that      I  shall be able to give a complete view               of
every thing      that remains to be done             :  what   I  offer  will  be
only an imperfect sketch, but this sketch                    will   be at least
useful   till some one produce a better.               Several   of  the obser
vations and questions which              I  here propose     as problematic,
seem    indeed to have been already             resolved ; but as most        so
lutions of this kind are founded merely on analog}-, the con
trary of which is always physically possible,                it is proper,      in
my opinion,       to keep the eyes         of naturalists always open to
the grand facts     which may be interesting to a theory so dif
ficult and of    so much importance.

    7. Whether these causes are sufficient to explain certain
changes, such as that of the plants and animals of warmer
countries having been able           to  exist   and multiply      in  the
coldest   countries    ?
    8. Mineralogy,       the nature  of  earths,   stones,  salts,   bitu

   9. If it be possible to transrhute one earth or one metal
into another.       For example, if it be possible that siliceous
earth can be changed into calcareous earth in the bodies of
marine animals;          or, reciprocally,   that calcareous can be
changed into siliceous earth in mountains of chalk             ?
    10.  If  it  be   probable,    according   to   the   conjecture of
Lavoisier,    that earths are the oxyds of metals       ?
    11.  What     idea   can we form of one or more solvents
which, either simultaneously or         successively,   may have ren
dered soluble in water the different mineral substances which
we   fee on the surface and in the bowels of the earth           ?
    12. Can we believe         that these solvents     may have been
afterwards destroyed       ; and that it is in consequence       of their
destruction that the matters they held in solution were pre
cipitated and became crystallised       ?
   12.   A. Or, can      we believe,  with Dolomieu, that all crys
tallisations may take place without previous solution;                and
that it is sufficient for this operation that the bodies be re
duced to their elementary parts, and that these parts be sus
pended    in  a fluid  which   gives them liberty to unite by their
corresponding faces       ?
   13. Can we       suppose that the electric and magnetic fluids
enter, as elements, into the composition of bodies           ?
                                                              14. Doe9

       14. Does      it  appear probable that the         nitric, muriatic, and
   boracic acids,        as well   as the three     alkalies, are of new forr
   mation; while the sulphuric, phosphoric, carbonic, tungstic,
  molibdic,      and arsenic        acids    existed before the formation      of
  animals *     ?
      15.  If  we believe that the mineral alkali or soda was of
  ancient formation,           may we not suppose that the ancient
  ocean held this alkali          in solution     ? That would explain how
  it might      have      dissolved    siliceous    earth  and   argil without
  being    able     to    nourish     animals.        Afterwards,    when    the
 marine acid was formed, or had issued from some cavity, the
  sea  might    have become proper for animals, and improper for
  the solution of siliceous earth and argil.
      16. Is it probable that in the first ages of the existence of
  our globe its atmosphere was higher than at present; that
 its lower strata were thus of             a much greater density, and sus-
 ceptible of receiving from the fun a greater heat ?
      17. May we presume that the waters of the ancient ocean,
 before the formation           of the primitive mountains, had          a heat
 superior to that         of boiling water       ?
      18.  What temperature may                we suppose at present to exist
  at  the centre of the earth ?
      19. Is it possible that the quartzy earth found in petrified
 vegetables and animals has proceeded from the substance of
 these bodies       ?

 however, be acquired from the traditions which history has

 retiring  of the    waters ; and by coming to periods less remote

water of the       sea ;  and what may be the cause         of it ?
    7.  If  it  be probable that large caverns have been opened
 in the bowels of        the earth, and that these caverns        swallowed
 up  a  part  of the     waters  ?
    8.  Do there       exist  any historical monuments which prove
 that the countries at present cold were formerly               so  warm as
 to favour the multiplication             of plants  and animals      which
 are no longer found but in the torrid zone             ?

such as excavations, rings for making fast vessels; in a word,
to endeavour               to ascertain     whether the       sea has   the fame level
as    it    had    in the      remotest ages.
      3.     In   cafe the level has chahged, to examine whether that
effect        has been          produced by       a   change in the      sea itself,    or
whether the shore rather has not been raised or depressed.

acclivity is insensible ; and to examine the nature of the sand
found on the shore.

crystallised or not, quartzy or calcareous, or of any other
kind of           stone.
      6. To endeavour              to discover its origin,       whether it can be
considered   produced by detrition from the neighbouring
                    as
mountains or hills; whether it may not have proceeded from
some river which had                     its mouth     in the neighbourhood,            or
whether it may not have been brought from the bottom of
the sea itself by the tide and the waves ?
      7.    Whether this          sand contains, like that         of Rimini, mi
croscopic shells of the order of those called                      pelagian ?
      8.    Whether           there    are not shells on the borders            of     the
fca   ;    and,     if   there    are,    to   determine those      by which that
coast seems to be characterised.
  9. Whether there are any rolled pebbles ?
   10. To examine, as in No. 2, chiefly on the shore, and
even pretty far up the country, whether there are any proofs
that the sea gains on the land, or the latter on the sea ; and,
in    case    the   sea seems to recede,          to discover whether that may
not be occasioned by the land rising by accumulations washed
down from the higher grounds ; by subterranean                             causes,      or
reciprocally.
      11.    If    a progressive         displacing of the ocean really exists,
by what           observations        can the systems,    which     tend to explain
it,   be verified        ?    Some have employed, for that purpose,                    the
currents produced                by   the trade winds    ;    others, the shock of

    InfpeBor of Mines and Member of the French National In
   stitute.       From Journal des Mines, No.                 XXXVIII.
I   RON       and manganese
the only metals
                                    have long been considered                as almost
                         employed by nature to colour minerals ;
but though these metals may assume                      a  multitude of different
shades       according to the proportions of oxygen which they
contain, we however often fee in nature bodies possessed of
colours which neither iron nor manganese ever formed arti
ficially or naturally when pure, and it is probable that we
shall one day find many other colouring                          metals and also
stones and earths.
     I  have already announced that the colour                     of the emerald,
which all chemists           ascribed to       iron, is owing to the oxyd of
chrome.          In examining the peculiar red colour of the spinel
ruby with the results of the analysis lately made of it by
Professor      Klaproth,     I  began to doubt of that rich and beau
tiful colour        being produced by the oxyd of iron, of which
the Professor found only 1*5 in 100 \. My doubts in this
respect were still increased by reading in Bergmann that the
 ruby fused with borax communicates                       to  it a beautiful green
   * iz.   To   observe whether there are not daily formed different            kinds of
stones   in the places which   are washed by the waters         of the  sea.    C.
   f   The   number, nature and proportion        of the principles    found by Klap
roth in the spinel ruby are     stated  as  follows  :  Alumine     76 ; siliceous earth

colour, as well as by              a passage       of Klaproth, in which               he fays,
that magnesia             extracted    from that precious stone, being dis
solvedin the sulphuric acid,                     had given to           it   a green colour.
The rubies of different colours                   preserved in collections, such as
the sapphire-blue in the              possession            of   the   Hon. Mr. Greville,
the green belonging to                Mr. Hawkins,                  and the white        in the
collection of Mr. Macie of London, authorised me                                      to suspect
that iron is not the colouring principle of that stone.
  These different considerations induced me to make a new
analysis      of the      spinel    ruby    :    and the result of this labour
will   prove,        that my doubts were                     not without           foundation,
and that it not only does not contain                             a single    particle of the
oxyd of iron, but that there is even no siliceous earth in                                 it,   as
announced            by   Klaproth. The rubies employed for this                           ana
lysis were crystallised, transparent, and free from any foreign
mixture.
  Exp.        I.    A   hundred parts of this stone being exposed to                             a
violent heat, lost nothing              of their weight, but their tint                      was
weakened           and changed to       a       rose    colour.
     II. A     hundred parts of the fame stone reduced to                                a   fine
powder, and strongly heated in                     a    charcoal crucible, were ag
glutinated into one mass of                a     greenish         grey colour.
     III. A        hundred parts of the small fragments of rubies re
duced to an impalpable powder                          in   a    mortar of silex, were in
creased five parts.
     IV.
       I      heated for an hour, inasilvercrucible,                         ioopartsof   a   ru
by thus pulverised, with 300 parts of caustic potasti                          :   the mixture
was not fused on the contrary
                    ;              was reduced toit                            a   pulverulent
mass     of   a    green colour, of which some particles were merely
agglutinated.           I    mixed this with distilled water, in which                           it
was all       so   nearly dissolved that there remained of                      it    only some
particles which weighed scarcely three parts.   poured upon                  I
the solution, which remained still mixed with the undissolved
matter above-mentioned, some diluted muriatic acid. The
first portions of this acid made the solution assume the ap»
pearance       of   a   mass as thick as soup                (bouillie), which was            re-,
                                                                                . •   dissolved,

                                                                                                 43
dissolved, at least for the greater part, by additional quantities
of the acid.              I    warmed the solution by                   a   gentle heat, and
having filtered               it,   there remained on the paper three parts                        of
a   rose-coloured powder, which was ruby,                                   not decomposed.
This I      placed        apart, that         I    might operate only on that por
tion which           had been attacked.
     V. The          muriatic           solution above mentioned having been
evaporated           to dryness           by   a   gentle heat,       I     poured        upon the
residuum        a    large quantity of distilled water                          :    almost the
whole      of   it   was dissolved.              There remained only five parts of
a   grey powder, which melted with borax, to which                                         it   com
municated         a   green colour.
     VI. I      subjected            these five parts           to different tests,            which
shewed, that they were siliceous earth mixed                                 with    a    little alu*
mine, and coloured by                     a   matter, of which          I    shall speak here
after*.
     VII.  I     precipitated the muriatic solution of Exp.                                V. with
tarbonat of ammonia.                          When      I     judged that      I     had added      a
sufficient quantity,                I   boiled the mixture for                a   quarter of an
hour, in order to expel the carbonic acid, and favour the pre
cipitation of the lime or magnesia,                           if   there were any of these
in it.       By      these means         I     obtained an abundant white preci
pitate, which         I        boiled with         a   solution of caustic potash.               The
greater part of this precipitate was dissolved.                               There remained
only iOy parts of                   a   brown      substance        inclining       to violet, but
which turned to                     a   yellowish -green colour,                by   drying in        a
gentle heat.
    * In    another analysis of the ruby             I   had for residuum,          after the evapo
ration of the muriatic solution,                but fire parts and      a   half of siliceous earth,
slightly coloured green, and without any mixture of alumine.                                This dif
ference arises from the degree of heat given to the matter towards the end
of   the evaporation,               or from    the saline mass        not being      equally    stirred
throughout.          In   the latter cafe       it   happens that there are parts which dry
too much, and others which do not dry sufficiently.                          Hence   it   happens that
moleculæ of alumine                  are abandoned       by   the acid, while moleculæ of silex
remain combined           ;    and this was the cafe          in   my first analysis.
                                                                                     VIII.      These

           VIII.     These 10^ part? were dissolved by the sulphuric
       acid.      The solution had a greenish colour. This solution
       mixed with the saturated carbonat of potash, precipitated a
       greenish matter, which, when washed and dried, weighed
      two parts.         A   small portion       of this precipitate melted with
      borax communicated to it              a beautiful emerald green colour              *,
      This matter, which            I placed apart,      I shall speak of hereafter.
           IX. As      I had    dissolved   in  the   sulphuric acid 10-5 of mat
      ter, and as the carbonat of potash precipitated only 2, there
      must have remained 8-5 in the solution.                      Suspecting there
     fore that the matter was retained                there   by an excess         of the
      carbonic acid,         I boiled    the liquor for some minutes,                and   I
      obtained a white granulated precipitate, weighing 16 parts,
      which by calcination were reduced to 8. This matter, com-
,    bined with the sulphuric acid, gave a salt crystallised                        in te-
     traedral prisms, terminated by pyramids with four faces, the
     taste of which was first sweet, and afterwards bitter ; which
    was not precipitated by the saturated carbonat os potash \
     was only partly so by ammonia j and, in a word, which
    presented         all    the    characters       of fulphat        of    magnesia.
    The ruby therefore, according to this experiment, should
    contain 8 parts of magnesia in 100; but as                     \ part was want
    ing in that subjected             to   experiment, we may estimate the
    quantity at 8*5.
       *In   heating the colouring matter of the ruby with borax over charcoal,
   and stopping       the operation    before the effervescence had ceased,          I have
   twice obtained a vitreous globule 6f a red colour, perfectly            similar to that
  •f    the ruby ; but in heating again this        red globule, the effervescence was       ,
   renewed,       and the globule became of an         emerald green colour.       In  vain
   did    1 afterwards    try to make the red colour re-appear,      whether     I applied
  the exterior or the interior flame        of the blow-pipe.     It is even very diffi
  cult to obtain, in the first instance, the vitreous globule of        a red colour.    It
  is necessary     for that purpose that the colouring matter should not touch
  the charcoal ; that it should not be added till the borax is melted; and that
  it should     be heated    with the exterior flame.      Though    I often   attempted
  to produce this phenomenon,          I never   succeeded but twice.
                                                                                    X.   I

                        Analysis      of the Spinel Ruby.                        45
    X.  I  united the five parts of Ex.              VI.   and the two parts     of
Ex.   IX  ; boiled them five or six times successively                  in  a por
celain   vessel   with concentrated nitric acid, evaporating each
time to dryness.         The matter         at first assumed a beautiful dark
green colour, and at the end                 of each operation it boiled and
was puffed up like alum.                  At  last, when the greater part         of
the acid was evaporated,              and the matter began to dry,           it as
sumed     an orange yellow colour.                  After treating    the matter     .
in this manner,         I  mixed with it a little pure caustic potash ;
and when        the mixture was well formed and reduced to a
kind of paste,       I  diluted it with distilled water, in which al
most    the whole        of    the matter was dissolved.            Nothing     re
mained but a little grey matter which weighed about i 't
 parts, and which I found to be siliceous earth. The alka
line solution had        a weak golden yellow colour ; and as it con
tained an excess of alkali, I added, in order that it might be
saturated,    a   few drops       of nitric acid.       By this addition there
was    produced a flight white precipitate, which weighed at
most   one part, and which appeared to me to be alumine.
The liquor      had then a reddish colour.
    XI. As       I  suspected,       from all the phenomena which had
 appeared    during the course of this analysis,               that the colour
 ing matter of         the    ruby was chrome,           I  mixed the liquor of
 the preceding experiment, first, with nitrat of lead,                       and   I
 immediately obtained a precipitate of a beautiful orange-
 yellow colour ; second, with nitrat of mercury, and there
 was produced        a deposit      of  a  cinnabar red colour ; and, third,
 with the nitrat of         silver,   which     gave a precipitate     of a  crim
 son red colour.           I  was convinced by these phenomena that
 the ruby, like the emerald of Peru, contains a certain quan
 tity of chrome, to which it is indebted for its colour.                     But it
 seems difficult at first to reconcile the colour                of  the emerald
 with that of the ruby, by referring them                     to the fame sub
 stance ; for nothing            seems more          remote   from green       than
 red.    If we     however recollect that this metal is susceptible
                                                                                  of

  4,6                   Analyjis of the Spinel Ruijy.
  of  assuming     different colours according to the quantities of
 oxygen which it absorbs ; that when it is saturated with this
 principle, it is red and acid ; and when it contains less, it is
 green, and in the state of an oxyd, we shall readily conceive
 how this oxydated           metal may colour the emerald and the
 ruby.     It follows    then from these considerations, that chrome
 exists   in the emerald in the        state of an oxyd, and in the ruby
 in the    state  of an acid; and that this acid is there, doubtless,
 in   a saline   combination with alumine or magnesia, and per
 haps   with both       at the fame time.       With    regard to the pro
 portion of the chromic acid in the ruby, I have not been able
 to determine it very accurately, on account of the affinity
 which it     has   with alumine, from which it          is difficult  to  se
 parate    it completely.       I  am however     of opinion that it may
 be estimated,      without committing any very sensible error, at
 between 5 and 6 parts in 100 of ruby.
     XII. I now return to the solution of alumine in caustic
 potash     (Exp.   VII.).     I  super-saturated    it with the muriatic
 acid, and precipitated it afterwards           by the carbonat of am
monia.       The   deposit washed and kept at a red heat for a con
siderable     time weighed 85 parts.           This matter had all the
properties of alumine. As I had however scarcely found any
siliceous earth during the course of this analysis, and as Klap-
roth fays that he obtained 16 in 100 parts                 of this  stone,    I
wished to      assure   myself whether there might not be some              of
it remaining in        the alumine.        For that purpose       I dissolved
the 82 parts above-mentioned in the sulphuric acid, and                       I
indeed obtained an insoluble residuum which weighed three
parts, and which was siliceous earth. This, with the i~
part obtained (Exp. X.), makes 4^ parts. But it must be
recollected, that during the pulverisation of the 100 parts                 of
ruby, the details of the analysis of which I have explained,
5 parts were taken from the mortar of silex ; from which it
follows, that the       4^ parts   of this substance found in the course
of   these operations did not belong to the. ruby.                Whatever
                                                                     method

                        Analyfis of the Spinel Ruby.                                 Afl
method       I  employed, and whatever care              I  took,   I  could never
obtain     a   larger quantity, and therefore it is very probable
that Klaproth was deceived in this respect.
    Now,      to establish     the proportions of the principles              of the
ruby,     I    must here observe,          that of     ioo   parts    subjected      to
analysis, 97 only were attacked ; but 97 having furnimed
85 of alumine (Exp. XII.), 3 of which were to be taken
away for the siliceous earth, 100 would have given 82*47 5
8*5 of magnesia having been obtained from these 97, 8*78
would have been found in 100.                    In the like manner,         instead
of   6  of  the chromic acid, we should have had                    6u8.       Thus,
100 parts        of   spinel ruby consist       of alumine       83*47, magnesia
8*78, chromic acid             6-i8. Loss 2*57. Total 100.
     XIII.      To   prove    the  correctness of the results of the pre
ceding analysis,          I  repeated   it by following another method.
I heated        100 parts     of ruby, reduced       to a fine powder, for se
veral hours        with concentrated sulphuric acid.                 I   obtained a
solution,        almost complete, by the addition                  of   a sufficient
quantity of water. There remained nothing but                          5 or 6 parts
of a grey powder, which               had    all the characters of siliceous
earth, and which was only mixed with                      a  little chrome.
     The solution          evaporated     to the consistence        of   syrup gave
radiated       crystals without solidity ; but these crystals,                re-dis
solved      in water, and the solution mixed with a sufficient
quantity of the sulphat of potash, gave octaedral crystals of
alum.        The whole        100 parts    of the ruby thus dissolved in the
sulphuric acid furnished me, in several successive crystallisa
tions, with about 800 parts * of alum, without reckoning the
latter portions which            I could not entirely separate from the
molher water.             This mother water          had a green colour, and
 a bitter slightly metallic taste.              I  diluted it with water, and
 mixed with it a solution of the carbonat of potasti.                          There
 was formed a greenisli white               precipitate, which was a mix
 ture   of alumine        and the oxyd      of chrome. The liquor             filtered

and exposed to heat deposited a white powder, which, washed"
and dried, weighed         17 parts, that were          reduced    to   8-3   by
calcination.       They   consisted    of magnesia, still mixed with a
few particles of oxyd.        The precipitate formed in the mo
ther water by the       carbonat of potash was treated with a so
lution of caustic potash.         By    these means the alumine was
dissolved, and the oxyd       of chrome remained without under
going any sensible alteration        :   it weighed      5 parts.
    This    analysis   perfectly confirms the former             ;  for, some
flight differences in the proportions excepted,                 it absolutely
gave    the same results.       It   proves    above      all that the ruby
does not contain siliceous       earth, and that the small quantity
found in the products was sornished by the mortar in which
the stone was pounded.
     I must here observe,     that it does not always happen that
the whole mass of the ruby is dissolved during the first ope
ration.      There remains sometimes           several parts      which have
undergone no alteration.            This     depends       on the time em
ployed for ebullition, and still more on the degree of fineness
to which the stone is reduced before               it  is subjected    to trial.
But when that happens, after having washed the residuum,
which is insoluble in the acid, it must be dried, pounded
again, and treated in the same manner                 as  before.     Nothing
then ought absolutely to remain but the siliceous earth be
longing to the mortar.
     XIV. The        muriatic   acid dissolves the ruby also           :   but a
considerable     portion of it is required      ;  because it volatilises      in
a moderate       heat, and    without       a strong      degree    of   heat   it
makes no sensible impression           on that substance.           I observed
that this acid dissolves the principles of the ruby in the fame
proportions as they hold between themselves                    in the     stone ;
for the portion not attacked absolutely preserves the fame
shade    of colour    as that which it had         before subjected       to the
action of the acid.        This  proves that      it  does not dissolve one
principle     in  preference   to another,        and that they are in a
state   of real combination in      the ruby.
                                                                           From

     From these considerations                     it would       appear natural to con
sider the ruby as a saline                   substance,           composed       of two        bases,
alumine and magnesia,                        and       of   an acid called the chromic
acid.
     When           I   announced to the National Institute that                               I   had
not found magnesia in the ruby, I was however far from
imagining that Klaproth was deceived ; so much confidence
did       I   place      in the labours of that able                       chemist.        I   chose
rather to conclude at that time, that the ruby                               I   had examined
was different from his. But                        I   was in an error in that respect,
as    I   was convinced by a new analysis,                         which     I   made    of about
16 grammes                of the     fame ruby ;            and   it   was   from this latter
labour, carried on in                  a   manner somewhat different,                      that        I
established             the proportions          of    the principles        of this    stone, as
already enumerated.                       This   proves the necessity        of employing
rather large masses, in order to find small                              quantities of mat
ter.          I   thought it my duty to make this public acknowledge
ment, both that                  I   might render justice to accuracy and to
the sagacity of a man who has given so many proofs of                                                 it,
and to avoid the reproach which might have been thrown
out against me, of wishing to conceal an error into which                                            I
had fallen.

transparent.               These           radii will not suffer                a   boat to remain
steady on the centre                       of the button, but,                  as may be readily
supposed, throw it back to the circumference.                                              M. Spallan-
zani, however, found means to fix himself in that position,
and was thence enabled to examine carefully the water at the
bottom,         as    well       as   that at the surface.
     The water             at the surface               is not fresh, but a little less salt
than that by which it is surrounded.                                        The depth of the
spring is 385 feet. When the heaving-lead approaches the
bottom, it is observed that the small line to which it                                                         i.->

suppose that              it   is     perfectly fresh at the bottom.                         To       ascer
tain this,           M. Spallanzani                invented       a   machine, by which he
eould draw up some                      of   it    from      the bottom, in such                  a   man
ner as not to be mixed with the salt water  the way; and                            by
the water procured in this manner, though exceedingly tur
bid and slimy, was found to be perfectly fresh.   He re
marked also, that' this water, when compared with the sea-
water, was remarkably cool, which arose probably from its
rising from some depth under the earth. The brass machine
also was         once very much beat together,                             which could            be oc
casioned             by   nothing          else    than the violence with which the
water        issued       from the ground, and                        by   which the machine
had probably been dashed against                              a   stone.
     M. Spallanzani     of opinion that the originof this spring
                                      is
is as   follows :— There are two small streams which flow from
the side       of    a    hill   at the distance            of three miles from Spezzia.
'1                afterwards united, and throw themselves
     hese streams arc
into an unfathomable abyss, from which the water, as                                                     it   is
sufficiently secured                    from the summer heat,                            forces   its way
through the earth, and supplies sufficient nouriffiment                                               to the
fountain that springs up through the saltwater.

IX.    Experiments respcEling the Effeds of Electricity on the Fer
    mentation of Vegetable and the Corruption of Dead Animal
    Substances.        Bv M.     Achard.           From    Memoires       de
    PAcademie de Berlin.
I   T  is a  well-known     observation,
either raw or boiled, acquires
                                             that, after  a   storm, flesh,
                                                           which in the
                                      a  putrid smell,
latter is particularly       acid.   It   is known      also,   that grain
suffered to ferment for the purposes           of brewing or distilling,
undergoes, during stormy weather, very sudden and percepti
ble changes.       On   such occasions   it is often extremely difficult
to observe where the first degree       of fermentation        ceases, as it
passes   so speedily,   and the second degree or the acetous            fer
mentation takes place         before one is aware.          To ascertain,
therefore, whether the electric matter, which during stormy
weather is so abundant in the atmosphere, has any share in
these phenomena,         M. Achard      made the      following     experi
ments.
    He cut    a piece   of raw beef into    three parts, and electrified
the first positively for ten hours without any shock ; the               se
cond he electrified for as long negatively, and             the third     he
did not electrify.       These three pieces were left in the fame
apartment, and exposed to the same degree of heat.                   When
 examined next day, both the pieces which had been electri
fied appeared     to be tender, but were free from the least bad
 smell.    On  the    fourth day the electrified fiesli had an into
 lerably fetid smell, and that which had not been electrified
 began to smell a little.
     M. Achard      repeated   these experiments       with boiled     veal.
 That which     was electrified had the next day           an acid smell
 and an unpleasant taste ; but that which had not been elec
 trified continued      sweet for three       days,  and    only on tlitj
fourth day began to have an acid smell.
    M. Achard then killed several bird? by electric sliocks,
*nd at the same time deprived           others of life by sticking          a
                                      E   2                          needle

 lame temperature, covered them with glass receivers                    in or*
 der to preserve     them from insects.          Having      observed       the
 gradual progress of corruption        in both, he plainly perceived
that it took place much sooner, and advanced                more rapidly
 in those killed by electric shocks than in those deprived               of life
 by the needle.        In those also to  which    a stronger        shock had
 been given, the degree of corruption was far stronger than
 in the others; and the cause in all probability was, that
in this    cafe the vessels     containing    the animal        fluids were
 suddenly    destroyed,   by which means these fluids had diffused
 themselves     through    the   particles of the body, and might
 thus accelerate putridity.
    It clearly follows from      these experiments,       that electricity
 accelerates    corruption,    and that the putrefaction              of flefli
after a storm muff be ascribed          solely to the more abundant
accumulation       of the electric matter          at   that time.          M.
Achard      saw that this was the cafe        in regard to several per
sons killed    by lightning.       The body of a farmer, who lost
 his life in this manner on the        2d  of July, between           five and
fix o'clock in the evening, emitted next morning                 a   very per
ceptible fetid    smell, which in the evening was totally insup
portable.
    M. Achard took          a  handful    of   rye,    which      had     been
 brought to    a state  of fermentation      in order to be distilled,
and divided it into two portions, one of which he electrified.
Five hours after being electrified, the vinous fermentation
was over in the first portion;        but this was not the cafe, in
regard to that     which   had not been electrified,       till  after eight
hours.      M. Achard       repeated    this   experiment          in such     a
manner that he sent         a  number of strong         sparks through a
portion of rye, infiead of giving ii an electric bath, and al
ways     found, except      in one cafe,      that    fermentation         was
accelerated    by the electricity.     The   cafe  in which       a contrary
tfiect was produced, may have been occasioned                by some cir
cumstance     which escaped      M. Achard's attention.
                                                                            On

                    an J Dead Animal Suhjlanccs.                            53
    On this    occasion   M. Achard      made    two experiments also,
 in order to ascertain what effect would be produced on air
 when electrified without sparks.           The object of his       first ex
periment was in particular to discover              whether the atmo
sphere,     by being electrified, would become            oxygenated, or
retain its goodness ; and         that of the second, to determine
whether a certain volume of air would be enlarged                      when
electrified positively, or be diminished when electrified nega
 tively.
    For this    purpose he took a Leyden          flask filled    with air,
the degree     of the oxygenation of which            he had previously
ascertained     by an eudiometer, and electrified        it  as strongly as
possible  :  he then let    it stand a few hours, and examined the
air again;      he,  however, found neither absorption nor di
latation to have taken place         : and    the   case   was    the fame
when he exposed           the jar to abundance of sparks;                from
which it appears, that the quality of the air is not changed
by electricity.
    He then electrified      a jar closely stopped, through the co
ver  of which     a bent glass tube proceeded downwards paral
lel to the   side  of the jar, and the exterior part of the tube
was placed in a small vessel filled with water. -He charged
this jar positively and negatively.          Had the positive electri
city occupied that space which the air before occupied, the
water must have sunk in the tube ; and had this space been
lessened by the negative          electricity,  the water must           have
risen  in the tube.       As neither of      these was      the   cafe,    the.
electric matter must        pass  through    the interstices     of  the air
without causing      a  farther separation of its component parts;
 and that matter also which goes out in electrifying nega
tively, must be contained merely in the interstices, without
occasioning     any alteration in the particles       of the air.

was    born in 1470, and                died     in 1537.             He was invited to
Rome by Pope Julius.              II.       in order that         he might add to the
splendour and magnificence                   of the Vatican ; and he left                  be
hind him many specimens                     of his art at Sienna, Naples,                  and

the variety and       beautv of the stained pieces                          of wood em
ployed in them, are still celebrated among connoisseurs, and
preferred to all new works of the like kind. It     however,                  is,
to be lamented, that the processes used                               by   John of Verona
are at present altogether unknown,                        though the wood he em
ployed was chiefly of European growth.                                Veneered or inlaid

                                                     is
manner;      and    the sums of money expended every year for
different kinds of foreign wood,                          necessary        to supply       this
luxury,     is   very considerable.                These woods arc                  imported
chiefly from India          by    the English,            Dutch       and French      ;    and
some    of them     are     of more          value than the best copper,                   the
filings of which might be employed to make imitations of
them. That narrow district alone on the Rhine between
Darmstadt and Heidelberg receives annually for wallnut-tree
wood the sum of 10,000 florins.                      Since mahogany furniture
however began         to be used, our cabinet-makers                           have made
scarcely any thing         else    than common works, because we are
accustomed       to purchase        from the Englisli, not only the ma
terials, but also the works themselves;                          so   that the time may
come when no workmen of this kind will be found in Ger
many    :   on that account,        it      is   well worth the trouble to make
                                                                                       expe-

                            Experiments on Staining Wood.                                                  55
 experiments on the staining of our own wood, in order to
 render them equal,                      if    not to all foreign woods, at least to
 some     of them,               since        many things can be coloured in that
 manner which are harder and more compact than wood.
The labours of Du Fay in this respect are well known ; and
it appears by some papers of his among the Memoirs of the
Academy of Sciences, that rock crystal, when exposed to the
 vapour of arsenic and antimony, assumes                                        a red       colour. Count
de Borch's description                        of    the method             of staining marble in
 Italy may            also be mentioned ; and                        the process by means                  of
the smoke of oak chips, which is employed by the Dutch
for colouring their tiles and earthen-ware.                                             Canes are pre
pared for usein India, by dipping them in quicklime. That
 hard compact wood brought from America, and particularly
Guiana, which, on account of its variegated and spotted ap
pearance, is called Bois de Lcttres,                                     and   which Aublet, who
gives    it the name of PiratineraGuianenJis,                                   much admired, has
its whole surface stained by the Indians with the blackest and
most durable colours. — As the art                                  of staining wood             seems at
present to be nearly lost, the following                                       experiments may be
of   some      utility       to artists        :
                            1.   By Means of Oils and Acids.
     Exp. I. A square               piece          of plane-tree wood,                  a   line in thick
ness,     was put into pounded dragon's blood from the Cana
ries * mixed with oil of turpentine, and placed over the fire
in a glass vessel. The wood slowly assumed the colour, even
before     the spirit was volatilised.                              After more than              an hour
the     vessel was          taken from the                 sire     and suffered             to stand the
whole night, when the wood appeared                                            of   a   mahogany co
lour, not merely on the surface, but also in the interior parts.
The     denser fibres were                    somewhat            less    coloured, but this, in
stead    of injuring             the beauty          of    the wood, rather added to                      it.
The      red         dye can be made stronger                             or weaker          by by
                                                                                                 taking    a
greater or           less   quantity of dragon's blood, and                                  a       greater

or   less degree          of      digestion       and boiling.            The wood of the
plane-tree was chosen for this purpose, because it can be                                     easi
ly   sawn         and     polished        ;    because       it   has    a white colour;           is
neither too hard nor too soft                          ;    because      it neither contracts
nor warps ; has beautiful white spots with veins that cross
each other ; and because artists who make inlaid work have
long attempted                to colour          it by staining.             The wood, when
stained,         can very easily be freed from the dragon's blood ad
hering to          it,   by means of rectified spirit of wine.                          The       spi
rit of turpentine makes the wood more compact, and renders
it   more susceptible of               a      fine polish.
     II.
      Gamboge, dissolved inspirit of turpentine, gave to the
whole surface of small piece of wood
                              a         most beautiful shin         a
ing golden yellow colour.                        The       fibres and veins, on the other
hand,        had       assumed        a       colour       inclining     a   little to red.        A
piece       of   the    wood of        the       pear-tree assumed            a    darker colour,
somewhat approaching to green, and which in part was
nearly an olive colour.                        Different colours ma.y therefore be
obtained          by   employing different kinds of wood.
     III.    One part of dragon's blood, two parts of gamboge,
with spirit of turpentine,                      gave to the wood             of    the plane-tree
or beech, according to the mixture of the colours and the na
ture of the wood,                 a   remarkable variation of dyes.                      A   bit of
beech wood seemed always to assume                                   a   blackish yellow co
lour   ;    and was thoroughly stained,                           when moderate heat was
kept up for         a    sufficient length of time.
     IV.    Distilled verdigris (crystallised                      acetite    of   copper)   could
not easily be used                in   the above             manner,      as its    colour   is   too
much changed               by oil and sire,             as   is   known to those who em
ploy    it   as    a     pigment.             The olive colour               also does not pe
netrate to the interior part of the wood.
                         Z.    By Means            of   Spirit     of   Wine.
     Exp.I. When    dragon's blood and gamboge were merely
dissolved in spirit of wine, the extract was not sufficiently
strong,      and ths dye was                   of no       use.    The       process, however,
                                                                                        succeeds

                      Experiments on Staining Wood.                                     57
succeeds when the spirit                    of wine    has been long boiled over a
slow fire   till it   is almost evaporated.                The    piece    of wood      ap
pears then     dark red colour, which is improved if the
               of     a
wood be washed in pure spirit of wine.  But the colour is
never so        that produced by means of an oil. .
            bright        as
  II. Gamboge with spirit of wine gave to wood in this
manner a yellow, and gamboge and dragon's blood a yel
lowish red, colour.
                           3. Experiment with
                                              Wax.
  White wood boiled in spirit of wine,                            to   which, when it
                                       not be made to assume
began to boil, wax was added, could
the green or the red dye, even in its small cross veins, which
were exceedingly porous.
          4. Experiments with dissolved Salts and Metals.
   The following experiments with                          these substances,        which       -
have already been described                     by Macquer, seemed to be most
successful.
   Exp. I. A solution of common alum (sulphat of alumine)
 penetrates      exceedingly well into wood which has been di
 gested    in it ;    so   that hopes may be entertained of some thing
being effected             by    it,   as     the white    colour of every kind of
 wood becomes whiter                     by   solutions of saline substances        :   this
 may be of great               use to artists.
    II.    Wood       soaked        in   a    solution of gold assumed         a   red co
 lour, but the inner part was only of                      a    yellowish red.
    III.    Distilled verdigris dissolved                  in vinegar       stained wood
 green,     but the colour could never be brought to                               a    grafs
 green.
       IV. Wood           which has lain           a    long time under water be
 comes black, as experience                      shews,    and looks as      if    charred.
 It,    however,          loses none          of its    toughness      or compactness;
 and many trees dug up in Holland                              from the turf earth are
 employed there for ship-building.                        This   effect   of the sulphuric
 acid     on wood gave occasion                       to the    following    experiment.
                                                                                       Pieces

   58                Experiments on Staining Wood.
   Pieces of different kinds of wood, of considerable             thickness,
   were placed     in the sulphurous acid. In half an hour the
   whole surface of them was covered with a yellowish scurf,
   and the wood itself had the appearance               of being charred.
  When      washed   in water,   and exposed some hours to the open
  air, it was   observed that the black colour had penetrated             still
  farther,    that  the interior     part only retained         the natural
  colour,    and that the wood was exceedingly close and com
  pact.     After this wood    had been several        times rubbed over
  with the oil or spirit of turpentine, it became harder and
  firmer, so that it could receive the highest polish ; by which
  means the colour was rendered more agreeable.                This process
  may be readily employed by artists,        as  it is  easy, and does not
  require much expenec.
     V. Another      black dye for staining wood, which succeeds
  extremely well, and may lead to other useful experiments, is
 that formed with liver of sulphur (sulphuret of potash)                 and
  metallic solutions.      As the sulphurized hydrogen gas is so
 subtle    that it penetrates the closest bodies, it might readily
 be conjectured that it would easily give a black colour to
 wood, if the latter could any how be made to imbibe it with
 a metallic solution.      Pieces of different kinds of wood were
 placed, for several days successively, in a solution of acetite of
 lead, and a solution     of silver, copper, iron, and other metals ;
 after which     a solution of arsenical liver of sulphur was pre
 pared   in the following manner : One part of the arsenical
liver of sulphur was mixed with two parts of clear quick-,
lime,     in a porcelain   vessel,  over  which      was    poured    six or
eight parts of boiling water.          The  solution was then poured
off, and the wood which had been impregnated with the
above metallic solutions being placed            in it    and   suffered   to
remain several days, the        vessel being closely shut, it assumed
a   black colour.     The solution of    acetite   of  lead produced     the
greatest effect; that of silver next, and those of the other
metals least of all.      Spotted wood, and particularly that of
the    plane, beech and      pear-tree,    assumed the        best colour
                                                                          H

                 Description     of a new Diving Machine.                                      59
It is   therefore    beyond all doubt that porous wood,                              such as
that of the lime, the elder, &c. could be stained much easier.
Though the arsenical liver of sulphur from lime may appear
superfluous, as the common, which is prepared from alkaline
salts and sulphur,             can produce the same effect,                        the above
process      however is that which ought to be recommended.
This method of staining may                           be       considered     as    the best,
because      it impregnates the wood with metallic                                  particles,
gives it a hardness susceptible                 of       a fine polish,        and    secures
jt from worms.             The    vessel    employed for this purpose must
be either     of porcelain,       stone ware, or glass.
XI.     Description   of a new Diving Machine, proper for being
   employed       in Rivers, &c. By C. H. Klingert.        Ex
   tracted from the Author's Account of                                 it,   published at
   Breslau.
JT   O  R    several      centuries mankind have employed their                               in
genuity to devise means              bywhich they might descend into
the water,         without       danger, in order to search for sunk
bodies   ;   but all the inventions hitherto made for this pur.-
                                                     ¦
pose have        never     fully answered                the    proposed      end, as they
have     all been attended          with inconveniences.                      Of    these in
ventions the best known                    is   the diving-bell         ;     but   if   a    man
descends in such          a    machine to        a    certain depth under water,
the air being condensed                in       the       bell in proportion             as   the
height of the column of water of equal diameter becomes
greater,     he can breathe          only for            a   short   time;    and the very
nature of the machine prevents                           him from moving about at
pleasure,     which       is   an object        of   the utmost         importance.             A
desire to        obviate these difficulties                    induced the author               to
contrive     a   machine in which                a man could not only rife and
descend at pleasure,            but even at the depth of from 20 to 60
feet and more under water, walk, breathe, and move freely                                       ;
and he was          so   far successful that an                 experiment made with
                                                                                               his

his machine in the river Oder, in the presence                        of   a great
many spectators, exceeded what could have been expected.
    It is well known, that the pressure of water increases with
its depth; and         as water is a dense body, a man cannot descend
far in it without experiencing              a  very strong pressure      :   so   that
if a  diver, whose head is five feet below the surface, attempts
to breathe       through      a pipe, he finds himself incapable of in
haling the air,        on   account    of the pressure he sustains on his
breast.     A man, therefore, to descend to a great depth, must
have    his body and breast free from the external pressure of
the fluid.        In order to secure him from this inconvenience,
the author has invented a fort of harness,                       made   of strong
tin plate,      in the form of        a cylinder,       which goes over the

line in thickness, wound into                          a     spiral     form,      and covered
with      strong leather.                In   order to       save expence,          six yards       of
the pipe, from the mouth-piece, may be made in this man

in length, joined together with                         pieces     of leather-pipe about
a    foot in length, prepared in the first manner.

can be screwed off,                 is   for the purpose of collecting the small
quantity of water that might force itself into the breathing
pipe when long used,                          and    which otherwise would                    be    in
continual motion and render breathing disagreeable.

leather must be used for the tubes, and that stripes of leather
must be sewed very closely on the seams of the jacket and
drawers,

    If  the machine be intended for diving to a great depth, it
 mult    be constructed      in  as strong a manner as possible,            and
 the drawers       must    be furnished        with iron ribs in the      inside
 fastened by means        of hoops to the machine, as may be seen
 fig. 3 and 6, over         which a net of small chains or strong
 cords must be hooked or tied to the hoop k, and also to the
 hoops 2, 3, 2, 2, by means of the holes made in them for
 that purpose    ;  but these chains or cords in particular which
go behind must not be drawn too tight,                  that the diver may
 be able to bend his body.
    The ribs   i, i,   are screwed on the inside to the strong iron
 hoop k, but in such           a   manner      as to be  moveable ; and        aa
 the centres     rest on the hips,          the diver can move his legs
 backwards and forwards.             To   these ribs the two hoops 2, 2,
"are made    fast by riveting at 3, 3, and the two interior ribs
4, 5 — 4, 5 are fastened in the like manner.                     To the latter
must be soldered at 5, 5, a circular piece 6, 6, 6, of the like
 radius as the part      0,  which,    as the diver walks, moves back
wards and forwards on            0 by means of       a groove,     at the fame
 time that the outer ribs move;              and on account      of these ribs,
 hoops, &c. the pressure           of the water upwards will present
 the  less impediment to the diver, as it can act only accord
 ing to the diameter of the smallest hoops 3, 4— 3, 4.
    The author gives the following instructions for using a
 machine     of this kind.         When       the diver, after being made
 acquainted with all the parts of the machine,                  has put it on
 and suspended from it the proper weights,                let him enter the
 w-ater at any convenient place,            and advance     till it  reaches to
 his eyes, while the end of the pipe is held                 by   a person     on
 the bank.      If   the    diver can then breathe with case, and               if
 no water forces itself into the pipe, which must be left to
 float on the water, he may proceed till it covers his head,
 having first taken the precaution to tie              a strong    rope to one
 of his arms. After this          he may stop for some time, and then
 gradually go deeper and deeper, making signals that he. finds
 himself at   ease,   by pulling the rope, or by speaking through
                                                                              the

 the pipe.      If  a man exercises        himself in this manner for
 several days      successively,   still increasing his depth, he will
 soon be able to dive boldly, and            to move under       the water
 with   ease  and freedom     :  when he wishes to ascend, he needs
 only unhook the weight, which will drop to the bottom; and
being then lighter than an equal volume of water, he will
 rise to the surface.      To preserve the weight from being lost,
a particular rope must be employed,             which may     be let down
to the diver upon his making a certain signal,              and w-hich he
may fasten to the weight before he unhooks it.
    By following these directions a              resolute   man may be
taught, in the course of a few days,             to dive to a moderate
depth, though on account of various preparations and un
 foreseen    difficulties, the author employed five whole weeks
in teaching        one  who     was unacquainted        with swimming.
This man, called Frederick William Joachim, a huntsman
by profession, dived in the above apparatus into the Oder,
near Breflau,        where the water was of considerable             depth
and the current strong, on the 24th of June I797» before
a great number of spectators, and sawed through the trunk
of   a tree  which     was lying at the bottom.           He  shewed also
that he could have fastened sunk bodies to a rope in order to
be drawn up, and that in case any impediments should pre
vent the use of the saw, such trunks might be hewn to
pieces    by an axe.        It clearly    appears,   therefore, that two
men furnished with such apparatus              could saw to pieces large
beams of wood lying at the bottom of rivers, which are
often   a great   obstruction, and, on account of their siz«, can
not be otherwise       removed.
    One part of the construction was attended with an incon
venience, which it may be proper to mention.                  It  has been
already remarked, that         a man at the depth of five feet under
the   water cannot breathe without             a machine    ; and though
one, such as that above described, will defend his breast and
body    from     the pressure     of the water,       yet  though    it be
furnished with        a  pipe to breathe through, it will appear,
                                                                      from

from what follows,                  that this will be impossible.                           The air
which surrounds                   the diver        in this machine                      amounts        to
somewhat           more than a cubic foot.                      Now         if   he inhales air
through the pipe screwed                         to the machine,                 his body must
distend a space equal                   to the volume            of air inhaled,               conse
quently he compresses                    so   much the air that surrounds him
in the machine.                   But    as this is impossible, on account                             of
its too great resistance, he does not obtain air sufficient to
support life, and is almost in the fame state as                                   if    surrounded
by water.           To   be convinced              of   the truth          of this, let any ona
take a cask, equal            in content           to one or two cubic feet                    j    press
his mouth against the aperture of                         it,   and try whether he can
without difficulty breathe back into                       it    the air he has inhaled.
A larger space around the diver in the machine would make
breathing easier, but would not render him sufficiently easy
to labour.    The interior air in the machine, therefore, must
be    connected with the pipe destined for breathing, in order
that           may be at freedom to dilate                  as    his body          is    extended

conveyed           the exhaled          air into the pipe destined for breath
ing. As he found that this was attended with inconvenience,
on account          of the moisture which                  adhered            to    it,   he       after
wards omitted the valve entirely.
     The diver, therefore, must                    suffer the air inhaled through
the mouth-piece               a to escape through                    his nostrils into the
machine        ;   and then the air in             it   will remain equally                    elastic.
The     next time he draws breatb, the air in the machine                                           will
be forced out from            it    at   z    by   the distention of his body.                        By
these means he           will      be able to breathe freely and easily for                            a
long time; and thus the chief difficulty                              is   overcome.

of that benevolent institution which                has been the mean,        in
the hand of Providence, of averting the tear of sorrow from
the eye, and inexpressible anguissi from the heart, of many
individuals who daily implore that the richest blessings of
Heaven        may    be   showered        down       upon     the   Humane
Societv.          The   apparatus       seems so well         contrived in all
its parts,     as almost    to preclude     the possibility      of improving
it  :   yet there  can be little doubt that by the                ingenuity of
British artists it might be simplified            a  little, and produced at
so cheap a rate that the funds             of the Society might be able
to add such machines to their other apparatus                        for saving
people from drowning.              If  such machines were deposited            at
the places where accidents            of this kind        most usually occur,
and some persons in the neighbourhood instructed in the use
of them, how         speedily might the unhappy victim                 be often
rescued from death        !   Plow infinitely      preferable    would this be
to dragging, and how much more certain in its result, since
the diver, when under water,              could look round him for his
object, and proceed directly to the spot ! For such a pur
pose it would be advisable to make the machine so large
 that it would require an extra weight, more than equivalent
 to that of a man's body in water, to sink it : the diver, by un
 hooking the weight or weights, would then be enabled to as
 cend to the surface      of   the water with the patient          in his arms.

 Notwithstanding                           the great progress which          the
  sciences have      made in the present century,              and though our

enlarged,      we are still far from being able to explain all its
phenomena, especially those of the luminous kind, in                         a  man
ner sufficiently satisfactory          to the cautious and reflecting phi
losopher.       Though many, in             consequence         of the important
discoveries     made respecting the electricity              of  the clouds, ima
gine that they have found in the electric fluid,                     so  widely dif
fused, a certain key to all distant phenomena                   of a similar kind,
yet the greater part          of them as mere observations, and the
explanations given of them as mere hypotheses, must be left
to the decision of posterity. ¦ It would be useless, and perhaps
it  is impossible,     to mention all these phenomena                    in any cer
tain order;       but the most singular of them are large fire-balls
 {bolides),     which, on account of their importance in natural
 philosophy, have in modern times excited                         universal     atten
 tion *.
     Respecting the origin and nature of these phenomena,
which are but seldom seen, and always surprise us as it were
 accidentally,       we can venture conjectures                 and explanations
 only when we have compared a series of observations                             care
 fully  made with the circumstances by which                          they were at-
    *  On the 1 3th of  Julv   1797, about 42 minutes after nine in the even
 ing, I had the gooil fortune, when m company with several of my friends,
to sec a meteor of this kind.         It appeared in the southern part of the ho
 rizon, at the height of     8 or 10 degrees ; had       the form of a perfect globe
or sphere well defined at the edges, almost as large as the moon when at
full, and proceeded in the       space  of scarcely  a second,   while its course was
only marked by a fine white streak of light, in an almost perpendicular di
rection towards our horizon, which was confined by houses, and disap
peared   behind them,     fts colour and splendour near the middle were some
 times   of  a dazzling white.      The    heat during the day, and in the even
 ing, was considerable.      The     thermometer varied from 18 to ao of Reau
 mur,   and   between the hours of four and five in the afternoon there had
 becii a storm   in the fame quarter       of  the heavens.      At   the surface of the
 earth theu was a perfect         calm,   and in    the evening     the weather-cocks
 stewed that a light south-west wind prevailed             at  some height    in the at
  mosphere.    At  the time   of this phenomenon the earth was overspread by a
 pile mist, through which no stars could          be perceived, and which the fol
 lowing night became a thick fog.

 the mass of iron found by Professor Pallas in Siberia §, and
 other         masses    of     the like kind,              as    well     as stones         which,       ac

  probability,      as alluding to the fame kind, and in most cafes
 just   as  they were given by the observers, without paying at
  tention to any particular mode of explanation, in order to
  assist those whose       attention is occupied with the origin                      and
 nature of these bodies, to examine the old and new hypo
 theses formed respecting              them, or to support future ones,                 if
 necessary.        These meteors appear, then,
     1.   In  every climate.           Of fifty    observations        with which        I
 am acquainted, three were made immediately under the equa
 tor * ; three in a southern            t,   and 44     in  a   northern latitude         :
 and this disproportion arises merely from the greater number
 of accounts brought to us from the latter, and the greater at
 tention of the observers ; for we are assured by Forster, that
 he saw several fire-balls           in the    south seas      J.
     2.  At   every season       of the year.       I  am acquainted with ob
 servations     made     in   every month         except     September;           and   of
 these several were           made, but between the 45th and 55th
 degree of northern latitude, in all the months except April,
size  of a bomb,    descend towards the earth ; but           though the ground was
dug up around       the place where      it seemed    to fall, nothing could be per
ceived except burnt grass and a sulphureous            smell.     A  violent storm, it is
said, had taken place a little before,        which makes it highly probable that
this phenomenon       was nothing else than lightning, especially as Rcimarus
relates, that lightning has been seen to sail upon houses and conductors in
a  globular form, and that        a sulphureous     smell has been afterwards         per
ceived : fee Reimarus vom         B/iz, Hamburg       1794, p. 51,      155*   319.    An
observation   of two    balls   proceeding towards each other before a thunder
cloud, made by Hartman,          in July   1758, seems to be of the like kind. See

June     and September.        It  cannot, therefore, be said that, like
storms,      they appear more frequently at one time of the year
than another.
    3. At every period of the day. The hour when these
phenomena took place is not indeed given by every observer,
but observations        have been made both by night and by day.
The     greater part, however, have been made in the evening,
when, being more perceptible to the eye, it was                      less possible
for them to escape notice.
    4. They appear, for the most part, when the sky is serene.
This remark is expressly made in regard to 26 of the above,
mentioned 50; and in regard to the                  rest  it is to be concluded
from concomitant circumstances,                   such as     their height, &c.
The      heavens were often covered only              with    a pale mist  *,  and
 some few were seen to proceed                from light clouds         t> which
 gives     us   reason   to suppose       that they came          from a greater
 height than these clouds.
    5. Most of them were seen to move with a very rapid
 motion, and of those on the velocity of which observations
 have been made,           that is said to have moved quickest which
 was seen in the month           of November 1758, and which, ac
 cording to the        calculation of Sir John Pringle %, passed over
 thirty English or seven German miles in one second; a ve
 locity greater by 3^ miles in a second, than that of the
 motion of the earth in its orbit.                    The     one   said to   have
 moved slowest is that which was seen by Balbus at Bologna,
 in   the month      of March 1719s,            and    which     proceeded,     ac
 cording to his reckoning,            at about 1530 feet or 0,067             or~  a
 German mile in one second.                 But there is reason to conclude

Compass.                 The     greater part        of them, however,                 have beyond
all dispute appeared in the northern or southern parts of the
horizon           ;    but no general conclusion, in regard to their con
nection with the northern                        J or     southern          lights, can be drawn
from this circumstance,                         though some observations                          made         in

not move above 100 feet per second.                                         When       such meteors
have         appeared,           it   has been            generally calm; but some of
them were followed                         by   wind f,          and Forster observed                     that

from         a   rarer to        a denser atmosphere,                     as    in    most cafes might
be  concluded from their soon becoming considerably en
larged. Some of them, however, particularly those which
moved slowly, seemed to proceed                                      in    a    horizontal direction
over the surface                  of   the earth ; but none                     of them, according
to every appearance,                     moved upwards.                        Their motion, there
fore, cannot be explained in the fame manner as that of
sky-rockets *, where the superior air is rarified by the flame,
and that below condensed.
   9. Their form was sometimes perfectly globular, and some
times more spindle shaped ; so that their length often occu
pied seven or eight degrees of the heavens.                                               When          observed
to     move with                 great      velocity, they had a long tail behind,
which            arose chiefly from the continuance                                  of   the      impression
made on the eyes.                            Others,            however          J,    and      particularly

belonged to the body itself;                                and it would appear that the
long train which marks their course, ought often to be ex
plained rather by traces left behind them than by mere im
pression§.

their axes*.
   13.     The    greater part      of them        diffused a very lively      dazzling
light    f;     the fewer number a faint light.                     Their colour and
splendour were very different and variable                           ; sometimes       red,
sometimes         blue, sometimes violet, sometimes in part yellow
or dazzling white, and some exhibited the prismatic colours                                 J.
Several have been             seen to    burn with           a     bright flame, and
others     as   if in    a state   of ignition.
   13.     Their       real diameter,     as       far as could be ascertained,
sometimes         by conjecture and sometimes                     by actual measure
ment, was always very considerable.                          The diameter of that
respecting which Sir John Pringle made calculations from
various observations he collected, and of that seen by Mr.
Rittenhouse § at Philadelphia, in the month of October 1779,
were at most about half a German mile.
   14. They seem to have originated at a very different,
though most of them at a very considerable height above the
surface       of the earth.         At any     rate all. of them, whose mean
or greatest height was subjected                    to any calculation,        exceeded
that of the highest clouds, as clouds are scarcely perceptible
at the height        of 13,500 toises;               and     Silberschlag found the
greatest        height of the fire-ball,              which         appeared    in July
1762, to be 19 German miles, or 72,276 toises.    On this
account their origin, as Reimarus and Chladni have already
sufficiently shewn, is not to be ascribed merely to electricity,
though          some have considered               them as occasioned               by the
action of the electric                fluid    between the               clouds and         the
northern         lights,      which would           agree exceedingly well             with

will     appear the more favourable to this hypothesis, as we have

entirely disappeared.          This division also seems to oppose the
hypothesis of        a tract  of  inflammable air set on fire *, which
Dr. Chladni        has sufficiently refuted on other grounds.
    17.   This bursting into pieces was for the most part ac*
companied with a rumbling noise like thunder, or a sudden
report.     This was observed to be the case in regard to 27 of
the 50 above mentioned ; and very often two or more reports
have been heard in succession, without the large ball being
divided into         smaller ones,         and     without    these being       still
farther shattered.          But    as these reports were heard at a            very
great distance f, and as many which did not appear to be
more remote, but nearer, have burst without any report ; a
 question arises, whether we are to consider,                   as  Dr. Chladni
 does, this violent bursting as peculiar to all these phenomena?
    18. Several, after bursting, seemed to dissolve into smoke                     Jj
 and, according to the observation made                      by Celsius in the
month of March 1731,               a visible     smoking stripe seemed to be
previously inflamed.             The      greater part of them, however,
 after exploding,       left no   visible    traces behind.
     19. In some cases, after their disappearance, a sulphureous
 smell was perceived         §, like that      perceived    after  lightning    has
 fallen, and which gave occasion to Muschenbroek's hypothesis
 of an accumulation of sulphureous inflammable vapours that
 arise from volcanoes and subterranean                  pits, and being driven
 together by the winds form clouds, that by some accident or
 other are    set   on sire; but which, however, can                  as  little be
 reconciled with their general                prodigious height,       as   Silber-
 fchlag's oily and (limy vapours.

 actually    seen to   fall at the time of the disappearance        of  these
 phenomena, or have been found soon aster on the surface of
 the earth, and as it is sufficiently proved by various accounts
 that stones have         fallen from the atmosphere,         Dr. Chladni
 concludes that both these phenomena are connected;                       but
 this can be determined only by future accurate observations.
 XIII. A Communication           from   Mr.W. H. Pepys jun.         Member
     es the London Philosophical Society, containing an Account
     issome interejling Experiments on the Production of Arti
   ficial Cold, in        one   of which Fifty -fix Pounds of Mercury
     was. frozen into a solid      Mass.
   1 HE       freezing or fixing of mercury has been the means
©f   proving it to be a metal possessing the principal properties
and characteristics of other metals, as splendour, malleability,
and    a crystallised     structure when reduced        to   a solid   form.
Gmelin       was    the first who ever observed        mercury at such a
 low temperature as leads to a belief that a partial congela
tion had taken place, though he did not then suspect the
fact   ;  but   "  De L'lsle      was probably    the first person upon
earth who saw quicksilver reduced to a solid form by cold, and
ventured to credit the testimony of his fenses             *." This     hap
pened      at Yakutsk       in Siberia,   in 1736, where the natural
temperature was          so   low at the time as to produce the effect
v. ithout the aid of artificial means.
     Since that period the production             of artificial cold, by
means of various            mixtures,    sufficiently  intense    to freeze
mercury, has employed the abilities of the most experienced
chemists       and philosophers, as Braun, Blumenbach,              Hutch-
ins, Lambert Bicker, Fothergill, Cazalet, Guthrie, Caven-

dish, fee and     latterly Walker, who, in his           treatise on that
subject, seemed to have         exhausted      the whole train of mix
tures,   and certainly has shewn considerable ingenuity             in the
contrivance of the instruments and apparatus he employed to
accomplish the end he had in view s but, though I am pos
sessed of the principal part of them, and repeated his expe
riments with the greatest care and attention, I cannot fay I
succeeded in all of them. The materials employed by Seguin
for frigorific mixtures     are certainly the         best that have   yet
been proposed,     or perhaps can possibly be devised.              Consi
dering the muriats as a class of salts best suited for the pur
pose, and having tried them all, he gave the decided prefer
ence to muriat     of lime in    crystals.      His method was to mix
the crystals,    previously pulverised,        with  an equal weight of
 uncompressed     snow. My friends Allen and Lawfon were, I
 believe, the first who in this country tried that method                  :
this was in December last          ;,  and they succeeded perfectly in
freezing the mercury.
    Determining      to make the experiment            with accuracy in
 respect  to the weight   of  the   materials    employed, and on such
 a scale  that it might   be  repeated by any one, on the 30th of
 January last we collected a quantity of snow for the purpose.
The temperature os the laboratory at the time was 40°. It
 may not be improper to mention here, that the thermometer
employed in this and the other experiments which followed
was filled with tinged alkohol, and accurately divided ac
 cording to Fahr. scale,     as  mercurial thermometers cannot be
 resorted to for determining          degrees   of temperature   at or un
 der the freezing point      of that metal.          Having put into an
 earthen pan equal parts      of muriat of lime of the temperature
 of 400 and    snow at 320 above         o"1, we found that the tempe
 rature of the mixture,     as soon as      liquefaction took place, was
 320 below o°.       Into this mixture        we immersed, each in      se
  parate vessels,  8  oz. troy of muriat of lime, and the fame
 weight of snow, by which means, and with very little trou
 ble, they were     cooled    down- to 50 above          o°, the mixture
                                                                   gaining

gaining a proportionate increase of temperature by trie Heal
which had passed into it from the immersed snow aud
muriat.
     We now             placed            a   half-pint Wedgewood's                    <;up   within    a
white stone-ware jar, insulating                                  it,     agreeably to     a    method
suggested          by   our friend Howard,                        with        three corks placed at
equal        distances         round the              vessel,    and       one at the bottom for
the cup to           rest    upon.             This     prevented             the cup from coming
in contact with the jar, which                                 we now placed,'         with     the cup
in    in the mixture that had
      it,                                                      served for        cooling the mate
rials down to + 5°                        *,
                       adding to the mixture   little more                             a
muriat of lime at + 400 and snow at + 3a0. By this means
we secured the advantage                           of having          a   cold atmosphere within
the   jar all round the insulated cup.
     Upon mixing the cooled ingredients, which                                       were now put
into the cup, the thermometer, being immersed in the mix
ture, sunk to — 50''. Four ounces of pure mercury at 400,                                       +
in small thin glass retort, were then introduced into this
     a
mixture, which in                     15      minutes became perfectly fixed.                         We
observed that           it         congealed          from the circumference                    towards
the centre, in the fame way                             as     wax or resin fixes in cooling.
     We now broke                    the retort, and gave the mercury several
blows with the beak of                         a     hammer, which indented, and at
last fractured          it   :      the fracture was similar to that                    of zink, but
with        facets    more cubical.                      Inadvertently taking up                a   piece
of the        solid mercury,                  I    experienced            a   sensation as    if  I   had
received       a     wound from                a     rough-edged instrument.                  I    threw
it   from me as         I          would have done                a     piece    of red-hot         iron,
and was not             a     little alarmed when                     I    found that the part         of
my hand which had been in contact with the metal, imme
diately after lost all sensation, and became white and dead to
the view.
     The mercury in                   the mean            time had            become     fluid.       The

have been about two minutes ; but the                  accident that  hap->
pened to my hand prevented me from noting it exactly.                   Oil
trying the temperature         of the mixture,     I now found it — 420     s
the addition     of  some snow,       which    had   been cooled   for the
purpose   while the preceding experiment               was going on,    re*-
duced it again      to — 500.
   We now put into the mixture a glass tube containing
some mercury.           In two minutes it was completely fixed.
We broke the tube, and bent the cylindrical piece of mer
cury into an acute angle, by means of pincers : we attempted
to straiten it again, but it became fluid during the operation.
    Several    substances    in proper    vessels  were now tried    in the
cold mixture.         Sulphuric      ether exhibited no signs of con
gelation   :   rectified spirit     of turpentine became thick and
                          —
nearly consistent at          500: pure concentrated sulphuric acid
was fixed    :  acetic acid likewise was fixed : nitric acid became
thick and ropy.         On muriatic acid        the cold had no effect.
    On  the 7th     of this month (Feb.) we repeated our expe
riment, in the presence of a number of our acquaintance,
with the same success          as before.
    Encouraged by the success             of  these experiments, we re
 solved to attempt one        of  some magnitude.         Accordingly,    on
 the following clay, my friend Allen, who is a zealous and
 able chemist,      started a    bullion of mercury for the       purpose ;
 and, having weighed 56 lbs. avoirdupoise, we prepared every
 thing necessary for fixing this quantity.
    The mercury        was    put into   a strong    bladder and well     se
 cured at the mouth, the temperature of the laboratory at the
 time being + 33°.          A    mixture consisting of muriat of lime
 a lib. at + 330 and the same weight of snow at + 320 gave
  — 4a-1.    The mercury was put as gently as possible into this
 mixture     (to prevent     a  rupture of the bladder), by means of
 a cloth held at the       four corners.         When the cold mixture
 had robbed the mercury of            so much of its heat as to have its
                                                   —
 own temperature thereby raised from                  420 to + 5, another
 mixture,      the feme in every respect a? the last, was made,
                                                                     which

                                                               43".     The
 mercury was        now received       into the cloth, and put gently
 into this new mixture, where it was left to be cooled still
 lower than before.
     In  the mean time five pounds of muriat of lime, in a large
 pail made of tinned-iron and japanned inside and outside,
 was placed in a cooling mixture in an earthen-ware pan.
 The mixture in the pan, which consisted of 4 lib. of muriat
 of lime and a like quantity of snow, of the same temperature
 as the former,       in one hour       reduced  the 5 lib. of muriat in
 the pail to — 15°.       The mixture was then emptied out of the
 earthen pan, and four large corks, at proper distances,             placed
 on its bottom, to serve as rests for the japanned pail which
 was now put into the pan. The corks answered the purpose
 already mentioned, that          of insulating the inner    vessel,  while
 the exterior one kept off the surrounding atmosphere, and
preserved the air between the two at a low temperature.
    To the    5 lib. of muriat of lime which        had   been   cooled    as
 already noticed to       —
                             15°,   and which still remained in the
metallic vessel, was now added snow, uncompressed                 and free
from moisture, at the usual             temperature of + 33d.        In  less
than three minutes the mixture gave a temperature of                — 63° :
a degree     of cold which     I   believe was never    before   produced
in this country, being 940 below the freezing point of water.
    The mercury, which, by immersion in the second cooling-
mixture      to  which it was       exposed,    we found by this time
reduced     to — 30°, was now, by the means employed before,
cautiously put into the last-made mixture of the temperature
of    —  63°.   A hoop,    with net-work fastened to its upper edge,
and    of  such a   breadth in the rim that the net-work, when
loaded     with the bladder of mercury, could not reach its
lower edge, was         at the bottom of the mixture, to prevent
the     bladder from coming           in contact with the       vessel;   by
which     means     the   mercury was suspended in the middle              of
the mixture.       As   soon as the bladder was safely deposited on
the net-work,        the  vessels  were carefully covered over with
                                             4                    a  cloth,

  a cloth, to impede the        passage   of   heat from the surrounding
  atmosphere    into our materials.         The condensation of      moist
  ure from the atmosphere          by the agency of so low      a tempera
  ture was greater than could have been expected                : it floated
 like steam over our        vessels,   and, but for the interposed       co
 vering, would have          given our mixture           more temperature
 than was desirable.
   ¦
     After one hour      and forty minutes we found, by means              of
 a searcher introduced for the purpose,             that the mercury was
 solid and fixed.    The temperature of the mixture            at this time
 was — 46, that is        1 6°  higher than when the mercury was
 put into it.
     We now       regretted    that we had not flung the hoop and
 net-work in the fame way as the shell of             a beam is suspended,
 which would have enabled us to lift it out of the mixture at
 once with    the    bladder and its contents          ;  but having over
 looked this provision, we were obliged to turn out the whole
 contents   of the pail into     a large evaporating capsule made of
 iron, which was not effected without the mercury striking
 against its bottom, and at the fame time receiving a consi
 derable increase     of temperature. The bladder was now cut.
 The   eagerness    of our friends, of whom several were present,
 to be   in  possession    of  pieces    of the   solid   mercury, which
 had fractured by the fall it had received, was past description.
Forgetting,      and    perhaps      not being aware        of the   conse
quence, some rushed their hands into the frigorific mixture,
while some seized on pieces which others, having selected
with    their eyes    as  their prize, also laid hold of at the fame
moment, and consequently each grasped them harder than
otherwise    they would have done.              The   acute pain that in
stantly followed, quickly recalled          their recollection, and, but
for the sufferings of the individuals, the scene would have
excited no small degree of mirth : some clapt their hands
into their mouths,         others shook them, blew on them, or
rubbed them against their clothes            ;  and all were more or less

suddenly           robbed       of heat by          the frozen metal               *.
     The larger            pieces were kept for some minutes before fusion
took place, while others were twisted and bent into various
forms, to the no small gratification and surprise of those who
had never witnessed                         or expected to             see such an           effect    pro
duced on so fusible a metal.
      Though mercury in                        the state          in which we           had     it,   exhi
bited       a      degree of ductility and malleability, we
                considerable
cannot thence infec the degree in which they would be
found to belong to                      it,   could     it   be reduced to            a    temperature
much more considerably under its freezing point, which
seems to be at about — 39° or — 40°. At the time that we
bent and twisted                  it, it    maybe considered as having been in                            a
proportionate temperature                           to iron           near its point          of fusion,
when, as     well known,
                      is                            it   will hardly            bear       the smallest
blow of         a   hammer.
     As the apparatus employed in                                 these     experiments was ex
tremely simple,                 a     short description               of   them may not be un
acceptable.                Fig.     1
                                         (Plate      II. )    represents that employed                    in
the first experiments;                        and only viewing the figure                     will con

restored to the parts,                which however returned without                    any other means
being employed than such as have been mentioned.                                 It   is   easy to conceive
that the injury was little more than skin deep,                             like what takes place from
touching     a    hot metal, without            allowing     it   to remain long enough          in   contact
with the skin to produce                a   wound   ;   but what       is   very singular, almost every
individual compared the sudden pain                        he experienced to that produced               by   a

by   the mixture,          was desired to take           a   little   snow in one hand and muriat
of lime     in    the other:      "   they were neither of them colder than he expected
to find them        :"     then to put the snow into the hand that held the muriat.
The     ingredients          had hardly come in contact when                      he threw them from
him, exclaiming,            "   Cold !— Tis         a   red-hot coal !"

Vey to any one a complete idea            of the arrangement,        as it ex
hibits the retort containing the mercury, surrounded by the
cooling-mixture        in the half-pint cup, which is insulated by
means     of  the corks, and       prevented    from coming in contact
with the stone-ware jar— the space between the latter being
occupied only with cold air, preserved in that state by means
of the frigorific mixture in the exterior               vessel, and     which
surrounds the jar.
    Fig.   3 represents     the apparatus     employed in the large ex
periment, which is similar in its arrangement to the former ;
only that the cold atmosphere round the japanned pail had
no exterior cold mixture to defend it ; which, however, was
the less     necessary,     as the   earthen pan was of considerable
thickness, and had acquired the temperature of the mixture
that had been employed in cooling the 5 lib. of muriat of
lime.
    In experiments of the kind I            have    described,    all the ex
terior   vessels  should be     of earthen-ware or wood, which being
bad conductors         of   heat,   prevent the ingredients from re
ceiving heat from the atmosphere                and   surrounding objects
with the fame facility that they would through metals ; and,
for a similar reason, the interior vessels are best of metal *,
that they may allow the heat to             pass   more readily from the
substance      to be cooled into the frigorific mixture             employed
for that purpose.
    Muriat of lime        is certainly the most powerful,          and at the
fame time the most economical substance                 that can be em
ployed     for producing artificial cold ; for its first cost is a mere
trifle, being a residuum from many chemical processes, as
 the distillation of pure ammonia,                &c.   and   often thrown
 away   :   besides, it may be repeatedly         used for similar experi
 ments, nothing being necessary for this purpose but filtra
 tion and evaporation to bring it to its first state. The eva-

its congelation.

poration should    be carried on       till  the solution becomes         as
thick  as a strong  syrup, and upon cooling the whole will be-
come crystallised : it must then be powdered, put up in dry
bottles, well corked, and covered with bladder or cement, to
prevent liquefaction ; which otherwise would soon take place,
owing to the great affinity the muriat has for moisture.
   The powerful effects produced by the frigorific mixture of
muriat of lime and snow presents a wide field for experiments
to determine the possibility of fixing some of the gases by in
tense cold.     As soon as an opportunity offers,            we mean to
attempt some experiments with that view, of the success of
which the earliest account (hall be sent to the Philosophical
Magazine, for the information             of  those who      are   fond of
such pursuits.

rich individuals, all contiguous, serve to lodge the men of

fine clock by Berthout,            and a    Japan vase of great size.
     I am just now employed in collecting all the curious ani
mals, which I was told were to be found at the houses of
the     Mamalouks.           Our    place     for keeping birds is       already
completed;          and in a little time we shall be better established
than     if  we were in the       Jardln      des Plantcs.     But the greatest
ambition of the members of the Institute is to transmit to
you the first volume of our memoirs, before those of the
 French Institute shall appear.                 We   are labouring      for this
purpose        with   great    assiduity.       You will find two memoirs
of mine, which           I hope will meet with your approbation.
     I  wish to give you some details, particularly in regard to
what      I  have observed in this country ; but too many events
have taken place, and            I  fee so    many things      highly interest
ing to the        philosopher that        I  really am at a loss what to fay
 or where to begin.            I   sliall, therefore, give you an account
 only of      a breakfast    and     dinner in which        I  participated, as
 they will serve to convey some idea of the manners of the
 Egyptians.
     General       Menou,      being provisional commandant of the
province of Rosctta, was desirous of making a tour through
it ; and as there are no inns here, and as he was informed,
besides, that it is customary             for the commandant to accept a
 dinner from the chief of the canton, the general conformed
to     that usage.         We accompanied him,              to the number       of
 fifteen,     and    had   a  guard of twenty          soldiers.    Ninety-six
disties,     all touching each other, and disposed              in the form of
an ellipse,       were served up, on the ground,               which    was   co
vered, however,           with   mats      and carpets.      We   were treated
in    a  high style.       The entertainment did not            consist of  seve
ral services, but, what amounts to the fame thing,                     of several

stories.     The   largest articles were      in dishes   of a  proportion
ate size.      All   these dislies   occupied the lower part          :  they
were of a circular form and made                  of tin,   as in   France.
Three dishes, placed quite close to each other, left an empty
space    in the middle, which was entirely                concealed     by  a
smaller dish.       These dishes contained the dainties, which are
made by the real Egyptian women.                  The company       first at
tacked these     in order    to get rid   of them,   and that they might
have access to the lower range.              These dainties consisted of
 seven or      eight kinds of cheese, molasses baked with flour
paste, fricasses    of  rice arid mutton baked with raisins, prunes,
 figs, grenadillocs, 8cc.
     The   solid  dishes were fowls dressed        with rice, or prepared
 other ways, 8cc.         The ellipsis forming the whole of the ser
 vice was bordered with half a cubical foot of bread of twelve
 kinds and different forms           :   there   were   cakes    of various
 forts, elliptic and circular bread, k.c. he.
     The Cheik invited         us all to squat down around, and we
 soon saw the      Turks in    the company put their hands into the
 dislies, take the liquids in their palms and the solids in their
 fingers, and in that manner convey them to their mouth.
 We    were obliged to do the fame ; for we had neither spoons
  nor forks.
     The dinner, which         we partook      of in  a neighbouring vil
  lage, was not much different from our breakfast, except by
  the absence of milk dislies, and a less variety in the kinds of
  bread. The new dislies were,         a  whole slicep in the middle, and
  various other viands around, either roasted or fried in               a very
  whimsical manner.           1 he principal domestic,       who waited on
  us, crossed the service through           a passage   which he made by
  taking away some of the dislies.           When     he cut up the slieep,
  he divided it into pieces by means of his hands and a knife,
  or broke and tore it without much ceremony, and distributed
  a  part -to each.
      The Cheik who entertained            us at breakfast     had a son 34
   years  of age,   a rich farmer, and, next to his father, the most
                                                                         consi-

considerable     man in the village.          We     wished   this young
man's son to breakfast; with us, and we desired him to place
himself at table    ; but he blustied      as   if we had asked him to
commit a crime.        His father told        us that his child would
never be prevailed     on to   sit  down where his grandfather fat,
and above     all to eat in his presence       :  that the profound re
spect he entertained for his grandfather, made him impose
this on himself as a law.           We then invited         the son to sit
down   ;  but he made the same observations in regard to him
self, and with a religious solemnity which surprised us.               Ge
neral Menou requested the grandfather to order his children
and grand-children       to partake in the entertainment ; and          af
ter some hesitation he agreed, faying, that it was contrary to
custom, but that it gave pleasure to his paternal heart. The
children    obeyed ; but they had an air            of  reserve and timi
dity during the whole time they were eating.                   They made
haste to finish their meal, and          retired speedily according to
the custom of the country, which requires those who have
no appetite to depart.
    After General Menou and his company                 had finished  their
repast, the soldiers came,       in their turn, to feed upon what
we had left.      The  first, and this second company, who con
sisted  of jolly fellows of     a keen     appetite,     ate at most   two
thirds of what had been         served up, after       which the poor of
the village were      invited.      These regaled        themselves with
what remained. They entirely emptied the dishes, for which
they contended, and which            they tore from each other in a
manner that afforded us much amusement.
    These Cheiks behaved with           so  much liberality       only be
cause  they are authorised      by the laws      of the country, when      a
commander in chief takes           a repast   with them, to reimburse
themselves for the expence they have been at,                by an impost
which they levy immediately           ;  and as it is therefore the vil
lage which treats, the inhabitants have a right to partake               in
the feast, and     to eat up what remains on the table             of their
lord.    But   those who actually pay do not participate in the

 entertainment     :    the poor in all countries escape such              assess
 ments, and people who are in                 easy  circumstances disdain to
 go and eat fragments.
    Upon    the whole, the Egyptians in the country are exceed
 ingly miserable      :   so   much       so indeed     that the imagination
 can hardly conceive it.              Would you       believe that the greater
 part of the villages consist almost entirely of earthen huts,
 which are not three feet in height ; that the aperture through
 which    these miserable        creatures enter their kennels is a cir
 cular hole of    a foot and a          half diameter,     and that this hole
 remains always open           ;    that there is no room in these huts,
 but what is necessary for the husband, wife and children, all
 huddled together, to sleep upon ; and that, to enter these
 wretched habitations, they are obliged to creep on all fours ?
 A   place  built up of earth, on which they bake their bread,
 occupies the third of the hut ; two stones to grind corn, a
 coffee-pot to make coffee, and              a bag   containing tobacco, are
 all the furniture        of   these     poor peasants.         They never eat
flesh, but they all drink             coffee in the    morning.        The Turks
 cannot live without coffee and tobacco.                    Besides these, they
seem to be acquainted with                   no wants.       They drink their
 coffee without sugar, and with the grounds:                the more abundant
 the latter arc, so    much the more agreeable it is to their taste.

 w,I T
                       Method for extirpating them.
               H IN      these few years an insect,         before unknown
in this country,         has made      its appearance     in the British or
 chards, which,         if means     are not generally taken to root           it
 out, will in      a  short  period destroy every apple           tree   in the
 kingdom.         It exhibits upon         the   trees the appearance       of  a
white efflorescence,          like what may be sometimes               seen on
 stones    in the fields : this seems, however, to be only the ha
 bitation of the insects, which exist in millions wherever they
 have once lodged themselves.             On bruizing the       efflorescence-
 like    matter between         the singers, a deep red-coloured fluid
 like blood is expressed, and which probably is of that nature.
 Already have         several valuable orchards been            much injured
 by this insect, which corrodes the apple trees in such a man
 ner as at last completely to destroy their organization and
 to   kill them, without        the proprietors, many        of them    at least,
 even     once suspecting        the cause.       We hope what we now
  state  will  be the mean        of making the fact generally known,
  and    of inducing       every    person    interested    to  co-operate in
  rooting them out.
      We    are happy in having it in our power to give them the
  recipe   of a  cheap composition discovered by           William Forsyth,
  Esq. his majesty's gardener at Kensington, which has been

    A   REMARKABLE CASE OF SCROPHULA CURED BY
                                 VITAL AIR.
      Miss Holmer, at 18, an amiable and accomplished young
  lady, the daughter of          a wholesale      ironmonger         in the Bo
 rough *,      so  early  as   at the age     of   seven had the glands         of
 the neck beginning to take on disease.                  First one gland un
 der the ear, then another, and by degrees all the glands
 about the neck became enlarged, and went on gradually in
 creasing.     The   fame disposition      also shewed itself by an affec
 tion of the eyes, for which            this lady was nine months un
 der the care     of Mr. Ware.          During     the progress       of glandu
 lar affection,     she was    under Messrs.        Kent, Fearon, Bayley,
    •This  lady haJ all the benefit of country air;     her father having a house
at  Vauxhall, and keeping his carriage, Ihe had every advantage that fortune
could give her.    Edit.
                                                                              &c.

                       Scropbula cured      by  Vital Air.                    91
tac.    &c.     and  Dr. Saundcrs.         Mercury      was   used externally
and internally         until   the    teeth became      loosened,   bark, and
steel, and soda, or fossil alkali, given in profusion;               but each
practitioner in turn relinquished the case, recommending sea
air, which was had recourse to at sundry times.                             This
young lady was latterly referred to John Hunter, who em
ployed hemlock to an uncommon extent ; and he also, as the
sea air had been before tried without advantage,                   advised the
parents       to do nothing farther,        saying, with his usual blunt-
ness, that it was a cafe            of that nature that whoever would
 undertake the cure would do it only with the                         intent of
 picking their pockets.            When      I first saw the young lady,        I
 observed the glands          of the throat,    even from the nape        of the
 neck,      so enlarged     as to defeat all concealment, and forming
 one apparently hemogeneous mass,                   extended    even over the
 jaw-bones, which could not                 be felt, and suffocation         was
 threatened        by pressure on the wind-pipe.             Her relations ri
  diculed the idea of any farther application                for this   disease  :
  but parental fondness           urged    an enquiry relative to the airs.
  The Rev. Mr. Townfend, rector of                  Pewsey,   author of    a very
  excellent work on physic, the Guide to Health, happened
  to be at my house when the lady arrived. Although he con
  ceived highly       of pneumatic medicine,         as may be   seen through
  out this work,          he told me, that         he must     consider me as
  very bold       if I  could venture to undertake such          a case,   which
  he acknowledged            to exceed     any thing he had ever before
  seen ;     and    Mr. Jones,      an eminent apothecary           in Mount-
  street,     declared,    that  if I  produced     a cure here, all he could
   fay was
                 " that  miracles     had not ceased."        I, however,     was
    not discouraged,         and   the event has proved         that we should
   not, having such new and powerful agents as the airs, rea
   dily give way to despair.
       In   a  month     after commencing          the inhalation     of vital air
    (six quarts daily mixed with thirty of atmospheric), the knot
   of glands began to soften, yielding a little to external pres
    sure  :   by degrees they separated from each other, and thir
                                                                              teen

teen glands could be distinctly made out ; the jaw-bones                                be
came       liberated   ;    and these,         whether     from pressure of the
glands, or imperfect ossification, were bent up a little from
their natural course ; and, not to tire the reader,      shall                    I
finally remark, that in               less   than eight months the decrease
was Jive inches           by measurement           round the neck ! The hands,
which      before were          unusually cold, were comfortably warm
during the whole time the vital air was inhaled,                             and the
appetite        and spirits increased.             Mr. Cruickshank       observed,
that during         the  time of inhaling the superoxygenated air,
the pulse were         raised about six beats in a minute, and be
came stronger.              I   must beg leave to mention here, that                          I
also roused the            absorbents         by both topical as well        as       inter
nal remedies.          But why        I   place such a stress on the power                of
the vital air over this system of vessels,                 is,   that from the ex
periment of         Dr.     Beddoes,          which    he made      upon himself,
while inhaling         a    superoxygenated            air, he became, he ob
serves,     considerably diminished in bulk,                   although he eat
twice as much as before,                  which    I   conceive could only arise
from the superior energy given to the absorbents                       by    the vital
air: — But, however the wife ones,                       past the age    of forty,
may smile at theory, \he.fa£l or cure must remain undoubted,
and   it   is   intended to lay others (many of which are no                            less
remarkable)         in quick succession before              the   impartial tribu*-
nal of the philosophic world.

success, that,         in 1778,       he found himself              in  a condition to

support     public      theses on some very difficult             points of law,
and to receive his licence.
   In    1780      he    made    a tour     through      several      cantons     of
Swisserland       in company with          a  few friends.          The account
of this   short excursion, written in a plain manner, and                    with
out the name of the author, may be found in the third
volume of the collection of travels                 published at Berlin by
M. John Bernoulli.
   The    study    of the law, and       the application he gave to that
branch       of knowledge,          was      not able       to    extinguish     his
geometric spirit hereditary in                 the   family.         The    lesions
which had been given him by his father in his youth, and
which were afterwards continued by his uncle, the cele
brated     Daniel Bernoulli,         had increased his innate and irre
sistible     propensity to        the mathematical               sciences.      His
rapid progress         inspired   him with       the most flattering hopes,
and induced the            heads  of  the university to entrust           him, in
1780, with the            functions of his uncle,           whose age and in
firmities had rendered him incapable, for some time,                       of con
tinuing his lectures            on experimental            philosophy.         Mr.
Bernoulli      discharged      these functions,        till   the death      of his
uncle, to the satisfaction of his auditors and the university ;
but he had not the pleasure of succeeding to the vacant
chair, though his name was inserted in the list of candidates,
because academic places at Bade are determined by lot,                            as
well   as   all the other offices of the republic ; and, on this
occasion, the lot was unfavourable to him,                     a  caprice of for
tune which he had experienced                in 1780, when he stood can
didate for the chair of eloquence,               at that- time vacant.            It
was on this last occasion that he published                  his Theses on the
Sublime.        This double disappointment, joined                    to a strong
desire    of   seeing     the world,      so  natural and         so  powerful in
young men, made              him soon after form a resolution, agree
able to his prevailing taste for travelling, but which seemed
likely,    for  a  little time, to lead him aside from the literary
career he had entered           with   so   much applause ; and he ac-
                                          3                                  cepted

cepted the place       of  secretary to      Count    de Breuner, minister
of   the Imperial    Court of Vienna          to the Republic    of Venice.
     This office furnislied him, indeed, with the wifhed-for op
portunity of travelling, and of feeing successively a great part
of Germany         and  Italy ; but     he could not travel always, and
when he arrived at the place of his destination he became
tired of a manner of life          so  little conformable to his way of
thinking,       and   unfavourable to his taste for study.                 The
society of     a small   number of literary men, and particularly
of    some geometricians       of reputation, with whom he formed
an acquaintance in Italy, and who received him in a manner
suited    to the name he          bore, and to his personal             merit,
rendered       his situation comfortable            for some     time.     The
 friendship of these distinguished characters, among whom
 was the celebrated        Lorgna, gave an         agreeableness    to his re
 sidence     in that country, of which              he long preserved a re
 membrance ; but it could not extinguish the desire of soon
 finding    a  place where he might devote himself entirely to the
 mathematical sciences, and make use of the knowledge he
 had acquired in them,          and     of which he       had   given public
 proofs    in the Memoirs       of    the    Royal Academy of Sciences
  and Belles Leltres        at  Berlin,      and   in  those  of the Royal
  Society of Turin, who           received him among the number of
  their corresponding members, during his residence in the
  latter city.
      The disposition of mind above mentioned having, by
  means of John Bernoulli at Berlin, come to the knowledge
  of his countryman Mr. Fuss, the latter                embraced     a favour
  able opportunity of mentioning him                    to  the princess "of
   Daschkaw      ; and her excellency being already disposed to re
   pair the loss which the Academy of Petersburgh had sus
   tained by the death of Mr. Lexell, found that Mr. Bernoulli,
  independently of his personal               merit,   had   a distinguished
   right to   aspire at a place     in    an academy to      which,    since its
   foundation,      his grandfather         and two grand         uncles    had
   rendered      essential  services.      Bernoulli,    therefore,    received
                                                                             the.

  the vocation of an adjunct, with            a salary of 600 rubles, and
  the promise of being promoted in the            course of a year.         He
  accepted    these offers    with joy,     and   quitted Venice in the
  month of May 1786, taking               the   route  of   Swisserland      to
 revisit   his country and family before he went to Russia,
  where he was to establish himself, in consequence of his en
 gagement, for at least three years.
     Scarcely had he reached         Petersburg when hi9 ruling pas
 sion for travelling, or, what amounts to the fame thing, his
 desire   of acquiring knowledge, made him conceive the idea
 of participating in a sea voyage planned at that time, and for
 the execution of which several vessels, destined to fail under
 the command of       M. Moulouski,        were then fitting out.         Mr.
 Bernoulli     ardently wislied to have       a share  in this expedition
 as astronomer, and conversed           on that subject with the chief
 of   the expedition,     who received the proposal with pleasure,
 and promised       to get the conditions they had agreed on
 sanctioned; but     Mr. Bernoulli's friends induced him, though
 with   great difficulty,   to renounce a voyage          the   fatigues    of
 which     his weak    and    delicate constitution       could not have
 supported.
    Having    abandoned      this plan, which had given him much
pain and uneasiness, he applied himself with the whole acti
 vity of his foul to physical mathematics.             He laboured with
 great diligence, and surpassed so much the hopes conceived
of him by      the academy, that, before the expiration               of the
time fixed in his agreement,          he found himself honoured with
the title of ordinary academician.               In the short space of
little more than two years, he presented and read eight me
moirs, inserted in the     six first  volumes of the Nova       Ada Aca
demics Scientiarum Impcrialis Petropolilame,               which      display
great penetration, a precise         and acute     mind,    a solid  judge
ment, and much more address in the management of analy
tical formulæ than could have             been expected       from    a geo
meter    so  young, according to appearance,             in  the secret     of
analysis and the resources      of calculation.

He   engaged,      among other things,          to make for         the   use  of
that corps an extract from          Mr. Euler's Algebra           ; but death
prevented     him from commencing that work.
   In  1789    Mr. Bernoulli married          the youngest       daughter of
Mr. John Albert Euler.            1 his marriage, which promised to
the young couple durable felicity,               and     which     united two
names equally dear lo the sciences, and respectable in the re
public    of letters, was    dissolved,    two months after it was            so
lemnised, by the tragical death              of   the   husband, who was
carried off by a stroke of the apoplexy on the 3d of July
the fame year. A residence in the country, and the conve
nience of bathing every day in the Neva, had made him re
sume a taste for that practice and the exercise                of swimming,
which is    so  salutary, but    so  often fatal.       He   was well accus
tomed to the art, and consequently had no fear                      of any un
lucky accident      ; but whether he had             neglected to dip his
head   first,  or   had  bathed    too   soon    after   dinner, during the
operation     of  digestion,  which     to  him    was    difficult, or whe
ther the germ of the malady had been already in his consti
tution, iie suddenly became insensible and motionless ; and
though he was almost          immediately drawn out by his bro
ther-in-law,      and   though all the usual methods were tried,
assistance was      useless, and    the physicians         unanimously de
clared that he       had    been   struck with       a stroke   of   the   apo
plexy.     It  has    been already     observed,       that   Mr. Bernoulli
was of   a  weak and delicate constitution.              In the autumn of
the year 1787 he was attacked by a nervous fever, which
exposed his life to great danger.              He, however, recovered ;
and it is to be presumed that his constitution would have
been establislied,      and that it would have been able to resist
the severity of the climate         of   Russia,    if "Providence     had not

academy in the 29th year of his age.
   To an open, free, and tractable disposition, Mr. Bernoulli
joined much modesty and mildness — qualities which pro
 cured him the friendship and esteem of all those with whom
he was acquainted,           and   which justified,    as much     as his
learning, the deep regret occasioned by his premature death.

   X HE public sitting of this      society on the 1st    of Frimaire,
 VII.   Year,   was opened      by C. Lallemand, president, who
 read a discourse on the utility of medical correspondence for
 preserving purity of principles in the art of healing, and on
 the most advantageous       method of teaching it.
    C. Mandel,     professor  of therapeutics and pharmacy, read
 a dissertation  on iron.     The author explained the different
 states  in which it is found naturally ; those which           may be
 given to  it by art ; and    the services which it has rendered
 to mankind by its magnetic properties, particularly          in regard
 to the mariner's compass,      and its power     of attracting light
 ning and conducting it to any place         required. He demon
strated the affinity of this metal with oxygen, the cause of
its so easily uniting with saline substances, and of its speedy
oxydation by air and water, and of its solution in the latter
vehicle which it decomposes.           He then      proceeded    to the
action  of iron on the animal economy,             and took a view    of
the speedy cures which it effects      ; and the accidents, on the
other hand, which it has occasioned             to some   individuals,
even when the dose was weak.           This   led him to propose the
following very interesting question, Whether the iron which
exists materially and formally in our humours, and above all in
the blood, might not be considered,        on account of its natural
                                 H 4                           increase

increase and           diminution,              as   the cause        of    a great       number of
diseases       ?    And    he mentioned chlorosis as one                             of    those molt
ikely to conduct              to a satisfactory                 result.
  He mentioned                the new system (quoting                       Dr. Rollo), which
holds that the greater or                   less     quantity of oxvgen in the blood
is the cause of various diseases.          Without denying this prin
ciple, he           combated the application made of it by Dr. Rollo
to certain diseases,              particularly            chlorosis, which he imputes
to a privation            of oxygen         ;    to restore        which, he recommend*
metallic oxyds as being proper to furnish oxygen. C. Man-
del asserts that this disease is destroyed by medicines capable
of carrying off oxygen,                       of introducing it into the
                                                instead
system     :       that it is cured by iron which has undergone no other
preparation than a great division of its parts ; from which
he concludes, that not disoxygenation, but rather deferrugi-
nation, ought to be assigned                         as the       determining cause.
  The author next pointed out                             the different medical cases in
which iron, or preparations of                            it,   ought to be administered             ;
and then examined the question whether                                      the magnet ought
to be admitted among the means                      of medical cure, or entirely

the partisans             and antagonists            of this mineral             :   he combated
from experience               the opinion of the latter, and sliewed that
there was nothing              less     doubtful than that the iron contained
in the blood, though                   in   a    state   of oxyd, cannot                  be attracted
by the loadstone.                 In    the last place,              he concluded, without
admitting            all the wonders ascribed to                          it,   that this mineral
ought to be retained               among the curative means.

    The National Institute of the Ligurian Republic was in
 stalled on the 24th of Brumaire, 7th year, by the directory
 of that republic.        It consists of sixty members, thirty-six of
 whom are resident; and thirty-six               associates, inhabitants     of
 the republic.       They form two        classes, each    of which is    sub
 divided into three sections.
     The   first class is that    of  the    Mathematical       and Physical
 Sciences;      the three sections of which are:           1st,  Agriculture,
 commerce         and manufactures;           2d, The nautical        science,
  mathematics,        physics   and natural history;          3d, Chemistry,
  botany, anatomy, medicine and surgery.
     The     second class comprehends Philosophy, Literature,               and
  the Fine     Arts.    Its  sections   are as follows      :  isi, The art of
  reasoning; and analysis of the operations of the human un
  derstanding, grammar,            eloquence     and poetry ; ad, Political
  sciences,    history and antiquities ; 3d, The art of design.

      Since our last report, (Vol.            II.  p. 327) Papers on the
   following subjects      have been read to the Society.
       One on the methods of finding               the latitude by double
   observations, which         contained several curious calculations
   and useful tables.        This paper, which occupied almost the
   whole of two evenings, is of such a nature that our limits
   will not allow our giving any account of it,
                                                                       A  paper

     A  paper  containing meteorological observations           made at
  Constantinople,      and   some    curious   information    respecting
  the plague which      so often   causes dreadful   devastation    in the
  Eastern countries.      The remarks brought forward on this
  subject go to establish       the fact, that the infection is only
 caught by contact either of a diseased person, or of articles
 that have been in contact with the infected.
     A  paper on the natural history of the elephant,            by  John
 Corse, Esq. author of the article on the same subject               given
 in a preceding part of the present number of oufr work.
 This paper, which contains a great variety of curious infor
 mation,    excited   much attention.        His  observations    are the
 result  of many   years residence in     India.   By them it appears
 that the accounts of the sagacity,         modesty and size of the
 elephant have been greatly exaggerated by natural historians.
 The female, when brought forth, is about 35 inches high ;
 when full grown, from 7 to 8 feet. A full grown male is 8
 or 9 feet high, measured        at the moulder as the height         of a
 horse is taken.

    On Thursday      the 14th    of Feburary, an Eolopile of great
 antiquity, made of brass,        and which had been dug up in
making the Basingstock canal, was presented to this Society
by Mr. Fry the letter-founder.               The form is singular:
instead   of being globular with       a bent tube, it is in the form
of   a grotesque    human     figure.    The   blast  comes    from it*
mouth.      The only thing similar we have ever met with in
this country is the eolopile called Jack of Hilton, mentioned
in Plott's History of Staffordsturc.

                               ANTIdUITIES.
    MEN of letters,         artists, and those fond           of antiquities and
numismatics, had long regretted, that the                     rich collections of
medals and gems in            possession     of the royal family of          Prussia
were scattered and preserved              in different places.            "The late
king, who       approved      of  a plan presented           to  him for uniting
all these collections in the capital, caused to be brought thi
ther, towards the close of his reign, and deposited in hisowfi
cabinet, the beautiful collection of ancient and modern me
dals, crown-pieces,          &c. which the margraves                   had formed
at Anspach,       and to which he           made      considerable additions.
To complete        the execution      of the     above plan,       it however still
remained to add to the cabinet of Berlin the grand collec
tion of ancient medals and gems preserved at Potsdam. This
valuable collection, made by Frederick I. and described by
that celebrated         antiquarian        Beger*, was enriched               after
wards by Frederick           II.  who purchased            the antique medals
of Pfau,     and    the magnificent cabinet              of   gems    of Baron     de
Hosch, almost unique of                 its    kind.      This collection was
 brought to the capital in 1770, and placed by Frederick                          II.
in the Temple of Antiques             at Sans Souci, where           it long  served
 for the noble amusement              of that      great man, who was fond
of being surrounded by master-pieces of                        every art, and by

 the last ventral.        The two former         are   of  an order different

body to the other, and         are joined by branches            which form
a very    beautiful tissue when injected.           The ventral and dor
sal vessels   do not form a tissue       of the like kind.        They only
throw out branches disposed alternately in an oblique direc
tion, and subdivided        in the usual manner.             The    second is
placed     exactly under the medullary cord              of the ganglions,

    M. Hammer, conductor           general     of the    diocese   of Agger-
huus in Norway, who left all his property to the Royal
Norwegian       Academy of Sciences, endowed also              a foundation,
which      has been   confirmed by his Danish Majesty,                 and in
consequence      of which    a part  of   the money bequeathed is to
be laid out in printing        his manuscripts, and for purchasing
natural curiosities, the productions of Norway. Another part
is to be employed in defraying the expence               of travels through
Norway,      and the following      districts are in particular to be
explored:     Neiden,    Powig,     Peisen,     Nordsieldet, the White
Sea,    and Dvinaan,      the most remarkable natural              objects of
which must be described.          These travels are to be conducted
on the plan proposed by Linnæus in the Norwegian House-
bold Calendar,       All remarkable objects and antiquities are
to be illustrated with maps and drawings,                 and the journals
of   the different travellers    will   be inserted among the papers
of  the society.

    On   the evening     of Frimairc 16th, C. Bouvard, astronomer
 belonging to the Observatory al Paris, discovered             a comet iri
 the constellation of Hercules.          At half after six next morn
 ing,  its right   ascension   Was    248^ degrees, and its northern
 declination 31^.        It had advanced 43 minutes per hour
towards the east, and 38 towards the south.                  It was small
 and difficult to be seen.       It forms the 89th, according       to the
 catalogue, in De Lalande's Astronomy.

    Michael Szekely,       overseer    of mines   to  Count Schonbom
 at St. Nicholas, near Munkats in Hungary, has manufac
 tured a kind of cloth from the swallow-wort (asclcpias vince-
 iBxicum) interwoven with silk.          A specimen of this new pro
 duction,    consisting   of  6 1  German    ells, was presented to the
magistrates     of  Ofven   for  inspection.     The first manufactur
ing of it     cost about 7 or 8 shillings        sterling, but in future
 the fame quantity will cost only           3   or 4 (hillings.    It wa»

   Nearly   at the     fame   time that Messrs. Pepys and Alien
were    engaged     in the interesting experiments, of which we
have given an      account in the preceding pages, Mr. Walker
of Oxford     was also employed. in producing frigorific mixtures.
For this   purpose,    he used the same materials         in  the follow
ing proportions      : 4 parts of the crystallised      muriat of lime,
pulverised,    to 3 parts     of uncompressed dry snow. On the
4th   instant,   having, by means of a previous mixture, re
duced his materials to 40 below on, on mixing the cooled
ingredients, they gave       a  temperature of      - 630 or 950 below
the freezing point of water. We believe the experiment
was only on a small scale.           We have not learnt what sub
stances,   or whether any, were exposed by              Mr. Walker      10

                               MINERALOGY.
    A  lode   * of   silver,    tolerably rich,  has lately been disco
vered in the      Ilurland Mine, formerly called the Old Manor
Mine, in Gwinear parish in the county of Cornwall, which
they are now working,             and which, judging from present ap
pearances,     we should expect       would turn out of great national
benefit,    if we   were not aware        of the  strong prejudices and
great ignorance       of  the Cornisti miners     in general.
    If we   may credit the testimony of foreigners, the poorest
mine in Cornwall          is worked at a greater       expence    tljan the
richest on the Continent.             How can it     be otherwise, while
the present system, disgraceful to the age in            which   we live, is
allowed to continue, without any attempts being made either
to alter or improve           it? We (hall hardly       be credited    when
we   state  that, in many places, the proprietors are never per
mitted to have a section of their mine             :  yet such is literally
the fact.      It would     be incroaching upon the province          of the
Captain of     the  Mine     ! who is sole monarch        of the subterra
nean legions, and guides all their operations.
    From this man the owners must be content to receive the
only accounts       they can obtain of the         state  of their works j
nor can they possibly help themselves,               or interfere in the

direction.
    When it      is known that this is the        state  of management,
our readers,      though they may regret the circumstance, will
 not be surprised       to hear that the      Wherry-mine       near Pen-
zance, one of the most curious in ihe world              f,  and in   which
 we   lately announced that cobalt had been found, has been
discontinued working,            and the sliaft been closed up.        Have
we not reason to fear that this mine, so rich in tin and cobalt,
 has fallen a disgraceful sacrifice         to the   ignorance in the art
of mining,        which     so    shamefully prevails    in this county     ?
 While     science is excluded, what can be expected            ?

    The French Government           have lately taken the slate         of
 the mines in France      into their consideration, established         a
 school    of mineralogy under     the auspices     of the minister of
 the interior, and are now devising means for propagating in
 struction relative to that important branch of industry. — The
 state  of the mines in this country calls loudly on our Govern
 ment to endeavour to devise some mean               of improvement.
 The   loss that results to the community         from the prevailing
 ignorance    of the operative   people    employed in them is ab
 solutely incalculable.      How happy        should   we feel,    if our
 well-meant     hint  should   have the effect to make the matter
 be taken up by those who have influence sufficient to accom
 plish the object   !

I.    Account of a remarkable Fiery Eruption from the Earth,
     in Iceland, In the Year 1783.   By S. M. Holm, S.S.
     Theol. Cand.
 JL HE following account is taken from a small work
written by Mr. Holm, a clergyman, and published in the
Danish language          at Copenhagen,         with     two charts.         The
author fays, in his preface,, that he was born in the island
in the year 1750, and lived there till the year 1774; that
he had himself seen all the places mentioned in                     it,   and had
since kept up an         uninterrupted        epistolary    correspondence
with his countrymen,            from whom he received the particu
lars   of   the devastation    occasioned     by   this singular disaster.
     On     the   isi of June    1783,     several violent sliocks          of an
earthquake were felt in various parts of Iceland                  ;   and these
shocks      afterwards   increased       to such   a   degree, that, on the
11th of the same month, the inhabitants                    were     obliged to
desert their habitations and to live in the open air.                      About
the fame time smoke and vapour were                  seen to rise   alternately
from the earth in the wild districts towards the-north,                        in
the neighbourhood             of Sidu,      Landbrot,      Medalland         and
     Vol. III.                       I                                Alptaver.

114            Account of a Fiery Eruption in Iceland.
Alptaver.        After this three columns of fire were observed,
the most        northern     of which first made its appearance.
When       first seen, they flamed up separately            ;   but they after
wards united and           rose   to such a       height that they could be
perceived       at the distance        of thirty-four miles, when the
flame was not covered by thick vapour.
     Iceland is bordered        by  a  long chain of mountains, which
are    all exceedingly high            and    always covered          with snow.
The     largest    and   highest      of  these is the      Klofa-Joekul, in
which the principal            and     best known       rivers of the island
formerly had their sources.              Among        these mountains there
are also four volcanoes,         the   Skaptar-Jœkul, theSula, Trœlla-
dyngia, and         the Oerœfa-Jœkul, the last of which is the
most violent.         They    at first throw out water, and then sire.
There are several of the same kind in the island                        ; but the
well known Hecla throws out only sire.
     On    the   8th of June the bright flames                  of the before-
mentioned        column      could be clearly distinguished.                 They
were     accompanied with          a  violent and incessant            eruption of
sand, sulphureous dust, ashes, large pumice stones, and most
dreadful explosions.            A    furious wind, which             prevailed   at
the fame time, silled the atmosphere                 in such    a  manner with
sand and sulphureous vapour, that people could not fee either
to read or        to write     even at noon.           The    asties   and scoriae
which fell back from           the atmosphere         were red hot.         There
 fell at the same time         a  kind of filth      as black    as   ink, which
 seemed as it were        hairy,      having sometimes          the appearance
 of   small balls, and sometimes           of wreaths or rings.
     On   the   nth    the fiery    column, which had vanished for                a
 little, again made its appearance,                 and   could be distinctly
 seen   at the distance     of thirty or forty miles.            Its thundering
 noise    could be heard         at the     same distance,        and continued
 throughout        the   whole summer.             The    above      column    was
 accompanied the fame day by               a very    violent rain, which oc
 casioned infinite damage ; because the water,                 in many places,
 swept off whole pieces           of the     soil  and carried them with it
                                                                               into

into the deep gulphs.            The water of this rain            was at the samri
time      so sharp and    acrid, on account              of the many         saline and
sulphureous particles which it contained, that it occasioned
severe     pain in the hands and feet where it fell.
     The    places in the neighbourhood                   of this column          were at
the fame time exposed to violent cold, snow, and hail                               of   art
uncommon magnitude; but,                    as the   column extended farther^
these were succeeded by a scorching and almost unsufferable
heat, and       the sun appeared             like    a    red globe.         This     heat
continued for several days without interruption,                        and returned
several times      in succession.            All    those places to          which this
destructive     column extended were, by the showers of stones
and ashes that        accompanied            it,   deprived    of all their          grafs
and every other plant           ;    so   that the inhabitants were reduced
to great      distress,   and       their cattle were frequently killed on
the spot.       In many        places      every vegetable         production            was
as   it   were covered      by   a   hard crust,         from the continual sul
phureous evaporation.                                                                 /
     When this      fiery eruption first broke out,                the river Skapta
was swelled up in an uncommon manner, and                          a    like overflow
ing was observed in several other rivers.                          On    the       nth       or*
June       the Skapta suddenly            disappeared,       and    became         totally
dry in the course of twenty-four hours.                       Its bed was situated
in   a    gulley called Skaptar-Gliufur, which extends four miles
northwards        through        the      highest rocks,       and      is   above       2oo
fathoms deep.             In this monstrous gulley                 there     arose,      the
second day aster the Skapta was dried up,                          a    dreadful and
tmdescribable fiery lake, which gradually increased                                  till   it
overflowed       the banks and filled all the neighbouring places
whether high          or low, the most exalted                  summits only ex
cepted.        Having inundated             the farm       of Buland,        it    covered
not only the adjacent fields and hedges,                       but also the houses
and the church,           though the farm            is   situated on    a   high rock.
Towards the        east   it   extended      six miles        in breadth       ;    its ex
tent towards the west was also considerable                         j      but towards

 the south       its progress had been checked by lofty moun
 tains.
    Thus      swelled and towering          up into huge waves it endea
 voured on all      sides to   procure a passage, which, by its con
 tinually pressing forwards, it at length effected, towards the
 south    in a valley between            the    mountains.      '1 hrough this
opening it rushed with incredible violence and force, like
the most terrible cataract, into the plain on the south, over
which it rolled, amidst            strong concussions       of   the earth and
awful thunder and             explosions     in the atmosphere,        earning
 before it stones,      rocks and small eminences.               This flaming
lake boiled        and foamed       in  a  dreadful manner with melted
stones, iron, and other substances capable                of being liquefied;
some    of   the ignited rocks and stones, as large as whales and
houses,      were    seen    swimming on its surface,          or driving      up
and down.
    In  the mean time smoke and vapour arose from the earth,
both in the neighbourhood                 of this    fiery  lake   and  in    the
more remote          districts.     All    these   appearances       continued
incessantly      both day and night            from the iath of June till
the   1 2th    of August.       The    lake still spread itself in the open
plains,     but with     less  impetuosity than before.            The boiling
and foaming,         however, continued until it at length began
to settle, and to form itself into a solid body.                      In many
places     it was found        to  have     been   70, and in others 140
fathoms in depth.            When it threw itself with violence into
the bed of any river, the water which it displaced overflowed
all the adjacent lands, and still added to the devastation and
distress it occasioned.          Seventeen farms were burnt by the
fiery stream,       and    four swept entirely away by the water,
besides a great many others which were destroyed                      by light
ning    and the large stones that fell from the atmosphere                  ;   so
that their inhabitants were reduced to poverty, and obliged
to wander about begging for relief.                 Three large rivers, the
before-mentioned            Skapta, the Hlverfisfliot,        and the   Steinf-

myrarfliot,        besides eight smaller                  ones, were found entirely
dried up.
     On the       1 6th     of August the             fiery    lake    began      to    cease
spreading        farther.           Wherever it proceeded it had burnt and
destroyed        houses,       -   churches,    villages, fields,           meadows      and
forests.        Among          the    places    destroyed were many abound
ing with excellent herbs, such                    as the      elymus arenarius, and
medicinal plants           ;       the want of which was              a great    and irre
parable     loss to the            island.
   This fiery eruption, however, did not                        yet cease, but con
tinued to rage with fury till October in                        the     middle parts of
the island, where vapour, flames,                          thunder and concussions
of   the earth were in succession observed among the cold and
extensive        mountains.             In   the first     half of November little
change had taken place                  ;    but the flames began gradually to
burn up with more brightness, which was considered as a
sign that the inflammable matter was now nearly exhausted,
and that the flame would be extinguished ; especially as it
had before assumed a variety of colours, such as green, blue
and the like,        according to the difference of the substances
by which it had been nourished.
   When the eruption first took place, the wholeatmosphere
of the island was so filled with smoke, vapour and dust, that
the sun had entirely a red appearance.         neighbour         In     the
hood of the mountains it was perfectly dark at noon ; and
the cold in the night time, -considering the                                warmth of th^
season, was very sensible.                     Where       the atmosphere         was dry,
the   sire made        the air highly oppressive                 ;    but where moist,
such severe winter cold was                    produced in            it,    that the grafs,
plants, and          cattle         were     almost   destroyed.            The cows     gave
scarcely an eighth part                 of   the usual quantity             of milk ;   and   a
four-year-old          wether,          which      before      would have had ten
 pounds of fat, had now only two, and was                               so   weak     as to be
 scarcely       able to stand.

bodies of the cattle.           Their hoofs      became white ; their hair
fell off; and they were covered all over with pustules and
ulcers. The meadows also suffered severely ; and the cattle
which      had    endeavoured        to pick up the few scanty remains
of  grafs    that had been left, might                be seen lying dead on
them in heaps.            Many      others     were   destroyed     by hunger;
and it was only         a few   that were      saved   by the means of hay.
The    cattle    in general       were     so stunned,     sometimes       by the
dreadful explosions of the thunder, and the incessant roaring
and    sire   in    the    atmosphere,        that- they ran into         marshy
places, threw themselves               over     precipices,   or even rustied
jnto the flames.
   These uncommon                phenomena were no             less   destructive
to the inhabitants.             Many, in particular old             people,   and
those whose        lungs were weak, could with difficulty breathe
On account of the sulphureous stench and vapour proceeding
from the flames.            Many     also who enjoyed good health were
reduced to a         state   of illness  ;   and   many would have been
suffocated     had     not moderate          showers     of rain, which fell
sometimes, cooled and refreshed the atmosphere.
   Besides these circumstances which took place                      in Iceland,
many other phenomena worthy of notice occurred in the
neighbourhood.             A   new island was thrown up in a part of
the   sea   where, according to the account of experienced sea
men, the water before had been about a hundred fathoms
in depth, Its distance from Iceland was sixteen, and from
Bird Island eight miles. In the month of August it threw
up bright flames         ;  and it continued          to burn     till February
 1784.      Later accounts         state   that towards the end of the
 year it threw up           a large     column of fire intermixed            with
 sand.     This    island was about         half   a mile   in circumference,
 and its height appeared to be equal to                 that of the mountain
 LTian.
    Towards the north-west,              nearer     to Iceland     than the old
 eastern gulph       of Greenland,          lies another very high island,
 Jarger than the former; which, according to the latest                        ac

  tember the 14th, in which                   it is said that a violent north
  wind from the        sea had     brought over to the northern coast of
  Iceland     abundance of           ashes,      with    a strong     sulphureous
  smell; and this phenomenon continued the whole summer.
     The    effects  of   these remarkable phenomena seem to have
  extended      also to other countries.              At    the   time when the
  before mentioned acrid rain prevailed in Iceland, an uncom
  monly sharp and penetrating rain of the like kind fell at
 Dronthcim         and     other parts          of Norway.          In the Feroe
 islands    this rain burnt          as  it were the leaves of the trees,
 and    the    grafs    on    the fields       had    a   blackish    appearance.
 When the wind blew from                     the   N.W.       great quantities    of
 ashes,    sand and       sulphureous vapour             fell   in these islands,
 though they are eighty miles distant from                     Iceland;    and the
 fails and decks          of    several    ships,    while     on their     passage
  between     Copenhagen and Iceland, were covered with black
 sandy dust.        Even in Zealand and at Copenhagen the sun,
 from the beginning of June till the 8th of August, seemed
 remarkably red ; and throughout the whole month of                            July
 the atmosphere         was    so filled with dust and vapour, that the
 fun could not be           seen   in the evening after eight or nine
 o'clock.      Even at noon the fun was red, and this was ob
 served in the night-time            to be the cafe with           the moon and
 the   stars.      The      learned     Professor      Kratzenstein      said  that
 these phenomena             must    proceed       from     a  fiery  eruption in
 Iceland ; which was the more remarkable as Iceland lies at
 the distance of almost 300 miles from Copenhagen, towards
-the   north-west.          Others     said     they arose       from   the   great
heats     which     frequently happened, and particularly                   on the
37U1 and 29th
                      of July, and the 5th of August,                   The earth

or grafs,          and    the leaves even withered on the trees.                                A
whitish           grey   kind    of    dust       was seen to fall             towards the
ground        ;    and the fields      in       the    night were often overspread
with     a blueish mist,           which was accompanied with                       a   certain
pale fiery brightness and                   a   sulphureous smell.              During the
nights when this fog prevailed, little or no dew fell. Phe
nomena of the fame kind were observed in Germany,
.Holland,          and other countries.

                   the regular course of that luminary,
                                                                  of   the variations     of

year, would produce the same weather in the same seasons.
The principal variations of                       the weather,            however, depend
upon some other cause                    not          so    uniform,      the discovery         of
which     has long given employment to philosophers                                 ;    and as
we find that the motion of the                         sea seems to have an         intimate
connection           with    the      motion of the moon, it has                        thence
been believed, that the latter acts                         a   principal part, not only in
this phenomenon of the flux                           and       reflux, but that it could
not produce these variations on the earth, without having,
at the fame              time,   a considerable                 influence on the atmo
sphere.           The difference of             the fluids which compose                it,   and,
above all, the great elasticity                  of    the air, can alter this effect,
but not entirely destroy it.
  It     is   well known that no philosopher has yet been able,
from mere theory, to form any proper conclusion respecting
these variations of the weather. To supply this deficiency,
M.    Toaldo called in the aid of experience, and                                  compared
the   state       of the   atmosphere           with        the situation     of   the moon,
\vhere    its activity           appeared             to be strongest         and weakest.

Prom     observations       made      at Padua on this subject, during
the course      of fifty    years,     he at length found that good and
bad weather have been              always determined by certain situa
tions of the moon         ; and    this circumstance furnished him the
means of foretelling, with some degree of certainty, the                        state
of the   atmosphere        by the situation of that luminary deduced
from astronomical calculations.                He      distinguisties   ten situa
tions of the moon, each of which is capable of producing a
sensible effect on our atmosphere ; and, in order to compre
hend these, it must be observed, that the motion of the moon
has three different relations, from which there arise the same
number of revolutions, and that each of these has                          a parti
cular duration, and at the fame time certain situations, as
 expressed in the following            table :

  IJ4                         Toaldo's System
    The   situations    of the moon    which   have a relation to the
 synodical revolution, are well known.            It may, however, be
 remarked, that new and full moon are called the syzigies, and
 the first and last quarter the quadratures.              '1 he perigeum
 and apogeum are comprehended under the term apsides.
    On account of      the difference   in the periods of these three
 revolutions, the situations of the moon do not return in the
 fame order,   till after a long series   of years;    and in the differ
ence of their coincidence, connected with the regular effect
of the fun    at each season, lies the cause    of   the different varia
tions of the weather.          The following       are the rules        which
M.   Toaldo has deduced from his observations.
    The probabilities that the weather will change at               a  certain
period of the moon are in the following proportions                  :
           New moon                                   -   6    :  I

           Southern lunistice                         - 3     :   i
    That   is to lay, a person may bet six to one, that the new
moon will bring with it        a change of weather. Each situation
of the moon       alters that state   of  the atmosphere         which     has
been    occasioned     by the preceding one     ;   and  it  seldom hap
pens that any change         in the weather    takes    place without a
change in the lunar situations.           These situations are com
bined, on account of the inequality of their revolutions, and
the greatest effect is produced by the union of the syzigies
with the apsides. The proportions of their power to prof
duce variations      are as follows ;
                                                                         tfeiy

    The combination           of  these situations     generally occasions
storms    and tempests      ;   and this perturbing power         will always
have the greater      effect, the nearer these combined situations
are to the moon's         passage    over   the equator, particularly          in
the months of March and September.                   At  the new and full
moons, in the months of March and September, and even
at the solstices,    especially     the winter solstice, the atmosphere
assumes a certain character,            by which it is distinguished for
three,    and, sometimes, six months.             The new moons which
produce no change in the weather, are those that happen at
a distance from the apsides.
    As it  is perfectly true that each situation          of the moon        al
ters that state    of   the atmosphere         which has been produced
by another, it is however observed               that many situations of
the moon are favourable to good and others to bad weather.
Those belonging to the latter class are : the perigeum, new
and full moon,      passage      of the equator, and the northern            lu-
nistice.     Those belonging to the former are             :  the apogeum,
quadratures, and the southern               lunistice.   Changes        of   the
weather seldom take place on the very days of the moon's
situations, but either precede or follow them.                    It has been
found by observation, that the changes effected by the lunar
 situations in the fix winter months             precede,    and in the fix
 summer months follow them.
     Besides the lunar situations to           which the     above observa
 tions refer, attention must be paid also to the fourth day be
 fore new and full moon, which are called the octants.                        At
 these times the weather is inclined to changes                ; and it may
 be easily seen, that these         will follow  at the next lunar situa
 tion.     Virgil calls this fourth       day a very sure prophet.        If on
 that day the horns of the moon are clear and well defined,
                                                                            good.

104                                   ToaUo's System
good weather may be expected ; but                       if they     are dull, and not
clearly marked on the edges, it is a sign that bad weather
will ensue. When the weather remains unchanged on the
fourth,       fifth and sixth day of the moon, we may conjecture
that it will continue            so    till full moon, even sometimes till the
next new moon            ;    and     in that    cafe the     lunar situations have
only a very weak effect.                     Many      observers      of nature      have
also remarked, that the approach                       of    the    lunar situations i»
somewhat critical for the sick.
                   Conjectures          on the    Periods of Rain.
  The rising       and setting          of   the moon, as well as its superior
and inferior passage            of    the meridian,         mav serve     as a   rule for
foretelling the times               of rain.      M.    Toaldo calls these situa
tions the moon's angles.
  The times        most exposed to rain are the rising and settinc;
those most favourable to good weather, the passage                                 of the
meridian.         It    has     been     remarked that, during rainy days,
bad weither            is always a little         interrupted        about the       time
when the moon                 pastes    the meridian.          We must, however,
make an exception to this rule as often as the angle                               of the
moon does not coincide with that of the fun.                              As     these ob
servations      may beverv easily made, by means of astronomical
tables,       in which the angles of the moon and fun are marked,
they are exceedingly well calculated to prove the truth                                  of
this system. No one, for instance, will refuse assent to                                 it,
when the daily changes                    correspond         with   the   angles   of   the
moon     and when, independently of the effects of the moon's
          ;
situation, the horizontal effect of the moon at rising and
setting   is   different from that produced by its                    passage     over the
meridian.
   It   rains oftener in the day time than, in the night, and
oftener in the evening than in the morning.
      Influence    of   the Moon         in   regard    to   extraordinary Years.
   Pad years take place when the apsides of the niooa fall in

                    respecting Changes      of Weather.                  12,5
the four cardinal points          of  the    zodiac.      Their intervals,
therefore,     are as   4 to 5, 8 to 9, &c. or as the intervals of
the   passage   of the  apsides through the four cardinal points of
the zodiac. Thus the year 1777 was, in general, a bad year;
and in that year the apsides of the moon were in the equi
noctial signs ; and it is probable that the years in which the
apsides fall in the signs Taurus,     Leo, Virgo       and   Aquarius, will
be good' and       moderate    years,  as   the year     1776 really was ;
and in that year the apsides        of the moon      were in Taurus and
 Virgo.
    Every eighteenth year must be similar.                  We, however,
can not depend         upon a return altogether the fame,            on ac
 count of the three different revolutions of the moon                  ; and
 therefore   it may happen, that the epoch of this extraordinary
 year may be retarded a year or perhaps two.                   Though ap
proximations only are here given, this does not prevent their
being useful to farmers, if they only pay attention to circum
 stances.     Besides, various exceptions must be made for dif
 ferent parts     of  the earth ; and      it is difficult to determine
 these beforehand, as what regards this system is applicable to
 the whole globe;        but when the result of the system has been
 improved bv local observations,              the   conjectures for each
 country will be attended with more certainty.
     The fifty-fourth year      must have a greater similarity to the
 first than to all the rest ; because,          at this period, the situa
 tions of the moon, in regard to the fun and the earth, are
 again found in the fame points.
     The quantity of       the  rain which falls in nine successive
 years is almost equal to that which falls            in  the next follow
 ing nine.      But this is not    the cafe when we compare in like
 manner the quantity of rain which falls in six, eight or ten
 years.
                 Effecls  of the Moon     on the Barometer.
     The variations of the barometer         are so intimately connected
 with   changes     of the weather, that      there   is reason to suppose
 that the moon has some influence on the               state  of that instru
                                                                        ment.

 merit.    For the   sake of more certainty, however, M. To-*
 aldo compared a diary of the state of the barometer, kept
 for many years, with the situations of the moon, and found
 the following result    :  ist, That   the barometer at the time        of
 the moon's apogeum rises the sixth part of           a  line higher than
 at the perigeum ; 2d, that at the time          of the quadratures it
 stands a tenth   of line higher than at the time of the fyzi-
                      a
 gies ; and 3d, that it is a fourth of a line higher at the south
 ern lunistice than the northern.
    Thus far the comparison of the moon's fituati6ns with the
state of the barometer agrees perfectly with meteorological
observations.     This, however,       is not the cafe at the time      of
 the moon's passage through her equinoctial points               ; for the
heights of the barometer are then greater, chiefly when she
passes in Libra : a circumstance which is contrary to meteo
rological observations, since these situations of the moon in
dicate bad weather.         It must, however, be remarked, that
in this contradiction      the indications   of  the moon's situations
are more to be depended         on than those of the barometer.
    It has a like connection with the coincidence            of the equi
noctial    point  and    the perigeum, which          also gives heights
considerably greater.        The union of      these points, however,
is a sign of great irregularity.          It must here be remarked
that, according to De Luc, the rapid movement of the baro
meter indicates    a storm     of short duration,    and that in such a
case, even when     it  rises,  bad weather is likely to follow.
    M.  Toaldo   fays,    that the Europeans, when they first vi
sited   Mexico, found       a singular custom       prevalent in that
country.    When     a  new emperor was chosen, he was obliged
to swear    that, during his government,            rain should fall ac
cording to the pleasure of his subjects        ;  that no inundations
should be occasioned,        and that the fields should not be ren
dered   unfruitful, 8cc.      The multitude imagine that the me
teorologist enters   into an obligation of the like kind ; but all
that can be expected from him is confined merely to conjec
tural rules respecting changes of the weather          ;   and even these

by local causes in different districts.
III.     On the present          State       of Surgery in Turkey.               From
  A     Survey of      the    Turkish Empire.               By W. Eton, Esq.
A T might           reasonably    be expected          that a nation of warriors
should       have    expert     surgeons       at least, and that they should
have     paid attention to the improvements                         and    discoveries
made by other nations.        Nothing of this, however, is the
cafe.        They perform no operations, nor will they consent to
an European's making an amputation, though the loss                             of life
be a certain consequence               of omitting it.           Their    art is simply
confined       to    healing,    and     at most        extracting a ball and            a
splinter of a bone.  It must he confessed that, as their habit
of body is generally healthy, nature performs often wonder
ful cures.    They rely much on balsams, mummy, &c.
There is in Constantinople             Persian extraordinary expert in
                                         a
the art of healing.             The Arabs bury a person, who has re
ceived a wound          in his body, up to the neck in hot sand for
twenty-four          hours ; and apply with success the actual cau
tery for the dropsy.
  I     saw    in    the    eastern    parts    of the empire            a method      of
setting bones practised,              which    appears to me worthy            of the
attention of surgeons             in Europe.            It is by inclosing the
broken limb, after the bones are put in their places,                             in   a
cafe    of   plaster   of Paris (or gypsum) which takes exactly the
form of the         limb, without any pressure, and in a few minutes
the mass is solid and strong.                  If   it be   a   compound fracture,
the place where the wound                is,
                               and out of which an exfoliated
bone     to come, may be left uncovered, without any injury
        is
to the strength of the plaster encasement.                          This    substance
may be easily cut with            a    knife, and removed, and replaced
                                                                                 with

with another.                If,     when the swelling subsides, the cavity                         is
too large for the                 limb,    ahole or holes being left, liquid
gypsum                           in, which will perfectly fill
             plaster may be poured
up the void, and exactly fit the limb. A hole may be made
at first by placing an oiled cork or bit of wood against any
part where        it    isrequired; and when the plaster   set,               is               is   to
                        There                                                          if it
be removed.                      nothing in gypsum injurious,
                                      is                                                   it       be
free from lime          ;    it    will    soon become very dry and light, and
the limb may            be bathed with spirits,                   which will          penetrate
through the covering.                      Spirits may be used instead of water,
or mixed with                it      (or vinegar)          at the first making           of the
plaster.
 I     saw   a   case    of      a   most terrible compound                fracture     of the.
leg and thigh,               by   the fall of       a    cannon,     cured in this man
ner.       The    person was seated on the ground,                          and the plaster
case extended from below his heel to the upper part                                      of his
thigh, whence                a    bandage,          fastened     into the plaster,         went
round his body.                   He reclined back when                    he slept,      as    he
could not lie down.                        During the cure, where they                         saw
matter or moisture appear through the plaster coating, they
cut   hole with
      a           knife to dress the wound, or let out the
                             a
matter more freely.
     On this     occasion         I    cannot help mentioning the treatment
of   parts frozen            in   Russia,      not       by   the surgeons,     but      by     the
common people,                   the success of which            I   was an eye-witness
to in several cases, as well as to the failure of the common
mode of treating frozen parts                            by   the most able surgeons                of
the army.        I      sliall simply          state     the facts   I   relate to.
     After Ochakof was taken,                  I        received into my subterranean
lodging as many prisoners                      as   it   would contain, all of whom
were either wounded or had                          a   limb frozen.        Among them
were two children,                   one about six and the other about four
teen years       of    age   ;       the latter had one of her feet frozen to
the ancle, the other all the toes and the sole of one of
her feet. The second day the parts appeared black, (the first
day they were not much observed.)      The French surgeon,
                                                                                        whom

whom       Prince Potemkin            had sent for purposely         from Paris,
and who was           a man of note, ordered them to be constantly
bathed     with warm camphorated                 spirits   : the  elder   was   re
moved       to    the hospital, when a mortification                 began;    the
younger       I   kept,    and as we removed              into winter quarters,
I   carried the child          along with me.              The mortified parts
separated,       the    bones     of    the toes came off,          and, after     a.
considerable time, the fores healed.                    I  should have said, the
surgeon was for immediately amputating both the limbs.
    In a subterranean room, not far from mine, were several
women        whose       feet had been        in  a like manner frozen;        but
 as  no surgeon attended them, the Ruffian soldiers and wag
 goners undertook the cure.                    It was also the second day
 when they applied their remedy, and the parts were per
fectly black.          This remedy          was    goose-grease,     with which
 the parts were         smeared       warm,      and the operation often re
peated    :  their directions were, never to let the parts be dry,
 but always covered with grease.                 The     consequence     was, that
by degrees the circulation               extended       lower down,       and   the
 blackness      decreased,      till,  last  of all,   the toes were only dis
 coloured, and at length circulation was restored to them.
     I can account for this no otherwise, than that the fat kept
 the pores shut, and prevented               the air from promoting         putre
 faction;     in   the meantime the vessels               were   continually   ab
 sorbing part of the stagnated blood, till by degrees the whole
•circulation was restored.              It is known that extravasated and
 stagnated      blood will remain a long time in the body with
 out putrifying,        if  it  be not exposed to the air.             I conclude
 also, that in these        cases   of frost, the mortification       first begins
 on the surface, which is in contact with the arr.
     I only meant, however, to relate facts, and leave it to
 others to account for them.
     This   is a general practice          of the     peasants throughout        all
 Russia ; but        if a part is discovered         to be frozen,       before the
person comes into a warm room,                  the frost may be extracted
 by plunging the part into cold water, or rubbing it with
 snow till the circulation returns,

      .AVING         now related, partly from my own knowledge,
and partly from comparing the accounts given by different
people employed         in this business,              the manner in which the
male elephants, called Goondahs, are secured;                                I   shall next,
entirely from my own knowledge,                            describe    the methods            I
have    seen   employed for securing                  a herd  of wild elephants.
Female elephants are never taken                       singly, but always in the
herd, which consists of young and old of both sexes.                                    This
noble, docile, and useful animal, seems naturally of a social
disposition,   herd in general consists of from about 40 to
                as a
100, and is conducted under the direction of one of the
oldest and largest females,                 called the Palmai, and one                of   the
largest males.         When        a    herd is discovered,      about 500 peo
ple are employed to surround                   it,   who divide themselves into
small parties, called             Chokeys,           consisting       generally of one
Mahotc       and two Coolies, at the distance                    of twenty or thirty
yards from each other, and form an                         irregular circle in which
the elephants arc inclosed              :   each party lights         a    sire and    clear*
a   foot-path to the station that              is    next him,        by   which   a   regu
lar communication            is   soon formed through the whole cir
cumference from one to the other.                          By this path reinforce
ments can immediately be brought to any place where an
alarm   is   given;    and   it    is   also necessary for the superintend-
ants, who are .always going round to                        fee that       the people are
alert upon their posts.             The       first circle (the Dawkce)                being
thus formed, the remaining part of the day and night                                        is
spent in keeping watch                 by   turns, or in cooking for them
selves and     companions.               Early next morning                 one man         is
detached     from each station,               to form another circle in that
direction where they wish the elephants to advance.                                 When
                                                                                           it

                   Method of Catching               Wild   'Elephants.                    151
it   is finished,      the people        stationed       nearest to the new circle
put out their fires and file off to the right and left, to form
the advanced party, thus leaving an opening for the herd to
advance through ; and by this movement, both the old and
new circle are joined              and        form an oblong.              The         people
from      behind now begin shouting and making                            a noise        with
their rattles, tomtoms,                 &c.     to cause the elephants to ad-
Vance ; and as soon as they are got                      within     the     new circle,
the people close up, take their proper stations,                           and pass the
remaining          part of the day and night                  as    before.           In the
morning the           fame process is repeated ; and                In this manner
the herd advances slowly in that direction                          where they find
themselves         least incommoded               by the noise and clamour of
the hunters, feeding,       they go along, upon branches of
                                   as
trees,    leaves of bamboos, &c. which come in their way.
If they        suspected any snare,           they could easily break through
the circle; but this inoffensive animal, going merely in quest
of food,       and not seeing any         of    the people who surround                 him,
and who are concealed              by the        thick jungle,      advances           with
out suspicion,         and appears only to avoid               being pestered by
their noise and din.              As     sire    is the thing       elephants           seem
most afraid        of in their wild             state, and   will    seldom           venture
near     it,   the hunters always have               a   number of        sires   lighted,
and particularly at night,                        the elephants coming
                                         to prevent
too near,         as well as      to cook their victuals and keep them
warm.           The   sentinels   supply these fires with fuel, especially
green bamboos,   which are generally at hand, and which,
by the crackling and loud report they make, together with
the noise       of the watchmen,          deter the elephants from coming
near;     that the herd generally remains at
           so                                  distance near         a
the centre of the circle.  Should they at any time advance,
the alarm    given, and all the people immediately make

noise and use their          rattles      to make them keep at                    a   greater
distance.         In this manner they               are gradually brought to the
Keddah, or place where they are to be secured,                              As        the na

 bring the herd       above   one circle in a day, except       on as
 emergency, when they exert themselves and advance two
 circles.    They have no tents or covering but the thick
 woods, which, during the day, keep off the rays of the fun;
 and at night they sleep by the fires they have lighted, upon
  mats spread on the ground, wrapt up in a piece of coarse
 .Cloth.    The season is then so mild that the people continue
  very healthy ; and an accident seldom happens except to
  stragglers about the outskirts of the wood, who are some
  times, though very rarely, carried off by tigers.         The Ked-
  dah, or place where the herd is to be secured, is differently
  constructed in different places ; here it consists of three en
  closures, communicating with each other by means of nar
  row openings or gateways.         The outer enclosure, or    the one
  next to the place       where the elephants are to enter,      is the
  largest; the middle one is generally, though not always,
  the next in size; and the third, or furthermost, is the smallest.
  These proportions, however, are not always adhered to in
   the making of a Keddah, nor indeed does there appear to
   me any reason for making three enclosures : but as my in
  tentions are merely to relate facts, I shall proceed to observe,
  that when in the third or last enclosure,        the elephants are
   then only deemed secure       ; here   they are kept six or eight
   days, and are regularly though scantily fed from a scaffold
   on the outside, close to the entrance of an outlet called the
   Roomee,     which is about sixty feet long       and   very narrow,
   and through which the elephants are to          be taken out one
    by one.    In many     places this mode is not adopted ; for, as
    soon as the herd has been       surrounded   by  a strong  palisade,
    Koomkees are sent in with proper people, who tie them on
    the spot, in the fame manner as was mentioned above of
    the Goondahs,      or male elephants, that are taken singly.
    These enclosures     are all pretty strong ; but the third is the
    strongest,  nor are the elephants deemed       secure,   as already
    observed,  till they  have entered it.    This enclosure   has, like
    the other two, a pretty deep ditch on the inside ; and, upon
                                     <S                               the

              Method of CatclAng        Wild Elephants.                133
the bank of earth, that is thrown up from the excavation, a
row of strong       palisades    of middle-sized     trees    is planted,
strengthened     with cross bars, which are tied to them about
the distance    of fourteen inches from        each other;      and these
are supported     on the outside      by strong  posts like buttresses,
having one end funk in the earth and the other pressing
against the cross bars      to   which    they are fastened.        When
the herd is brought near to the first enclosure,            or Baigcote,
which     has two gateways      towards the jungle, from which the
elephants are to advance,         (these, as well as the other gate
ways, are disguised with branches of trees and bamboos
 stuck in the ground so as to give them the appearance of a
 natural jungle,) the greatest difficulty is to get the herd to
 enter the first or outer enclosure; for, notwithstanding the
 precautions taken to disguise both the entries            as  well  as the
palisade     which surrounds this        enclosure,    the    Palmai,    or
leader, now appears to suspect some snare, from the difficulty
and hesitation with whiclt in general she           passes  into it  ; but,
as soon as     slie enters, the whole herd implicitly follows.
 Immediately, when they are all          passed the   gateway, fires are
 lighted round the greatest part of the enclosure,           and particu
 larly at the entries, to prevent the elephants from returning.
 The hunters from without             then make     a  terrible noise by
 shouting, beating of tomtoms (a kind of drum), firing blunt
 cartridges, &c. to urge the herd on to the next enclosure.
 The elephants, finding      themselves ensnared, scream and make
 a noise ; but, seeing      no opening except the entrance to the
 next enclosure, and which they at first generally avoid, they
 return to the place through which they lately             passed,   think
 ing perhaps     to escape,    but now find it strongly barricaded ;
 and   as  there is no ditch at this place,      the hunters,       to pre
 vent their coming near and forcing their way, keep a line of
 fire constantly burning all along where the ditch is inter
 rupted, and supply it with fuel from the top of the palisade ;
 and the people from without            make a noise,       shouting and
                                   ,K3                          hallooing,

hallooing, to drive them away. Whenever they turn, they
find themselves opposed by burning fires, or bundles of reeds
and dried grafs, which are thrust through the opening                              of the
palisades,   except towards the entrance of the second enclo
sure, or Doobraze-cote.           After traversing the Baigcote for
some time,     and      finding no chance of escaping but through,
the gateway into the next enclosure, the leader enters, and
the rest follow : the gate is instantly sliut by people who
are stationed on a small scaffold immediately above-    and                       it,
strongly barricaded, fires are                  lighted,       and    the    fame       dis
cordant din made and continued,                       till the herd         has    passed
through another gateway into the last enclosure, or Rajecote,

                            is
former     was.The elephants, being now completely sur
rounded on all sides, and perceiving no outlet through which
they can escape, appear desperate, and in their fur)- advance
frequently to the ditch           in
                          order to break down the palisade,
inflating their trunks, screaming louder and shriller than any
trumpet,     sometimes         grumbling         like the hollow murmur of
dift.mt thunder    ;      but wherever they make an attack, they
are opposed       by   lighted fires,      and      by    the noise and triumph
ant shouts of the hunters.                As they        must remain some time
in this enclosure, care           is   always taken to have part                  of the
ditch silled with water, which                 is   supplied     by   a   small stream,
either natural, or conducted through an artificial                             channel
from some neighbouring              reservoir.            The elephants       have re
course to this water to quench                  their thirst and cool them
                                       it by   sucking the water into their
selves after their fatigues,
trunks, and then squirting                 over every part           of their bodies.
While they remain in this                 enclosure,        they continue sulky,
and seem to meditate              their    escape    ;    but the hunters build
huts, and form an encampment                         as   it   were around them,
close to the palisade      ;     watchmen are placed, and even' pre
caution used to prevent their breaking through.                              This they
would soon effect,        if   left to themselves,             notwithstanding the
                                                                               palisade

              Method of Catching          Wild    Elephants'.              135
palisade is made     of  very strong stakes funk into the earth on
the outside of the ditch, and strengthened              by cross bars and
buttresses as already      mentioned.
    When the     herd has continued a few days             in the Keddah,
the door of the Roomec is opened,               into which some one          of
the elephants is enticed to enter,            by having food thrown
first before,  and then gradually further on into the passage,
till the elephant has advanced           far enough to admit of the
gate's being stiut. Above this wickcr-gate, or door, two men
arc stationed on    a small scaffold,      who throw down the food.
When      the elephant has passed         beyond the door, they give
the signal to a man who from without shuts it by                   pulling    a
string, and    they secure it by throwing two bars that stood
 perpendicular on each side, the one across the other thus                  X,
forming the figure        of St. Andrew's         Cross  ;   and   then two
similar bars are thrown           across each other behind the door
next to the Keddah,        so  that the door is in the centre            :  for
farther security, horizontal           bars   are     pushed     across    the
Roomce, through the          openings of     the palisades,     both before
 and behind those crosses,         to prevent      the   possibility of the
 door's being broken.         The Roomec       is  so narrow that a large
 elephant cannot turn in        it; but   as soon as he hears the noiso
that is made in (hutting the gate, he retreats backwards,
and endeavours to force it : being now secured in the man
ner already noticed, his efforts are unavailing.                Finding his
retreat thus cut off,      he advances and exerts his utmost force
to break down the         bars,   which were        previously put across
a little farther on in the outlet, by running                against   them,
screaming and roaring, and            battering them, like        a  ram, by
 repeated   blows of his head,         retreating and advancing           with
 the utmost    fury.     In his    rage he     rises and leaps upon the
bars with his fore-feet, and strives to break them down                   with
 his huge weight.       In February      1788 a large      female elephant
rlropt down dead in the Roomee, from the violent exertions
 she made.      When the elephant is somewhat                    fatigued    by

                                 An Account of the
these      exertions,         strong ropes
                                           * with running                   nooses      are
placed in the outlet by the hunters                 ;   and as soon as he puts
a foot     within      the noose,    it   is immediately drawn               tight and
fastened to the palisades.            When all his         feet have been made
pretty fast, two men place                   themselves       behind some bars
that run across the Roomee to prevent his kicking them,
and with great caution tie his hind-legs together, by passing
a cord alternately from the one to the other, like the figure
8, and then fastening these turns                as above described.                After
this the Pharah, Dools, &c.                  are put on in succession,             in   the
same manner as on the Goondah,                      only that here the people
are   in   greater security.         While      these ropes are making fast,
the other hunters are careful not to go too near, but keep on
the outside of the palisade, and divert his attention                         as    much
as they can from those employed                 in fastening them, by sup
plying him with grass, and                 sometimes with plantain-leaves
and sugar-canes, of which he is remarkably fond, by pre
senting a stick, giving him hopes of catching or  gently           it,        by
striking or tickling his proboscis.                 He frequently, however,
seizes      the ropes with          his trunk, and endeavours                 to break
them,       particularly those        with which his          feet are tied, and
sometimes tries to bite them through with his grinders (as
he has no incisors or front teeth) but the hunters then goad
                                                ;
him with          sharpened      bamboos, or light spears,             so   as to    make
him quit his hold.                Those who are employed               in   putting the
ropes around his body, and over his head, stand above                                him,
on    a    small kind         of platform,    consisting      of   a   few bars run
across       through          the openings of the palisades            ;     and as an
elephant cannot fee any thing that                       is   above,        and rather
behind his head,                they are very little incommoded                 by   him,
although he appears to smell them, and endeavours to catch
them with his trunk.   When the whole apparatus       pro                          is
perly secured,           the ends of the two cables                (Dools)          which

end       of the Roomee, where two female                    elephants       are wait
ing ; and to them these cables are made fast.                         When        every
thing is ready, the door at the end of the outlet is opened,
the cross bars are removed,               and the passage left clear.              The
ropes         that lied his legs to the palisades            are loosened,        and,
if    he does not advance            readily, they goad him with long
poles sharpened           at the ends or pointed         with iron,          and urge
him on with their           noise and din,         and at the same time the
females pull him gently forward                :   as   soon as he has cleared
the Roomee, his conductors separate;                    so    that   if he    attempts
to go to one side, he is prevented                 by the elephant that pulls
in the         opposite   direction,   and vice versa.               TheBundahs
which tie his hind           legs,   though but loosely,             yet prevent    his
going fast; and, thus situated, he is conducted like an en
raged bull, that has a cord fastened to his horns on each
fide, so that          he cannot         turn either to the right or left to
avenge himself.             In like manner         is this noble animal led to
the next tree, as the Goondahs before                          mentioned          were.
Sometimes he becomes obstinate, and will not advance ;                                    in,
which cafe, while one of his conductors draws him for
 ward, the other comes                behind and pushes him on should         :
he lie down,            (he puts     her snout under and raises him up,
 supporting him on her knee, and with her head pushing him
 forward with all her strength; the hunters likewise assist                              by
 goading him, and urging him forward                           by    their noise and
 din      ;   sometimes they are even obliged to put lighted torches
 near, in order to make him advance.    In conducting small
 elephants from the Roomee, only one cable and one Koomkee
 are made use of. As soon as each elephant     secured, he           is                   is
 left in charge to the Mahote, or keeper, who appointed to           is
 attend and instruct him and, under him, there are from
                                     ;
 two to five Coolies, according to the size of the elephant, in
 order to assist and to supply food and water, till he becomes
     so   tractable as to bring the former himself.                       These people
 erect        a   small hut immediately before him, where the Mahote,

 138                         An Account of the
 or one of the Coolies, constantly attends, supplies him with
 food, and soothes and caresses him by a variety of little arts.
 Sometimes the Mahote threatens and even goads him with
 a long stick pointed with iron, but more generally coaxes
 and flatters him, scratching his head and trunk with a long
 bamboo      split   at one end       into many pieces,         and     driving
away the flies from any fores occasioned                  by the     hurts and
bruises he got by his efforts             to escape from the          Roomee.
This animal's skin is          soft, considering his great size; is ex
tremely sensible, and is easily cut or pierced, more              so  than the
flrin of most large quadrupeds.              The Mahote likewise          keeps
him cool, by squirting water all over him, and standing with
out the reach        of his trunk : in a few days he advances
cautiously to his side, and strokes and pats him with his
hand,     speaking     to him     all the while in     a  soothing tone of
voice, and in      a little time he begins to know his keeper and
obey his commands.                Bv    degrees    the   Mahote       becomes
familiar to him, and at length gets upon his back from one
of the tame elephants, and,              as  the   animal becomes         more
tractable, he advances gradually forward, towards his head,
till at last he is permitted to feat himself on his neck, from
which    place    he afterwards regulates         and directs all his mo
tions.     While they       are training      in this manner,        the tame
elephants lead out the others in turn, for the fake of exer
cise, and likewise        to ease    their legs     from the cords with
which they      are tied, and       which    are apt   to gall them most
terribly    unless    they are regularly flacked and             shifted.    In
five  or six weeks         the   elephant becomes           obedient to      his
keeper, his fetters are taken off by degrees, and generally in
about five or fix months he suffers himself to be conducted
by the Mahote         from one place to another           :  care,   however,
Is always    taken not to let        him   approach    his former haunts,
Jest a recollection       of the    freedom     he there     enjoyed should
induce him again to recover his liberty.                 This obedience       to
his conductor        seems to proceed          partly from a fense      of  ge~
¦erosity,    as  it is in   some measure voluntary ; for, whenever
                                                                             au

                    Method       of Catching Wild Elephants.                      139
   an elephant takes fright,              or is determined to run away, all
   the exertions         of the Mahote cannot prevent him, even by
   beating or digging the pointed iron hook into his head, with
   which     he     directs him        ;  on such an occasion           the   animal
  seems to disregard             these feeble       efforts,  otherwise he would
  shake or pull him off with his trunk, and dash                     him in   pieces.
  Accidents of this kind happen almost every year, especially
  to those Mahotes who attend the large Goondahs ; but such
  accidents are in general owing                    entirely to their own care
  lessness   and neglect.            It is  necessary to treat the males         with
  much greater            severity than the females, to keep                them    in
  awe ; but it is too common a practice among the Mahotes,
  either to be negligent in using proper measures to render
  their elephants docile, or to trust too much to their good
 nature before            they are thoroughly acquainted with their
 dispositions.           The iron hook, with which they direct him,
 is pretty heavy, about sixteen inches long, with a straight
 spike advancing a little beyond the curve of the hook, so
 that altogether it is exactly like that which ferrymen or
 boatmen        use fastened to a         long pole.
     In this account of the process for catching and taming
 elephants, I have used the masculine gender to avoid cir
 cumlocution,            as  both males and females             are treated   in  the
 fame manner           :   the former are        seldom      so  docile, but, like
 the males of other animals, are fiercer, stronger, and more
 untractable than the females.
     Before    I conclude,        it may be proper to observe, that young
 elephants        fuck      constantly with their mouths, and never
 with their trunks*,              as  Buffon has asserted;        a conclusion he
 made     merely from conjecture,                and     the great    and    various
 uses to   which         they are well adapted            and    applied by every
 elephant.

                                                                             I have

 140             Method     of Catching Wild Elephants        .
    I  have seen young ones from one day to three years                   old
sucking their dams, but never saw them use their trunks,
except to press the breast, which, by natural instinct, they
seemed to know would make the milk flow more readily.
The mode of connection between the male and                       female    is
aow     ascertained     beyond the possibility of         a doubt  ;  as Mr.
Buller, Lieut. Hawkins, and many others, saw a male copu
late with a female, after they were secured in the Keddah,
in   a manner exactly similar to the conjunction              of the    horse
with     a mare.
    This fact entirely overturns what           has been so often related
 concerning the supposed delicacy of this useful animal, and
 a variety      of other     hypotheses,   which      are equally void      of
 foundation.         As far  as   I know,  the exact time an elephant
 goes    with young,      has not yet been ascertained,          but which
 cannot be        less  than two years,       as one     of the elephants
 brought      forth a young one twenty-one             months     and three
 days after      ssie  was taken.       She was observed        to be    with
 young      in April or May 1788,          and    she   was only taken in
 January preceding ; so that it is very likely she must have
 had connection with the male some months before ssie was
 secured,    otherwise they could not discover that she was with
 young,      as a fcetus    of  less  than fix months       cannot well be
 supposed      to make any alteration         in the    size or ssiape   of  so
 large an animal.          The young one,        a male, was produced
 October      1 6th,   1789, and appeared in even' respect to have
  arrived at its full time.          Mr. Harris, to whom it belongs,
  examined its mouth           a  few days after it was brought forth,
  and found that one of its grinders on each side had partly
  cut the gum.         It is now alive and well, and begins          to chew
  a little grafs.
     I  have further      to remark,     that one of the tusks         of the
  young elephant has made its appearance ; so that we can
  now ascertain it to be of that species called Mucknah, the
  tusk*   of which      are always small,      and point nearly straight
                                                                downwards.

                     Observations  on the Negroes,                    141
downwards.         He was thirty-five inches high at his birth,
and is   now thirty-nine ; so that he has grown four inches in
nearly   as many months.        Elephants are always measured at
the shoulder ; for the arch or curve        of the back, of young
ones    particularly,    is considerably higher     than      any other
part, and it is a sure sign of old age whenever this curve is
found flattened or considerably depressed, after an elephant
has once attained his full growth.
     Though     these remarks,    as well    as several others in the
Above relation,       do not come      within the plan I proposed,
 which    was merely to describe      the method of taking wild ele
 phants in the province of Tipura, yet          I hope they will not
 be deemed      impertinent    or superfluous, especially       as several
 •f them tend to establish        some important       facts   in the na
 tural history of this animal,         that are not known,          or not
 attended to, at least in any accounts that           I   had an oppor
 tunity of seeing.

  JL/URING          a tour  which   I  made through       Swisserland,     I
  saw  in the picture-gallery at Pommersfeld sour negro heads
  by Vandyk, two of which in particular had the lines of
  the face so regular that the features seemed very little dif
  ferent from the European.        At that time,   as   I  had never had
  an opportunity      of acquiring   a proper knowledge respecting
  the form     of the negro  head and cranium, by studying nature,
  and   as   I  remembered that       Mr. Camper, in         a dissertation
   read in the Academy       of Painting   at Amsterdam,        had men
   tioned that the    greater part of the  most eminent painters, and
   especially Rubens, Vandyk and Jordaens, when they painted
   Moors, copied from Europeans, whose faces had been blackr
   ened   for that purpose,     I ascribed the European         look of the
                                                                      above

above     negro heads to this common            fault.    Some month*
after,   however,     I  had an opportunity      of convincing myself
 that there are real negroes whose features correspond very
nearly with those of the Europeans, and that the above
heads    in the gallery of Pommersfeld might           be a true repre
sentation of nature.
    Going     to paya   vifitatYverdun     to the two brothers      Trey-
torrens, one of whom, the chevalier, had been thirty-five
years in the French service, particularly at St. Domingo; and
the other, by means of the opportunities which his brother
enjoyed, had a collection of natural curiosities that contained
many rare articles, when         I entered  the court of their elegant
 habitation, which is situated on the road to Goumoens,           I saw no
person to shew me into the house, except a woman          of an agreeable
figure, who was standing with her back towards me.                 When
ihe turned round        to give me an answer,     I was  much surprised
to find that (he was a female negro, whose face perfectly cor
responded       with her figure, and fully justified the fidelity of
likeness in Vandyk's negro heads, which I had seen at Pom
mersfeld.        All the features of her face, even the nose and
lips, the latter of which were a little thick, though not so
 as to be disagreeable,        had they been covered with a white
 skin, must have excited universal admiration.              At the same
 time    stie  was not only exceedingly lively, and           possessed   a
 found understanding ; but, as I afterwards learned, was ex
 tremely well informed and expert in the obstetric art. The
 handsome pretty negress of Yverdun             is celebrated     far and
 near as the best midwife         in the  Italian part of Swisserland.
 I was informed        by her master,    the chevalier, who has in
 his  service also a negro man as elegantly formed as a statue,
 that slie was a creole from St. Domingo           ; that both her pa
 rents were natives of Congo, but not          so black as the neoroes
 of Senegal.
    Since that period      I  have had an opportunity      of feeing and
 conversing with many negroes,            and have     procured for my
 collection     a great  many anatomical preparations from negro
    ,  .                                                           bodies,

    bodies, which, together with what                          I       in different

    voyages,       tend more and more to                  convince me of the truth
¦
    of   the two following propositions                   :
          That between one negro and another there is as much
         1.
    (if not more) difference in the colour, and particularly in the
    lineaments of the face, as between many real negroes, and
    other varieties of the human species.
         3. That the negroes, in regard                        to their mental faculties
    and capacity, are not inferior to the rest                         of the human race.

    ford,     by   the very striking gradation                with which the linea
    ments      pass   from the one to the               other, very evident proof of
                                                                   a
    the first proposition. One of them, which    Mr. Michaelis was
    so   good as to        bring me from New-York, and of which                                      I
    have given an accurate description in another place                                   *,    is   dis
    tinguished    suchby projecting upper jaw-bone, that,
                                      a                                                         if   the
    same      peculiarity         belonged to all negroes, one might                                  be
    tempted to suppose that they had another first parent than
    Adam.          On      the    other hand, the lineaments of the third
    have      so   little of the exotic form, and are                      so      different from
    the first,      that   if
                            I      had not dissected the whole head perfectly
    entire, and just as            it     was when cut from the body,                    I     should
    be in doubt whether                 I      ought to consider         it   as   having actu
    ally belonged to             a      real    negro.        The      second      holds      a   mean
    rank between both, and in its whole form has                                    a   great like
    ness to the head             of   the Abyssinian Abbas Gregorius,                          a   good
    engraving of which                    by   Heiss, in 1691, from                a   painting       by
    Von Sand,         I    have         now before        me,       and    which          not only
    proves in general                 the close affinity of the Abyffinians                        with
    the negroes,           but approaches              much        nearer to the ugly ne
    groes, to speak according to the European ideas of beauty,
    than the well-formed negress of Yverdun, or the handsome
    young negro whose head                     I   dissected as before mentioned,                      or
    than      a    thousand       others whose            features        are little          different
    from those of the Europeans.                         What       I     have         here    said    is
    indeed nothing               else     than     a   confirmation           of   a    truth long

travellers, as will appear                         by the following quotations.  Le
Maire, in his Voyage                           to Cape         Verd, Senegal, and Gam
bia     *,   fays    :
                          " Blackness              excepted,       there are female negroes
as well made as our ladies                          in Europe." Leguat, in his well-
known Voyages                 t,    tells us, that he found at Batavia several
very pretty negresses, whose                            faces had the perfect European
form.         Adanson, in his Account of Senegal                                         %,    speaking            of
the female negroes there, has the following                                            passage       :

still farther to confirm            the truth           of Professor Blumenbach's                   proposition       :
"   Almost all the negroes              are   of   a   good stature, and the Akra negroes have
remarkably       fine features.          The       contour of the face, indeed, among the ge
nerality of these people,               is    different from that of the Europeans                       ;   but at
the fame time faces are found                      among     them which, excepting                       the black
colour, would in Europe                  be considered as beautiful.                    In    common,        how»
ever, they have something apish.                       The   cheek-bones              and chin project very
much    ;    and the bones of the nose are smaller than among the Europeans.'
This    last circumstance has probably                   given rife to the assertion, that the ne*
gro women           flatten    the noses          of their children         as soon as        they are           born.
But     noses may be          seen among some            of them       as much elevated aud as                     re
gular    as those        of the Europeans.              Their   hair   is   woolly, curled and black,
but sometimes red.              When continually                combed,         it   may be brought to the
length of half yard but  a never can be kept smooth.

      The   testimonies      and examples which serve to prove the
 truth of the second proposition, respecting                 the mental facul
 ties, natural talents and ingenuity               of  the negroes, are equally
 numerous and incontrovertible.                   Their astonishing memo
 ries, their great activity, and their acuteness in trade, parti
 cularly with gold dust, against which the most experienced
 European        merchant cannot be too much on his guard, are
 all circumstances        so  well known,         that it is not necessary to
 enlarge on them*.               The great aptitude of the slaves for
 learning every kind of nice handicraft is equally well known;
 and the cafe is the fame in regard to their                    musical talents^
 as we have instances of negroes playing the violin in so mas
 terly a manner, that they gained so much money as enabled
 them to purchase their liberty f.
      Of the poetical genius of the negroes instances are known
 among both sexes.            A   female negro,         who was      a poetess,      is
 mentioned by Haller            ; and a specimen of the Latin Poetry
 of Francis Williams, a negro, may be found in the History
 of Jamaica. The interesting letters of Ignatius Sancho, a
 negro, are well known              ;  and    the two following            instances
 will    serve as a farther proof       of the capacity and         talents    of our
 black      brethren, in regard          to literature and science.               The
 protestant      clergyman       J. J.    Eliza Capitein       was a negro ; a
 man of considerable          learning, and a great orator.                I  have  in
 my     possession   an excellent print        of him     engraved       by Tanje,
 after    P. Vahdyk.        Our worthy        professor     Hollman, when he
was at Wittenberg, conferred the degree of Doctor of Phi-
    '* Barbot,  in his Description of the Coasts of Nonh and South Guinea, to
 be   found in the fifth volume of Churchhill's Collection, relates           many in
teresting things on this subject.     Thus   he fays, p. 235.  "The     blacks are for
the most part men of fense and wit enough,           of a sharp ready apprehension,
and an     excellent   memory beyond what        is  easy to imagine;     for,  though
thsy can neither read nor write, they are           always regular    in the greatest
hurry of    business  and trade, and seldom in confusion."

   one of which, in particular, displays extensive                                  and   well-di
   gested reading          of    the best physiological works                       of  the time.
   Of the uncommon knowledge which many                                     negroes have had
   in the practice of medicine,                      very favourable testimony has
   been given by Boerhaave and                       De Haen, who               were certainly
   competent judges             ;   and the sound skill and delicate expert-
   ness   of the Yverdun               accoucheuse          are,     as already said, cele
   brated throughout the whole neighbourhood.

   4. Limits and causes of their extraordinary inundations.
   5. Whether they are navigable, and to what distance

   6. The nature, purity, and salubrity of their waters.
   7.   The nature of     the sand or mud which they carry along

 to     lakes, it is not necessary to make them the subject of                   a
 separate chapter.           I  shall insist only on their nature and the
 measure       of their   depth ; on the temperature           of their bottom
  compared with          that at their surface in different seasons         ;  and
  also on the vestiges of their extent and height in the remotest
  ages, compared with their present state.

                   Observations      to be made on the     Plains.
        1.   The extent, limits and inclination of a plain; its
   height above the level of the sea; its relation with the hills
   or mountains by which it is bordered.                    To form      a proper
   idea     of it  as a whole, it would be necessary to ascend some
   eminence commanding                a  view over it.
        2. The vegetable         earth    ; its  nature and thickness      in dif
    ferent parts, compared with the time since it has been culti
    vated, with       its productions,        and the kind o      culture.     The

contain shells, and of what kinds; extent of their beds, and
their thickness ; analysis of them, at least with acetous acid ;
the uses for which the marl is employed.
    7.   Clay-pits; quarries of lime-stone, gypsum;                   mines of
coal, &c.

in the interior     parts of   the earth, vestiges      of marine bodies,
petrified wood, bones or other substances foreign to the soil
and to the country.
    9. Internal temperature of the earth, ascertained either by
direct experiments, or by observing that of the deepest wells
or cellars   ;  or by that of springs, which do not freeze in win
ter, and which remaining cool in summer, seem to come
from the greatest depths.
    10.   Whether any      fact can be observed which might oblige
us to have recourse to the hypothesis             of  a central sire.
     11. Basons     surrounded      by hills     or mountains;         whether
 they   seem   to have been formerly silled with water              ;  whether
the water appears to have been fresh or salt; whether any
 thing indicates the period of its retreat, and              if  there arc any
 traces   of the apertures    through which it escaped.

     1.  The nature     and size     of  those found in        any particular
 district.
     2.  To examine,       above     all, whether there is any kind
 which may be considered          as peculiar to that district, or which
 may be proper to characterise            it ;  or even, whether the ab
 sence    of any kind or      class might not be sufficient to form
 that character.

  3. Whether those found on the borders of any river might
be considered as having been thrown up by that river, or
whether             it only     exposed them to view by washing away the
soil which             it watered.
   4. After establishing the character of the pebbles of a cer
tain district, one might follow, as it were, their traces, and
form conjectures both respecting their origin and the route
they have pursued.
  5. The increase of their size will (hew that they approach
their origin, or vice versa ; but care must be taken that other
veins of pebbles                    crossing    the former may not conceal the
course         of    those which you are tracing out.
     6.       A    consideration of the pebbles, and still more that                                        of
rolled blocks, or, at least, such as are foreign to the foil which
bears them              ;    of the height            at which               they are found, and
of   the large valleys opposite                       to their present                   situation, may
afford         some         indications        of     the      direction,              size      and force
of       the currents           produced by the grand revolutions of the
earth.
     7.        A    consideration of those blocks which                                    rest on       solicj
rock, and which seem still to occupy the place where they
were deposited, may, by the                           state    of   these rocks, give an idea,
of   the time elapsed since their arrival.
     8.       Now far         can the transportation                    of   these great blocks to
considerable                distances       be considered           as a general                 phenome
non       ?    or,     is it only a particular                 phenomenon, arising from
some local cause                ?

  Observations          to.  be    made on       the    Strata of the Earth and
                                        Mountains        .
       1. The      first question      is to determine whether              a   mountain
  or any mass of earth and stone is or is not divided by strata's.
      2.  What, in            regard 4o the theory           of  the earth, gives im
  portance to the question, whether                        a  mountain is or is not
      * The    word stratum, originally fynonimous            with that of    bed,  expressed
  the situation    of   a substance    extended horizontally,        and with an uniform
  thickness,    on   a plain    and horizontal     base.     But the signification    of this
  wotd has been enlarged, and it is now employed to express                 the situation of
  substances   extended with an equal or almost equal thickness on bases which
  »re neither plain nor horizontal.           Hole of the Author.
     Might not      the term stratum be reserved        for those that are horizontal, and
  the name of banki be given to others ? C-

stratified,    or composed of strata, is the supposition that strati
fied mountains have been formed by the successive deposition
of   substances before suspended        in a fluid, while those which
exhibit no signs of strata may be supposed to owe their origin
to a simultaneous creation, or an accumulation not formed
in    a  fluid, or which, at least, had nothing successive or re
gular, or in which there remain no traces of regularity.
     3. If the mountain or mass exhibits no marks of division,
 the question of its being stratified or not is superfluous.         We
 shall suppose      then that it presents divisions, and require to
 know whether these divisions may be called strata. The so
 lution of this question depends upon three considerations               :
 viz. The regularity of these divisions, or their parallelism.
 Their number : the greater the number, the more it excludes
  the idea    of fortuitous parallelism. The parallelism of these
 divisions with the laminae or parts discernible in the inside
  of the    mass.
      4. Though the strata,        in general, have the form         of  a
  parallelopipedon,       some are seen cuneiform ; in         others  are-
   observed     alternate swellings and constrictions;         and others
   are seen ramified, dividing themselves        sometimes    into two or
  three, or two and three uniting ahd forming themselves into
   one.
       5. Besides the form of the strata, to observe their extent,
   either in the same mountain, or in several mountains near
   each other, or even at a distance.
       6. To observe also their inclination,        or the angle which
   they form with a horizontal line, and the point of the ho
    rizon to which their declivity is directed.
        This   last observation   determines the      direction   of their
    planes,    or the two opposite points of the horizon through
    which their planes would pass, were they prolonged, after be
    ing made      entirely straight.    This direction of    the planes is
    of importance to be considered, especially in vertical strata.
        7. To examine whether this direction is parallel, oblique
    or transverse to the direction of the body itself of the moun
                                                                      tain,

  tain, the chain of which it makes             a   part, and the adjacent
  valleys.
      8.   To examine      also whether the declivity        of the  strata is
  conformable to that of the external surface of the mountain ;
 that is to fay, whether they descend towards the outside                   of
  the mountain,       or towards the interior part.
      9. To examine next whether the inclination is the fame
  from the bottom of the mountain to the summit, or whether
 it   varies at different heights ; whether          it be the fame or    dif
 ferent at the opposite sides of the fame mountain.                Strata in
 the form of      a fan*.
      10.   It is of importance       to observe, in inclined or vertical
 strata,    whether their thickness is not greater at their basis
 than at their summit.
      11.   To  observe the    joinings of the strata, and whether any
 substance different from that of the strata is placed be
 tween them, and what is the nature and thickness of this
 substance.
      1 a.  To observe whether the contiguous or corresponding
joinings of these strata arc smooth or unequal ; whether there
are observed in them any knots that exhibit traces                of crystal
 lisation or undulations proceeding in            a  certain direction.
      13.   In mountains      consisting  of strata different in their na
 ture, or of different thickness, to observe whether their re
 turn is periodical,      so that the same order recommences after
a    certain number or determined interval.
      14.   Whether,     at the bottom     of  a  mountain consisting of
horizontal strata, there are not found mountains composed of
vertical strata resting against the basis of that mountain.
      15. In bent or circular strata, to observe in the elbows or
points where the flexion is greatest, whether the strata are or
are not broken.
      16.   When    the strata have the form      of a C,   to observe whe
 ther at the back of the C there is not a vacuity, which proves
that the upper part has been thrown above the under part.

       17.    To examine, in general, whether the strata exhibit
  traces      of violent convulsions, which may have changed

  whole, as well as the straightening of the strata, may be ex
  plained by simple sinking down *.

   of that inclination in          regard to the cardinal points,           and in
    regard to the adjacent mountain and valleys.
        4. To observe, above all, the direction of fissures in re-
-
   gard to that of the planes of the strata ; because fissures, as
   is presumed,        being produced, in general, by the earth sink
    ing down,       and this sinking down being the effect           of  pressure,
    fissures have      been originally      vertical or nearly     so ;   and, on
   the other hand, because              the strata having originally           been
    horizontal      or nearly so, the situation of fissures, in regard to
    the strata, and the direction of both in regard to the horizon,
     may give some idea            of  the situation which       the    strata had
     when the fissures were formed, and even of the changes                       of
     situation which the mountain afterwards experienced.
         Thus,   fissures perpendicular to the planes          of the   strata,  in
     dicate that these fissures were formed when the mountain was
     still in its primitive situation ; and         if they  are also perpendi
     cular to the horizon, it proves             that the mountain is still in
      the fame     situation   :  but  if fissures perpendicular to the strata
      are inclined       to  the   horizon, we may conclude that the
      mountain has changed its situation since these fissures were
      formed    f.

 fissure, whether the strata correspond            at the same height,        or
whether the corresponding strata are lower on one side than
on the other.          The     first case indicates that the         fissure has
 been produced by mere              bursting asunder      ;  and the second

VII.      Observations       on    the   Winter    Sleep    of Animals       and
     Plants.       By  Professor     Fabricius. From             Magazin fur
     das neueste aus der         Physik.     Vol. IX.
   X     HE     so  called winter sleep is a very singular property            of
 animals and plants ; and though it occurs daily before our
 eyes, we are not able to explain the phenomena with which
 it is attended.        In cold countries many animals, on the ap
 proach of winter,          retire to their fubtersanean abodes,               in
 which they bury         themselves      under the snow, where they re
 main five or six months without                 nourisliment      or motion ;
 nav, almost without circulation              of their blood, which flows
 onlv sluggishly and in the widest vessels.                Their perspiration
 is almost imperceptible:            but still they lose something by         it;
  as  they enter their winter           quarters in very good        condition,
 and are exceedingly thin when they return from them.
      Some animals enjoy their winter sleep under the earth,
 and    others concealed          below the snow       ; some     for the same
 purpose     creep    into the holes of rocks,            and    others below
 stones or the bark        of   trees.    Some kinds,       such as swallows
 and frogs, can pass the winter in marshes under the water.
 In this     state   many of those exposed to the severity of the
    •  To observe   whether   this (inking down has not always taken place on
that fide which looks towards the flat country.        C.
                                                                            open

                    If inter      Sleep      of Animals and Plants.                               lifl
open air are destroyed                   by the frost when it is violent                      ;   and
even some           of    those      which       have buried themselves                   stiare the
like fate.
   Plants have their winter fleep also                          ;   for, during the period
of winter, their sap flows towards the root, and the circula
tion of      it,
           which     very flow, takes place only in the widest
                                is
vessels.  Were the expansion of the sap         winter as con              in
siderable      as   in summer,           it   would burst all the               vessels   on being
frozen.
   Several observers                   have       endeavoured             to prove        that this
singular circumstance                  is   merely accidental             ;   and, indeed, no
difference          is    found in the internal                     organization           of     those
 animals which have winter fleep, and those which have not.
It   is   very remarkable that this property belongs                                   in general
 to animals         of prey.            As       these have         far    stronger     powers of
•digestion, and stronger                 digestive        juices,     it   would appear that
 abstinence          from food for several months would to them be
 hardly possible.
     The     bear,        the bat and the hedge-hog                        have winter sleep         ;
 but the white bear has not.                          As       the latter       is   secured      from
 the cold          by    his long hair, he finds nourishment in the dead
 whales and             seals   which are          cast   on shore         by   the waves.
       The    earth worms               have winter sleep            ;     but aquatic worms
 very seldom.               Insects,        as    well    as   their larvae, have winter
 sleep.       Butterflies may be often fluttering about in the
                                                           seen

 that condition.                  Amphibious animals                       have      winter       sleep,
 those which              live merely in the ocean excepted.
       Few birds, on the other hand, are exposed to this state.
 The       greater part          of    these, on the approach                   of winter, retire
  to   a   milder climate where they can find more abundant
  nourishment.
       In Iceland the                 sheep have          winter sleep, because in that

      From the New Transactions                   of the Imperial Academy                     at
      Petersburgh,     Vol.   IV.
 A HE        invention of Arfuid Faxe, confirmed by many ex
periments tried at Carlscrona, but not yet communicated to
the public, for making a certain kind of artificial slate or
stone    paper, which         may be procured at a small expence,
and can be employed instead of common                                   slate,         was an
nounced and highly extolled a few years ago in several of
the public journals. This substance was said to have a great
resemblance     to milled or paste-board                  ; to be       of an iron-red,
White, or yellow colour         ;   to be very hard and stiff, but some
what elastic    ;    to be subject to no alteration even when                             im
mersed     in cold water for        several months, or when boiled for
several hours ; to be hardened                   by exposure to the air; tore-
fist fire a long time, and to burn slowly, after having expe
rienced a great degree of heat, but, when left to itself, to be
come soon extinguished.
  It is evident, therefore, that this paper may be applied to
various economical purposes, such as sheathing sliips, which
it would not only        preserve            from rottenness,           but also from
being destroyed by worms      for guarding from sire the cook
                                        ;
ing places in sliips and powder magazines, and, lastly, for co
vering houses and wooden buildings.       To this it may be
added, that plates      of this     paper sixed on with brass nails, and
done over at the joinings with cement, might be covered
with    some oil varnish in such a manner                       as    to be altogether
impenetrable to moisture. We are told also that a small
building constructed of wood at Carlscrona, and cased over
with     stone paper, after being silled                  with combustibles               and
seton sire, resisted the effects of the flames and remained
unhurt, and that the fame experiment repeated at Berlin on
a smaller building was attended                    with    the fame result.               One
great advantage       of this stone-paper                also   is,   that   it   is   exceed
                                                                                         ingly

                         and                                                           a   cheaper
    rate than any other materials for covering roofs,                               as      a plate
    of it   23 inches          in length      and 14 inches            in breadth          costs at
    Carlscrona only two schellings Swedish.
        An invention of           such       utility     and importance ought there
    fore to excite the ingenious to attempt an imitation                                   of   it,   in
    order that,       if  possible,     it   may be rendered            more public.              As
    soon      as
               I        obtained   a      specimen        of   it   from Sweden,           I    made
    experiments to try whether                 I    could not discover the method
    of making it. The fragment which         first examined wasI                                      3
    line in thickness. It was light, easily broken, and possessed
    all the properties above                   enumerated.        As the analysis                     by
    which M. Antic               de Servin,         at   the request of M. Crell, en
    deavoured           to illustrate     the nature of this paper,               did not ap
    pear to        me satisfactory,          I     subjected        part of the specimen
    sent me to        a   farther examination, leaving                 a   third portion en
    tire for the sake of comparison.
          After this examination                   the red stone-paper appeared                       to
    me to consist of, 1. Martial-bole, which seemed to be equal
    to half its weight, and which, on account of the chalk per
    haps, or calcareous               earth with which                it   was mixed, pro
    duced      a     little effervescence          with acids.          Perhaps also there
    were some particles               of another earth,             the discovery          of which
    would be of little importance to the object of this research.

    a  fourth part of the weight.       An animal glue, similar to

     about     fourth part of the weight.

          Another specimen which      received     I                  from   Mr. Cameron,
     architect          to her imperial majesty,               contained the same sub
     stances       in   proportions       a   little different.      I   was, however, not
     able to obtain specimens                 of   the white and yellow stone-paper,
                                                                                                       in

160              Experiments on the Composition                  of
in which M. Servin            observed some traces             of martial vitriol
(Julpbat of iron).
  Though I made           a   number of experiments in order to dis
cover     the composition of this slate,            I     shall    here mention
those only     which   were attended        with    the best success.          But,
to avoid repetition,      I    shall first describe       that previous mani
pulation which appeared most convenient.
  The red or white bole, carpenter's ochre and chalk, which
I employed      for this use, were reduced to              a   fine powder.      A
pulpy mass of the coarsest kind, procured from a paper-
manufactory, after being macerated in water, was strongly
pressed and weighed out for use.              The weight           was increased
about two-thirds by the moisture.               In giving          an account     of
the following     experiments,         I
                                      (hall mention the weight                    of
this substance    as   alluding to it when dry.
  The glue was dissolved in          a moderate       quantity of water.              I
added martial vitriol undissolved,          and employed unboiled               lin
seed    oil.
  For want of     a sufficient      quantity of raw pulp,            I   procured,
for some experiments, fragments of coarse old paper and book
binder's shavings, which, after being boiled for about three
hours, were much tenderer than that brought from the pa
per manufactory.   A pound of this when wet, after it had
been pressed, exceeded that which was dry by about two-
thirds.
   The pulp procured from a paper manufactory being mixed
in a mortar with the dissolved gluten, and being afterwards
formed into     a paste   by the addition of the above earths and
sulphat of iron,       was well beat up in the mortar, and linseed
oil then poured over it.           The     mass, being prepared            in this
manner, was spread out with            a spatula above a sheet            of coarse
paper placed on a board furnished            with     a   rim or border; ano
ther sheet of the same paper was then spread over  and                   it,          a
second board was placed above all.  The whole being then
inverted, the board with the rim was taken                      oss, and then   the
                                                                                first

                        the Swedish Stone Paper.                      i5l
first   sheet   of paper.    The     compressed    mass was then laid
over upon another board sprinkled with sand, and left to dry,
after taking the meet        of  paper from its other side.       Squares
made     in this manner dry without cracking; but as they be
come     warped, it is necessary afterwards to flatten them, by
putting them, with boards between, under a Icrew-press, and
letting them stand for some time.
    Ex p. I. I      mixed an ounce and a half of the dry pulp
from the mill with two ounces of common glue, and, having
added red bole and ochre,           of  each two ounces, obtained a
smooth plate.
    II.   To two ounces of pulp I added four ounces of red
bole pulverised, and half an ounce of chalk, with an ounce
and a half of glue.          The plate thus produced was full of
wrinkles and chinks, but tolerably hard.
    III.   An ounce       and a  half of pulp, with four ounces of
bole, and      two of sulphat of iron, produced a plate equally
hard, but uneven.
    IV. An      ounce of pulp procured from old paper and book
binder's (havings mixed, with half an ounce                  of glue, an
ounce of powdered          chalk,    two of bole,      and  an ounce of
linseed    oil, produced two     thin  plates smooth and hard.
    V.    Two    ounces  of pulp from the mill, with half an ounc«
of glue, fix ounces of        red bole and two       of chalk,  to which
were added two ounces         of  sulphat   of iron, and the same quan
tity of linseed oil, afforded plates that were smooth, but not
strong.
    VI. An      ounce and a half of pulp, with an ounce of glue,
and four ounces of white bole, produced a plate smooth,
beautiful, and hard.
    VII. An      ounce and    a half of pulp, mixed with two ounces
of glue, two ounces of white bole,          and as much chalk, yielded
a smooth plate as hard as bone.
    VIII.     An ounce of pulp, one ounce of glue, three ounces
of white bole,      and an ounce      of linseed   oil, produced a plate
sufficiently perfect and elastic.

half an ounce of glue, three ounces of white bole, an ounce
of chalk, and an ounce and a half of linseed oil, was superior
to that mentioned in the preceding experiment.                                 This    sub
stance      retains figures impressed upon      and, tinged with
                                                              it,

  X. An ounce and                a   half of pulp, with an ounce of glue
and four ounces         of chalk,        afforded   a   plate exceedingly spongy.
  XI. An ounce and               a   half of     the same pulp, one ounce                of
sulphat of iron, and four ounces of white bole, without glue,
produced       a   plate yellowish and spongy.
  XII. An               half of pulp, four ounces of white
                    ounce and        a
bole, with an ounce of sulphat of iron, and the same quan
tity of glue, produced yellowish plate
                                 a       little more solid.  a
 I      tried several other mixtures;               but   as the plates         they pro
duced were of an inferior quality,                      I   shall not give any ac
count of them.             The   plates which had been prepared in the
above            cut into several pieces,
             manner    I                                            and daubed over          a
specimen of each with boiled linseed oil.                           The     parts covered
with     the oil assumed         a   darker colour, and the superficies ac
quired more solidity, nor were they                       less   capable of resisting
fire.
      Being desirous of comparing the productions of my expe
riments with specimens of the Swedish                         stone-paper,      I     mace
rated about an inch square                 of   each    in   cold water. After they
had been macerated               four months,            the specimens           prepared
with sulphat of iron were considerably                              swelled,    but those
made without linseed oil seemed to have                             scarcely swelled at
all.       Those, however, which             I   had daubed over with                 boiled
linseed       oil or   linseed   oil varnish, exhibited               as    little appear
ance of change as the Swedish.
 I      put   a   square   inch of each of          the different kinds upon an
 iron    spatula,      together with         a   like quantity of beech wood,
 and exposed the whole to                a   strong heat         in   the    mouth of a
 furnace.          After fifteen minutes the wood                      began     to burn,
 and     in   fifteen, minutes more was reduced to ashes.                               The

                     He Swedish Stone Paper.                        16$
fragments of the different specimens          of the stone paper, ex
posed to the same heat, were       in  such a state  of ignition that
they hissed when immersed in water.             I however examined
them     with great attention.      The fragment of the Swedish
manufacture was somewhat black on the surface, and puffed
up into small blisters j but did not seem to have burnt, or
to have changed its form.          The     specimens   prepared    with
the sulphat, being more spongy at the edges, burnt ; but so
slowly, that in those of the worst quality the fourth part was
scarcely consumed     in  the above time.        All the rest, inferior
in nothing to the Swedish specimen, resisted the fire with
equal strength ; so that most of them were only a little
blackish on the surface, and entirely free from blisters ; nor
did there appear any difference that could be ascribed to the
glue or linseed oil employed,        as   they were all of the fame
consistence,   and none     of them     seemed to have been warped
by the heat.
     I then put some of the same fragments toasted in the fire
on a red-hot plate    of iron,   and immediately exposed them for
 fifteen  minutes to a strong heat in the middle         of  a furnace.
The Swedish      specimen    burnt, and for five minutes emitted a
 thick   smoke ; then appeared      of   a white heat for some time,
 and at the end of fifteen minutes was converted into three
 friable cineritious laminae.       The    specimen   produced by my
 first experiment burnt     in the  course   of  a minute,    kept up a
flame for three minutes,        and in fifteen     minutes was con
 verted   into a black plate sufficiently hard.          Specimens of
 the second, third and fourth experiments exhibited the fame
 appearances.      A   plate   produced     by the fifth experiment
 was sooner destroyed      by the fire, and appeared        friable like
 the Swedish.     A  plate  of the sixth experiment, which        before
 had been scarcely changed by the fire, bore the last exposure
 exceedingly well;      was scarcely       changed in its form and
  magnitude, continued sufficiently hard, and was only ren
 dered    black and as it were scorched.           A  specimen    of the
 seventh experiment burnt for a whole minute,             and became

 eighth burnt for two minutes, and then continued black
 and sufficiently hard.          The     same was the cafe almost           with
 the ninth specimen.            A   specimen      of   the   tenth, though it
 became black, was however scarcely changed.                      A  fragment
 os the eleventh experiment burnt with                 a flame for about two
 minutes, and was converted into ashes ; which was the cafe
 also. with      the   specimen produced by the twelfth                 experi
  ment.
    Those specimens          produced by my fourth,            sixth, seventh,
 eighth and ninth experiments, seemed to be the best in their
 external qualities and their power of withstanding fire and
 water.     The      same fragments suffered as little from the                in
 fluence of the weather and atmosphere                 as the  Swedish.      The
 materials for making this article may be readily procured
 for a small price ; and the process is simple, and requires
 verv little time.       My    specimens      indeed were not so neat and
 elegant   as   the Swedish; but this inferiority may be obviated
 by practice and experience            :   and even     in its imperfect state
 the invention may be          of  great economical utility.
    The cement which the             Swedes      recommend for silling up
 the interstices between the squares, and of which                  I  received
 a specimen        from Mr. Cameron, was                composed    of   linseed
oil varnish, white        lead and chalk,        mixed together in such a
manner      as to    approach to     a   fluid state, that it might more
 easily insinuate itself into the fissures.
    As  the   chief    use  of this invention        is to cover and incrust
houses,    I  was desirous      of trying my production by exposing
it  to the     effects   of the weather.           I  therefore   nailed frag
ments     of    the Swedisti stone paper, and of that made by
myself, to a small board          ; and     having daubed over the join
ings with cement,          I  exposed them in the month of August
on the top of my house, and in the beginning                     of April     the
next year     I   found they had undergone no change.

 IX,      On the so calledSea Froth and other Substances of which
       the Bowls of the Turkish Pises are made.     From a Letter
     written in Persia by Dr. Reinegg, Correspondent of the
     Royal Society at Goltingen, to Baron Von Asch at
     Petersburg!}.           Communicated                 to       the    Society    by    Professor

TiHE           so called        sea-froth (lithomarga),                    of which       the bowls
of     the    Turkish      pipes are made,                is not an artificial composi
tion, but a natural kind                    dug up near Konie in
                                               of    earth
Natolia.           This place, the ancient Iconium, lies in a most
fruitful       district,        which may            be        truly       called    a    terrestrial
paradise ; and is celebrated                   on account of                a large       monastery
of Denises          founded       by the       Scheik Abid il Daher, but which
received particular endowments from Sultan Suleiman,                                              and
in which           at present      there are two hundred Dervises under
the direction         of    a    Scheik,       by whom                   they are clothed and
maintained.
     The income of this monastery                          arises         in part from some
natural productions of that district, such                                 as marble, &c. and
in particular from the above-mentioned                                       yellowish         white
earth, of which the bowls of the Turkish                                     pipes       are made.
It   is dug up at Kiltschik, (that                  is,   the place of clay,)              a   village
five   miles distant from Konie;                     and besides this           I        have heard
of no other place, either in Natolia or along the                                    coast     of the
Mediterranean sea, where any of the like kind                                       is    produced.
It   is   found in    a    large fissure       six feet        wide, in grey calcareous
earth     ;   and the workmen              assert     that the earth grows again
in   the fissure,       and      puffs     itself up like froth.                     They there-
sore call     it   kill-keffl, or kill-kef,          a    word which,           if
                                                                                I         read with
Teschdid, kill-lefp, signifies clay-fVoth, or light clay.
     This earth, when            it   comes         from the fissure,               is   heavy, soft
and greasy.           It   sweats     if   thrown into the fire;                         produces   a
fetid vapour;           grows hard,             and        becomes           perfectly white.
The       fresh earth dissolves          in    no acid.              That which           has been
                                               M     3                                         burnt

l66                    On the so tailed Sea-Frotb
burnt   can be acted upon only by the nitrous acid ; but not
until the solution      has been continued a considerable time                    in
heat, and then it loses nearly a third of its weight.                       When
water is poured on the pure solution, it becomes                            a little
muddy;       and when         it is   suffered    to   evaporate     entirely,     »-
bitter salt exceedingly easy to be dissolved is obtained.                        The
undissolved    earth, fused in a strong fire, is converted into a
brown flag.       The       fresh earth remains        in water unchanged ;
and when it has been mixed with it by shaking and stirring,
it falls again   to the bottom,          loses its cohesion, and cannot
be again used.        The earth,      after being burnt, imbibes a large
quantity      of water, throws out abundance of air bubbles,
and becomes soft.
     The         of the village of Kiltfchik dig up a sufficient
           peasants
quantity of this earth, for which they pay a certain sum to
the monastery, and then cut it into bowls for tobacco pipes.
For the    most part, however, they press the earth,                   while     yet
soft,   into proper moulds         in which the figures of various
flowers have been            cut; and while the bowls are in these
moulds they bore the holes in them, and then lay the bowls
in the fun to dry 7 Some days after, when the surface of
them is covered with a hard yellowish crust, they place the
whole quantity of bowls in a heated baker's oven, and let
them remain there till it is entirely cooled.                   They then boil
them for an hour in milk ; and when they are taken from                           it,
they rub them with Biscbik Kuirugbi                    (equifetum)      common
horse-tail, in order to make them smooth and shining, which
is   at length completely effected           by   means    of   a   piece   of   soft
leather.
     When    the bowls have been prepared               in this manner, and
sent to Constantinople           for sale, they are dyed there of                dif
ferent colours, partly           by   being boiled in wax or oil.                The
best mixture,         however,    is   dragon's blood and nut-oil           ;     for
when the bowls have been well soaked in this mixture and
penetrated       by   it,   they acquire, in       a    short time,         a   most
beautiful dark-red dye.           The Turks, however, in general                 are.
                                                                                 not

4iot very fond of tobacco pipes made of sea-froth : and they
 are seldom used by the Asiatics; for they are too heavy, hold
 too much tobacco,          and    in some measure          lessen   the agree-
 ableness      of its   taste.    The Turks, therefore, prefer pipe-
bowls made of red clay, and fell the former chiefly to the
 Greeks, who transport them to Tranfilvania                    and   Hungary.
    These small red pipe bowls are, on the other hand, in
 common use throughout all Lesser Asia, Arabia, Egypt, &c.
 and are formed of a real kind of clay-earth ; but in places
where that clay-earth           is not to be found, they are imitated
 by some artificial composition, which is indeed                     preferable ;
ibr    those burnt     of clay    have      in   general  a pale red colour,
 whereas      those made artificially have a beautiful high colour.
 The earth of which          these bowls are made is not a red bolus,
 but    a  blueisli argillaceous species of potter's earth.                Such,
at    least, were     those    which      I   saw at Trebisond,        Poli, and
Cæsarea,       where an immense number of these pipe-bowls
 are made.
    In   those places, on the other hand, where this species                   of
 potter's earth cannot easily be procured, or is not valued, as
 at Constantinople         and Tocat,          the  pipe-bowls are prepared
 in  the following manner:           — Small fragments of thoroughly
 burnt tiles, particularly old ones, are pounded and then re
duced to fine powder in a mill. Three parts of this tile-dust
are then mixed         with one      part    of any well washed argillaceous
earth in pits made for the         purpose, or in wooden boxes, and wa
 ter to the height      of a few    inches is poured over it. This mass
is daily stirred during a week ; the water is poured off and
fresh water poured on every evening; at the end                     of the week
 the whole paste is well stirred round with                 sticks,   and when
 the    useless coarse    sandy parts         begin to sink to the bottom,
 the remaining muddy water is drained off into other vessels,
 whore it is suffered to remain till the argillaceous paste falls
to the bottom and the water has again become clear. The
 remaining water is then carefully drained off, and the clayey
•ake, as     it dries, is well kneaded.             As  soon as it is so dry as

quantity of umber, and formed into pipe-bowls,                                         either in a
mould, or by being applied to the lath.
     When         these bowls have been sufficiently burnt, they ac-,
quire a dark brown colour, which, however, changes into a
beautiful red as soon as they have been well rubbed with a
piece of leather sprinkled over with fine pulverised                                          blood

X. A singular                Phenomenon             respecting Snow, some os which
      of a red Colour was found                               on the         Alps.    By M. DB

  VV HEN                  M.      de Saussure             explored mount Breven, for
 the first time, in the year 1760, he found in several places
 pn a declivity snow still remaining,                               and was not a little sur
 prised to see the surface                   of   it,    in various parts, tinged with                  a
 very       lively red colour.                 This colour         brightest in the
                                                                        was
 middle of such spots                     as      had their centres more depressed
 than the edges, or where different planes covered with snow
 seemed to be joined to each other.                                 When       he examined this
 snow more closely,                 he remarked that its redness                           proceeded
 from       a    very fine powder mixed with                          it,   and which had pene
 trated         to the depth         of two or           three        inches, but no farther.
 It    did not appear                that this powder had come from                                 the
 higher parts of the mountain, because some of     was found                          it
 in places at considerable distance from the rocks and much

                 t    A   piastre   is   equal to about half-a-crown.
                                                                                                  lower

                                             refpeSilng        Snow.                                         169
lower down             ;    and       it   appeared also that it had not been con
veyed thither               by the winds,                    because         it was not      disposed in
stripes or  in the form of radii. The most probable con
jecture therefore was, that it was a production of the snow
 itself, or the remains of its partial melting suspended at its
surface      as    in           a    nitre when              the    water         passed    through it.
What        seemed to favour this conjecture still more, was, that
the colour at the edges of the hollow places where little
water had funk down was extremely faint ; and, on the
other hand, shewed itself stronger                                      in   those parts where the
greatest quantity                    of water       seemed to have penetrated.
      M.    de Saussure took a tumbler                                   full of this snow, as he
had no other                vessel         with him, and                held it in his hand till the
snow melted, when he soon saw the red dust deposit itself at
the bottom.                     Its colour then did not                       appear so      dazzling           as
before,      and when dry                     it   lost it entirely           :    it   decreased also          in
quantity,         so as almost                to appear nothing.
      Next   year           M.       de Saussure ascended the Breven, and found
on it a quantity of the same kind of red snow, some of
 which       he squeezed                     closely         together and put into                      a    large
 handkerchief,                      but before          he got home                it   was entirely dis
 solved by the heat                    of the       sun.           It   was not, however, on the
 Breven asone that he discovered                                    snow of this kind               ;       for he
 found of it on all the high mountains of the Alps, about the
 fame season               of the year,            and       in similar situations           ; so       that he
 was much surprised that authors who had written respecting
 the Alps, such as Scheuchzer, had made no mention of it.
 It   is,   indeed, true that                      it   is    found only in hollows, where
 the snow          lies deep,                 and       at    a    season     of the       year when the
 melting of                it   has proceeded                to   a     certain degree      ;   for, when
 none of the snow or when very little of                                           it   has been melted,
 the dust         is   then in too small quantity to attract the eye                                        ;   and
if    the melting has proceeded too far, the whole                                         of   the powder
 has passed through                         with the water,                  and   it   becomes         equally
 invisible.                Besides, towards the end                          of    the melting,         a    great

distinguishable.
     In   the year 1778, when                 M.            de Saussure was on mount
St. Bernard, he found               a    great deal          of the      fame       kind of snow.
He collected            as much         of   it   as    he possibly could                 and      Mr.
Murrith,         an experienced naturalist,                       collected          it ;
                                                                                    of      also
                                                                                               j    so
that they were enabled to make some experiments.                                              On   ac
count of its great specific gravity,                         M.    de Saussure treated this
red powder as an earth, first                          with distilled vinegar, but                  he
employed         so     little that he had no result.                     He then boiled            it
in the muriatic acid,               and obtained              a    solution, which, when
carefully distilled and sihred, had                          so   brown      a   colour that he
was quite at            a   loss respecting            the nature of this substance.
He therefore applied    to the blow-pipe, and observed that
                                   it
itinflamed with    smell like that of burnt vegetables.
                            a
  This experiment induced M. de Saussure to digest 40
grains  the powder in spirit of wine
           of                        and having filtered           ;
the solution, he found that the residue weighed                                           7   grains
Jess: the spirit of wine had become of                                    a      golden yellow
colour.  He then distilled  in balneum       it        a                     mariae,        and the
spirit of wine came off perfectly pure.       An oily transparent
matter of       a    golden brown colour, which   the warmth of           by
the balneum mariæ had not become dry, remained at the
bottom of the retort.                This oily matter had                    a   smell like that
of wax, which            it   emitted also when burning.                            The     deposit,
which the spirit of wine had not dissolved, was, in regard to
its extractive part, also inflammable                         ;    and    the ashes which
remained after           it   was burnt, though they did not seem alka
line, were fused              by   the blow-pipe                  into   a     porous kind of
greenish       glass.
     These experiments seem to prove that this powder was                                           a
vegetable       substance,         and probably the farina                     of   some flower.
M.    de Saussure was acquainted                       with no plant in Swisserland
that produced red farina in such abundance as to tinge the
snow      of   the    Alps red     ;    especially          when     it   is   considered       that
a   great deal       of   must
                         it             be lost before            it   can reach the spots
                                                                                              where

where the red snow          is found.      But the action of light,
perhaps, may first give it its red       colour; and in regard to its
specific  gravity, that is not surprising, as by its long con
tinuance on the snow it must, on account of the repeated
flow meltings,      receive such an accumulation         of particles    a*
to become dense and heavy.
    M. deSaussure     communicated his discovery to           M. Bonnet,
who    advised him to examine the powder            with   a microscope,
in order   to see whether      it exhibited    the   appearance      of the
farina of flowers.       He did    so  with the   greatest care and the
best glasses, but he could not discover          the least regularity    in
its form.
    Though    M.    de Saussure      found this powder in different
 places  on the Alps, he however asks, whether it be very
 common,      and whether it be found on the high mountains
in different countries and different climates,              such,   for ex
ample,    as the  Cordilleras    ?  These questions deserve certainly
to be examined; and though it be probable that this powder
 consists of the farina of flowers, it is not altogether impossi
 ble that it may be an earth separated by the snow itself, and
possessing some inflammable            properties called      forth by the
immediate action        of the light    and heat     of the fun,     which
 shines  with    so   mnch     liveliness in the pure air of these
elevated    regions.
XI. Description of an Apparatus proposed to be applied to
    M. Kl 1 n oert's Diving Machine, to enable it to be used at
    greater Depths than it otherwise could.
 •JOME       doubts having occurred to the inventor             of the div
ing machine,      described     in our   last Number,       respecting  the
 practicability of employing it at very considerable depths, he
 was induced to propose an additional apparatus to render it
 more extensively      useful.     The description of this        proposed
 improvement we (hall give in his own words               :   " Supposing
                          9                                               it

it possible," says he, " to proceed to the greatest depth*
with the before-described machine, difficulties may still arise
on account of the great length of the pipe ; for it may be
asked, Can the diver breathe long when the column of air
is of such a length           ?    I    have     found that it is difficult                 to
breathe long through a pipe of a hundred feet, and half an
inch in diameter         ;    that the breast soon becomes                       fatigued    j
and that it is much easier to breathe through                           a   pipe of half
that length.         Though                    diameter may in part ob
                                       a greater
viate this difficulty,        so   that the diver can breathe with more
ease,   yet another question arises              ":   At the depth of        a    hundred
feet and more, is it possible                  for the diver to manage such a
long tube conveniently, as it must meet with resistance ac
cording to particular circumstances, and                       as   by its length it
must     acquire considerable             weight      ?   How would         he manage
when he wished to rise again to the surface                         ?   and at such a
depth could he make a signal for that purpose, and with suf
ficient quickness ? On account of these questions I turned
my thoughts to another machine, to be used in necessary
cafes with the former, and                I   hope the one      I   mean to propose
will    be found worthy           of   some notice.
  " The figure  (Plate III.) represents the machine, which con-
fists of a hollow cylinder, terminating in two hollow trun
cated cones. It is constructed in the fame manner as casks,
and made exceedingly strong.                       In order that        the wood may
be rendered water-tight,                 it is    daubed      over on the outside
with any proper varnish or cement.
   "    By   means   of the interior construction of this machine                           a
man can descend              to a great          depth      in the water, and live
and     move    freely   without          a pipe to supply him                   with at
mospheric air, because,     being placed on a stage without the
machine,       and furnished with a harness and pipe like that
before described,        he can obtain air from the space                        within     it,
which contains 58 cubic feet.  He may, therefore, remain
under water two hours  descend from the stage at pleasure,

move about with freedom, and,                      by     means of the machinery

•within, rise and descend when he thinks proper, as will ap
pear from what follows           :
     "   Those who have made                experiments with air will not
doubt that 50 cubic feet of it are sufficient to maintain the
life of a man for two hours ; and the possibility of ascending
and descending           at pleasure may be thus explained :
     " As   this machine contains such a volume of air that it
is lighter than water, it will require a considerable weight to
make it sink below the surface.     That as little, however, as
possible    of   the space destined         for containing air may be lost,
lead may be employed,                in the    inside       of   the machine at h,
sufficient to make it sink            so   far that     a   cubic foot   of it only
shall remain above the surface                of the water.           An additional
weight then of 100 pounds will not only depress it below the
surface of the water, but make it sink even to the bottom.
     "   But    the    fame  thing may be effected without weights,
by lessening the         volume of the contained air. This is done
by means of the piston c, which fits closely into the cylinder
d, and which, by means of the rack e, the pinion            the                 f,
wheel g,        and the endless screw b, together with the winch                       i,
can be moved either upwards or downwards.
     " The      machine,      however, must not only be strong                       and
durable, but be constructed                according to the depth to            which
it   is destined to descend and the pressure on the piston, that a
man at such a depth may have sufficient strength                             to depress
it   by means of the winch, and thereby to enlarge again the
volume of air.    It will readily appear that, by raising the
piston, the machine  must sink to the bottom ; and that, by
depressing       it,
             the machine must again ascend      as was proved     ;
by   a   small model       which
                            made for that purpose.
                                 I

be found,        by    calculation, that,     if we estimate          the friction     of
the piston, when made water-tight, at 200 pounds, and that
of the wheel-work at 300, though may perhaps not beit                                  so
much, the winch at the depth of 120 feet will not require                              a

 be lessened,              and the cylinder,              in order that it may hav«
the fame cubic content, be lengthened, and                               if a   larger wheel
be added to gain more power,                              something will       be lost in re
gard to time but it can be easily calculated to what greater
                       ;
depth the machine may be used, and how much the strength
of    a man can accomplish.                    The higher       the machine is in pro
portion to its diameter, the more securely will it remain per
pendicular in the water, and the less danger will there be of its
being overturned                 ;    because the diver is then nearer the cen
tre of gravity.               That the         fame advantage,       however, may be
obtained with               less      expence,          the wheel work, together with
the cylinder               and       piston, may be omitted, and the machine-
constructed            as    far      as the       upper cover    0 ;    but it must be          so
furnished with hooks for ballast, that the diver, when he has
previously screwed on the pipe fastened to the machine and
placed himself on the stage, may hang on ballast, stones or
other heavy substances, till it sink, and, by throwing them
away, may again ascend at pleasure.      The machine in this
form       is simpler ; and,                in my opinion,          to    be    preferred        to
the construction with the piston, wheel and rack, which                                           I
shall      endeavour to prove                      in    as mechanical         a manner          as
possible.
      "   The    ends       of the pipe lm, which                proceed        into the ma
chine, are           so    applied that all the particles of air may gra
dually proceed through the lungs.                             Should     it,   however, after
being used two hours, be no longer capable of supporting life,
the diver must ascend with his machine, and be conveyed to
the ship or boat attending him,    means of the rope fast  by
ened to die ring n.   He must then screw off the pipe, open,
the top         0,   and,    by      means     of   a    pair of bellows screwed upon
the mouth-piece,                     expel the air from the machine, and blow
into      it   sound atmospheric air for further use*.

be enabled     to walk about       with the    pipe at freedom, for the
purpose    of examining sunk bodies, and discovering the pro-
perest  method      of raising them. For the greater security, in
case any accident should happen to the machine, an appa
ratus may be applied to the pipe, that the diver can leave the
machine and rife without it            ;  which he might easily effect,
by throwing away the weights suspended                   from his harness,

of air for ascending.           By   these means he might             leave the
great machine,        even   if  he were not acquainted          with swim

  all other lights      are  extinguished.         They contain          a  space
  equal to a cubic      foot ;   and the candle burns, without                any

XII.    Singular Injlance of the Attachment of Birds of Prey
    to their Young. By M. Cronstedt.                  From New Trans
   actions of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Stockholm,
    Vol.   X.
iVl R.       Cronstedt resided several years on a farm in Suder-
mania, near        a steep  mountain, on the summit of which two
eagle-owls        (strix bubo L) had their nest.         One day, in the
month of July, one of the young owls having quitted the nest
was caught by some of his servants.              This bird, considering
the season of the year, was well feathered ; but the down ap
peared here and there between those feathers which had not
yet attained their full growth.             After it was caught, it was
fliut up in     a large hen-coop,      and next morning      M. Cronstedt
found a young partridge lying dead before                 the door of the
coop.      He immediately           concluded that this provision had
been brought         thither by the old owls, which no doubt had
been    making        search   in the night-time for       the lost young
one, and might have been led               to the place   of  its confine
ment by its cry.           This turned out to have been actually
the cafe    ;   for  M. Cronstedt found that the fame mark of at
tention was- repeated           every  night for fourteen days. The
game which          the old ones      carried to it consisted chiefly of
young partridges, for the most part newly killed, but some
times a little spoiled.          One time a moor-fowl was brought
to the young owl,           so fresh  that it was still warm under the
wings    :  a   putrid stinking lamb was also brought.           M. Cron
stedt supposes that the spoiled flesh had already lain a long
time in the nest of the old owls, and that they brought it
merely because they had no better provision at the time. He
and his servant tried to watch several nights, in order that
they might observe through a window when this supply was
deposited     ;  but their plan did not succeed, and it would ap
pear that these owls,         which    are very fliarp-fighted,   had dis
covered the moment when the window was not watched, as
food was found to have been deposited for the young before
                                                                       the

the coop that very night.          In  the month      of August this      care
ceased   ; but that period is exactly the time when all birds                of
prey abandon their young            to their own exertions.            It may
be readily concluded,         from this instance, how much game
must    be destroyed      by a pair of these owls during the time
that they rear their young.            This observation is applicable
to the whole      race   of owls,     in general    ;  and these       may be
considered     therefore   as the     most destructive      of all  the birds
of  prey.     As the eatable-birds of the        forest repair chiefly       in
the night-time to the fields,         they are particularly exposed to
the acute fiVht, smell, and claws           of these birds     of  the  night;
and even the swift-footed hare seldom escapes them.
 XIII. Ashort     View of the Mitcbillian        Theory    of Fever, and of
                    Contagious     Diseases in general.
 \^>ERTAIN          exhalations from marshes and swamps, and
 from collections       of putrefying vegetable           and   aninial    sub
 stances,   induce    diseases   attended     with different degrees of.
 malignity, according to circumstances. There is a great simi
 larity at least in the diseases induced by the                   exhalations
 from marshes and from putrefying substances: it ought to be
 so; for the noxious quality of the former is in consequence
 of their containing        the   latter  ;  and   hence such         diseases,
 though improperly, have been called putrid.
    What     is the peculiar substance,       or what the substances in
 these  exhalations that cause what are termed contagious dis
 eases ?   What     the mode     of action     ? Animal       and many ve
 getable   substances,     especially    those which        contain gluten,
 give similar     products when decomposed             by the putrefactive
  process.
     Can   hydrogen gas be the deleterious product ? No its
                                                                           —
  base combined with different substances makes a great part
  of our aliment : with carbon it forms fat — with oxygen,

 inedicine.
      Carbonic acid gas cannot              possess a   contagions quality, for
  it is continually generating where                 its effects would be most
  hurtful — in the lungs, from whence it is constantly                    emitted
  by expiration.            We swallow it in           great  quantities in beer
  and other fermented             liquors;     and, combined with hydrogen
  gas,   it may,       as has been         proved by the English pneumatic
  physicians, be taken in large                doses as a remedy     for different
  diseases.
      Azotic     gas forms nearly two thirds              of   the  common at
  mosphere        we breathe        :  its base    united to other substances
   composes a great portion              of our  food.   Oxygen gas forms the
  other third— without it we cannot live.
      Such    gases     therefore      may be mixed with each other, and
  yet not be the cause of contagion.                    Where then      is it to be
   sought   ?   In   some      chemical      union between two or more of
   them, or their bases, effected, by the operation of some cause,
.  during     their separation           from the organised        body of which
   they formed       a   part, by the process of putrefaction.
      Permanently-elastic             fluids owe their gaseous         form to     a
   chemical union of caloric with their respective bases. When
   this union is once effected, two gases may be mixed or
   blended together,          as  oil with water, or wheat with barley; but
   no chemical union caa be effected between them, the at
   traction of the         base   of  each    for caloric being stronger than
   that of the     gases    for each other. When the affinity of their
   bases for each other is stronger              than for caloric,    a  chemical
   union of the        bases   may take place       ;  but in that cafe the ca
   loric is    set at    liberty, and the product,          instead  of being   ga
   seous, is concrete, as when ammoniacal gas is presented to
   carbonic acid gas.
      But if     the    bases act on each         other before cither be satu
   rated with      caloric,      a  chemical      union may be effected be
   tween, them       :   thus azote and oxygen will yield the nitroi!3
                                                                            • -acid.

dcid.     If caloric,  as a  third principle, unite itself,   so as to sa
turate the oxygen and azote at the moment               of their extri
cation, not to each respectively,         but  as entering chemically
into union with each other, the result will be           a gas    holding
the three      ingredients chemically united, and consequently
possessing    very different properties    from   a mixture of oxygen
gas with azotic gas;       for, in the latter cafe, the base of each
having been previously saturated with caloric, both the gases
by that means have been put into a state that prevents the
possibility of a chemical union taking place between them.
   When       a mere mixture     of oxygen    gas and azotic gas        (at
mospheric air) is inhaled into the lungs, the animal powers
exert such an action on the oxvgen gas as to effect a separa
tion between       the oxvgen and caloric,        applying each to the
purposes     intended by nature      ;  while the greater part of the
azotic gas is respired undecomposed, mixed with the car
bonic acid gas that has been generated by the union of a
portion of the oxygen gas with carbon furnished by the ani
mal, and with moisture formed by a portion of the base of
the oxygen gas with hydrogen, the caloric of that portion
having gone to the supply of the animal heat.               But if    a gas
composed      of oxygen   and azote chemically combined with each
other and with caloric, be diffused through the atmosphere
inhaled,    a substance   is received into the lungs possessing        very
different chemical properties from common air; for, though
the component principles be the fame, being combined in a
very different manner,        it must   possess a very  different mode
of action upon       the animal.       In fact, it may    be taken into
the system in its combined state, where, meeting with prin
ciples which possess a stronger affinity for some          of its  consti
tuent parts than they do for each other, it may be decom
pounded ; while, by the fame operation, the animal fluids, or
solids,   or both, are themselves decompounded, by parting
with    one   or more of their principles which enter into the
new combination.
                                    N   4                          Where

   Where     such   a  noxious gas abounds, it is no wonder thaf
pestilential   disease   should   be the consequence,         especially  if
it sliould  prove miseible in water, for then it         will  be taken in
with    the food and drink, and may even be absorbed by the
skin,  as  well  as by the nose, pallate and lungs.
   The nitric acid, which is composed of oxygen and azote,
possesses very   different properties from atmospheric air, which
is a mixture of these two each previously combined with ca
loric.    It would     be just as fair reasoning        to say that, their
bases being the fame,        they must     possess the fame     properties,
as to  infer that the noxious gas above mentioned fliould pos
sess the fame properties with atmospheric air, because com
posed   of the same ingredients.
   Oxygen and azote, by certain operations of nature, enter
into   combination       with other elements         to form     organised
bodies.     By this process they are put into          a  situation which
enables    them to form        a new union      as  soon as the laws by
which the    organised     structure maintains the harmony of the
complex combination,          cease to exert    their influence upon it.
New affinities then begin to          operate,   and that species    of de
composition so well known by the name of putrefaction is
the immediate consequence.             The oxygen and azote, during
their extrication from the putrefying substance, may come
within the spheres of each other's attraction, without enter
ing into    an intermediate slate       of  gas by union with caloric      :
and in this way it is probable some modification of nitron*
gas, or the nitrous acid, is formed, according as caloric en
ters or not as a third ingredient into the compound.
   As this    gas, which      the supporters     of the present theory
consider as the matter        of contagion, according to them, al
ways    owes its origin to the putrefaction of animal and vege
table  substances, they have given it a name expressive of that,
origin. They assume the word seplon to express the radical                of
the nitrous acid, and derive       it from vww, putrefacio       ; whence
comes septon,      putridum;     and propose that the combinations
                                                                    formed

in    the nomenclature,                    and     be arranged             in the following
order     :
      Scpton, for azote or nitrogen
      Septous gas, for azotic gas
      Gaseous oxyd of scpton, for dephlogifticated nitrous air*
      Septic gas, for nitrous gas
      Septous acid, for nitrous acid
      Septic acid, for nitric acid
      Septat, feptite— for nitrat, nitrite, &c.
     By insisting that              the nitrous acid is              of animal derivation,
or from vegetables possessing the same principles, the Mit-
chillians only mean, that nature effects the decomposition of
azotic gas by the operation of those laws which                                  she   employs
in forming organised bodies ; that oxygen (not in combi
nation with caloric) enters into the composition, and that
during the destruction of such bodies                              these     principles      unite
with each          other.           By the affinity the product has for the
vegetable alkali, which,                   or the principles that form                 it,   is   ex
tricated from decaying vegetables,   joins wherever can     it          it                it
find      it,
          and produces nitre, the grand source from whence
the nitrous acid              is   made.
     To       prove this position, the works                 of those who have wrote
on the production               of nitre,        and the    nature of the soils where              it
is         in the greatest abundance, are examined, and
     produced
from them the fact    endeavoured  to be established, that
                                    is
the putrefaction               of    organised         substances       is   an indispensible
requisite.        Another           fact   is   pointed out from the fame source,
and from medical writers, namely, that                                 the neighbourhood
of   such soils         is   extremely unhealthy, especially at particular
seasons        of the
              year, when circumstances, in the first place, are
such as to favour quick putrefaction, and in the second, to
present the greatest number                      of   obstacles to the septic (nitrous)
gas, being taken out of circulation                             by   being neutralised.

lations, excretions,              &cc.     go through the putrefactive process
in   the fame way that dead animal substances would, and the
products are the fame.                     One of them, the gaseous oxyd of
septon,        being miscible in water, lodges                            itself in the damp
walls, where, after it has saturated such of the substances it
meets with as have affinity for
                                                     it,

some circumstance, as hot weather for instance,                                     drives   it   out
with      the evaporating moisture, in such quantity as to infect
the atmosphere.
     That combination of                   septon     (azote)      with the acidifying
principle which produces the gaseous                             oxyd of septon,    not      is
however considered as exclusively the only proportion of the
ingredients           that produce contagion.                        There are an infinity
of gradations in            the proportions             in   which          these principles
may be united, and yield                    a   contagious fluid — the vapours of
the nitric        acid      itself are not excepted.                       These      pestilential
fluids are considered                as    being always, even                 in   their weakest
form,       somewhat of stimulants.                        In many            instances       most
violently       so.      Though           their operation            is   modified, when in
a    dilute     form       they      impede          respiration,          or nauseate            the
stomach,         as they        then bring on         a    diminution of action                   and
energy        amounting           in the cold           stage        to   a   state    of direct

                                          in

    "  The main difficulty    left is to account for the cold fit     of  a
regular tertian.       This   stage   of  fever -I  believe   to depend
upon impeded        respiration, and the impeded           respiration to
depend upon the vitiated          quality of  the   air taken into the
lungs ; or in some slighter cafes,           where     the   stomach     is
originally thrown into       a disordered   state, the lungs, by asso
ciation with that organ, are thrown into disorder too, and
for a time perform their functions but imperfectly.
    "  Thus I    presume it is that the impeded        state  of respira
 tion is attended with     a smaller   evolution of heat and oxygen
in the lungs, and consequently with more or less diminu
tion in the circulation of the blood, and a proportionable
degree    of chilliness  and coldness throughout the body.            The
duration and degree of the cold tit will correspond                to the
continuance and power of the causes disturbing the pulmonic
organs, either by acting upon them directly or indirectly
through the intermedium of the stomach.
    "  From the small quantity of heat and oxygen communi
cated to the blood in the lungs, and the consequent flow
and feeble circulation      of   the blood, can the shrinking, pale
ness, tremors, coldness,       debility, 8cc. &c. be sufficiently ex
plained, as the constitution is now deprived of its two chief
 stimulants.
    "  But why does not the continued operation of the vitiated
 air upon the lungs, or the associated condition of the lungs
 with the stomach, go on in an increasing series even unto
death   ?   The power of our constitutions           to become      fami
liarised   to the action of noxious causes,         is evinced     by the
 innocent operation of poisonous'         substances,    which, by    fre
quent repetition, grow gradually habitual, and by custom
 lose their primary operation.           This disposition to become
 familiarised to vitiated airs, is apparent in the inhabitants of
 Africa, who      are so seasoned to the air and climate they live
                                   N4                                   in,

184                The   Mitchillian       Theory     of Fever
in,   that it excites no disturbance at all in their constitution?,
while strangers fall victims in the greatest abundance.                     Now,
common intermitting paroxysms                    are instances    of temporary
seasonings,      which     the   constitution experiences, of a kind
quite analogous          to   what      is    perpetual     with   the    Guinea
negroes.
     " The    cold fit sometimes does.terminate              in death  ;  and this
happens when the constitution cannot acquire the habit of
enduring the noxious cause with impunity.                         In  the gene
 rality of cases, however, the stimulus of the infectious gas
loses its power to operate before the constitution is debilitated
 to death ; and as soon as it becomes,                 for this time,    so  much
accustomed       to the vitiated       air,   as  no longer to be disturbed
 by its presence, the cold          sit ends.       The length     and violence
 of   the cold sit will thus be, cœterls paribus, in a compound
 ratio of the impediment given to the respiration                     by the in
 fectious gas, and the facility with which the constitution ac
 commodates itself to its action : if three persons then in
 habit one house,          it is possible         that one may become             so
 quickly accustomed           to   the air       as   to  have no distemper;
 a second      may    have    a moderate          disease   of but   a few     fits;
 while the third,       possessed    of  a  constitution not easily moulded
 to a new habit,        may be incommoded by                  a violent and ob
  stinate malady.
      " In every    paroxysm      of   an intermittent, the infection thus
  wears    itself out;     but this is only           a  temporary reconcile
  ment of the body to its action;                when,     after a repetition      of
  fits, the disorder      becomes        milder and milder,           and after a
  while wholly       ceases.     This      is   a case    of lasting reconcile
  ment ;/ and in this way may               a large     portion of small inter-
  mittents cure themselves,              while the credit is given to the
  bark   ! This power of habit daily does wonders, and labours
  more effectually for the good of the sick than bark, opium
  and antimony put together.
      "  The   attack   of   these   causes being thus for a time over
  come, respiration grows free,                full,    and frequent;       because
                                                                              there

 there    is now       a greater      appetency    in the constitution for
 heat; more vital air is decompounded in the lungs; and
 more stimulus is applied, by means              of  the increased heat and
oxygen now in the blood, to the heart and arteries : these
 stimuli operate more powerfully on account of the accumu
lated excitability       of the body;       and a degree     of excitement is
thence induced, which sometimes ends in death, sometimes
causes delirium,        and    in   almost every cafe exceeds the healthy
 temperature.
    " The      duration and violence of the hot         stage  will be, cateris
paribus, in      a  compound ratio of the excitability accumulated
 in  the cold stage, and           the  heat  and    oxygen evolved in the
 hot one.       When       the excitability    is exhausted by the opera
 tion of the stimuli, the violence of action will cease, and the
 body grow cool.
    " The     doctrine of intermitting fever, then, is briefly this:
 the vitiated atmospheric fluid, by interfering with the pul-
 monic action, brings on the cold stage, and would continue
 the fame until its termination in death, did not the consti
 tution in the mean time acquire such a habit as to gain a
 temporary insensibility to its action.               This habit being in
 duced, the cold stage abates by reason               of  the state  of direct
 debility    into which the body had                been brought;      anxiety
 continues, and, by the quickening of respiration, heat and
 oxygen are       set loose   in the lungs, and becoming incorporated
 with the blood, now warm and stimulate                       every part   with
 more than usual power, and occasion the phænomena of the
 hot   stage,-  which terminates         as soon as the     accumulated ex
 citability of the system is exhausted.— The sweating stasje
 follows of course, as in other cafes of the subsidence' of
 violent action      :  for, after a time, the exhausted excitability
 of the animal          system allows excessive action to go on no
 longer;     the respiration        grows more moderate and         easy ;  the
 heart beats with        less   frequency and force;        the arterial con
 tractions are also more slow and health-like;                   and,   as  the
 arterial contractions relax, the hydrogen and oxygen of the
                                                                         blood

 i86                 The Mitcbillian Theory of P^ver
blood now run together in the extreme                        vessels  of   the (kin,
and form the moisture which bedews                      the surface ; and this
afterwards flying off by evaporation, cools by degrees the
whole body down to its ordinary temperature: and, as the
arterial extremities of the           rest  of the body       become dilated bv
the subsidence of excitement,                 the    other secretions,         which
had been generally suspended                 during the fit, now return as
before    :   after this, the constitution,          so  far accustomed        to the
breathing such an atmosphere,                 regains     its former vigour and
 functions,       as  far as the exercise induced and functions in
jured during the several            stages   will allow.
     "  The interval        between       one   sit and the succeeding            one,
 will  be proportionate to the duration              of the habit of       resistance
 acquired.        Some persons thus experience                  but one fit, and
 all is over;        for, under the fame              circumstances they are
 never invaded by a second.                Others suffer two sits, or a suc
 cession of, fits, and after a while                become      so accustomed       to
 the stimulus, that,          if  always applied in the fame degree of
 strength, its effect is no longer felt upon the body                    :   in other
 instances       again,    so   hard    is  it for the constitution             to be
 moulded into          a  settled habit      of opposition, that           after   en
 during     a great     number       of invasions, it         becomes      at length
  enervated       and    worn down         so   much as finally to die ex
  hausted.
     "  The     species    of  fever,     whether quotidian, tertian, &c.
  will  depend upon the           readiness or quickness wherewith the
  offending cause gains           a  new ascendancy           over   the    body, or
  breaks the habit.           And    to the mobility         of the body, or ease
  with which        the habit is broken,           is to be ascribed,          as  well
  the frequency of the returns,              as the    duration and severity of
  the paroxysms.                      ^
      " The anomalous           cafes o££iver, which have puzzled phy
  sicians    to explain, and no||Clogists to arrange, are thus \cry
  nalurallv accounted tor; since, according to the variation of
  the cause, as the noxious atmosphere may thicken or diiperse,
  will be the varittv in the effect prodoced ; and as there may

be   infinite gradations of     the deleterious     cause, there may be
endless varieties    in the morbid effect.
    " And     to this principle    of   the human constitution,       I  be
lieve, may be referred all the febrile ailments from the most
trifling intermittent to the more serious remittent,              and the
solemn form of continued fever.
    "  Hence further may it be understood             how a succession     of
fits, long continued, may dispose the constitution to              a repe
tition of fits,     even   when the morbid           cause is away     :  for
though there may         be a  habit of insensibility produced to the
vitiated airs, yet     a  habit may, in the mean while, be esta
blished    in  the bodily motions       of falling periodically into re
gular trains of action, even         when the original cause is with
 held.     Here then will be produced            a habit of having pa
roxysms      depending on the particular inward state of the
moving fibres, after the manner of temporary seasonings;
while, at the fame time, there is a habit formed of resisting
the active causes (vitiated air) altogether, or of obtaining a
permanent seasoning as to them.
    " The     cold stage of a paroxysm is a state of direct debility,
 induced by the vitiated air breathed operating to subduct heat
 and oxygen from the body             ;  and its termination    is by the
 stimulus of the vitiated air being for that time worn out.
 The hot stage, which begins as soon as the temporary sea
 soning is induced, is        a  state   of excitement brought on by
 the heat and oxygen now operating upon the accumulated
 excitability     with additional force. —The sweating             stage     is
 formed after the subsidence            of  the excessive action     of the
 body, and       the  consequent     enlargement of the diameters           of
  the vessels;   whereby sweat is formed by the combination                 of
  hydrogen      and   oxygen,    and     the  other secretions     proceed
  again,   as usual,  in the several glands.
     " The length of interval between the paroxysms depends
  upon the strength of habit acquired:
     "  The frequency of their occurrence will           be proportioned
                                                                            to

to    the     facility with which                a temporary habit is broken or
gives way.
     "   The cold stage is the most dangerous                       ; and persons     dying
in    it, die of the direct debility induced                        by   the vitiated at
mosphere         they respire.
     " The       hot    stage   is   less   dangerous, and persons who die               in
it   expire    in   a   state   of indirect debility.                But, according      to
circumstances, death may happen in both the cold and hot
stages.
     "   The     sweating stage         is  a    mere consequence         of   the cooling
of   the body, after the preceding heat and excitement                              of it."
     Our limits will not permit                   us to detail, at length,          all the
arguments that have been                         brought forward           in support    of
this theory,            by   its author Professor          Mitchill of New York,
and      by   those medical gentlemen in America                          who have em
braced        his opinions.             We        have    however endeavoured            to
give such        a   concise    yet accurate          account of the theory, and
the grounds on which                  it    is   supported,    as    may enable       those
of our medical               readers,       who have not            seen the    American
publications           on the subject, to form some opinion respect
ing it.          We      give   no opinion           of our own — that           does not
belong to our province.                      It    will not however            escape the
notice of medical men, that daily observation                              presents some
facts    which, on first view at least, do not appear reconcile-
able     with this theory. Copper-plate engravers, in the course
of their       business, are often obliged to breathe                     an atmosphere
loaded        with septic        (nitrous)         gas,   without        appearing to be
more liable to contagious diseases than other men; and, to
mention no other fact of this kind,                           it   ha* been proved,      by
the experiments made on board the Union hospital                                  ship by
desire   of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, of which
we     gave an account in our last Volume, page 68, that the
fumes       of    the nitric         acid are not only         a    cure, but an anti

 screw fitted to the frame, and worked by a handle.
                                To draw the Bolt out.
     The     head     of the bolt must be cut off, and a hole made                    in
  the timber big enough to receive the male screw                          H, which

    is put over the bolt: a slit is then to be made, either by                                          A
    saw or cold chissel,                in   the head       of      the    bolt, to receive the
    key    I,    and    which          corresponds            to the       flit in   H:     the bolt
    head is then to be riveted                     as   firmly      as possible      upon   H:        the
    cylindrical tube, B, is then to be screwed on, turning the
    whole machine round till it can be done no longer, when
    the endless screw is to be used.                          If the      machine is of        a pro
    per strength, and the riveting well done, the power is fucli
    as to extract; the                bolt or break           it,   but generally         it   will   be
    drawn out uninjured.
                                  To draw Bolts into Ships.
         It will   be necessary to have                 a   bar,    L,    which   I   recommend
    to   be made        of   steel, long enough to pass from the inside to
    the outside of the sliip, and somewhat smaller than the cop
    per bolt intended to be drawn in.      This may be called                                          a
    conductor.           On one          end    should        be     a male screw,             a
                                                                                               ;      the
    'bolt to be drawn in should be tapped                                 at one end to receive
    the male       screw, a, on the                conductor,             and at the other end
    should be another male screw that                            sits    into the female screw
    inB;        after   which          the    operation        is    the fame        as   drawing      a
,   bolt out, and the machine                           sliould be applied           accordingly.
    When        the bolt arrives at its destined place,                      it   may be secured
    on the inside            by   a   nut, which         is   as good      a    way of fastening
    as   clinching,      and much more expeditious.
       This machine, though only of the height of eighteen
    inches, will draw bolts or out of any length
                                              in for, after                          ;
    the bolt has risen to the top of the tube,                             it   will only      be ne
    cessary to screw the machine                        back, and follow up the work
    with blocks of timber,                   as represented             in the drawing.
         Note.     If the     upper part of the hole in                    II   be made square,
    larger than the round hole as sliewn at M, and the head of

XV.       Description     and     Use   of C.     Gutton's       Eudiometer,
           From Journal de 1'EcoIe Poty-technique,               P. II.
V>HEMISTS              and   Philosophers have long wished for an
eudiometer capable of shewing exactly the quantity of oxygen
cas mixed in any other gas.                 Berthollet has proved, in his
Lectures       at  the   Normal       School,     that the eudiometer of
Scheele, which he justly considers               as the best, has still great
defects,      as  the   absorption requires         several   hours,    and   as
towards      the end there is a decomposition            of water,  and con
sequently a disengagement             of hydrogen     gas, which occasions
uncertainty respecting the quantity absorbed.
     This induced me          to    seek  for some substance which in a
 convenient manner might immediately give                    a more accurate
 result    than nitrous gas,          hydrogen gas, phosphorus, and a
 mixture of sulphur and iron, the only substances which, as
 far as    I know,    have been hitherto employed for that purpose.
     Sulphure (sulphuret) of potasti appeared to me                    sit to be
 tried under this point         of view.      I  was well aware that at the
 ordinary temperature            it is susceptible only of a combustion
  still flower and more insensible than             a moistened     mixture of
  sulphur and iron        ; but     I  presumed     that, if  the temperature
  were    raised by applying a small taper,            it would be sufficient
  to put in action the affinity, and to determine rapidly an ab
  sorption which would not then be affected                     by any foreign
  cause.      The    effect  sully answered my expectation            ;   so that
  the question then only was to determine the apparatus ne
  cessary    to form this new eudiometric instrument.                I thought
   that an inverfed retort would unite simplicity, convenience,
   and every advantage          that could be desired.          The following
   is a description of it.
      AB      (Plate   V.)  is a small      glass retort with a long neck,
   and capable      of containing from         12 to 15 centilitres*.        One
   must be chosen so much bent that, when the neck is placed
 'vertically,     the bulb may form in its lower part a cavity con-
                            *  About eight cubic inches.

taining the matters introduced into it. The extremity of
the neck is ground with emery to fit air-tight at C into the
glass tube      C D,        open at both ends, and ao or 25 centimetres
in length.        F       is a cylindric vessel — a common glass jar, into
which the       tube       of    the glass    CD        may be entirely immersed
below the surface of the water.
   When you        wish to try- any aeriform fluid in order to separate
its parts, and discover the quantity of respirable air it contains,
put into the retort two or three bits of fulphure of potash of
the size of     a pea ;         sill it with water, taking care to incline it
to make all the air which                    might remain in the bulb                    pass
into the neck         ;    stop with the finger the orifice of the retort,
and place it in the pneumatic
                            tub, that the gas to be tried
may be introduced in the usual manner.   By inclining it
again, alternately in different directions,                        all    the water may
be easily displaced,             and the fulphure left remaining                      in the
bulb.
  Then      place the retort vertically, and introduce the end                             of
it into   the glass tube           C D, which           must still be under water ;
and place below the bulb                a small        lighted taper.           To   preserve
the retort in its position,           a cover      of wood, with          an aperture for
its neck to     pass       through, stiould be fitted to the jar.
  The     first impression         of   the heat dilates the gaseous fluid, so
that it descends almost to the bottom of the tube, which has
been disposed on purpose                  to receive         it,   and    to    hinder any
part of   it   from escaping,           which would be the               case   if   the tube
were not sufficiently long, and which would prevent the
diminution        from being accurately determined.                              As    soon,
however,       as the      fulphure      begins to boil,            the water ascends
with    rapidity, not only in the lower tube,                            but also in the
neck of the retort, notwithstanding                        the application or even
augmentation of the heat.                    If   it   be vital air absolutely pure,

denly, the ascent of the water must be retarded,                                 cither by
removing the taper, or inclining the retort, which will not

proper for maintaining        combustion.
    If it be common air or vital air mixed with any other gas,
you must, after cooling, measure the quantity of water which
has entered      the retort, and which will exactly represent         the
bulk    absorbed.      You must not neglect        to confine the re
maining gas under the fame pressure, by immersing the re
tort in the pneumatic tub, till the internal              and    external
water be on the sarhe level, before you close the orifice by a
stopper.     This operation, very    easy when you have graduated
vessels, may be made         in common       practice by means of a
piece    of  paper cemented     along the neck of the retort, and
having traced out on it divisions determined by experiment,
and which may be covered         with varnifli   to defend   it from the
action of the water.
   C. Chauffier      has constructed, for eudiometric experiments
by phosphorus, an apparatus somewhat different, composed of
a long tube all of one piece, one end of which is bent and
blown into a bulb, and having,          as at e, a tubulure sliut with
a stopper after the water has been made to ascend in the               in
side  of  the tube to two-thirds     of  its height.   This instrument
would    serve   also for experiments     with the fulphurct of pot
ash ;   but   I  must observe,  that the execution of it is not so
easy as    on the first view might     appear.     Besides,    if the tu
bulure      renders   it very convenient      for trying atmospheric
air, the    case  is not the fame in regard to other gases which
cannot be introduced but by transmission.

IRON-STONES,              though commonly denominated ores of
clay, contain notwithstanding a variety of mixtures, and may
with propriety be divided into the following classes :

     1. Iron-stone that has clay for its                        chief component earth,
and this clay comparatively pure and free from sand.
   2. Iron-stone pofl'csfing lime for its chief mixture, and this
lime also comparatively destitute of sand.
  3. Iron-stone that unites clay and lime, containing large
proportions of silex ; hence, for distinction's fake, may be de
nominated siliceous iron-stones.                          I    mail-therefore, in naming
these varieties, use the following                            terms   as    they are arranged-
in   succession.               Argillaceous,           calcareous, and siliceous iron
stones.          None of those              earths exist singly            with the iron. All
iron-stones contain                a   mixture of the three, in various propor
tions   ;    from which arise the supposed variety of the qualities
of crude iron, which                   each respective stone is said to contain.
There are some, however, which are composed                                            of nearly the
same        proportions of clay, lime, and silex                            ;    and these com
monly afford, when compared with themselves,                                                     a similar
quality of crude iron.
     Nature, in the formation of these secondary ores of iron,
has invariably                impressed characters upon them, easily to be
developed            :    by which means their qualities, and the                                    conse
quent effects produced in the blast-furnace,                                         may be accu

enabled to pronounce exactly upon the quality     the iron                                  pf
likely to be obtained from the ore. We must not, however,
consider         these characteristic features as                     a    consequence               of the
metal existing of                 a    variety of qualities;                    but,        a   priori,   we
otisht to consider,               that,     as    a   consequence          of     the           nature and"
proportions of the mixture, the iron will be called into exist
ence      state more or less oxygenated or carbonated.

expression               ought to be understood, which                          by   the bye         is   sel

  portion of fuel, coaks or wood char, by weight, is understood
  to be sufficient      to smelt, and give principle to a determinate
 weight and quality of iron-stones combined together, in order
 that    a   certain quality of crude iron may be produced.                      In
 this cafe, should       a  newiron-stone be substituted           for one whose
 quality and effects are already known,                  and should      its appli
 cation be productive          of iron   less  carbonated than formerly, it
 would instantly be denominated                a  bad iron-stone, or an iron
 stone containing         bad iron — an assertion only true             compara-
 tivelv     so far as  it would     affect the     interest  of  the manufac
 turer, unless corrected by an addition of fuel,               a  change of the
 mixtures of ores, or a varied              application of the lime-stone
 used as a solvent or flux.            But this     is no proof that the qua
 lity of iron,     as it exists in the ore, is bad, since           a larger pro
 portion of coaks, or           a  change of mixture, which incurs no
additional expence,           can correct the evil.         It rather furnislies     ,
a    demonstration         that the iron      in all oros    is the fame     ;  but
that, in calling it into          a metallic form, the quality is affected
 chiefly by the reduction of those mixtures originally united
 with it.
     As the quality of the fuel is improved in a direct ratio to
the quantity of carbon which the coal contains, and its pu
 rity-,    hence arise the great variety           of coaks   used    m smeltino-
iron-stones;        some    of which will       smelt, and give principle to
the     iron contained in doable the weight of the same ores
that others will.           From     this then may be deduced another
proof, that good and               bad iron are terms of comparative
meaning only, confined to situation.                     Let it   be conceived
that     a  change of fuel opposite in its quality to that now men
tioned was to take place ; the fame quantity of ore, which'

nated, would now yield its produce in a partial degree, and
that highly oxvgcnated— almost unfit for any purpose.                          The
consequences         here entailed arc the fame, though they may
be attributed to different causes;               the former as derived from'
the hostile      mixture of the ore, but the latter             as   arising from
a-  deficiency in the quality of the coaks.

    Besides these two leading instruments             of alteration in tne
smelting process,       inherent      in  and derived    from the mate
rials, good and bad effects may be produced from an unjust
proportion and quality of the lime-stone, which is added, in
order that the proper equilibrium             may be restored, and       thi
iron properly and beneficially revived.
     Talcing   this then for a general principle, that the crude
iron contained in all iron-stones is the fame, and that it can
be called into existence         as a metal   of  all the various degrees
of carbonafion, by regulating            the proportion     of fuel, and of
 the solvent;      I  sliall proceed      to mention       those mixtures
 which     I have always observed determine the future quality            of
 the crude iron.
     i. Argillaceous iron-stone having sine clay as its chief com
 ponent earth, lime in the next proportion,               and both these
 nearlv destitute    of   sand ;    which, when properly torrefied,
 exhibits fibres on its      internal surface, of a brown, dark-
 brown, or claret colour, running cither in                streaks  or radi
 ated,    and adhering tenaciousty to the tongue, will afford,
 with   a moderate proportion         of coaks   and lime-stone,     iron of
 the finest quality, possessing strength conjoined with an inti
 mate degree of fusibility.
     2. Calcareous iron-stone, that which contains lime as its
 principal earthy mixture ; holding clay in the next propor
 tion,    and   both these comparatively unallayed (totally they
 never are)     with sand; which, when regularly torrefied, as
  sumes     a variety of sliades generally lighter in the colour
  than the former class         ;  which sometimes, and          sometimes
  not, presents internal fibres, and which adheres less tena
  ciously to the tongue ; always contains iron, which can be
  revived, richly carbonated with a comparatively small quan
  tity of coaks, and with a trifling addition of lime.                Under
  this class of iron-stones are found those which produce iron-
  of a fusible nature,     seldom connected        with strength, but va
  luable for its utility in sine     castings, which require ornament
  more than durability.       .  It is also from this source      of mixture
  that  I  would trace the red fliort quality os bar-iron.               The
                                                                       nature

nature imposed         upon crude iron in the blast-furnace                    by
the development of its mixtures,                  most   commonly accom
panies it through       all its subsequent          stages  of existence     as a
metal.
    3. Those iron-stones whose component parts are nearly an
equalised mixture of clay, lime and sand, which torrefy with
a slight degree      of adhesion      to the tongue, assuming a dark-
red or brownish colour,          void of internal fibre, always afford,
with the local proportion of fuel, iron of                   an intermediate
quality   for fusibility     and   softness,      but generally       possessing
strength in     an eminent        degree.        Such    iron   is   excellently
adapted for the manufacture of great guns, mortars, and the
large species of machinery.            Its application to the purpose of
bar-iron making, would           also   be attended with the most bene
ficial effects,   possessing neither the extreme             of fusibility nor
of infusibility  :  it would greatlyprevent, inthe manufacturing,
a tendency,     which iron      possessed     of   these extremes       has, to
become red or cold short.
    4. Iron-stones which unite           a large    proportion of sand with
sparing proportions         of clay     and lime,       which, upon being
slightly exposed to heat, exhibit masses                of semivitrification,
neither obedient to the magnet, nor adhesive to the tongue,
having a refractory disposition to part, and possefling a dark-
blue or black colour, always afford, with the usual pro
portion of fuel, crude iron of the worst quality, either                   as' to
strength or fusibility.       Such metal is commonly highly oxy-
ginated, and brittle      ;  incapable of being used alone for any
 melting purpose      ;  and, when applied to the           use   of  the forge,
 affords malleable iron,      which      possesses   the cold short quality.
    These are the four principal             classes   under which       I  have
 arranged our iron-stones,          with     regard to their tendency to
 afford their iron carbonated, possessing strength,              or otherwise,
 when smelted in the blast-furnace with                a  determinate quan
 tity of fuel.    As this    classification     is exactly analogous to the
 results obtained in the large way,            it may     serve as a ground-

work lo those who may wish to attain                a   practical knowledge
pf these ores, so far as it relates to their manufacture.
   It is however easy to counteract the natural tendency
which     every iron-stone has in this cafe, to afford its iron of a
certain qualitv, and to make each of them yield crude iron
of all the different degrees of fusibility and strength. Is it
not obvious, that since the qualities of crude iron depend
upon the mixtures            and    their kinds composing the stones,
that   if nature    be assisted by adding or subtracting from them
in   the blast-furnace,       every      quality of crude iron may be
produced from the same iron-stone                  ?   I  have seen  most os
these results determined in the large way,                 and  the whole    of
them beautifully confirmed              in the assay-furnace.
    It remains with       the present manufacturer to consider whe
ther it will be more his interest to reject such iron-stones            as are
of difficult carbonation, or to apply the necessary additional
proportions of fuel, capable of correcting the quality of sili
ceous iron-stones.          Not    so,   however, to those who may at
some future period succeed him j necessity, at all times inge
nious,    assisted   by the     increasing light which science           daily
sheds over our manufactures,              will devise the means    of calling
into    profitable existence        the metal contained          in all those
ores   which may         have    fallen into disrepute        in the  present
day, or from which at this time it is thought                  impractipabje
to extract metal in the large way.
   'i be usual crjterjons by which iron-stone is judged, whe

    I. The      degree    of tenacity with which it adheres to the
tongue after       torrefaction : 2. Its colour: 3. The obedience
to the magnet when pulverised              :   4. By depriving of its iron
a  given weight of the ore, in contact with charcoal and fu
sible earths     in the assay-furnace.
   The     first and   third    of   these methods are liable to great
error.      1 he adhesion      to the tongue      will   be more in propor

lion    to the quantity        of clay and its kind contained in the
stone, than to its real        contents in iron.           Iron-stone may also
be torrefied    in  such a manner as to deprive its internal surface
of this property      ;   as  it  is only peculiar to the stone at a cer
tain stage of torrefaction.
   The influence which              the magnet possesses          over some ores
of iron is no direct proof of the quantity of iron contained ;
as some ores which contain 15 parts in 100 are completely
magnetic, while others again that contain 60 to 70 parts of
iron in 100 are not in the smallest degree affected with this
property.       The magnetic test is more used to ascertain the
 existent  state of the metal, whether mineralised with an acid,
combined with sulphur or with oxygen, or existing in                          a  dis
engaged state more or            less   metallic.      No iron-stones which
in their native      state   contain their iron mineralised with oxy
gen, or in the     state   of an oxyde, completely            dispersed through
an   intimate combination of clay, lime and                    silex, containing
water, carbonic acid, and sometimes                     concrete sulphur,         are
obedient to the magnet till such                  time     as  torrefaction      has
 passed   upon them, either exposed to open air, or in contact
 with charcoal in close vessels.                If this   process     is continued
 for  a short  time, the whole mass             will become obedient           ; but
this affection will still depend upon the relative quantity of
concrete oxygen fixed with the iron.                        Individually, how
ever, iron-stones are affected by the proportion                     of heat con
veyed to them while torrefying.                  If  the quantity communi
cated has been         sparing,       so as  not to have carried off all the
 water, carbonic         acid, &c. the magnetic virtue will also be
 proportionally absent         :   if  the dissipation     of  these     substances
 has been complete,           the     magnet will      possess an      influence in
 the   exact ratio of the quantity of oxygen which remains
combined with the metal.                  Should,    it happen that         a decree
of   heat  capable      of exciting       fusion   is applied,      the mass will
then rapidly      lose its   magnetic obedience            by an extra-fixation
»f oxygen; if driven          so far as to    make it exhibit        a  femi-vitri-

 hed appearance,       this principle would be found to be entirely
 annihilated.
     Although the colourwhich iron-stones               assume in torrefy
 ing intimately depends upon the degree of heat presented to
 them in the operation of burning, yet, by regulating this
 agent in     a  proper manner, an accurate            knowledge may be
 formed, not only of the probable quantity of iron, but even
 of its tendency     to become     carbonated in smelting.         The   ex
 pulsion of the water and acid leaves the combined earths
 more exposed to determination.              The   small   specula  of  silex
 arc distinctly discerned; adhesion to the tongue develops               the
 presence     of clay  ;   and  lime   is indicated by its assuming          a
whitish colour, either striated,         or disseminated,     approaching
towards the surface of the stone.                                          «
    The    last method mentioned,          namely, that of depriving a
 given portion of        ore of its iron,    is the most consonant to
truth and to the ideas         of the manufacturer.         Acids may      be
used as a check upon the assay by fusion             ;  but this intricate,
or rather this slow process is chiefly resorted to by chemists,
and seldom goes beyond the bounds of the laboratory.                       In
assaying by fusion, not only the quantity of iron may with
precision be ascertained,          but also the quality of crude-iron
likely   to be produced from the ore,         with the local proportions
of fuel in the large way.           The earths formerly united with
the iron,      now become fused with          those added     for solvents.
These float upon the surface            of  the extracted metal,       and,
when      cold, may afford information,           from their colour snd
transparency, concerning           the   regulation     of future propor
tions upon      a more extended scale.         This  subject  I shall more
minutely illustrate in       a subsequent      paper   on the assaying of
iron- ores by fusion.
    The burning or torrefying of iron-stones, known in the
large way by the rather improper term of calcination, con-
fists in  exposing    the stone to a certain degree       of heat in con
tact with air, in order          to dispel those substances      which it
                                                                  contains.

                 On    the Component      Parts of Iron-Jlones.                 201
contains, capable of assuming the aeriform state by the com
bination of caloric.          This operation ought to be performe4
in   a progressive      heat, always short of fusion. The water is
then slowly evaporated without being decomposed ; the ca
loric unites to the carbonic acid, which soon assumes the
gaseous state ; and lastly, the sulphur,            if any,     sublimates.
     This     process is essentially necessary' to be performed before
the iron-stone is introduced              into the blast-furnace.          Were
raw iron-stone, or ore, precipitated in the violent                       heat    of
the smelting-furnace,            the water and acid would instantly be
decomposed; the oxygen would partly unite to the iron in
addition to the fixed quantity peculiar to each ore, and part
of it would oxygenate the sulphur, either of the ore, or of
the pit-coal,          a portion     of which is always         present    in the
furnace.         The whole       mass would       then be precipitated in
fusion, and        a    dark porous lava obtained,          containing          iron
more difficult to be revived               than ever, owing to the great
quantity of oxygen combined with it.                 In    cafes   of this kind,
the disengaged hydrogen manifests its escape, by changing
the colour of the flame from a mellow white to a pale sickly
blue.
     It
      must from all this appear obvious, that, when torre-
faction has been properly conducted, a very considerable part
by weight         of the whole will        be dissipated    :   the absence       of
these volatile substances always leaves              the iron-stones more
or    less    magnetic.    The
                             of weight, however, is very dif
                                   loss
ferent in the various classes of iron-stones, even when they
are        all exposed for the same length        of time       to a degree       of
heat capable        of expelling     those mixtures,      which, under          such
circumstances, assume the gaseous state.
      I.     Calcareous iron-stone, when properly exposed to tor-
refaction,       loses more of its weight than either of the other
two classes.                   is abundant, I have found thigk
                       Where the lime
iron stone lose 38 per  cent, but more commonly 35 and                            ifi
per cent, of water, carbonic acid, and sulphur,
                                                                           a.    %-

 aoi          On the Component Parts        of Iron-stones  .
    2. Argillaceous    iron-stones, exposed to a similar degree of
heat, and treated in the same manner, commonly lose in
weight from 32 to 35 per cent.
    3. Siliceous iron-stones always give out less weight when
 exposed to torrefaction under similar circumstances with
other stones.     In common they        lose from 27 to 30 per cent.
I  have, though rarely, found them to give out 25 per cent,
only.
    The extreme    loss   of weight in     each class must be consi
dered   as the utmost point        to  which torrefaction can with
safety be urged, without exposing the iron-stone to an accu
mulation of weight by the combination of oxygen.
    From the variously compounded natures of iron-stones
arise the various calculations of the loss which thev         J are said
to sustain in burning,        at different   iron-works. Fields of
iron-stone    are commonly       impressed    with a general distin
guishing characteristic feature : some are of the calcareous
genus ; some of the argillaceous ; and others again have a
more intimate      alliance with silex       than   the   former two.
Hence we find, at those works where the chief supply is
drawn from the argillaceous iron-stones, that the loss in tor-
refaction on the great scale is computed from 30 to 33 per
cent. Where calcareous iron-stones form the chief supply,
the loss is estimated     at from 35 to     37! per cent.        Few or
no iron-works are obliged to have recourse              to iron-stones
abounding with sand for their chief consumption            :   a general
estimation of the loss sustained         by this stone in the large
way is therefore difficult to be made, though, I have heard,
that at some works 25 per cent, was all that was allowed to
be expelled    during burning.        Nature has      been extremely
kind in the formation of our secondary ores of iron; as the
bulk of them, that contain iron sufficient to entitle them to
be smelted, are combined with superior proportions of clay
and lime.
   As the burning or torrefying of iron-stones is of great im

portance to the manufacturer, and as it may be in some re
spects gratifying to the man of science, I shall particularly
enter into the various phenomena attending the operation j
dividing torrefaction into two classes : that which deprives
iron-stones of certain substances capable                      of becoming aeri
form by the combination                of caloric in contact with atmo-.
spheric air ; and that which deprives ores of their oxygen —
hence called dc-oxygenation — by heating them in contact
with charcoal, in         closed vessels, or          in cavities impervious          to
the external air.
    1.   The   consequences          of heating iron-stone           exposed to air
 is a lofe of water, sulphur,              and    carbonic       acid *.     A   small
portion     of oxygen may            at times be unfixed, when the fuel
 may chance to come into contact with the heated iron-stone
under a partial exclusion from air. But the association of
circumstances necessary to effect this can                       so seldom      be the
effect    of chance, that it is never to be looked for with cer
tainty.      When the operation is properly performed, the last
particle of acid and water may be expelled.                          But this point
 is difficult to be ascertained            with any       degree    of exactitude :
 for, in proportion as these gaseous substances are carried off,
 the metal becomes more and more revived, of course more
and more liable to attract, and six oxygen by the decompq
   * I  have seen   some   iron-stones     in torrefying deposit a beautiful      oxyde
upon their surface, of a lake colour, and light as down.                The   fame sub
stance,  1 have observed,     effloresced upon       the  surface of the fracture      of
highly oxygenated crude iron, which hud been broken immediately after
the metal had lost its fluidity.        Fr.im this coincidence of effect, I am in
clined to suppose,   that the oxyde deposited on the iron-stone in burning is
the consequence of the decomposition of the sulphuric acid ; a ponion of
which had    been mineralised     with the    stone,   holding iron in solution   :  and
that in the latter it was occasioned by a superabundance of oxygen in the
blast-furnace,   probably from      the   introduction of raw        iron-stene,  which
had escaped    the effects  cf   the fire: that the sulphur,        as formerly   stated,
had become oxygenated,           dissolving a portion      of  the metal ; which was
again deposited in the state of a calcined           sulphat, when 'he acid was suf
fered to escape,   by being freely exposed at a high degree of loeat to open.

sition of the ignited       gas ; and, as the last portions     of the acid
and water are distilling, the stone is apt to gain weight by the
calcination      (oxygenation) of its iron.        This will positively be
the cafe when the heat is carried beyond the necessary degree,
and is indicated by the iron-stone swelling in bulk, becoming
specifically lighter      and porous on the surface,          but gaining
weight in      a  great degree     internally.     As oxygenation goes
on, the magnetic virtue decreases,             until at last it becomes
entirely annihilated.
    The   first   stage in    torrefaction   is indicated    by the first
general change of colour in the iron-stone.                  This    is com
monly    a faded      blood   colour,   more or     less  dark according
to the quantity of lime present.
    I have repeatedly       made use    of all the various iron-stones,
in the   state   of  a fine powder, in order to ascertain what was
the weight lost by each class in its transition from its native
 hue to the first stage of an assumed colour.                   And I am
 enabled to state the following as an average of the results
obtained on this head: Calcareous                iron-stones give        out 6
parts in 100 of the raw mineral;, argillaceous iron-stones,                  55
 and siliceous     iron-stones,    4!.
    If  the   pulverised     iron-stone    is thrown     into a    vessel   red
 hot, this loss will be effected in two minutes.              The change
 of colour     is immediately effected       on those parts in contact
 with  the heated iron.          The whole     is brought     into contact
with it; and when thrown out, the magnet will                      be found
 to have acquired       a  perceptible influence over it.        When the
 powder is first thrown           in,  a slight decrepitating        noise is
 heard for a few seconds.           This operation may also serve to
 shew the presence        of sulphur, or of its acid. When in the
 former state it instantly takes sire, and burns with                  a   dark
 lambent      flame.      When      the acid is present,        it  is    easily
 known     by the suffocating fumes disengaged              by the action
 of heat.
    The application of         heat beyond the first stage        of colour,
 causes the iron.-slone         to pass  through     a variety    of   sliacles.
                                                                        These,

These,       as  in metallic     substances,     are the effects      of the   pre
sence    of air at certain degrees of heat *. As the progressive
dissipation of the volatile mixtures takes effect, the colour
deepens; and, according                 to the nature      of the iron-stone,
becomes         fixed,    of   a  brown, dark brown,             or deep      claret
colour.         These indicate the almost entire expulsion of the
water, acid, &c.             In this    state all iron-stones        are  possessed
of magnetic attraction,             and exhibit the various phenomena
already described,            as being peculiar       to their     respective    na
 tures.
     The methods commonly in use for torrefying iron-stone,
 in the large way, are of two different kinds: that of burn
 ing in kilns or conical furnaces ; and that of exposing iron
 stone in open air, stratified with coals, to combustion.                       The
 former is used in some places in Wales ; the latter is almost
 universally adopted in England, and totally                    so  in Scotland.
      In  the operation        with furnaces, they become filled entirely
 with iron-stone,           except a stratum of coals in the bottom,'
  which is afterwards inflamed.                     The combustion          is their
  carried on by means of a current of air pasting through tins
  furnace,        and   forcing the heat along with it.                 When the
  iron-stone        is deemed sufficiently burnt, the register is slmt
  up j and the combustion,                no longer maintained by means"                 >
  of external air,       soon dies away, and leaves the furnace to cool.'
       The    most    common        method, however,           of burning iron
  stones, consists in levelling a piece              of ground,       and covering'
  ft with a layer        of small pit-coals.         This  is  of various thick
   nesses,    4, 6 or    8  inches, according to the height the pile i-r
   to be built,       and the nature of the iron-stone.                  Upon this
   stratum      of   coals   the pieces      of iron-stone      are imbedded, as
   near to the fame size as possible,               in order that all may            be
   equally acted upon.             These are reared          to various heights,
       • From smooth-surfaced        iron-stones   and ores,   when    exposed  to lient

ceeding      2    inches        in thickness.              Upon      this is reared          the
subsequent           building,       always'       gradually narrowing                itself till
it   has    assumed       the sliape          of   a   stout wedge,          with its       base
resting upon the ground.                    After this           is effected,     the whole
of the external          surface         receives a complete covering                    of the
smallest     sort     of coals.           The pile          is    kindled     by applying
burning coals           to the ground              stratum.        This     creeps        tlowly
along; heats the stone upwards; kindles the second laver
of sm.ill coals, and ultimately inflames the whole mass from-
top to bottom.
     When the coals           arc-   consumed, the pile gradually cools,
and in 8 or 10 days may be wheeled away to the furnace.
     The quantity of iron-stone burnt                            at one time is various
at different         and even at the fame places; some kinds re
quire to be burnt           in smaller heaps,                    owing to their nature
and fusibility.          At     some works' the fires extend              from 50 to'
fro yards;       and it is not uncommon                     to fee skilful workmen,-
at one end,           adding fresh            materials to the              burning        pile;
while others,          at the opposite             end, are employed wheeling
away that        which the       fire has left sufficiently burned for the
purpose     of   the    furnace.           Fires that extend              from 30 to 60
feet in length are more                  common; from              10 to 16 feet          wide/
and about 5 feet high.
     At   most   iron-works          a   local opinion exists, to what dcgreS
of   heat   iron-stone ought to be exposed before it is property
fk for the blast-furnace.                 All, however,            agree     that burning
is necessary     ;    though few give an accurate reason why.                              The
only one     I   have heard adduced                 is,   that iron-stone        is     calcined
in order to burn          out the sulphur and other                          heterogeneous
mixtures.  Hence arise       diversity of opinions, chiefly
                                          a
sounded upon individual notions of the fixity or volatility of
                                                                                      sulphur.

ritlphur.        Some contend that sulphur is easily displaced, and
that therefore the iron-stone          should be moderately calcined;
lest the sulphur from          the coal used in burning           it should
enter, and        again hurt the quality of the iron. On the other
hand, it is       said that sulphur is of difficult expulsion from the
centre of the stone, as it is never seen going off till a bright
red     heat    forcibly expels it   ; and therefore it is highly re
quisite the iron-stone          should be long and violently exposed
 till  the last portion is got rid of.       To   effect  this, therefore^
 the heat, fay they, ought to be urged till such time as the
 stone has indicated signs         of fusion, or    has partially suffered
 thereby.         In order   to give strength     to this opinion,      those
 who adopt it add, that, by such severe calcination, the
 volume of stone is reduced, becomes heavier, and that it will
 consequently occupy less room in the blast-furnace;                         of
 course     it is imagined that, bulk for bulk, the iron-stone
 becomes richeu in iron than when in a raw state.
      Those who are acquainted with the oxydation of metals,
  and the consequent increase          of weight, will    at once discover
 the source       of this error, and readily conceive, that,        after the
  metal in the iron-stone has become partially disengaged by.
  the expulsion of water, carbon acid, sulphur, ice. forming
  frequently       a third part of the whole weight,        it will become
  an object      of attack   to the oxygen       of  the atmospheric       air;
  the combination          of which with the iron alone          adds to the
  actual increase        of weight,    and not the transposition       of the
  particles of metal from one piece of iron-stone to another.
   It   must    also be obvious that,       where such      fallacious pre
  judices have taken rods, the consequences               must frequently
   be fatal to the interests     of ihe manufacturer       ;  as such    iron
   stones,    literally calcined, must require an additional portion
   of  fuel to furnisli carbon to carry      off the  superadded oxygen.
       It is somewhat      remarkable that the phenomena attending
   the oxydation of iron should           be entirely unknown at iron
   manufactories.         Such    a  process  is never    dreamt of, and

 for the increase      of weight,        by asserting     that the earthy
parts are burnt        out and nearly         consumed, and that the
metallic    parts    only    remain,     destroyed     however     in theif
nature and       reduced     to   a cinder.
    We   are not to wonder,         therefore, at the uncertain results
which the untutored manufacturer obtains, until such time
as a long course of experience has taught him, that, by com
bining certain      causes,     good   or bad effects       are the conse
quence.      Even at last he stUl rests upon an unstable              basis :
destitute  of the correct operation of principle, and incapable
of preventing an evil from a total ignorance of its real
source   of action, he can only in the end avoid it after a
multiplicity of movements, wherein he finds his practical
knowledge increased at the expence of a considerable sacri
fice  of property.                                      ,
    How much more enlightened would                   be the mind    of the
manufacturer, were he to attend minutely to the phenomena
developed    in all the    stages   of his  process, and satisfy himself
as to the radical principles       of action in   each individual stage     !
In doing this, chemical minuteness, the terror and butt of
the unphilosophised mind, is not absolutely indispensible j
and yet every thing may be ascertained            necessary to be known
for  the production     of certain determinate qualities of crude
iron.
    He would then         easily    comprehend       that all iron-stones
tontain   less  or more water of crystallisation, and that, being
Combined with         a  certain proportion         of lime neutralised
with carbonic acid, it         is necessary that they be exposed to a
heat sufficient to expel the first and last            of  these as well as
sulphur.     The    reason has already been given,            and the con
sequence shall be once more stated.            The evil   effects produced
by introducing raw iron-stones into the blast-furnace, are less
owing to the small portion of sulphur contained in most of
them, especially in balls, (the vapours of which arise even
from the softest crude iron when fluid,) than to the de
composition      of water and acids,         each     of which    gives  up
                                                                     a pro-

     proportion of oxygen to the metal, chiefly                 before   sepa
  ration is effected.
     Does it not then unquestionably follow, that              if  the quan
  tity of charcoal in the furnace formerly               was    sufficient to
 take   up the oxygen existing in the ore, and to afford car
 bonated crude-iron, that if a further quantity of this princi
 ple is added, by whatever means, part            of  the charcoal      which
 formerly went to carbonate the iron now combines with the
 superadded     oxygen to form carbonic            acid;     of   course    the
 metal will be deprived of its carbon, become white in the
 fracture, and may then justly be denominated oxygenated
 crude-iron.      The fame application to principle would also
 inform    the merely practical man, that when iron-stone is
 completely deprived of those substances which assume the
 gaseous state by the combination            of caloric     at a moderate
 temperature, it is then sufficiently prepared for the furnace.
This is always indicated by the colour which the stone
assumes     varying     from a brown         to a dark claret.          Blues
 always succeed this shade        j  and the smallest        appearance      of
 blue, however light, is a certain sign that the external air
 has made      an    impression   upon the particles of metal, by
superoxygenating them.            Instead    therefore of expelling a
further quantity of heterogeneous matter, a principle is added
 the most noxious and destructive          to the existence        of iron in
 a  metallic form.
     The phenomenon of iron-stone becoming heavier in the
 fire, would no longer be explained by assuming vague as
 sertions    incompatible       with  and    inadmissible to        common
 fense.    Upon finding two         pieces   of iron-stone in the fame

different manner by the heat ; the one heavy,                     of  a black
blueifh colour     ;  the other light and porous          :   the practical
man would now no longer fay that the metal from the
porous piece had escaped by these pores, and entered into
the ponderous one ; and that the accumulation of weight
in the   tatter  was entirely owing to        it abstracting the metal

from the former.            Widely different             indeed      would be the
conclusion.       He now would              have     learned       that uictals are
combustible bodies        ;   that under certain circumstances iron
is one of the most inflammable in the group                          ;   that, during
 its combustion,     it    decomposes          the air that maintains the
 combustion,      and    sixes one        of its     elements        in   spite of   the
 powerful affinity exerted             upon it by the caloric ; and that
 by this process      alone       it increases its volume and weight.
 The porous      mass    of iron-stone would now                    be described as
  having had its iron completely saturated with oxygen at a
  very high temperature         ;   that an imperfect            state  of fusion   had
  been the consequence            ;   and    that a combination               of   these
  circumstances, acting for a considerable                    length of time, had
  volatilised and carried oft' a very considerable                     portion of die
  metal.
      On the   same principle would be explained the increase                          of
  weight in the more ponderous piece                   ;   it would then readily
  be conceived, that the fame             association of circumstances had
  not been present     ;    but that the iron had gained                    in weight
  by the addition of oxygen at a temperature                          short   of  fusing
  and volatilising the oxyd.
      What I     have    further to         state    on this subject (hall be
  forwarded for the next Number of the Philosophical Maga
  zine. In the mean time I sliall subjoin a few remarks
  which may      be considered         in  the   light of      a
    Postscript  to the   Paper on the Principles                of Iron and      Steel.
      In  that paper     (Phil. Mag. Vol. II. p. 165) I stated that
   the carbon which exists in steel is in an elastic or aeriform
   state.   In a long series of experiments which I made on
   the dissolution of crude-iron and                steel    in various       acids and
   in water,   I  always obtained carbon from the former in a

   my search,     and never appeared             till  some days afterwards,            in
   the manner of      a greasy       pellicle, thin aud transparent                 upon
                                                                                      the

the surface           of the fluids.          This circumstance confirmed
what had long been                  evident to me, from a knowledge of the                                j
principles and the mode of conveying them in manufacturing
both these states of iron, that the carbon in crude iron and
that in steel existedin              a   widely different mode of union. And as
in the latter it           existed not        in    a crude state,        I was led     to con
clude that an aeriform chemical union was effected,                                      during
the process of cementing the                             steel, by the          agency of the
caloric on the charcoal, which                           stratifies the bars during the
operation.
   In my       correspondence,                however, with the Editor of                       the1
Philosophical Magazine, he threw out some hints that a
different kind of chemical union might be effected by the
fame agency, and that in steel the carbon might exist in
a concrete           state, though                not crude — neutral,              though not
aeriform.            This combination,                    which      I     had      overlooked,
(humanum             ejl   errare!) appeared              so   highly probable that        I     re
sumed       my experiments;                   and   I     am happy in now stating
that this idea         "was        just, as I       have since obtained from steel
carbon in the              state   of    an impalpable powder, by the follow
ing simple operation.
 I     introduced into              a    glass vessel      a    plate     of    polished    steel,
and poured upon                it    as much            clear rain water as covered               it
three inches.               In this        remained for 50 days, during
                                          state    it
which       time     I     carefully observed the agency of the water
upon the metal.                     Twenty-four hours                   after      introduction,
minute flakes were observed floating lightly in the water                                         ;
they increased on the second and third days, and fell gradu
ally towards the bottom.                      As     these accumulated, the surface
of the water               became        covered with           the same carbonaceous
pellicle mentioned above*,                         exactly resembling the coloured
film which     frequently found floating upon the surface
                     is                                                                           of
springs where iron   precipitated from the carbonic acid.

   *   A   plate of pure malleable            iron      underwent   a    similar    immersion   ill   A
separate   vessel,   but exhibited no disengagement of carbon in this state.

Sis               On the Carton in Iron and Steel.
    During the immersion of the steel, a double affinity was
exerted ; part of the oxygen of the decomposed water united
to the carbon to form carbonic             acid   :  this union was at
aaiy time    highly facilitated by raising the temperature of the
water.      The precipitate and oxyd upon the surface of the
plate then became        covered with transparent        bubbles, which
remained     if the  temperature was decreased} but on the con
trary rose to the top and escaped, if the heat was augmented*
The other affinity excited was that of the oxygen upon the
iron   ; which it slowly oxydated, covering the surface at first
with a slight yellow membrane of the thickness of gold leaf.
 This daily     increased,    and at the end       of fifty  days had ac
quired firmness and consistency.           After carefully drying the
 plate,  I  began to separate the      oxyd from the surface.           This
 easily parted    in scales, and under it      I  found the surface of
 the plate entirely covered with sine carbon, without grease
 or the smallest       asperity.    When      strewed     in  the   fire, it
 sparkled and exhibited the same characters as charcoal.
     This experiment      proves    clearly that carbon exists in        steel
 in  a concrete state, though        not crude — in chemical union,
 however, and not as a mere mixture             as  in crude iron.
     I cannot   conclude this note without                                  *,
 and expressing a hope that the confirmation of this fact may
 lead to a solution     of many of the phenomena attending the
 manufacture of iron.

 and having already inserted enough of what respects   ourselves to stiew that
 we would not willingly disobey his commands,       we hope he will excuse
 this small chasm.    Edit.

XVII. A       remarkable  Case   of internal Pain in       the Heel,,   and i
    an incipient Mortification,    cured by the Inhalation         of Vital
    Air: being the Third Communication from Dr. Thorn
    ton, Physician to the General Dispensary , and Leclurer
   on  Medical Botany at Guy's Hospital, relative                to Pneu
   matic Medicine.
Mi    IRS.   Frith,    æt. 45, wife     of  the Rev.    William Frith,
rector of Kentish Town, for nearly four years experienced
the most violent pain in the neighbourhood                  of  the   heel,
which    she could compare to nothing but the burning                  of a
caustic.     Various outward applications had been made, and
medicines taken internally, without any alleviation.                When
Mr. Cruikstiank, lecturer on anatomy in              the school     of Dr.
Hunter,     called  me into   consultation,       there was extended
over the heel a wound about the size           of  a crown, very dark,
the edges livid; and the feetor from it was so intolerable
that, when her maid had occasion to remove the dressings,
she had always volatilcs applied to the nostrils to prevent her
from fainting.      The countenance         sliewed    a livid' paleness/
the pulse was quick and tremulous,             and the slightest exer
tion produced faintings.      The bark, opium,          and wine, were
continued.      This lady inhaled also fix quarts vital air mixed
with twelve of atmospheric, and in a few days,                 as this re
spectable family can also testify,      the livid hue     of   the wound
disappeared,     it had a more healthy appearance,                and   the
discharge    was   so greatly improved, and fœtor gone, that
when the smelling-bottle was presented to the servant, she
said that there      was  not   the   least occasion      for it.     In  a
fortnight    the sore was completely healed,           the appetite re
 stored,   and   countenance     so  greatly improved that every
friend marked the sudden alteration ; the violence of the in
ternal pain lessened by degrees, and the superoxygenated
 air being continued for a few weeks longer, it altogether
subsided   y  and this lady for these last six months has enjoyed
                               P  3                       uninterrupted

314                              A remarkable         Cure       by
Uninterrupted health, and is able, at pleasure,                                     to walk up
Highgate-hill.
  As many persons might                     wish      to see the lady's             journal in
her own words,             I   here subjoin         it,   with   a    few observations.
     " September          13. 1798.    First inhaled the vital air.                             Felt
acute spasms         in   the chest, and fainted."
     Observation.           Artificial inhalation                is   accompanied with
increased       action of the intercostal muscles, and gives fre
quently        afterwards         a     sensation     of muscular pain, which
speedily       goes off,          and    after    a   few trials does not appear
again. The           second effect we always fee                      in   those very weak,
and hence the expression of                    " being     overpowered              by   the   air."
Patients labouring under scurvy,                          if   suddenly         exposed         to   a
clear air, are killed instantaneously.
     "
     September 15. Felt       most pleasant glow after the in
                                           a
halation of the vital air. Spirits also much increased, feeling
as   if  a   great weight, or oppression,                 was removed.
     " September           16.      The     hardness       about the heel gone,                      as
also the fœtor.            Has      less discharge.            The wound looks                  red
der.         The glow      after the inhalation             of the vital air              lasts for
about     a   quarter of an hour.
     " September           18.      The glow, and spirits, after the                      last   in
halation,       lasted four           hours.        Feel wonderfully                light, and
pleasant.
     " September           20.     Asked by my apothecary,                      '   Whether      I
did not feel, from the inhalation of the vital air, an uncom
fortable      beat   ?'     My      answer was, that             it    produced          the most
pleasant glow imaginable,                   not at all resembling beat."
     Observation.              Putting the thermometer under the tongue,
the sensible heat was not increased.                              This       effect may per
haps be accounted for from the increased                                   sensibility     of the
nerves; or, does the insensible perspiration raised                                  by   the ca
pillaries of the          stein   being filled        by   the greater energy                  of the
heart, account for this phenomenon better                                   ?I    have almost
invariably found the inside                      of the palm of the hand, after,
                                                                                                 and

                       Inhalation  of Vital Air.                    215
and during the inhalation,        break out in   a pleasant   moisture,
which are parts somewhat remote from the heart.
    "   October 4. The pain in the heel infinitely more lively.
The pain is a new pain ; but, thanks be to God ! it remits
for three or four hours every day."
    These are the chief particulars: the nature of your Maga
zine may not admit of        a further detail, nor does the nature
of  the cafe seem to require it.
    General Observation.         The change of colour in the
wound, so immediately after the inhalation of the vital air,
seems to indicate a remarkable change wrought in the blood.
It   is not, however, the temporary increase           of oxygen only
in the system, that this partial inhalation produces ; for it
renders the blood also more attractive of this principle.
Hence the continuance          for some time, even in London,
among people of fashion, of the good looks acquired in the
country ; hence the pallid countenance of the man lately re
covered     from suffocation, or drowning      ;   and hence also the
return     of the breath in patients        under this       treatment
being more and more noxious, from a greater                 absorption
of oxygeni         The deterioration of the air inspired, has
ever indicated the attractive p6wer of the blood.               Hence
also   it is that substances    abounding in hydrogen are called
cordials, from their sympathetic action on the heart, through
the medium of the blood : but in the superoxygenated air
we have a more direct action on the heart, without exhaust
ing the irritable principle, and occasioning indirect debility?
 and I trust' I (hall be able to make it evident to. the unpre
judiced mind,       that this is a great desideratum        in  surgery
 and    medicine, more especially      where     diseases  are remote
 from the heart ; or else, why do we      so  frequently hear of sore
 legs,   but never of fore arms ?       But, however the modus
 operantti of these new powers may be, the observance of saQs
 is of greater importance ; and I here beg leave publicly to
thank     thdfe ingenious medical gentlemen who have honour
ed me      with their correspondence    on this subject,      the result
of which will     be laid before the philosophic world.

geological observations on the different states in which trees
are found in the earth, by Mr. Joseph Serra de Correa.
   The    meetings    of March 7th and 14th         were occupied in
reading a curious paper on hermaphrodites;             which contains

but not transferable, of      free admission       to all public    philoso
phical lectures and experiments.
    Each, annual subscriber's tickets will be for one year, but
not transferable.
    Subscribers for life, and annual subscribers,            as  well  as the
 proprietors of the Institution,      will  be entitled to have copies
 or drawings      (made    at their own expence)            of any of the
 models in. the repository, and this even when such copies are
 designed for the uso     of their friends;       and workfliops      will be
 prepared, and workmen provided under the direction of the
 managers for executing such work properly, and at reason
 able prices.
    Persons employed in executing work after                    any of the
 models, will, on the recommendation of any subscriber,                    be
 allowed access to such model as often as shall              be necessary     :
 and such    of them  as shall be    willing    to furnish to buyers any
 article exhibited in the repository,          will   be allowed to place
 a specimen     in the   repository,^  with his name           and place    of

the managers.
     The    design     or object of the Institution                    is   not to give
rewards to the authors of ingenious inventions, but to dif
fuse the knowledge of such improvements as bid fair to be
of general         use,      and to facilitate the general introduction                    of
them   ;    and to excite and             assist   the ingenious and the enter
prising by the diffusion of science, and                       by   awakening       a   spirit
of inquiry.
   In order that           the proprietors          of the Institution, and the
subscribers, may have the earliest notice of all new disco
 veries     and    useful       improvements that shall                 be ma<le        from
 time to time, not only in this country,                             but also in all the
different parts of the world, the managers will employ the
proper means for obtaining, as early as possible, from every
 part of the British empire, and from all foreign countries,
 authentic accounts of all such new and interesting discoveries
 in the various branches of science, and in arts and manu
 factures, and also of all such new and useful mechanical
 improvements as shall be made                    room will be set
                                                    ;    and     a
 apart in the Institution,  where   all  such  information will be
 lodged,  and where       will be kept
                                 it     for  the  sole and exclusive
 use and inspection of the proprietors and subscribers, and
 where no stranger will ever be admitted.
      Several resolutions adopted                   at   a   general    meeting of the
 proprietors, held at the house of the Right Honourable Sir

                                 COW-POX.
    WE     have already given an account             of Drs, Jenncr         and
Pearson's      publications     on   the cow-pox,        which     tended     to
establish    the important        fact, that those who have had that
disease,   which never       proves fatal, and     which may always be
so   managed     as  never to disfigure the patient, are not capable
of afterwards taking the sinall-pox infection                — a fact  which,
if  properly followed up, promises            fair to extirpate the latter
disease, to which more have fallen victims than to the pesti
lence itself.       Drs.  Pearson,    Jenner,     and   Woodville, with         a
zeal that does them great honour, have since bestowed much
attention and labour in ascertaining, by proper trials, how
 far it is prudent to persevere in substituting a disease that
 has hitherto appeared          no way dangerous,           for one     that   so
 often proves mortal       ;  and, we are happy to add, with             a suc
 cess equal to the most sanguine          expectations that could have
 been formed       : in consequence      of which, the following cir
 cular letter has been addressed        to the gentlemen of the faculty:
                                           Leicester Square, March     it,  1799.
          S 1r,
     I  hope you     will pardon me for taking the liberty to inform
 you, by way of additional evidence to the testimonies I have
 published on the subject of the cow-pox, that upwards of one
 hundred and sixty patients, from two weeks to forty years of
  age, principally infants, have been inoculated since the twen
  tieth of January last by           Dr. Woodville and myself              sepa
  rately. — I shall    at present only communicate the following
  observations    :
      I. Not    one mortal case occurred.        — %. Not      one  of the    pa
  tients was considered to be dangeroufly            ill.— 3. Although the
  extreme cases      of the   severe kind      which     ordinarily occur in
  the same number of           cases  in the inoculated sinall-pox did
  not occur in the above practice, and although many                     of the
  patients were even more slightly disordered                constitutionally,
  yet the whole amount          of the constitutional       illness seemed to
  be as great as in the fame number of patients in the inocu
                                                                            lated

  324                            The new tnseS.
  lated  small-pox.—4. None of the patients, namely,                       above
  sixty, hitherto inoculated for the sinall-pox, subsequently                   to
 the vaccine disease, took the infection.              — 5. One of the most
 important facts is, that the local affection in the inoculated
 part, on the whole, was            less considerable,     and   of shorter du
 ration than in the inoculated               small-pox. —6. In          many of
 the   cases   eruptions on the body appeared,                some     of which
 could not be distinguished from the small-pox.
     I  have sent the matter            of the cow-pox         pustule    on the
 thread    inclosed, in order,        if you  approve     of the inquiry,       to
inoculate with it ; and           I entreat  you to favour me with the
 result  of your trials   :   but   I must   trouble you to apply the test
 of inoculating with variolous matter              subsequently      to the vac
 cine disorder.
                      I have     the honour to be, &c. &c. &c.
                                                               G. Pearson.
     P. S.   I   am happy to be able            to   state, that at Berkeley
Dr. Jenner       has continued his trials          of inoculation with vac
cine matter, sent       from London, with good success. — I should
have given you        a  more circumstantial account              of the cases
here alluded to, but           I   think it   unnecessary,     as Dr. Wood-
ville has    a  pamphlet in the press on the subject.
                           THE NEW INSECT.
    IN   our last we informed our readers that             a  new infect had
appeared      within    these few years          in this country, which
threatens      the  entire destruction of all our apple-trees, if
means be not generally followed                for extirpating it.        In  the
hurry of the press a material ingredient was omitted in                      Mr.
Fors\ th's recipe     :  we therefore reprint         it more correctly.
     R. To     100 gallons     of human urine          and  1  bushel    of lime
add cow-dung        to bring it to the consistence os           paint.     With
this composition anoint the trees.               The    present is the proper
season for applying it.            If  the white efflorescence-like sub
stance    in which the      insects are lodged has made             its appear-*
ance, it should previously be bruslied off.

I.       Observations     on   Living Animals found                inclosed in Stones
     and other solid Substances. By F. W. A. Murhasd.
     From Magazin fur das neueste aus der Phyfik. Vol. XI.
o,   "F living animals being found inclosed in solid masses, I
have met with no mention in the works of the ancients.
Martial, indeed, in one of his epigrams, speaks of insects
inclosed in amber ; but these animals were dead, and there
fore do not belong to this subject.                        As far as       I    know,   Ful-
gos
         * is the    first author who makes mention                   of       a living toad
being found inclosed              in   a stone.          He wrote about             the be
ginning of the sixteenth century ; and the circumstance took

of       poisonous      frogs being found in stones, but which soon

inclosed          in an elm           as    thick      as    a man's body.                     As       soon as
the trunk was cleft the animal dropped out, and no opening
could be discovered through which it had got in to the heart

 what spongy nature, found in great abundance in the Adri
 atic Sea, and of which there               are some     also   in the port of
 Civita Vecchia.          These   sea dates,    which are     a kind of mus
 cles, are almost round, pointed at both ends, and consist                     of
 two sliells which open on one side, and are from one or two
 to nearly four inches in length.               1 he shell is of the fame
quality    as   that of the common             muscle, but it is a 'little
browner and        less smooth      on the outside.        The inside has a
somewhat silvery appearance.                The   fish which they contain
is white, delicate, fat, and          of a very   agreeable      taste, so that
it  is a morsel for     a  cardinal (un boccone di cardinale).             They
 are called    dates,     because the (hell which contains              the  fish
 has   a great   resemblance       to the dates     of Barbary when they
are ripe and dried.          The    stone  in which they are inclosed is
heavy and pretty           solid, though it appears spongy.                 The
cavity which         the   shell occupies in the stone, and which
it exactly fills, touches it on all sides like the best fitted cafe.
Some small ones are not half an inch in length, but others
are four inches.          When the fishermen had procured a suffi
cient number of the stones, they placed them on the edge of
the quay, and broke them by means of a large hammer. In
 some they found nothing, but others contained two or three
dates.     They gave some of them to me, together with frag
ments of the stone which inclosed them, and on which I
made the above observations."
     Instances of a similar kind may be found also in various
other works.          Thus   we are told      that Charles Hall, a mer
chant at Eberach, saw a living             toad sitting    in   a stone, upon
its being broken.         Martin Weinreich *         relates a circumstance
of   the like kind ; and       John Nardius       t  fays, that he found       in
a block    of marble      a living snake.       Libavius     speaks    of vipers

  toad was found           in   an oak by Seigne         in  1731, and another         in
  a hard stone, at Ecretteville, by                  Le Prince in 1756*.
      A   great many particulars relating to this subject have been
  collected by Guettard.                 A    common toad, two of whose feet
  were free, and the other two sticking fast                     in gypsum,     so  that
  it was     impossible       to disengage them without tearing them to
  pieces, was sent to             him by order of the Duke of Orleans.
   Count Hermann               II. of Hatzfeld,        told Dr. Sachsen t that he
   heard a living frog croak in the middle of a stone at hi*
   palace      of Schellenberg,           near Cologne, and that the animal
   hopped out on the stone bursting of itself.                       I  shall now give
   a  few other instances, of which Guettard makes no mention.
       In   the year 1733 a living toad was found by                        J. M. Gra-
   berg in a solid hard block of stone, dug up from a quarry in
   the parish        of Wamblingebo, in Gothland, and which he
   caused to        be broken by the workmen.                   The colour of the
   animal was blackish grey,                  a  little spotted on the back, and
   somewhat          fainter on the belly.               Its  eyes were       small   and
   round, and covered by a tender skin or film, under which
   they seemed to sparkle               a  little with a colour like that of pale
   gold.        Having      touched       it on the head with a stick, it con
   tracted       its eyes as       if it   had been asleep         :   as soon    as the-
    stick   was      removed,        it gradually       opened    them ; but moved
.   neither its body nor              sect in the      least, though he touched          it
    different times.             He remarked          also that the mouth had no
    aperture.         It was      covered with a yellowisli skin,              which    he
    examined also with the stick, but he was not able to make it

water issued from it behind,              upon which      it immediately
died *.      Don Antonio de Ulloa, who with Condamine,
Bouguer and Godin, was employed in measuring a degree of
the meridian in Peru, saw at Madrid two worms which had
been found      in the middle of        a block  of marble by the king
of Spain's statuary.          Misson, in his Travels through Italy,
speaks of a living crab found in a piece of marble near Ti-
voli.      M.  Peysonnel, physician to the king of France, hav
ing employed some workmen to dig a well near his house in
Guadaloupe, they found living frogs amidst the strata of the
rock.       His curiosity being      excited   by this circumstance, he
descended into the well himself, bored              into the rock, and
brought up alive some green frogs,              which had    a perfect      re
semblance      to the common ones.
     In the Gentleman's Magazine for 1756 mention                     is made
of   a living toad found in a block          of marble,    at an old castle
belonging to Lord Tankerville,            twelve miles north-west from
Alnwickf.          T. Whiston        relates, that in the year 1743 a
 stone-cutter named Charlton found near Wifbich,                        in the
 Isle of Ely, a living toad inclosed            in a piece    of marble       J.
 Being called to the spot, he saw the animal, and the cavity in
which it was contained. The latter was somewhat larger
 than the toad, and had almost the same figure. The animal
 was of    a dark yellow colour      ;  and the solid marble,     which in
closed it on all sides, was several inches thick.              It  seemed to
 be quite healthy,        and by its long confinement had not be
 come meagre.          John Malpas also, in the year 1 755, found
 a  living toad    inclosed in a piece of free-stone at Great Yar
 mouth §. The hole in which it lay was six inches distant
 from the corner of the stone.             He took it out with a pair of

 placed it on the ground             it however crept about, but died
 in the    course   of   an hour.         It had a yellow      stripe over the
 back, the colour of which became changed after it was dead.
 No crack or cleft could          be discovered       in the stone.      The in
 side  of the cavity was smooth, and looked                 as  if it  had been
 polished.
     M.   Gerhard,       at Padenburg,         in the county of Mansfeld,
 saw likewise a      living   toad    inclosed in a stone. The cavity in
 which it lay seemed exactly fitted to the size of the animal,
 but was exceedingly smooth in the inside.                         No opening
 could be observed          through which it was possible for it to
 have got into the stone. Aster some search, however, a hole
 was discovered at the surface            of the earth, which       extended to
 the depth       of  twelve     toises; but ceased at the distance              of
 thirteen inches above             the cavity that contained the toad.
 M.   Gerhard considers          it  as very probable that this aperture
 had formerly extended to the cavity,                 into which      the egg   of
 a toad might        have    been conveyed          by water;      and   that the
 opening must afterwards have been closed up near the cavity.
 The toad, however,            must have remained long in this state;
 for such apertures        do not close up soon,           and a long time is
 required for the petrifaction of earthy particles                *.
     M.   le Cat  f,   who relates many instances of the like kind,
 examines the possibility of them, and thecauses of such phe
 nomena.        Some philosophers have been               of opinion, that the
 eggs   of  these animals, created           by the Supreme Being at the
  beginning of      the world, and floating about on the watery
 expanse,      have    since   that time been inclosed in the interior
 parts   of   the rocks.       But    M.   le  Cat contradicts this opinion
_by remarking that           the    creation of an egg is not sufficient,
  and that it must         be   hatched in order to produce               a living
  creature.      He   considers     it also   as impossible     that such ani

 mals can be of the fame antiquity                   as the stones          or substances
 in which they          are found.        The   age       of    the oldest men, fays
 he, never       exceeded
                    169 years;                   and           what is the life of an
 infect when compared with that of man                               ?   Even     if   we sup
 pose that the moderation of these animals, and their being
 exposed to very little motion, had caused their growth and
 the periods of their life to be extended in an uncommon
 degree ;      and though their want      of air, or rather their being
 preserved and defended          from the manifold impressions of that
 corrupted element, had contributed a great deal to their
 support, the prolongation of life thence arising could not
 exceed so very much, their natural and usual existence.                                    M.
 le Cat rather thinks           that a hatched egg,                      in all the cafes
 mentioned,        may have       fallen by chance into some                              small
 cavity, where it was secured from petrifaction                              till its      sub
 stance acquired sufficient strength.                     He        here   remarks that
 eggs, when rubbed over with varnish so as to be defended
 from the effects of the air, may be preserved fruitful for
 years ; and he therefore believes,              on good grounds, that an
 egg so secured in the centre         of a rock might retain                    it? activity
 for some thousands of years,              and even that it would be im
possible for it to be hatched till it had been exposed to                                a very
high degree of often renewed or long continued heat.                                       Ac
cording to      M.     le Cat's opinion      it is       the egg which is              of great
antiquity,       and    not the animal.              I   sliall here observe that
nature, when allowed peace and rest, does not require                                        so
much time as is generally believed                          in order         to        produce
minerals.       Of   the truth   of this remark             I   am fully convinced,
since   I   saw in the museum at Gottingen the step                          of    a    ladder
found on clearing the gallery of a mine in Ramroelsberg,
abandoned at most about 100 years before, and which in the
course of that period had been encrusted with selcnite seven
inches in thickness. Nay we have instances of ore having
grown up in a much shorter time *,

       I must observe            also, that most       of the animals found in this
manner were of the amphibious kind, and request the reader
to reflect on the habits, nature and mode of living peculiar
to that class.              Caldesi relates, that tortoises can endure hun
ger for half a year; and numberless instances might be pro
duced of their strong and tough nature.
       I   shall not enlarge farther on this subject at present,                                    as   I
mean at some future period to communicate my ideas to the
public in a more connected manner, and to give as complete
a theory on it as possible.                      I   flatter myself that                  I   am the
more qualified for this task, as many have written on these
phenomena and formed conjectures without                                             having ever
seen one instance,                while     I   have been an eye witness                      of   some
of the        latest.       In   a quarry not far from Cassel, between that
city and the palace                     of Freyenhagen,                I   found three toads
together in           a   pretty large block of free-stone *.                        I   remember,
also, that, when a boy, our house at Cassel being under repair,
and  the old plaster pulled down,                            several toads were found
between it and the stone wall f.
       At    a   period like the present,               when           so    many things are
made the subject               of experiment, when every one endeavours
to tread in the             footsteps of a Bacon and a Newton, and, in
stead        of being        contented          with surveying Nature in her pri
vate recesses       carefully watching her progress, compels
                          and
her as it were to labour and make known her secrets, I am
much astonished that                     she    has not been put to the proof                            in
this respect long ago.                      Such experiments,                  without         which
all theory must ever remain mere hypotheses,                                        and can never
amount to demonstration, would require little or no expence.

 II.    Observations
                         on Snow and     Rain ; their Influence on Ve
     getation, and their Combination with Oxygen.               By J. H.
      Hassenfratz. From Journal de L'Ecole Polytech^
      nique,   P. IF.
  x\LL        those who      inhabit   parts of the earth exposed to
  snow, agree in considering this meteor as one of the means
  employed by nature to give to plants more strength, and to
  make them expand with more vigour.                   Several even    are
  persuaded that winters which produce no snow presage a bad
  harvest and a feeble state       of vegetation j and they ascribe its
  influence to the salts which they fay exist in that congealed
  water. Snow collected in large masses, melted and evapo
   rated  in earthen     vessels, having left no residuum, has made
   this supposition be considered         as a mere    chimera;    and, in
   consequence     of  reasoning   carried too far, some have been in
   duced to deny that snow has any influence at all on vege
   tation.
       In phenomena transmitted through successive generations,
    we must distinguish the results of observation from the ex
    planations some have attempted to give of them. There are
    phenomena, indeed, the whole of which present themselves
    to our fenses     in their full force,     and which     can leave no
    doubt in the mind of the least attentive          observer ; but there
    are others which       exhibit only a few traces that cannot be
                                                                        dis-

 134                 Influence  of Snow and Rain
 distinguished, unless      by particular instruments, or after a
series   of  observations   often repeated.        When      these traces
have    been observed     by  a great   number       of individuals,   for
several generations,       however incorrectly         transmitted,   and
however obscure may be the tradition, the philosopher must
beware of deciding too rashly. The greater the number of
observers,     the more perfect is the uniformity          of their opi
nions respecting the phenomenon,               and    the more careful
ought people to be in their discussions before they venture to
contradict them.
   The influence of snow on vegetation has been subjected
to the examination of too many observers, to allow us to be
lieve  it possible that there could be so great an         uniformity in
their opinions, were not the effects really such as are sup
posed.      In this memoir, then, I shall examine these effects ;
I shall   endeavour to explain the cause of them, and (hall en
quire what relation there is between the explanation given
Jong ago by farmers and a more accurate analysis of snow.
   That, after    a very cold and very severe winter, itegetation is
stronger     and more active in proportion as plants have been
covered    with  a greater depth   of snow is     a certain fact, proved
by the result of the experience of every one engaged in agri
culture. The cause is simple and natural.                 All plants are
capable    of supporting cold in    a less or a greater degree ; there
are some      which cannot     be exposed     to    the temperature     of
melting ice without perishing, and there are others on which
the most intense      cold produces no alteration.            Each plant
then has certain limits       to its resistance      of cold ;  a certain
temperature beyond which          it cannot    be exposed to     it with
out the danger of being frozen              and     destroyed.    Several
plants exposed to a temperature nearly equal to that which
must congeal them do not perissi, but, by the sharpness of the
cold which they experience,         contract    a  languishing disease,
the effects of which they feel during the whole course of
their existence.
    If we   expose to the action     of great cold    a series  of plants
                                                                  capable

in that series greater number in proportion as the cold has
                     a
been greater        ;    but     if,    by   means         of   a    covering, we intercept
the cold, and prevent the plants from being exposed to                                           a   di
minution of heat as great                       as that      which       exists without,             se
veral    plants which would                     otherwise have perished will be
preserved     ;     several      of    those which would have been diseased
will    be    healthy and vigorous,                        and their number will be
greater in proportion              as the       covering has intercepted                 a   greater
degree       of cold.
    The earth         has    heat accumulated in its interior parts
                             a                                                                         :
this heat      is   perceived in all subterranean places of sufficient
depth to prevent the external cold or heat from penetrating
thither.  This temperature     equal to 130 on the decimal
                                                     is
scale   of    the mercurial thermometer (55*4
                                         Fahr.). Snow                                                  is
a bad conductor of heat  cold penetrates   with difficulty,
                                            ;                            it
and its temperature when   melts    zero. When the sur
                                                it              is
face    of the earth           is      covered        to    a    considerable          depth with
snow, the cold of the atmosphere,                         in contact with                   it,   tends
to cool its mass         ;     and the          internal heat of the earth                  tends to
warm it.            Through            the mass           of snow there        is      then   a   con
test    of   heat and cold,             the usual result of which                   is   to melt          a
portion of the snow, and to carry to zero the temperature                                              of
the middle, in which the plants arc situated.
     Thus      snow has the property                   of keeping the plants which
it   covers       at the temperature                  of melting ice of preserving
                                                                              ;
 them from the influence                         of   a    greater      cold   ;   of supplying
 them with continual moisture                         ;     of preventing          a   great num
 ber from perishing, and                        still more from           languishing;               and,
 consequently, of giving more                             strength      and vigour           to vege
 tables       than they would have obtained had they not been
 covered       with     snow.          It   appears then that we may explain                              a
 part of the influence which snow has upon vegetation,                                            with
 out having recourse to the salts or nitre which  said to                              it   is
 contain, and which analysis and experiments have proved
 do not exist.
                                                                                                     The

 i$6                  Influence  of Snow and Rain
    The explanation of the influence of snow by the continual
humidity it supplies to plants, is the result of observations
which cannot have escaped intelligent farmers in all ages ;
but a knowledge of the influence it has by being a bad con
ductor of heat, is the consequence of experiments recently
made on caloric.         The ancients had neither      a series  of facts
nor instruments proper for such researches.            They   observed,
that the atmosphere         rusted metals   in the   fame manner as
acids ; from     which they concluded, that the air contained an
acid.     They remarked, that nitre was formed spontaneously
on calcareous masses ; from which they concluded, that the
acid of the atmosphere was a nitre : and this conclusion was
not far from the truth, since the latest experiments, and most
remarkable discoveries which have contributed in the highest
degree to the rapid progress       of physics, have proved      that the
air is formed of two elements, which enter into the compo
sition of the nitric acid, viz. oxygen and azot.             Let us ac
knowledge,      therefore, that the philosophers who preceded
us   possessed  no little acuteness and sagacity to be able to dis
cover,    so  long ago, by the accumulation of several indirect
experiments, what the most accurate analysis demonstrates
at present.
   If   snow   possessed   only the property    of  preserving     vege
tables, and    of preventing them from perishing by the severity
of  the  cold, it is not at all probable that the ancient philoso
phers would have considered          it  as depositing on the earth
nitrous salts,   as they might have ascertained,     by   a very simple
experiment, that it contains none         of that  salt ; for they did
not ascribe the same property to rain-water,              but they re
marked that snow burnt the skin in the manner of acids,                 an
well as other bodies immersed in it.         Being induced to con
clude that there was nitre in the air, it was natural that they
should ascribe to this nitre the burning qualities of snow, and
consequently its influence on vegetation.
   C. Guyton having          engaged me to examine the cause            of
the difference     of  the effects  of snow and rain-water on va
                                                                    rious

                               on Vegetation.                         237
rious substances,       I found    that they were occasioned       by the
oxygenation of the snow ; and that these effects were to be
ascribed to a particular combination of oxygen in this con
gealed water.        I  put 1000 grammes         of snow in ajar, and
1000 grammes of distilled water in another.                 I poured into
each of      the  jars  an  equal quantity    of  the   fame   solution of
turnsole.      I placed both the jars in a warm temperature, and,
 after the snow melted,          I  remarked that the dye was redder
 in the snow water than in the distilled water. I repeated
 this experiment, and with the fame result.               I put into a jar
  1000 grammes          of  distilled  water,  and  into    another 1000
  grammes      of  snow.     Into   each of the      I
                                                jars put 6-$ grammes
  of very pure      and   clean sulphat of iron.       In the first there
  was precipitated 0*150         grammes of the oxyd of iron, and
  o*oio grammes in the other.            As the oxyd of iron was pre
  cipitated from a      solution of the sulphat by oxygen, it thence
  follows, that the snow contained more oxygen than the dis
  tilled water ; and it follows from the first experiment, that
  this quantity of oxygen was considerable             enough to redden
  the tincture of turnsole.
      It is fully demonstrated     by these two experiments, that snow
   is oxygenated water, and that it must              consequently have
   on vegetation an action different from that           of common ice.
   The experiments of Dr. Ingenhouss, on the germination of
   feeds, have taught us that the presence and contact             of oxy
   gen are absolutely necessary for the plant to expand. They
   have shewn also that the more abundant the oxygen is the
   more rapidly will the feeds grow.            Most plants suffered to
    attain to their perfect maturity shed on the earth a part             of
    their seed.     These seeds, thus abandoned and exposed to the
    action of cold, are preserved by the snow which covers them,
    at the fame time that they find in the water, it produces by
    melting, a portion of oxygen that has a powerful action on
    the principle of germination, and determines the feeds that
    would have perished to grow, to expand, and to augment the
    number of the plants that cover the surface of the earth.

    Frimaire (end of September to end of December)                          ; several
    of these   seeds     germinate before the cold commences its action
    upon them and changes the principle of their life.    The
    snow which covers the rest, acting on the germ by its oxy-
    genation, obliges them to expand and to increase the num
    ber of useful plants which the farmer and gardener commit
    to the earth, and consequently to multiply their productions.
         Here then we         have three effects      of   show upon vegetation,
.   all very different, which contribute each separately to in
    crease, every year, the number of our plants ; to give them
    more vigour, and consequendy to multiply our crops. These
    effects are : 1 . To prevent the plants from being attacked by
    the cold, and from being changed or perishing by its force.
    2.    To furnish       vegetables        with continual moisture, which
    helps them to procure those substances necessary for their
    nutrition, and to preserve them in a strong healthy state.
    3. To cause a greater number of seeds to germinate, and con
    sequently to increase the number of our plants.
         Before   I    conclude,       I   must mention some important expe-»
    riments,      in    regard     to vegetation,     which    I   made on rain
    water.     Rain-water   does not act on tincture of turnsole or
    on sulphat   of iron like snow ; from which it would appear
    that it does not participate in that property which it acquires
    by oxygenation.              Rain-water,    however, contains oxygen
    also ; but    in   a state   of solution, and not of combination, as in
    snow; for under an exhausted                    receiver   rain-water      suffers
    air to escape from         which contains proportions of oxygen
                                 it,
    much     greater      than river water, spring water, and even
    atmospheric air.

100 parts   of atmospheric air.       Air drawn     from the water      of
the Seine, tried by the same eudiometer, gave the same di
minution.      Air   drawn from rain water was, on the other
hand, diminished by phosphorus from 0*33 to 0-40. As the
mean of    a great number of experiments was 0*35, it thence
follows that the proportion          of oxygen in the air obtained
from rain water, newly fallen, is greater and more consider
able than that contained in atmospheric air, and in the air
of other water.
    Since rain water thus differs from common water by the
oxygen it holds in solution, and since oxygen has an influ
ence on germination,         and even on vegetation, as is proved
by the experiments of Ingenhouss and Senebier, it is natu
 ral to ascribe to it a part of the peculiar action which rain
 has on the vegetation     of plants different from that of other
water with which they are watered.

  ra.AVING        in the former part of this paper stated the ave»
 rage loss   which the various natures of iron-stones sustain
 when exposed       to torrefaction   in external air, I shall now
 simply  state the quantity of oxygen which the various classes
 are apt to imbibe when exposed to a high temperature, after
 those volatile mixtures     capable   of assuming     the gaseous state
 by the combination of caloric have been expelled.
    The facility with which iron-stones become oxydated is
 entirely dependent upon the nature of the mixture constitut
 ing fusibility or otherwise    :  so  that were     argillaceous, cal
 careous,   and siliceous iron-stones, previously de-oxygenated,
 exposed to the same degree       of heat  —a   degree capable   of oxy-
 dating their iron — the result      would be, that the quantity of
 oxygen combined would be in a relative              proportion to the
                                                               fusibility

fusibility of the mixtures, for a determinate space of time.
The argillaceous iron-stone would             be found in a given time
to have gained least ; the calcareous          a larger portion ;     while
the siliceous,    containing an assemblage of mixture fusible             at
a degree     of  heat   in which the former would remain un
changed, will be found to have gained the greatest weight ;
but if exposed to an high temperature for a sufficient length
of time,    the oxygen absorbed will be in an exact proportion
to the iron contained in the stone          ;  only, the siliceous iron
stones arrive soonest at a high pitch          of combination.       In the
course of many experiments          I  have found the following pro
portions to be nearly just, when the quantity of iron con
tained in the respective stones was nearly analogous.
    Argillaceous iron-stone, which has yielded me 38 per cent,
in the assay-furnace, first distilled and afterwards carefully
de-oxygenated, increased          in weight, during        an exposure to
ignited gas for       8  hours in the bottom of a          deep crucible,
22 per cent.
    Calcareous iron-stone, which afforded              a similar quantity
of metal,     and  which    was subjected to the same train         of pre
paration, to dispel its volatile mixtures, and unfix its oxygen,
gained in weight nearly 23 per cent.
    Siliceous iron-stones, containing from 36 to 38 parts of
Iron in 100, treated in the fame manner, afforded me instan
 ces  of an accumulation       of weight    equal to 24 to 25 per cent.
    In order more particularly        to illustrate the double pheno
 menon of iron-stones first losing and then gaining weight,
 I (hall  insert the     treatment of one particular stone of each
 class ; from which a positive judgment may be formed                 of the
 general   operation, and results, peculiar lo each.
     1. There were introduced          into an iron       test some pieces
 of argillaceous iron-stones, weighing              -        -   1750 grs.
    After being    exposed to a bright       red heat for 8
 hours, and then allowed to cool, they weighed                   1160
    Lost in simple distillation           -           -       -   590 grs.

     The   stone had now assumed a claret colour, and was pos
 sessed   of regular internal            fibres, adhesive    to    the tongue,
 obedient to the magnet, and exhibiting every property pecu
 liar to excellent iron-stone.
     I returned the     residue,    which, as   above, weighed        1160  grs<
 and exposed       it in an open          crucible for 4 hours
 to an increasing heat till a flight degree of fusion
 was perceived       to take place.         This was indicated
 by the angles       of   the pieces becoming rounded,
 and swelling       a   little in bulk — When cool they
 were found slightly porous, and weighed                        -    1309

    Equal     to   12*8     per cent.       Specific gravity in this       state
    The fracture of the            pieces    now wore a femi-vitrisied ap
pearance,      of   a dark blue colour, refractory to part, inad
hesive to the tongue, unmagnetic,                 but much more metallic
and ponderous.             A  calcareous iron-stone        treated after    the
fame     manner, of which              I also  used small    pieces,    weigh
ing              -                                                   1750  grs.
which      had yielded a similar product            in iron in
 the assay-furnace         with the former, when cool
weighed              -                                          -    1090
    Lost in simple          distillation    equal  to 37-7 per

    The fracture of this iron-stone was now of a bright brown
colour, streaked with lime, faintly marked with internal
fibre,   less  tenacious to the tongue than the former class,
but equally obedient to themagne-t.

a flight        indication      of   fusion    was   observed ;
when cooled, the pieces weighed                        -        -    1233

     In its present state          this iron-stone,      in point of colour,
resembled         the former.
     Its fracture, however, was             smoother, and more vitrified,
equally destitute           of tenacity to the tongue,         and obedienctf
 to the magnet.
     3.   An iron-stone, which contained               a  large proportion of
 sand, was        exposed under similar circumstances to the fame
 degree     of   heat — Quantity         used weighed also       -    1750 grs.
     When properly torrefied, weighed                     -      -    1248

     The     appearance       which     this stone had assumed was of a
 reddish,      small,     granulated fracture, considerably magnetic,
  but scarcely       possessing   any degree of adhesion to the tongue.
      The    residue, weighing as above                -          -   1248    gr?.
 was exposed to an equal                 degree   of  heat   with

      The colour of         the stone was now changed           to a black, vi-
  trescent, slightly porous mass, hard and refractory.                     I have
   not given the specific           gravities of the two last natures           of
   stones :     iron-stones containing          equal    portions of iron,- in
   similar    states    of preparation, vary little in their        specific gra

    It will no doubt      be observed, that the increase       of weight
 in  these statements     tally not with the sums formerly given :
the amounts there adduced are results from iron-stones which
had     been previously deprived        of most  of their oxygen ; but
in    these,   the- extra    quantity of oxygen taken up by the
stone is only given, forming an aggregate, with              the original
existing quantity,      as   stiall hereafter be shown, nearly cor
responding to the sums first given.
    From these experiments, singled out to convey a just idea
of  the changes to which iron-stone may be subjected, it be
comes obvious,        that all the varieties     of iron-stone    are ca
pable    of decomposing atmospheric air at a certain tempe
rature, and of fixing a portion of its oxygen, whereby weight
is gained, by each, nearly equal to i-8th of its origina.
quantity.
    It  must also from      this appear obvious, that the burning
of iron-stone     is an operation — though hitherto conducted          by
chance, exposed to all weathers—            of the  greatest nicety, and
consequence      to the certain and economical manufacture             of
cast-iron    ;  wherein    a small   addition of fuel, by exciting a
high temperature,        exposes the iron to the combination of a
hurtful     principle,   in quantity (as will hereafter be shown)
almost equal to what the metal was originally precipitated            in.
The extra proportion of fuel, therefore, requisite under cir
cumstances where a severe mode of torrefaction is either
universally adopted, or where it is frequently the result of in
attention and want of skill,            though    as  yet unascertained
upon     a large scale, must be very considerable.
    I  look upon it therefore       to be a great    desideratum   in the
preparation of iron-stone,          to contrive a mode which would
unite certainty and economy           ;  a mode    which    would either
de-oxygenate the ore unexposed to external air, or which
would dissipate its volatile mixtures exposed to air, with a
degree     of certainty which, with        a small   sliare of attention,
would preclude the possibility of the metal attracting more
oxygen.
                                                                       lit

     In   the present mode            of preparing iron-stones, too much
is left to chance and            the discretion of subordinate workmen*
The      surface    of   the piles, being always in contact                 with the
open air,        is frequently exposed to perforations from winds,
especially        in those parts where the Liver of ignited coals
 comes       in contact with the current            :   a   hollow space is soon
 formed       ;  the fuel, by means            of  the     freih. air    continually
 pouring in,         becomes       ignited to whiteness;           the surrounding;
 stone      is immediately fused          : should     this aperture       be joined
 by    a   similar communication             from opposite        sides  of  the sire,
 a degree        of heat will       be excited     beyond what could              have
 been conceived            possible in this mode          of burning, and oxy
 gen be combined             with    a mass   of stone in such an high pro
 portion as to form               a very considerable         part    of the whole
 weight.         This     is an accident which             will   take    place   even
  where order, regularity and experience                         are   conspicuous     :
  were     it   possible    to avoid    it by torrefying the iron-stone in
  that just temperature           which has been formerly demonstrated
  as the most proper, uniting at fame time an equal degree                            of
  economy, it would contribute greatly to reduce to certainty
  and rule the operations             of thel'melting-furnace.
      The     extreme      of  fusing the materials,           and combining        the
  iron with an extra portion of oxygen, is not the only evil
  which       an accurate mode           of torrefaction would            avoid  :  the
  fame train        of casualty often       affords a considerable          portion of
  the stone not enough prepared,                   and some quite untouched
  by the fire.        The    effects produced       by iron-stone in this state
  are exactly similar to those experienced                  in  the former, arising
  from the fame cause, but existing                 as the result       of two   oppo
  site extremes.
      I  confess      it is much easier to point out the faults of an
  established mode           of practice, than        to substitute      one, which,
   though it might unite some superior advantages,                          yet might
  not combine an equal number upon an extended scale.                                  I
   have frequently considered the subject, and have as often
  been impressed           with the truth of its importance in                the ma
                                                                          nufacturing

to the manufacturers of iron a double method of preparing
iron-stones for the blast-furnace ; in which, certainty of
operation would         be obtained,    and   in the end most         pro
bably    a  degree     of economy insured       equal   to that     of the
present mode.
   I  would effect this by exposing the iron-stone stratified
with a small proportion of coals, in simply constructed ovens,
entirely covered on the top, except a few small               funnels to
carry off the smoke and disengaged vapours            5 the ignition to
be occasioned       by a current of flame passing under a flue           in»
the bottom of the furnace, and conveying combustion to the
sub-stratified     coals.   As this operation could be conducted
to   a   physical    certainty by means of damping the fur
nace instantaneously, as soon as the vapour,            &c. had ceased,
or   as soon as    complete ignition had pervaded the contents,
(the duration to be determined by the nature of the iron
stone,) the results in this cafe could at all times be depended
upon, and the present irregular products avoided.                A second
method of depriving iron-stones of their volatile mixtures
would      be to expose them to a consider ible degree            of heat,
in contact with the dust of pit-coal coaks— as being the most
economical — (hut up from the admission of external air.
This would not only deprive them of their acid water, &c.
but would also unfix most of the oxygen combined with
the metal, and afford the iron nearly iq           a disengaged      state.
Both    these methods, however, at the present time, want the
sanction of approving practice, on an extensive scale, to ren
der them useful, or worthy of universal attention.
                     De-oxygenation    of Iron-Jlones,
   This    process has been      long known in part, and its prin
ciples    (so far   as  understood)   applied by the metallurgist         to.
deprive the ore, subjected to the assay-furnace,          of  its oxygen,
in order that     the metal might become revived.           Its operation
js however much           more extensive     than what has hitherto,
                                     R3                               been.

 been conceived ; and its results afford the most beautiful and,
 interesting phenomena known                 in  the art  of manufacturing
 iron.
     De-oxygenation          in the     case  of iron-stones will admit of
being divided into three distinct stages, all of which tend to
 the fame final result.
     1. That wherein iron-stone is found to have lost its water
of crystallisation     and continuity         of fracture  ; to have assumed
a greyish white colour, soft and pulverulent ; and greatly
specifically lighter than formerly, having lost from 3-5thstq
 g-20ths of its original weight.
     3. That stage wherein the pieces have assumed the state
of malleability, and          have again become firm and connected;
wherein they brighten under the file ; and, when subjected
to the hammer, under various degrees of heat, receive im
pressions at pleasure, and draw into shape.
     3. That stage wherein, by prolonging cementation, the
pieces of iron-stone are found to have pasted into the state of
steel ; possessing all its properties, though difficult to separate
from the earthy parts, and               preserve its quality    ; but which
may be precipitated from the steelisied ore by fusion, in the
state   of cast-steel,   by means of the assay-furnace.
  . These three distinct        stages   of de-oxygenation arc produced
by    a continuation of the         fame cause to which all iron-stones
may at pleasure be subjected.                With primary      ores, richer  in
iron,    the results are       more certain, ponderous,            and much
better suited to operate            upon, for the production          of good
malleable iron and          steel :   these are almost      universally capa
ble of being de-oxygenated, for the production of both these
modifications of the metal.                I have met with no exception,
indeed, but in the cafe of a few granulated Norwegian                    ores,
a   blue speckled Danish ore,           a sew Russian     bog ores, and the
Scotch ore of the       illand of May.
    In  the present papers sliall confine myself to a minute de
tail of the first   stage    of de-oxygenation        ; the second and   third
stages, as they more immediately belong to the manufacture
                                                                            of

                  On the Component Paris of Iron-Jlones.                        247
of iron      and steel, fliall be fully considered          in connection with
this curious mode of manufacturing                  these states    of the metal
from ores without fusion, which, from its novelty and sim
plicity, deserves        a   thorough     investigation of operation and
principle.
    De-oxygenation            simply consists in exposing          iron-stone or
ore,    stratified   with coaly matter, such           as the dust     of pit-coa!
coaks, or the charcoal of wood unexposed                       to air,   at a high
temperature.           The oxygen contained in             the ore is taken up
by the charcoal, and            passed  off in the    state   of carbonic acid;
while the water, carbonic acid, &c. previously existing in
the stone, is evaporated by the addition of caloric.                       In pro
 portion     as the ore becomes         cleared from these mixtures,            the
 metal becomes          more and more revived,             approaching how
ever to the state        of malleable iron, though still interspersed
with      the    original quantity of earthy parts united in the
stone.       By increasing the temperature, and continuing its
duration, the particles of iron unite, and form themselves
 into fibres, which, even when cold, maybe twisted and bent
 a little  ;  still however having the original quantity                 of earthy
matter almost          invisibly interposed       betwixt their interstices.
 If  the heat is urged still          further,    the iron, now malleable,
 begins to take up         a  portion of the carbon from the charcoal,
and the metal then commences its change to steel.
    Duringany part of           the process, should air come           in contact
with the ore, by previously destroying the surrounding char
coal, an immediate oxydation of the iron takes effect, pro
 portioned       in  its increase     of weight to the stage of the ope
 ration at which it is         effected. The ore has then passed into a
friable, bulky, and unmetallic             state.
    In de-oxygenating iron-stones, with                an intention       of disco
vering and         of establistiing    an analogy as to the           quantity    of
oxygen contained in the respective              classes  of   stones,  I  was fre
quently led to conclude, that argillaceous and calcareous
jron-stones contained less oxygen than iron-stones where a.

 248            On the Component Parts          of Iron-Jlones.
 greater proportion        of  silex predominated.          Though by far
 the greater number of experiments performed on this sub
ject were in favour of             such    an inference,     yet    I   have at
times experienced          my arrangement palpably contradicted,
without being able to solve the obtruding difficulty.                     I (hall
not however despair, in most cases, to reduce to certain in
variable      inherent     properties,      and external       characteristic
forms, the various iron-stones in the manner in which                           I
have arranged them, and consonant to the results obtained
from them in the process of manufacture.                       The utility of
such    an arrangement,          founded upon experiment, must be
obvious and striking         : it will  give certainty and value to the
various products of the manufacturer,                as  it will in     the end
systematize      the manufacture itself,         and reduce        it  to rules
guided by principle, and not by the aberration of a false or
misinformed judgment.
    From many experiments I have made with all the varie
 ties of iron-stones found in this country, I shall subjoin the
treatment of one of each class, highly marked with the pre
dominating earths, that an accurate opinion may be formed
 of the phenomena exhibited in this part of the                  process.
    J. I   used a  fine argillaceous iron-stone,           in   small    pieces,
weighing                   -             -
                                                                     1750 grs.
    After   a  proper distillation     of  8  hours in   a de
 gree  of heat equal to 30"         of Wedgewood,        I  ob
 tained  a  fine purple-coloured fibrated iron-stone,
 which, when cold, weighed                   -     -           -    1160
    Loss of water, acid, and sulphur, equal to 33             "6

    The influence which           the magnet possessed over this stone
 was considerable     ;   the adhesion       to the tongue was however
 great.
     I next introduced into a proper             vessel,   in contact with
                                                                      charcoal

                   On the Component Paris of Iron-Jlunes,                                 249

mass ; they also weighed                        -             -           -     1 750     grs.
    Afterexposure for 14 hours to a degree of
heat equal to 1 20° of Wedgewood, the iron-stone,
being carefully separated from the charcoal and
dried, weighed                  -                                               1003
    Loss of water, acid, sulphur, and oxygen                              -         748 grs,
    Lost by simple distillation                               -           -         590
    Oxygen taken up by the charcoal, equal                               to
9 parts in 100                  -'                                                  158 grs.
    This must not, however,                    be taken as the total measure                  of
oxygen combined with the iron, but only that portion taken
up in the first        stage   of    the operation ;      which, as it possesses
the following properties,                fully entitles it to this distinction:
    1.   The iron-stone, from being firm                      and compact, possessing
specific gravity from 3 to                   y$,    now becomes          comparatively
light, friable,      and pulverulent;               specific gravity, from a*             I   to
3'5.     It   now moulders with a flight pressure,                            and    is easily
reduced to fine powder              pf
                                 whitish grey colour, which again
                                         a
possesses     the following distinct properties : It adheres to the
magnet in the greatest abundance, but not in confused
clusters like iron-stone simply torrefied : a manifest indir
cation to become attached                     in the form of fibres             is visible ;
and the quantity taken up is equal      in point of bulk to the
effect produced  with iron filings.
    2. Iron-stone in this state pulverised, when strewed in the
flame of      a sire    or candle, gives out metallic sparks, like the
combustion of iron-filings when strewed in the fame man
ner.     When the         flame      of      the blow-pipe          is directed upon          it,
a   considerable       inflammation             takes     place, and the metallic
particles again become oxydated.
    3.   In this      state iron-stones             possess       the property of effer
vescing violently with the sulphuric and muriatic acids.
The iron and lime are instantly dissolved, without the prq-
duction       pf
               heat.       This      is   only peculiar to iron-stones at this
                                                                                      period,

250            On the Component Parts        of Iron-Jlones.
period    of de-oxygenation.         In no other      state either raw or
roasted does iron-stone        possess   this property, unless             highly
united to lime      ; but remains undissolved         till  it has attracted
a portion of the oxygen from the acid with which it is in
contact.
   From     these confirming     circumstances     I   conclude, that the
particles of metal exist in a highly disengaged state ; that
they are partially malleable, yet so much combined with
oxygen     as to be easily   precipitated, in fusion, for the pro
duction of cast-iron, with a sparing proportion of fuel, and a
proper application of solvents.          So far, therefore,         as   this ex
periment leads us, the practical analysis             of this      ore may be
thus stated    :
   In    the  assay-furnace    this iron-stone yielded            a   button of
super-carbonated crude iron equal to               -          -     39*5 parts.

    In  the subsequent part      of  the operation
I found     that, when the iron-stone had as
sumed malleability,       and brightened under
the file, a further quantity of -oxygen was
taken up, equal to                 -                       4-2
                                                                 —

    The    earths   I found to be proportioned nearly               as  follows    :
 Clay   7  parts, calcareous earth 4, silex       27 = 137.
    II. "Of a    calcareous iron-stone, reduced in the same man
ner,   I  operated upon          v   -          -               -      1750 grs,
    After being       exposed   to a similar distillation,
I  found it to weigh             -                                      1090

    This iron-stone, when torrefied, exhibited               a  thin      schistus
                                                                                 9f

lines running        in various directions      :    its colour was reddish
brown,      partially fibrated, magnetic,              and tenacious to the
tongue.
    I  took of the fame, mixed with charcoal dust,                   1750 grs,
and exposed the        vessel    to a temperature equally
high with the former.
    The   residue, when carefully separated from the
charcoal, washed and dried, weighed                        -      -   92a
                                                                       828 grs.

    In this   state  the stone was pulverulent, much frittered, ancl
of a darkish grey colour. Its fracture exhibited a number of
white spots like madrepore.             In   many places lime was dis
tinctly perceived      :  when pulverised,        it sparkled in the flame,
dissolved rapidly       in acids with       a violent effervescence,        was
less    magnetic than the former,             though possessing a great
tendency to adhere in the form of fibres. From this treat
ment the practical analysis of this stone will stand as follows:
    In the   assay   furnace it yielded, of super- carbonated crude,
iron,                 -                                             37-5 parts

   This    analysis must not,            however, be taken as           a standard
whereby the quantity of iron                    and earth is to be judged of
in calcareous iron-stones in              general.      The iron-stones of this
class contain much           less  iron than argillaceous or even sili
ceous iron-stones        :   38 to 32 per            cent, are products more
commonly       met with than 37 and upwards; the difference
in   point of metal being made up in lime and clay. In
stating the quantity of oxygen disengaged,                    I conceived   it pro
per to adduce iron-stones,                though       of different   classes,   yet
containing nearly the fame weight of metal as the quantity
either disengaged or absorbed must be in a direct ratio to
the existing quantity of iron.

    In  these experiments          I   wished to Obtain results which
would throw light          upon the de-oxygenation          of iron-stones,
with a view to apply them to practice upon an extended scale.
I  therefore used fresh ore, in order to present nearly the same
surface to the action          of the heat, and to be able to judge         of
the results    apart from each other.              In torrefaction it    fre
quently happens that the stone is reduced too small to enable
us, by its subsequent treatment, to form             a probable opinion of
the tenacity, or otherwise, with            which iron-stones hold their
oxygen.      The     difference    betwixt returning into the crucible
the fame pieces deprived           of their volatile mixtures,     and ope
rating upon fresh ore, cannot be great, especially when they
are selected from         fragments of the fame mass, directed by
an intimate        acquaintance and thorough knowledge of the
qualities indicated by their external forms.
    All iron-stones thus          exposed    to de-oxygenation       becomp
more or      less saturated      with carbon     ; it forms a union like,
 carbon in steel, and its presence is only ascertained when the
 iron-stone is dissolved in an acid, by rising to the top, and
forming     a   fine pellicle possessing lustre and various shades
                                                                            of

of colour.       I  have also at times detected crude carbon           in tin
centre of pieces       of ore     i\   inch diameter.       To  the remain
der  of this mixture,       after the oxygen is taken up, ought to be
attributed the natural tendency which most malleable iron
made     in this   process has      of becoming red-short.
    The    average    of  the  results of the principal classes of iron
stones may serve for information               on the products obtained,
by treating those of equal quantities of mixture.                  The ana
lysis here furnished is not that           of the chemist, or laboratory;
but, though the calculations are less rigorous, yet they are
sufficient for the manufacturer, and better suited for prac
tical information        ;  as they never once lose fight        of their  ap
plication and effects in the large way of manufacture, and
as  they have been chiefly effected by an agent, which alone,
in the large way, can modify the whole, and procure results
consonant to the         use and existence      of the metal.
    From     the    amount      of   the   experiments here recorded            I
would be apt to draw this conclusion, that, in general, iron
 stones arc variously combined with oxygen as to quantity                       :
 argillaceous iron-stone,           least; calcareous, more; and           sili
 ceous iron-stones, most           of all.
    In the     general     arrangement which        I  have made     of iron
 stones in this and the preceding paper,              I wish not to be un
 derstood as      having comprehended every variety which may
 exist ;  new    classes    may be brought to light,         as the progress
 of discovery      and establishment         advances.    I  am at present,
 however, acquainted with only one exception, which, from
 its scarcity,    I  have    avoided classing     along with    those   gene
 rally used.       My   experiments also have hitherto been limited
 as to the nature, so that at the present             time  I am only ena
 bled to     state   a  few, of its distinguishing properties.            This
 iron-stone      is found near to Clough Iron Works,                   in the
 county of Lanark.             Its   appearance    is much like      a  coarse
 schistous coal ; its average thickness is about i^               inch;    pos
 sessing a dark sandy fracture,             and by no means resembling
  an ore    of iron.       The mixture       w a union     of coal   and   iron
                                                                          with

                  On  the Component       Parts of Iron-Jlones.                  355
with- a small proportion of silex.              Its inflammability          is great,
and it requires          a cautious preparation for the blast-furnace.
For this        purpose   it is built upon a thin layer of coals, in
piles not exceeding 20 inches, or 2 feet : the coals are kin
dled     in the usual manner, and convey ignition to the incum
bent stone. These precautions are absolutely necessary, other
wise the whole stone would be connected                    in one    general mass
by fusion.
     I   exposed    of this  stone to distillation             -       -    979 grs.
in   a   bright red heat for     7   hours, during which time
a considerable         degree   of combustion took place,
and a black vapour was disengaged ; when                         cool,
 the residue weighed                       -                                 476

      In this state, the iron-stone was divided into thin, blue
 laminæ, of a vitreous nature, and very weakly magnetic.

      When        separated, washed,        and    dried, the     resi
  due weighed                   -             -            -            -    590

      The charcoal        was in part consumed, and part                  of the  sur
  face     of  the ore exposed        to contact with         air, otherwise it is
  probable that the loss in de-oxygenation would have been
  less, by the quantity         of carbon contained in the stone, than
  in torrefying in the open air ; where the carbon must infallibly
  be consumed, and the loss greater.                   In this state of de-oxy
  genation this iron-stone             poHcsses   the usual properties         peculiar
   to the other varieties.              At Clough it         is highly esteemed,
   both     as   to the quantity and          quality of the iron it affords.
   It   is reckoned,     in a torrefied     state, to yield in the blast-furnace
   from 55 to 60 per cent.               This   is easily accounted        for, when
   it  is considered,       that it loses more than half its weight in
   torrefaction.

 H AVING           in our Number for Feb. laid
 an account of the volcano in the island
                                                       before our readers
                                                   of St. Lucia, from the
 Swedish Transactions,        the    following particulars respecting
it and the neighbourhood are now inserted, as they tend to
make the description of that singular spot more complete.
    " Soussriere   is a small town situated at the bottom           of a bay
towards the leeward extremity of the island.              It is surrounded
by hills covered       with     trees,   the declivities of which,       and
every part capable       of produce,     are cultivated, and afford good
sugar-cane.      This     place   has its marshes,      but not   so exten
sive, or so much to windward as those about Carenage.
    " The extremity of the south side of Soussriere Bay runs
into two steep hills of a conical figure, which are nearly per
pendicular   : they are reckoned the highest               on the island,
and are known by the name             of the Sugar-Loaf Hills.         From
their height and straitness it is impossible             to ascend them      :
we were told it was once attempted              by two negroes,    but they
never returned.         They are covered with          trees and     shrubs,
and arc the shelter of goats, several of which sometimes de
scend, and arc stiot by the natives.
    " After you    pass the    hills to windward of Soussriere,       a fine,
clear and level country presents itself. From the back of the
Sugar-Loaf Hills, and all along the sea-coast, to the distance,
we suppose, of from fifteen to twenty mises, this flat or level
extends:   it is all cultivated         and divided into       rich estates,
affording sugar-cane equal to any in our islands.               This  beau
tiful spot is   intersected      by many river's     of very clear water,
and these are       conducted by art to           the purpose of sugar-
making.     The rains in this part are less frequent than on
any other part of the island j however, they have often a
                                                                        pro-

 the      sea,   or nearly          so.
      "    We cannot finish this description without taking notice
of     a   volcano in the neighbourhood of Souffriere.    You pass
over       one or two small hills to the southward of the town,
and, before any mark of the place is perceived,                                  you are   sen
sible    of           of sulphur. Ihe
                 the smell                                       first thing you discern is
a     rivulet of black running water, fending forth steams                                 as     if
nearly boiling.                 From the prospect of this you soon open on
the volcano, which appears in a hollow, surrounded close on
every fide by hills. There are only two openings ; the one
we entered,              and     another almost opposite to it on the north
fide.        In the hollow                there are many pits         of a black    and   thick
boiling matter, which seems to work with great force. Lava
is slowly thrown out ; and in the centre of the hollow there
is a large mass                of    it,    forming        a   kind of hill.     This   we as
cended; but were soon obliged to return, from the excessive
heat.  The lava     sulphur mixed with
                                is   a     calcareous earth            a
and some saline body.                       We found           small quantities   of alum in
a     perfect         state.        In     the opening,          at the north side      of the
hollow,          there     is   a    rivulet of very good water.                  On stirring
the bottom, over which this water runs, we were                                     surprised
with       feeling        it   very hot       ;      and   on placing      a   tumbler filled
with some of the water close to the bottom of the rivulet,                                   it
soon became              so    hot    as    not to be touched.          The liquid which
runs from the pits                  is    strongly    impregnated with sulphur, and
resembles         a     good         deal     the     preparation     sold     in the   shops,
known            by   the name of aqua sulphur at a, or gas fulphuris.
Before St. Lucia was in our possession, two or three                                    vessels
were loaded with the crude sulphur                              of this volcano, for the
use   of America."

  X HE       principal object of the author, in this Report, is to
prove that it ought not invariably to be the aim of the phy
sician to repair the loss of a portion of the refpirable air in
the atmosphere          which surrounds the patient ; since diseases
may occur, such as those of a putrid and inflammatory na
ture, where an augmentation of the unrespirable part may
be beneficial.         In   such diseases,  if air of the   common stand
ard     be respired,       the patient is furnished with such           a  por
tion of    oxygen as, by increasing animal heat and accelerat
ing circulation,       must naturally increase the fever, inflamma
tion and putrefaction, or decomposition of the blood and
 other humours.             A lowered atmosphere, which in health is
 improper for respiration, must in these             states prove    salutary,
 as, by affording less oxygen           to the system,     it will  abate in
 flammation,       check the putrefaction, and diminish other bad
 symptoms, producing the good effect of what are called
  coolinof medicines.          These principles are confirmed beyond
  a doubt by daily experience          *.

little ammoniacal gas, and a peculiar emanation called con
tagious miasm, which appears to be a particular combination
of hydrogenous carbonic acid gas, holding in solution ani
mal fluids        as yet      little known.             Hydrogen gas almost always
holds in solution pure carbon, phosphorus, &c. from which
arises the smell             of   these gases, often so disagreeable.                            Car
bonic acid gas would form                       a   much more considerable                  part of
the atmosphere which                      surrounds sick persons, were not this
gas continually neutralised                     and rendered concrete by the am
monia, which is formed                          and    evolved         in all    diseases      where
animal substances containing azotare decomposed.                                            It may
readily be            perceived          into       what      contradiction            those     have
fallen who suppose air to contain at the same time carbonic
and     ammoniacal                gas.      The absurdity of                  exposing         in the
apartments of the sick,                  vessels      filled with quick-lime, must also
be obvious ; the inconvenience                              of which, in all            cafes, is to
leave      in   a disengaged state,             or to return to the air, the ammo
niacal gas ; the carbonic acid gas, which would otherwise

 upon      it             the lime;        and, in some cases, to take                           away
 an unrespirable             gas,     the presence of which would be bene
 ficial.
    " I     have ascertained               that in      a     state    of health       we form         by
 respiration more water, and in                         a    state     of    disease     more car
 bonic acid.              The carbon            seems, at         a   certain temperature, to
 exercise on the oxygen                   a   stronger attraction than the hydro
 gen can in the same temperature.                                     Among the principal
 means          for       purifying       infected          air
                                                              I       class vaporised            water,
 which  incommodes the patient very little, and takes putrid
 emanations out of circulation better than the muriatic and
 acetous acids,              or than spirits, being                   a   better       solvent    than
 these liquids.              When         the air      is    surcharged         with ammonia,
I   would rather let loose into                        it    the carbonic acid              gas than
 the acetous or any other acid.                             The       cafe   in which C. Guy-
 ton employed with                  so   much success the muriatic acid vapours

was totally different from those which have been the objects
of my   researches.
   The sulphurous acid       gas would be useful in           some cases to
decompose      miasmata,    by giving up to them a portion of its
oxygen; but it leaves behind it an oxyd of sulphur, the smell
of which      is extremely offensive      :  the oxygenated         muriatic
acid gas ought therefore        to be preferred.
   The    gases   which in my opinion            ought to be employed           I
for augmenting the portion of unrespirable air, are the car
bonic acid gas and hydrogen gas.                 The    first ought      to be
made to pass through water, and the second through oil.                     By
these means you free the carbonic acid gas from that portion
of the acid employed       to disengage it from the carbonat used,
which it    carries along with it ; and you precipitate from the
hydrogen gas the carbon it holds in solution. The oil, after
being   used some    time for this purpose,        is found quite black,
and converted      into empyreumatic or carbonated              oil.
VI.    Simple and Easy Method            of Cleaning and Whitening
   Prints or Engravings. By M. Fabbrom. From Annali
   di Chimica, by Brugnatelli.                    Vol. XIV.
 X.  HE    methods formerly employed for. cleaning engravings
consisted in wasliing them in pure water, or a weak lixivium
of pot-asti, or in exposing them a very long time to the dew.
Aquafortis has also heen sometimes employed. Leys, how
ever, together with the dirt and filth, carried away part of
the colour     of the engraving, and aquafortis           attacked     the ve
getable fibre    of which    the paper    of   the print was composed.
   Since the discovery        of   the oxygenated        muriatic acid by
Scheele, and the application of its properties, by Berthollet,
to the bleaching       of cloth, trials     have been       made    of it  also
for whitening prints and engravings;              and Chaptal's experi
ments on this subject were attended with the                 best success    *.

    This      process,      however, is not            so   generally followed Us it
    ought lo be, chiefly because the preparation of the oxygen
    ated muriatic acid is attended with more trouble than some
    people      will   take, and because it is sometimes                    difficult to pro
    cure the acid ready made.                  This       consideration          induced     M.
  ¦
    Fabbroni        to make known             the following             process,     which is
[
    extremely        easy,     and may be put in practice by any one.
        Half fill      a glass bottle     with   a   mixture composed of                 1  part
    of    the red oxyd         of lead,   or minium, and               3 parts    of  the mu
    riatic acid      ;   and having closed the mouth                    of   the bottle    with
    a glass stopper, put it m a cool place, not exposed to the light.
    A    certain heat will then be produced, which is an indica
    tion that new combinations                  are formed.             The bxyd of the
    lead abandons a considerable                   portion of its oxygen, which
  I remains combined                with the- liquor           *
                                                                  ;  the    latter then ac
    quires a beautiful gold colour, and assumes the odour of the
    oxygenated          muriatic acid.         It holds in solution              a small    por
    tion of the lead, which does not in the least injure its effect                            f.
    It   is necessary that the bottle should                    be   of  strong glass,       and
    that the stopper be well secured,                       in order to prevent               the
    elastic vapour which, rises from forcing                         it out.      When you
    employ the liquor thus prepared,                      take a large         pane of glass,
    and raise a kind             of border of white wax around                        its edge,
    about two inches in height, and every where equal.                                        By
     these     means       you form       a   sort     of trough, into which put
     the prints, and pour over them a little fresh urine,                              or water
     mixed with a portion of ox-gall.                     At     the end     of  three or four
        * Where        the  oximuriat of pot-ash        can    be   had, the     process   recom
    mended by Mr. Cruickshank,             of Woolwich Hospital, will            be found neater
    than     the   one    here   proposed.    If  the    oxygenated       muriat   of pot-ash   be
    simply     added to the muriatic       acid, diluted with about an equal bulk of
    water,     the salt is ilowly decomposed, and the acid converted into the oxy
    genated acid.         About    1 drachm   of the     salt,   if pure, is found to be suffi
    cient for three ounces of the dilute acid.             Edit.
        f-  If this  be   a fact,  the portion   of   lead   held in solution must be small
     indeed — otherwise it should be partially revived in a
                                                                           length of time,     and
    produce blackness.          Edit.

changed every three or four hours, until it come off perfectly
clear.    When the matter with which               the prints are dirtied
is of a resinous nature, which sometimes happens, dip them
in a little alcohol : afterwards suffer all the moisture to drain
off, and cover the prints with the liquor of the oxygenated
muriatic acid made by minium. Place on the edges of the
wax another pane of glass, of the fame size as that below,
in order that you may not be too much incommoded by the
smell   of the acid ; and you       will then plainly    fee  the yellowest
prints resume their original          whiteness.     One or two hours
will be sufficient to produce the desired effect.             Having then
poured off the acid, wash the prints, several times, in pure
water, and dry them in the fun.

VII.    Observations      on the British Trade     with Turkey.        From,
    Eton's Survey of       the  Turkish Empire.
 r ORMERLY                the trade to Turkey, was of considerable
importance      to this country ; but        of  late years it had been
languisliing,     and    at last dwindled     into   a state   of insignifi
cancy, when the present war entirely put a stop to all com-!
munication with the ports of the Levant.
    As this    trade   will   be again opened       when     a peace   takes
place, an investigation of the causes of its decline, and the
 means to give it its ancient extension, may not, in the mean
time, be unimportant to the government and to the merchants
 of this country.
    The causes of     its gradual decline arc, ist,       The rivalfhip of
 other European nations;           2dly, The diminution of the con
 sumption of our manufactures in Turkey, by the impoverished
 state of the country; 3dly, Sonic branches of trade being got
 into other channels       ;  and 4thly,  The monopoly of the Levant
 Company in London,
                                                                      With

                      British Trade with Turkey.                      263
      With    respect to the rivalfhip   of other nations, that cause
  will   be considered    when   I  speak of the Levant Company.
  As to the impoverished        state of Turkey, it must affect the
  trade   of other'European nations as well as our own; if we
 are   not, therefore, to expect to fee it again in that flourishing
 state   in which it was, when there were forty English houses
 of  trade at Aleppo,     (at present there is but one.) we may at
 least expect to have the fame proportion        of it as we  then had;
 and    if  we acquire only this, our trade to the Levant will still
 be a national object.       Some branches of trade are got into
 other channels; this regards principally certain imports from
 Turkey, and particularly of silk from Aleppo, whence for
 merly larger quantities of Persian silk came, which is not
 now brought thither, but the East India Company supply our
 market cheaper and more abundantly.               Considerable quan
tities of cotton and drugs come from Holland and from Italy,
which formerly came direct.             This will also be accounted
for in     the next consideration,     the monopoly      of the Levant
 Company.
     It  is often necessary,  and where merchants          undertake to
•pen to the country a new branch            of  trade,   and where the
expence and rifle is great,      it is just, to grant them exclusive
privileges, or monopolies, for a certain limited time, to pre
vent others from reaping the harvest they had sown,               and to
secure      their laudable industry as far     as  possible from    risk;
but when that risk exists no more, and when they have
reaped their harvest over and over again, and have had a              full
compensation for their risk, their industry, and their expence,
the country at large has a right to a participation        of the trade.
There may, indeed, sometimes exist circumstances of a pecu
liar nature, which give them a claim to a longer indulgence
in their monopoly, particularly where that monopoly               is no
injurious, but, on, the contrary, beneficial to the country in
general, (and such is the cafe of the East India Company;)
but in a trade where the merchants have no common stock,
and can urge none        of the   above reasons in defence      of their
                                   S 4                      monopoly    j

264                            Observations       en tbe
 monopoly;         where they cannot prove that any particular
 loss would       accrue      to them by abolishing it               ;  where it has
operated      as a restraint        on the trade,        confining it to narrow
bounds, and giving a decided                  superiority to their rivals of
other nations, to the almost total exclusion of the products
 and manufactures           of their country from that               to which their
 privilege exclusively         permits them to trade,               ought in com
 mon     fense  such a monopolv to exist?                The Levant Company
is truly become          the dog in tbe manger;               it   does not operate
 so  much to the profit of the -company,                    as to the loss     of the
 country.
    This monopoly          is   of a singular     nature    :   it  has none    of the
 advantages      of   a common stock, in which many individuals
risk small sums,          but which         in the aggregate            amount to a
larger capital than any one merchant or set of merchants
possess,     or would choose to risk ; a common stock to which
any one may contribute,                 and which thereby, strictly speak
 ing,   ceases     to be      a   monopoly     :   it is  a  privilege granted to
 certain persons only to trade to Turkey,                     each     with his own
capital, and for his own particular account and risk, without
any assignable reason why they should be preferred to others
his majesty's subjects           :   it has all the disadvantages            of other
monopolies       ;   it has not one of their advantages.
    In  speaking thus freely           of the company, I solemnly              declare
that   I  have no private motive,             no rancour against any indi
vidual,      and no inducement             for writing on this subject but
the advantage         of  the country.           The     few members           of  the
company with whom                  I am acquainted I personally respect
and highly esteem           :   on this subject they must disser with
me; they are bound by oath to support the interests of their
body.
    The    trade   of all other nations         to Turkey is free,          and they
have experienced          the advantage        of being        liberated    from the
fetters    of  exclusive       privileges.       Let    every      obstacle    be  re
moved      in this country         to an equally free commerce, and the
superior industry, skill, and riches of our manufacturers, our
                                                                              traders,

      It may       be said, that at present the Levant Company is not
a   monopoly, as any one, by paying twenty pounds, maybe-
come        a    member of it.          When the        trade was already ruined,
it was imagined that this regulation                     was equivalent to laying
the trade open, (a proof that government have thought it
necessary to- abolish the monopoly;) but the bye-laws of the
company, and the power to enforce them, were permitted to
exist, and these so fetter the trade                   to new adventurers,               that
few have found their account in pursuing     and the trade          it,
still remains monopoly in favour of the old houses.
                        a
    It     will   be necessary to pass         in   review these bye- laws,          which
have operated               so   injuriously to the trade in general            ;   and to
sliow how they have gradually effected its total ruin, and the
introduction of rivals, who have gotten                            possession   of what
we have lost.
    By one of            the bye-laws, for instance,         it    was enacted,          that
all merchandise brought                     from Turkey, and imported into
England, should be the produce of goods exported from Eng
land to Turkey. The following are the words of the bye-law                                  :
      "
    That upon entering goods received in England from
Turkey or Egypt, every member shall in like manner sub
scribe the following                affirmation;      videlicet:
    " I     affirm,         by   the oathI    have taken to the Levant Com
pany, that the goods above mentioned are for account                                       of
myself,          or others free of the said company, or of such as now
have their licence to trade, and are beyond the seas; and that
              nor any part of them, are not, to the
the said goods,                                                                     best   of
my knowledge, the produce of gold or silver, either                                 in   coin
or bullion, sent into Turkey                  ;     but that the said goods are
purchased           by   merchandise, or monies arising or to arise from
the       sale    of    merchandise         sent into Turkey         or Egypt,           from
Europe, or from the British settlements                       in America,           on ac
count of freemen of the Levant Company,                               or such   as have
their licence to trade, and of which regular entries have been
           9                                                                         made

 266                      Observations    on the
 made    with the company,         or are purchased       by freight    re
 ceived in  Turkey or Egypt, by        ships navigated      according to
 law ; which freight is entirely the property of members of
 the company, or such       as have   their licence to trade."
    And   every merchant or factor         in Turkey or Egypt is re
quired to make      a similar affidavit, on exporting goods from
Turkey for England; and to give,' on oath, an exact account
of every kind of transaction or business, direct and indirect j
so  that all his affairs become known.
    The object of this law is evidently to encourage the ex
portation of cloth ; and when we had no rivals, it produced
no bad effects ; but it soon produced rivals, and it continued
in force till they had nearly got possession of the whole cloth
trade.    Such   a law, indeed, was sufficient to ruin any trade.
One house may deal in exports,              another in imports ; one
may combine its Italian with its Turkey trade; another may
fend vessels for the carrying trade : but if every individual
house be obliged to keep an exact register on oath, and under
a penalty   of 20 per cent, called
                                       "  a  broke," of all its exports
and imports,      and   to balance   them exactly, how is such a
trade to prosper,     where the profits are reduced        by the rival-
ship  of foreign nations? This bye-law at length, when it had
produced the full effect of its ill tendency, was repealed; but
the trade was not revived:       so difficult is it to turn back com
merce from channels into which it has run.
   It will  be asked, then, what are the restraints          which now
lie on the trade    ?
   The subjection to the control of the company ; the ne
cessity of making entries with it of all their transactions on
oath, and not being able        ^o
                                    be concerned      in  anywise    with
others not free    of the company, or foreigners        ;  the power     in
the company, for the least violation        of their rules,   to inflict a
penalty of 20 per cent. ; the idea of restraint, and the ap
prehension    of violating   a solemn oath, have made many de
termine to trade with Turkey through foreign and circuitous
channels, without becoming free of the company                 :  witness
                                                                       the

                       British Trade with Turley.                                             us]
the very large quantities of cottons and drugs, &c. which
come from Holland and Italy,                      as    the custom-house books
prove.      This    was the cafe        till our       trade to           Holland and the
Mediterranean was stopped by the war, and in that fame
situation we shall be when a peace takes place.
  The drugs,         8cc.    which are. imported from Italy, were car
ried thither from Turkey           ; they had already given a profit to
the Italian factor in Turkey;                     to the importer,                   and to the
purchaser         in Italy, who cleans, assorts, repacks,                             and often
adulterates       them; to the commissioner, who purchases them
for his correspondent                in England         ;    to   which         add charges,
and interest of money for              so   long a disbursement,                     which the
different people        through whose hands the merchandise has
gone     have      all calculated, as well                  as    their profits, double
freights, and loading and unloading,                            &c. &c.
   Cottons are imported from Holland, because the company
cannot import themselves enough for the consumption                                           ; and
the reason why they do not                      is,   because          the old members,
who are under no apprehensions                        of the'bye-laws, find other
articles enow to employ their whole capital, and beyond that
the    trade      cannot increase.           This          is    the reason,          as    will be
seen hereafter       more fully, why the trade in exports                             as    well   as
imports      is   confined within such narrow bounds.
  The British merchants in Italy and other foreign countries,
not being members of the company, (and to become free of
the company they must come to England,)                                   cannot trade with
British houses in Turkey               ;    and        these,     if      they will trade to
Italy,      must    trade    with foreigners           :    thus all combinations of
the trades         are prevented.           English             vessels    in the Mediter
ranean might           often make           a   voyage           to   Turkey,         instead      of
lying in an Italian port, and return time enough                                      to take      in
 their cargoes for England.
      The   great preference          given to British                vessels   in the Medi
 terranean would            assure   them an employment whenever they
 want freights.        This carrying or               caravan trade             is   so   extensive,
                                                                                               that,

   l6S                        Observations    en the
   that, besides the French, the little        state of Ragufa has no   less
   than 400    vessels  in it.
      Were   the masters      of  ships, their owners, and the English
  merchants in Italy and Turkey, under no restraint in regard
  to the Levant Company, people would risle more readily the
  sending their vessels to the Mediterranean to get employment
  in this carrying     business, and, their speculation in trade being
  free,  they   would     find means to employ their vessels in the
  intervals of their being without freights; the masters, owners,
  and correspondents        might combine their own speculations in
 merchandise with their earning business, and thus keep
 them constantly employed.             It is the want of these   resources
 to our sliips, that prevents English owners from sending their
 sliips into the Mediterranean           to seek freights, and prevents
 the few    which    do go thither from profiting so much by it as
 those of other nations, whose houses of trade are nearer, and
 whose trade is under no restrictions.
      Had  the Turkey trade in England never been, a monopoly,
 the French would never have got              possession of almost all the
 cloth trade; and the laying it open will be the onlv means
 ef our coming in again for any considerable (hare in it.
There     is a greater demand in Turkey for the light Langucdoc
cloths, than for any other sort.            The Turks clothe their     ser
vants twice a year; and the French cloth,                 made into loose
garments, (which         last  much longer than the tight European
dress,) is strong enough for their purpose, and its cheapness
causes it to be preferred ; poorer people, who form the great
body of consumers, buy it also for œconomical                     reasons.
Englisli broad cloth, called mahoot, (of a light quality, made
purposely for the Turkey market,) is only worn by those in
easier circumstances.           Considerable quantities of cloth have
also of late years come to Turkey from Germany.
     It is the opinion of many            people well acquainted with
these   matters,    that the Englisti manufacturers might make
the fame fort      of cloth    as the  Languedoc, and     as cheap as  the
                                                                 French ;

                            British Trade with Turkey.                              2S9
French     ;    but,   as    long   as the    Levant Company exists; who is
to undertake           it? Were       the     trade   laid entirely open, it is
probable that all kinds of English manufacturers would fend
people (called riders) to Turkey to seek for commissions, as
they do to all parts of Europe.                    This practice, though not
very agreeable           to English merchants, (which                    however may
not be the        case      in Turkey,       as   they may find the mediation
of merchants            necessary,)      would greatly increase the vent of
English        commodities,          and     these industrious people             might
possibly       be the means         of our regaining        the cloth trade.
   The     few        merchants who are in the true secret of the
Levant trade, can employ in it their whole capital advan
tageously, and therefore do not seek for new branches, or
how to recover old ones which are loll. — This is the great
secret.
   The French            do not get their wool cheaper                       than we do;    .
the price of labour may be less;    but will' not superior skill
and industry, with larger capitals, compensate this single cir
cumstance against ug? Experience in other articles shews                              it,
as in the'manufactures of Manchester,                            Sheffield, and Bir
mingham.
   It     is   very worthy          of attention, that           the French       cannot
 make      so   cheap as we can the fame kinds                   of cloth, which our
 people bring to the Turkey market;                        it   is   not that they can
 not make them               so   fine, for they make in France much finer
 cloth than that kind of broad cloth made in England pur
 posely for the Turkey market.   There   also coarse strong is           a
 cloth brought to Turkey from England, called londras: these
 the French            cannot make           so   cheap    neither;      nor are their
 ssialloons      so    cheap.       In sliort,     there    is   no sort of woollen
 stuff made in the two countries, of the fame quality, which
 the Englisti do not fell cheaper than the French.  The fact
 seems to be, that the French invented                       a   kind of cloth more
 proper for the general                  consumption of Turkey than that
 which         the English          had brought   thither and the English
                                                                     ;
 never attempted              to follow their example, but continued car
                                                                                    rying

tjo                        ObservMtioTU on the
rying to the market a sort of cloth, which at last got almost
out of use.     Whenever         the English     (hall have   made    and
brought to Turkey the same kind of cloth as the French, and
cannot afford it    so cheap,      then with certainty we may con
clude that the French have an advantage over us ; but till
then it ought to be doubted, and certainly it merits the trial;
but a fair trial never can be made till the Levant trade is
entirely free.
    But  even supposing that we cannot regain the cloth trade,
there are very many other objects worth attending to, and
which may be of great national advantage.
    The Manchester        stuffs would find a great vent     in all parts
of Turkey. The manufactories of Aleppo and Damascus are
almost ruined ; and if the Manchester people were to imitate
 the Turkish patterns of their stuffs, they could certainly af
ford them cheaper.            Imitations     of the Surat   and Bengal
goods   of silk  and ¦cotton,     which    are enormously dear, would
 find also a ready   sale  in Turkey;     and cotton velvets, velverets,
 &c.    Birmingham and Sheffield wares would be articles of
 importance.       The Turks, both in Europe and Asia, have a
 great partiality for all these kinds of English manufactures,
 and in general the epithet English            is synonimous with ex
 cellent.
     These articles at present are not attended to; but the mas
 ters of sliips, who bring out their little ventures to Turkey in
 a contraband manner, in these kind of things, make great
 profits ; they can, however, bring only small quantities, lest
 the Levant Company should take umbrage at it.                 A   few of
 these goods     also find their way to         Turkey from Italy, but
 greatly enhanced in their price from the many hands they
 go through,      and   therefore     this channel does not afford a
 great vent for them.          Linen may likewise be an article of
 exportation for Turkey.           The Turks wear linen of a hard
 twisted   thread, very open         and    unbleached, which       comes
 mostly from Egypt, and is exceedingly dear, but is the most
  pleasant kind to wear       in hot weather.      No European nation
                                                                       has

                     British Trade with Turiey,                        ay   I
has yet undertaken to imitate it ; but it is probable it might
be made  in Ireland infinitely cheaper than in Egypt : if this
was the cafe, it would be of great importance. The German
linens begin to be sold in considerable quantities in Turkey ;
but they never will supply the place of the Egyptian, on ac
count of their quality.            Vast quantities of the above men
tioned articles come from Venice and Germany, where they
are dearer, and of worse quality, than those manufactured in
England.
     Were    I
            to enter into an enumeration of all the English
manufactures that could be sold in Turkey, and particularly
in the interior parts of Asia, and point out the different ports
to which they might be sent, the detail would be too long for
a general representation; but collectively it must be very ob
vious to every person acquainted but generally with the trade
of Turkey, that our exportations to that country must become
of   great importance   few years, were the monopoly re
                          in   a
moved, and the agents of the manufacturers sent to travel
through the country, and get certain information of the                state
of   its trade and manufactories.
     Salt fish, could the Newfoundland              sliips, &c. go directly
to Turkey as they go to            Italy, would         be a very important
branch.
     The East India Company could            supply the Turkey market
with muslins much cheaper                than they are brought by the
way of Bassora, of Gidda, and Suez, which trade is entirely
in the hands of their servants: the trial has been successfully
made; but the members of the Levant Company have other
articles enow in which to invest their whole capitals.
 Other      nations now bring           large     quantities of muslins to
 Turkey.         British muslins      (i.   e.   manufactured    in Britain)
 also fell to considerable     profit.
     Let all this   be mere supposition,          is   not the object of im
 portance enough to give       fair trial
                               it   a              ?   and does not common
 fense say, that trade freed from obstacles must flourish more
                    a
 than when clogged with the most unsupportable shackles, or
                                                                        with

   372                      Observations      on the
  with any shackles at all     ?  May it not      be asked, what just right
  have   the members      of   the Levant Company to lay restraints
  on this trade by their bye-laws           ?  I  have heard     this subject
  discussed    in Turkey, where        people certainly understand         the
  trade  of  the country better       than in England,          and  I  never
  heard one plausible     reason alleged in favour          of the company.
 Sophistical arguments may be produced                  in London,     which
 may appear plausible       to those who are not informed              of the
 real state  of  matters   in Turkey.
     To   show what little efforts have          been made by the com
 pany to extend the trade,          and how little they deviate from
 the footsteps of their forefathers,          I will  cite two striking   in
 stances   :
     Mr. John Humphrys,            of Constantinople,           was the first,
 who,   a few years ago,     imagined that English shalloons might
be fold    in Constantinople,      and they soon became a very im
 portant article for exportation to Turkey.               The- French have
 not been able to make them so cheap.
     Mr. Peter Took, of Constantinople, only                   about  twenty
 years    ago,   discovered that he might buy raw silk from the
 first hands at Brusa, (the hills behind this city are visible from
our merchants houses in Pera,) and thus make his returns
direct to England.          Before that period, from the first ex
istence  of  the company, the merchants             of Constantinople    had
always sent their money to Smyrna to be invested in silk,
which the Turks and Jews of Smyrna bought at Brusa.
    There     is  a great   demand        in Turkey        for Staffordshire
earthen-ware, which would become                 a very   important article
of commerce.
    Perhaps the greatest importation              of British articles into
Turkey would be by foreigners, or natives of the Turkish
provinces, as is the cafe in many branches of our commerce,
where such restraints on foreigners do not exist; for instance,
every one knows that not one-tenth                 part of our exports to
Russia are on account       of  the Russia Company in London,              or
of   the British Factory      in  Russia.      These articles are sent to
                                                                       Russia

Russia for account of foreigners settled in Russia, or Russians,
and some part for account          of our manufacturers.        With   re
spect to Germany this is still more the cafe.
   The Levant Company            exact a duty on all merchandise ex
ported to and imported from Turkey,                besides a consulage  in
the ports   of Turkey on all the exports and imports in British
vessels.    This consulage is a very heavy burthen on our trade,
and particularly when it is considered that some other nations
pay none.      The following        are the words      of the company's
bye  -law :
   "   At   a general court,         &c. the following       orders  were
established   as   proper and       expedient for the support of the
company's affairs, and for the government of the trade; and
they were confirmed at a general               court held 3d of March
    "  It was    resolved    and ordered,       That all  goods  exported
from Turkey or Egypt for Great Britain shall pay three con-
sulages and one-half,         or seven in the hundred, according to
the rates of the company's tarif, in such species of the grand
seignior's coin      as  his officers      receive   for customs; which
consulage    stiall be paid,       one-half in thirty days, and the
other half in sixty days       after the departure of the ship, &c. ;
and the company's treasurers              are not to take any notes or
obligations for the payments of consulages,               but they are to
insist upon being paid       in money when it is due.
    " That   all goods    imported, &c. into Great Britain,          shall
pay one imposition         according to the company's rates,           &c.
except cotton and emery stones,             &c.
    "  That all    goods    imported into Turkey or Egypt, from
Leghorn,     or any other port or ports of Christendom,                 by
 British subjects or British ships,         for account of foreigners,
shall pay a consulage       of two in the hundred, &c.

shall pay         two in the hundred, &c. and in like manner ex
ported,         two in the hundred,                &c."     and several other regula
tions for the paying of consulage, of                           lesser   importance, which
I omit for brevity.
    "
    April 39th, 1785.   It is resolved and ordered, &c.
    "
    That all goods, excepting raw silk, mohair yarn, and
drugs, exported from Turkey and Egypt, in the time of the
plague, to Malta, Ancona, Venice, Messina, Leghorn, Ge
noa, or Marseilles, for the purpose of performing quarantine,
and which are to be re-shipped on the same ship for Great
Britain or Ireland,                    shall      pay    a consulage        of two in the
hundred only."
    Besides        this revenue,  the company have for many years
 received         an assistance from government of five thousand
pounds          a year.      All       these sums are expended                   for paying a
part of the         salary   of        the ambassadors at Constantinople,                    the
 consuls        at the several ports in                 Turkey, the chancellors             and
 drogomans   (or interpreters), and for defraying the ex-
 pences attending visits from the ambassador to the porte, and
 of the     consuls to pashas, besides extraordinary presents made
 at the first audience                 of   a   new ambassador and of a consul; for
 paying avanias (or money extorted by false accusations), and
 public entries of consuls, which were formerly very costly ;
 and finally, for the expences                      of    the company and its officers
 at home.
      Were our        trade put on the                  fame footing as the Russian,
 the five thousand pounds government now pays, would per
 haps       more than suffice for all the                           expences     which then
 wpuld be necessary                ;    and that our trade could be put on the
 fame footing,            I suppose         nobody will deny.              The   Russian trade
 to Turkey is free to every one ;                         there is no tax on         it,   cither

are made by consuls to pashas or other officers ; no avania is
submitted to.
  A     consul at Smyrna               only is necessary.             Vice-consuls              in
the other ports would answer every purpose for the protection
of trade; and there would be found merchants enow, who
would be glad of the office without pay, for the honour of                                      it,
which in Turkey              is   considerable.           There      is   at this day no
necessity for consuls             living in      such     great stale as they did a
few years ago.           The foreign ministers             at Constantinople have
very considerably retrenched their expences.
   The power of             an ambassador           and   of   a   consul in Turkey             is
very great;        it   extends even to life and death.                   By one of the
articles of the capitulations      (or treaty with the porte)                              it   is
stipulated,     that in all criminal cafes wherein subjects of the
porte are not concerned, ambassadors or consuls shall punish
the criminal according to the laws of their country.  In the
Dutch capitulations this expressed still stronger.
                                       is                                           As crimes
committed in      state are crimes immediately
                        a                                                      against     that
state, the cognizance             of them belongs          to   it   alone. The sultan
delegates his power to the ambassadors                             and consuls       ;    and   if
in punishing the criminal they exceed the rule prescribed                                       by
the laws of their own country, they are only answerable for
their conduct to the sultan                 ;   but the sultan takes no cogni
zance of       it,   therefore they are without control,                            and their
power     is   despotic.          It   is   indeed    true, that they generally
fend such offenders            home to their country; there have, how
ever,   with other nations,             been examples              where an European
has killed     a   subject     of the porte,         and justice being demanded
the ambassador              or consul       has put the            criminal         to death.
Should    it   happen that an Englishman killed                       a   Turk,      it   would
certainly be better that the ambassador or consul should cause
him     to be hanged           by   his own people,                than that he stiould
deliver him up to the Turks, for justice being demanded,

there is no other alternative;      if he escaped, the consequence
might be a general massacre; we have lately had an example
at Smyrna exactly of this nature, which cost the lives of
many hundreds, and caused the European quarter to be re
duced to ashes. There is no possibility of sending the crimi
nal home     if the  populace   demand justice.
    The company       have given also another power to the am
bassadors    and consuls     over merchants,        which       free traders
may not approve of.         Their bye-law      is :
                                                     " If    any factor or
factors shall have any dealings with any person battulated by
the lord ambassador, or the consul of any of the scales (ports,
Scala Italian) in Turkey, with the advice of the respective
factories, such factor or factors shall pay a fine for every of
fence to the amount of three consulages upon the value of
the transaction by or with        such battulated person,            without
appeal, 8cc."       Battulation   with them        signifies    interdiction
of all commerce with        the person battulated.         The intention
was to prevent the factors or merchants having dealings with
litigious   persons   of  the country;     but this power has been
abused.
    The   ambassador formerly had a considerable             revenue    from
protections granted to subjects        of the porte, under           the title
of Baratli,     or honorary drogomans        ;   but these protections
having been totally disregarded          by the present sultan, who
without any ceremony has beheaded several persons                   possessed
of them, both that income         and that source       of constant liti
gation with the porte are partly done away.                  It were to    be
wished that this privilege was wholly abolished.                The French
several times proposed giving         it up,    and at a      time when it
was respected, and lucrative to their ambassadors.
    The French also, on the representation of their ambassador,
M.    de St.  Prieste, laid the Levant trade open             ;   the conse
quence was, that immense quantities             of French        goods were
 carried to Turkey by subjects of the porte; but the company
 at  Marseilles found means         to get their      exclusive     privilege
 renewed ; they had suffered, but the country had gained.                  At
                                                                      present

present every one has liberty to trade ; and since our fleet has
left the Mediterranean,         their commerce is revived, and, ex
cept the trade to Great        Britain    be equally free when a peace
takes place, we (hall have little chance          of being   able to rival
them   :  but we must not wait till that period arrives to lay
our trade open     ;  it must be done immediately.
   As all communication with             the Levant    by sea   is cut off,
there remains no resource to our merchants, but to carry on
their trade through Russia        ;   and though    this be a circuitous
way, it is not by far       so  expensive     as might     be imagined.
The freights    to the Baltic are very low,         as  half the    ships go
out empty.       The carnage from Riga to Cherson, or Nic-
colai on the Bog, is mostly by water, and the land car
riage   in  Russia    is not one fourth of the price it is in Ger-,
many.      The    expence     on cloth would be trifling, and on
cheap and bulky goods e\ en would not be equal to the enor
mous price of insurance paid for armed ships, which run the
voyage at present, and        which is not      equal to the risk;       it  ig
indeed so great,       that government should, perhaps,           interfere.
At Cherson     there are good vessels to be found, which in three
days may carry the goods            to Constantinople at a reasonable
freight.
   But in order      to open such a communication,           liberty must
be obtained     of  the emperor      of Russia to send merchandize          in
tranjito (without paying duty) across Russia ; and there is no
doubt but that sovereign, who has studied Adam Smith's
book on the Wealth of Nations, and who is perfectly ac
quainted with the principles            of commerce      and navigation,
would    fee  the very great advantage which would accrue to
Russia by such a trade,        both on account of the sums which
would remain in the country for expences of carriage, the
employment of        a  number of people, and also the encourage
ment it would be to the Russian              navigation    in the Black
Sea;    but he never would grant such a privilege to a part of
the British nation exclusively, and shut out from it the Russia
merchants, who carry on a branch of- commerce                    so   advan-

 Before this can be done, the Turkey Company                      must    be

     At  present a few goods,      I am    informed,     have been      sent
 to Hamburgh,         thence to Vienna,       and   down the Danube,
 where they are shipped for Constantinople.               The freight to
 Hamburgh is dearer than it is to Riga; the charges across
  Germany      ten   times  as   much     as   across   Russia.     At the
 mouth of the Danube there           are only bad Turkish         or Greek
 vessels  to be freighted, on   which no regular        insurance can be
 made.      At Cherson there         are  some     hundreds of vessels,
  among which many equal those to be found in the ports of
  other seas, and a reasonable insurance may be made on
. them    by safe  underwriters   ;  but the route through Germany
  does not necessitate an abolition of the Levant Company.
  VIII.    Observations   on  Niples Yellow, and        the different   Me
      thods of preparing it.     By   Professor  Beckmann.
  IN APLES         yellow, which is also called Neapolitan earth, in
  Italian Giallolino, and in French Jaune de Naples, has the
  appearance     of  an earth, is    of  a pale orange-yellow colour,
  ponderous, granulated, exceedingly friable, does not efflo
  resce, nor become      moist when exposed to the air, but when
  applied to the tongue seems to adhere to it.             When     reduced
   to a fine powder, it remains for some time suspended              in wa
   ter, but soon deposits itself at the bottom in the             form of a
   slime.    When boiled with water,          the water,   at  least some
   times, is observed to have a somewhat           saline  taste.    It  does
   not effervesce with acids, but is in part dissolved by aqua-
   regia (nitro-muriatic acid). In the sire it emits no sulphureous
   vapour, is difficult to be fused, and by that operation under
   goes no material change, only that its colour becomes some
   what redder.      When    fused with colourless      glass, it gives it a
                                                                       milk-

   milk-white colour,           a sure  proof that it contains no iron              ;   and;
    with inflammable substances, there is obtained from it a re-
   gulus which has the appearance                     of   a mixture        of   lead    and
    antimony.
        This article     is brought from Naples                 for the most part in
   the form     of  an earthy crust about three or four lines                   in thick
   ness, and     it  sometimes       retains the form of the             vessel  in which
   it   has hardened.          It can   be procured also as a sine powder,
   as   the colourmen keep it sometimes                   ready pounded for use.
        How long this colour has been an article of trade I will
   not venture to determine. As far as I know, Pomet is the
   first druggist who mentions              it; but    he tells us that       it   was ex
  ceedingly scarce.             Kunckel, who          has     carefully enumerated
  all the substances proper for colouring glass, and for glazing
   earthen-ware, does not, as far as I have observed, take any
   notice of Naples yellow ; but                if names       alone can afford any
  proof of antiquity,' I would             assert   that this colour was known
  in Italy at any rate, about             the end      of   the sixteenth century ;
  for Ferrante Imperato *, whose book was first printed in the
  year i,599j fays that
                                   "  there are two kinds           of giallolino, one
  of which      is produced       from white lead by the first alteration."
  This     passage seems to         allude to the real Naples yellow ; but
  perhaps      he only meant the yellow calx (oxyd)                     of lead, or the
  so called     massikot.         Respecting the other kind, he gives no

paint really is.                  Most         of them          have considered                   it    as origi
nating from fire, and                         as a      volcanic production of Mount Ve
suvius        or Mount Ætna *                       ;   others have pronounced it to be                             a
natural ochres. Guettard thought it rather a kind of bole                                                       %    ;
but Pott approached                           nearest the truth,                   by asserting          it   to be
an artificial preparation §.                               Fougeroux is entitled to the me
rit of having proved this, and of having shewn the possibi
lity of preparing it. According to his experiments, Naples
yellow will be obtained, if you boil for seven or eight hours,
first over a slow and then over a strong fire, a mixture finely
pulverised            of     twelve           parts      of pure white                  lead,      one part         of
alum, one part of                      sal    ammoniac, and three parts of diapho
retic antimony || (white oxyd of antimony by nitre) . But
before Fougeroux, who may have obtained an account of the
process         during            his Travels through Italy, a more certain
process         was         published in the year                           1758, by Giambattista
Passeri, in his interesting work on the painting                                                   of earthen
wares.            The articles      to be employed, according to this au

ceipt was not               unknown             to Fougeroux,           and that he con
sidered allume difeccia to be alum.                                Professor Leonhardi,          a
man of very sound learning, has translated this expression by
the word alum.                   I
                   will, however, freely confess, that I con
sider allume difeccia not to mean alum, but salt                                   of tartar, or
potash      *.    Passeri says that the proportions maybe varied                              dif
ferent ways j and he gives                             fix other        receipts, in which
he does not mention allume                            difeccia, but only feccia           f ; and
this word certainly means weinbefen or winesione {tartar).
Professor Leonhardi himself seems to confirm this opinion,
by saying, that Vairo, professor of chemistry at Naples, has
tranflated " the ashes of wine lees

  2%Z                      Observations           on Naples      Yellow,
       After Fougeroux's papei was printed, De la Lande pub
  lished a receipt which he had received from the well-
 known prince San Severo, and in which lead and antimony'
 only are employed ; but no mention is made either of alum,
 tartar, or any other salt *.
      The fixity of this pigment, a property in which                         lead ochres,
 when used alone, are deficient, is ascribed by Fougeroux to
 the antimony and alum.                          The latter, perhaps, may not be
 necessary, but the addition                    of  the former is indispensible. It
 is well known that the glass of antimony has a hyacinth co
 lour, and that with red lead and flint it produces glass                                of a
 gold colours'
       Artists generally complain that this pigment often fails in
 its application, because they cannot always procure it                                of an
 equal        quality.       This     difference       arises   in all probability from
of an.          As  dictionaries,    and particularly      those  of the Italian language,
 are    in    general    deficient in regard to scientific expressions, it         would    be
doing a great service          to the    public if   some man of learning would collect
and explain all those which relate to chemistry and mineralogy.                       At any
rate translators       ought to follow the good example set them by                M. Leon-
hard i.
     *   I  shall here give      the whole       receipt  as it stands  in the   last part of
the newest edition           of foyage        en Italic, par De la Lande. Paris, 1786.
9 vol. 11 mo, p. 504 s         Take      lead   well calcined and sifted, with a third part
of   its weight     of antimony      pounded       and sifted also.    Mix  these substances
well together, and sift them again through                    a piece  of silk.   Then take
large      flat earthen    dishes, not varnished,         cover them    with white paper,
and spread out the powder upon them to the depth of about                       two inches.
Place      these  dislies in a potter's furnace,           but only at the top, that they
may not be exposed to too violent a heat.                  The   reverberation of the flame
will    be sufficient.     The     diflics    may be taken out at the fame time as the
earthen-ware,         and the substance        will  then be found hard, and of a yellow
colour.        It is then    pounded on a piece         of marble with water, and after*
wards dried for use.            This    is what is called Naples yellow.
    f To this       subject belong        the experiments      of Lewis, who, though       he
carefully examined all those substances                which seemed proper for colouring
glass, makes, however,             no mention of Naples yellow.             Sec his Philoso

 he same proportions of the two metals, and the tartar not
being always employed, as Passeri has said ; but the incon
venience might easily be prevented,                          if   the workmen               who
prepare Naples yellow would work according to a sample, as
is the cafe in regard to smalt ; and if the different qualities
were in the like manner marked by numbers or characters.
Fougeroux was informed, from Naples, that there was an old
man still living there who prepared this yellow, but that he
kept his art such a profound secret that it was apprehended
it would          die   with him.           Nothing more of it                  was   known
than that he exposed the metals which                             he employed to the
heat of a potter's furnace for twenty-four hours.
    Those who attempt to prepare this colour in Germanywill
not certainly            set    the same value          on the             Italian receipt,
and that given by Fougeroux ; for the diaphoretic antimony,
as well as white lead, are too dear — and sal ammoniac, which
is not cheap, is lost                in the   process.            On   the      other hand,
some advantage might be gained,                        if,   according to the Italian
method, both the metals, with                    a   small addition          of   an alkaline
salt, were reduced to the state of oxyds                          in   an earthen-ware
furnace.           But our enamel
                             painters prepare   yellow glazing          a
not very different from the real Naples yellow, and for which
I find    receipt in
             a          new work*, the author of which
                                  a
seems to be  man of experience, but not of learning.
                    a                                Ac
cording to this prescription, one pound of antimony, fix
ounces of red                lead,    and    two ounces           of white          sand,     are
to be fused together.                   The produce, which                     appears      quite
black,       is   to be pounded, and then fused again                      ;   and this pro
cess    is   to be repeated          till the whole     mass becomes thoroughly
yellow.           Half   a     pound   of this   mass    is    to be mixed with two
ounces of red lead, and afterwards fused                       ;   and       by   this tedious
process an orange-yellow pigment                        will      be obtained,           which,
however, might be obtained with more                              ease and        certainty    by

     All     artists who speak             of the   use   of Naples yellow, give               cau
tions against applying iron to                            it,   as the    colour by these
means becomes greenish, or at least dirty.                                For this     reason,
it   must      be pounded on               a   stone,      and      scraped together           with
an ivory spatula.                It   is   employed chiefly in oil painting, be
cause the colour           brighter, and richer than that of
                                is   softer,
ochre, yellow lead, or orpiment, and because      far exceeds               it
these pigments              in durability.             It     is   employed in particular
when the yellow ought to have the appearance of gold, and
in this       respect      it   may be prepared with gum water and used
as   a   water colour.               A still   greater advantage           of   it   is,   that   it
isproper for enamel painting, and on that account may be
employed on porcelain or earthen ware     In the last place          *.
I    would recommend to artists to examine whether the oxyd
prepared           from wolfram,               by   boiling in         the muriatic         acid,
which          has   a    beautiful yellow colour,                   might not be used in
the same manner as Naples yellow                              f.

attention too much on man, without examining other species
of animals, and comparing their varieties                            and degeneration
with     those    of    the human species.              The     first fault       is,      when
one, for example, places together                       a    Senegal negro and an
European Adonis, and at the fame time forgets that there
is not one of the bodily differences of these two beings,
whether          hair, colour, features,             &c. which            does    not gra
dually run into the fame                     thing of the other,           by    such      a   va

establish       a   certain boundary between these gradations, and
consequently between the extremes themselves.
     The    second        fault    is,when people reason as                if    man were
the only organised               being in nature, and consider
                                                    the varie
ties in his species to be strange and problematical, without
reflecting that all these varieties are not more striking or
more uncommon                 than those with which                 so   many thousands
of other        species     of    organised      beings degenerate,              as   it   were,

     More       reasons than one have induced me                          to make choice
of    swine      for this comparison;                but     in particular,            because

  Heidelberg and those of Durlach, respecting the position of
 the heart in man, was determined in consequence of orders
  from government, by inspecting a sow, to the great triumph
 of the party who really were in the wrong. Nor is it because
 in   the time        of Galen, according               to repeated assertions,           hu
 man flesh was said to have a                    taste   perfectly similar to that of

 are very like to each other                   ; but because both, in regard to
 the economy of their bodily structure, taken on the whole,
 shew        unexpectedly,          on the first view,           as well as on closer
 examination, a very striking similitude.

 to the principal causes of degeneration arising from climate,
 mode,       of life, nourishment,              &c;      both, for the same reason,
 are      subject to many diseases, and, what is particularly
 worthy of remark, to diseases rarely found among other
 animals than             men and swine, such                  as    the    stone    in    the

  Another        reason,          however,         why            I    have made choice of
swine for the present comparison                                 is,   because the degenera
tion and descent from the original race are far more certain in
these two animals, and can be better traced than in the va
rieties of other domestic animals.                                For no naturalist,            I      be
lieve, has carried his scepticism                       so       far as to doubt the descent
of the domestic swine from                      the wild boar           ;     which      is    so   much
the more evident, as                  it   is   well known that wild pigs, when
caught, may be easily rendered                              as    tame and familiar                 as do

 than one species.

    In this    respect the Patagonians           *,    as is well known,         have
 afforded     the greatest employment to anthropologists.                         The
 romantic tales, however, of the old travellers, who give to
 these inhabitants            of the southern extremity of America                    a
 stature   of   ten feet and more, are scarcely worth notice ; and
 even the more modest relations             of later English navigators, who
 make their height from fix to seven feet, have been doubted
 by other travellers, who, on the fame coast, sought for such
 children of Enoch in vain.                But we shall admit every thing
 said  of   the extraordinary size        of these Patagonians, by Byron,
Wallis, and Carteret, the first of whom f assigns to their
 chief, and several of his attendants, a height of not less than
 seven feet,     as far as     could be determined by the eye             ;   the se
cond    %,   who asserts that he actually measured               them, gives to
 the greater part of them from 5 feet 10 inches to 6 feet; to
 some 6 feet 5 inches, and 6 feet 6 ; but to the tallest, 6 feet 7
inches    :  and this account is confirmed by the last-mentioned
   • Or rather Pata-chonians,        for the people themselves are called Chonoii
and because    their   feet, covered with raw hides, gave them a likeness to
a  bear's paws,      they were    called  by  the   first Spanish navigators pata-

the cafe, it is not near such                         an excess of stature as that ob
served in many parts of America among the swine, originally
carried thither from Europe ; and of these I shall mention in
particular those of Cuba                    f,    which are more than double the
size    of the original             stock    in Europe.

is observed among swine                     in different countries. In Piedmont,
For example,                they are black.                When    I   passed     through that
country, during the great fair for swine at Salenge,                                    I did   not
fee a single one              of any other colour.                 In Bavaria, they             are
reddish brown ;               in Normandy, they                 are all white.
   Human hair                 is,

different, but lie flat, and are only longer than the hair on
the other parts of the body.                               They cannot, therefore, be
employed              by   the brush-makers.                 The difference between the
hair of the wild boar and the domestic                                  swine, particularly
 in    regard to the softer part between the strong bristles,                                is,   as

    The whole      difference    between the cranium     of a negro   and
that of an European,          is not in the least degree greater than
that equally striking difference which exists between the cra
nium of the wild boar and that of the domestic swine.
Those who have not observed this in the animals themselves,
need only to cast their eye on the figure             which Dauben     ton
has given of both.
     I  (hall pass over less  national varieties which may be found
 among swine        as well  as among men, and only mention that
I   have been assured by          Mr. Sulzer that the peculiarity of
 having the bone of the leg remarkably long, as is the cafe
 among the Hindoos, has been remarked with regard to the
swine in Normandy.
                               " They   stand very long on their hind
                                               " their back, therefore,
legs," fays he, in one of his letters;
is highest at the rump, forming a kind of inclined plane ;
 and the head proceeds in the fame direction, so that the snout
is not far from the ground." I mall here add, that the swine,
in   some countries, have degenerated           into races which in sin
gularity far exceed every thing that has been found strange
in bodily variety among the human race. Swine with solid
hoofs were known to the ancients, and large herds of them
 are found in Hungary* Sweden, &c.                   In the like manner
 the European swine, first carried by the Spaniards in 1509
 to the island of Cuba, at that time celebrated for its pearl
 fishery, degenerated      into a monstrous race, with hoofs which
were half a span in length          *.

  X-    -Account    of   the Method        of making Sugar from Beet
     Roots,   lately discovered      by  M. Achard. Communicated
     by  A. N. Scherer,             Counsellor    of Mines     to the  Duke of
     Saxe Weimar.,
                                                   Weimar, 14th Feb. 1799.
   A HE      newest and most important discovery             in Germany is
 that of the well known M. Achard, director of the physical
 class  of  the Academy      of Sciences     at Berlin, who has at length
 found    a substitute   for sugar in the beet root, (Beta vulgaris,
 Linn.)     These beets in this country have been hitherto em
 ployed as fodder for cattle.              The following       is one of his
principal experiments:— Twenty-five                 roots,  which in their
raw    state  weighed 32!      pounds, being freed          from the rind,
bruised, and well pressed, gave, aster the residuum had been
extracted by boiling water, 10 \ pounds of juice.                    The ex
pressed    juice  was then put into a tin saucepan, and evaporat
ed to the consistence        of honey     over a slow fire.       During this
process the impurities contained            in the juice,  and which arose
from the albumen of the beets,                 were   scummed       off.   The
inspissated salt was next evaporated to dryness over a flower
fire, and      gave,   when pounded,           a   dry powder of a very
bright brown colour, which attracted little or no moisture ;
It was    exceedingly      sweet, without        the intermixture       of any
other taste, and       weighed two pounds three               ounces. The
above     quantity, viz. 32} pounds of the raw roots, gave,
therefore, two pounds three ounces of raw sugar. By another
experiment it appeared, that a pound of this juice contained
only    I of an   ounce, or almost one ounce of gummy and mu
cilaginous particles      :  a circumstance which greatly facilitated
the separation      of  the sugar.       To obtain      a  portion    of pure
sugar    from     a quantity     of juice evaporated and treated as
above described,       a portion       of the juice, inspissated to dry
ness, was       digested    with  a   sufficient quantity     of alcohol in
a  gentle heat ; and after all the saccharine matter was dis
solved, and the liquor had become perfectly cold,                it wasfiltred
                                       U  %                                and

*tO*                     Description of   Mr. Salmon's
and the residuum properly edulcorated                 with   a suitable   quart*
tity of alcohol. When all the spirit of wine had evaporated *
over a gentle fire, the quantity of the pure white sugar ob
tained was such that in general 8 pounds of pure sugar may
 be expected from ioo pounds of raw beet roots. According
 to this result, an acre of land, which may produce 46,000
 pounds of beet root, will yield 22 hundred weight                       of raw
 sugar.        If  we allow four pounds         of  beet root to one square
 foot, a German mile will produce 16,756 hundred weight
2    quarters      and 14 pounds.         This is all    as    yet known      re
 specting the discovery.             What M. Achard           still keeps secret
 is the result of his fifteen years experience                  respecting   the
 cultivation        of   these beets.     He   has found that the quantity
 of   sugar to be obtained          will depend on the soil in       which they
 are sown, and the             method of culture employed. The king
 of    Prussia has not only bestowed a considerable                   reward   on
 M.     Achard for this discover)-,          but is pursuing every possible
 means to render            it beneficial to  his dominions.
  XI.    Description       of an Improved Machine for Cutting Chaff's,
      invented       by   Mr. Robert Salmon, os Wohurn, Bed
     fordshire.         From Transactions of the Societv for the             En
      couragement of Arts, &c.               Vol. XV.
   W        ITH        this machine the chaff is cut bv two knives,
  A A,     (Plate VI.) fixed on the inside of the fellies of two
  wheels, B B, which are strongly connected together ; the
  edge    of   the knives being at an angle          of about forty-five      de
  grees from the plane           of the wheel's motion.            These knives
  are so fixed as to be forced forward by springs,                  C C, on    the
  wheel    ;   which springs are formed to adjust, and act more or
     '* Distillation
                       might be employed to save the loss of the alcohol.   Edit.
     f Thirty     guineas were voted to   Mr.  Salmon for this improved machine,
 of which     a model is rcsetved in the Society's   repository for the inspection
  of  the public.
                                                                              less

  Jess as occasion    may require,       so as to give the   knife as much
  pressure against the box as may be requisite to cut the straw.
 The knives     are prevented       from coming too forward, and oc
  casioning unnecessary         friction, by the wedges under the
 staples   a a ; which       wedges,      as  the  knives wear, must be
 drawn out     so as to    admit the knives to come more forward.
 With     the before-mentioned provisions             it will be found very
                                                                             -
 easy at any time to put on new knives,                as the springs,  &c.
 will  always adjust them to their work.
     On  one side    of the wheel    is fixed a round block     of wood, D,
 in which    there are four holes and a moveable              screw; to this
 block is screwed one end of the feeding-arm, E, running nearly
 horizontally     to the cross bar      F,   at the end   of the box G ; to
 which cross bar       E  is attached by the pin b, moveable to five
different holes in F, by means of which, and the four holes in
 the block before described,           twenty changes in the length of
 the chaff may be obtained.               The   straw is brought forward
 by the rollers     in  the box    G, the form of which is         shewn at
 Fig.  % ; which rollers are turned from the outside by the rig-,
gers or ratchet-wheels,         H,    one on each side the box,      which
 move more or less, according to the stroke given to the cross
bar by the feeding-arm and wheel: by this mode of feeding,
the straw is perfectly at rest, and does not press forward at the
time of the knife cutting;            and, by means of the pin being
taken out    of  the cross bar, the feeding is instantly thrown off,
although the wheel and knives may continue their motion.
Under the box is suspended the pressing weight I, which may
be made more or less powerful by shifting the weight on the
bearer    K,  to which it hangs, and             also may be thrown      on
either side, more or less, as occasion               may require ; which
will   be found useful,      in order     to force the straw towards    the
knife, and to counterbalance the ratchet-wheel of the upper
roller: near the fulcrum of this bearer is fixed a chain, shewn
by the dotted line c; its upper end suspended from a roller;
at each extremity of which is a small bar of iron joined to
                                       U   3                            the

is always equally      pressed  in  passing the two-spiked rollers.
    L. The winch by which           the machine is turned.
    M M. The frame of the           machine.
     In order   to apply this machine to the best advantage,        the
 inventor proposes      a second    box to be placed at the end       of
 the first, which box may be of any length, and suspended by
 a line and counter-weight, whereby the end of it is brought
 down level whilst silling with straw, and then drawn up, so as
 to give the said box a declivity, to make the straw more easily
 come forward.
     It is also presumed     much advantage      may be expected      in
 this sort of machine, from its cutting various lengths — resting
 during the cut — the knives being adjusted to their work by
 regulating springs     —the     feeding being readily thrown off —
 and the pressure moveable to either side.
     It is also well calculated to be applied to any power which
 may be occasionally fixed to the opposite fide of that on which
 it is turned by hand ; and, by the additional box, when used
 by hand, the workman will be enabled to cut for some con-
 tinuance, without stopping to feed.

      the Results of ivblcb may serve as the Foundation for a
      Theory   of  the  Earth.      By   M. de Saussurb.          From

                                to be made on the   Valleys.
                Observations
  1.    JL O observe the direction of valleys.        Those parallel t«
  the chain of the mountains where they are situated are called
  longitudinal ; those which intersect it at right angles, trans
                                                                versal  ;

  versal ; and those which         follow an indeterminate direction,
  oblique.
      2. To  observe this direction, especially in regard to that           of
  the planes   of the    strata of  the mountains.
     3. Dimensions of the valleys; their length, breadth, depth,
  and the form      of their transversal section.
      4. The re-entering and salient angles : whether opposite
  to each salient angle, which forms a fide of the valley, the
  fide or opposite mountain forms a re-entering               angle j or, on
  the other hand, whether the valley does not present alternate
• constrictions    and swellings     ?
     5. Whether the         opposite     mountains correspond by their
  height, their form, the inclination of their corresponding
  faces ; the situation     of their   strata, or their nature    ?
      6. Answers      to these questions         will  serve   to  determine
  whether the valley may or may not be considered as                  a large
  fissure produced      by the bursting asunder          of the mountains
  which it traverses.
      7. If  the lateral valleys      which terminate at a principal
  valley, as the branches of a tree at its trunk, correspond or
  not ; or, in other words, whether the branches of that trunk
  are opposite or alternate      ?
      The  answers to these two questions           are very important for
  the solution of this question        :  Whether     the valleys have been
  excavated by currents        of  the   sea. ?
      9. Whether there are seen a great number as narrow val
  leys, of no great depth at their most elevated part, but be
  coming wider and deeper in proportion as they descend
  lower, whieh woukl seem to indicate that their excavation
  has been the effect of the fall and descent of water j especially
  if the  strata have the same inclination            on each side of the
  valley, and   if its formation cannot be explained by a finking
  down or heaving up of the earth.
      jo. To   observe    in  a valley, the corresponding mountains
  of which    are  of  the fame nature, whether the strata           of these
  mountains do not descend on each side towards the bottom
                                       U4                                   of

SjjD                    Hints for  the  Formation of
of the valley, which would indicate that the valley has been
produced by a finking down of the earth, or perhaps by the
opposite faces being thrown up.
    II.   There are two other cafes possible when the strata
have not the fame situation on both sides of the valley.
 i. When the strata rife up on each fide against the valley.
2. When on one side they descend into the valley, and on
the other rise against it. These two cases afford room for
suppositions     too various to be here detailed.
    i a.  To  search on the vertical sides     of the valleys for  ves
tiges    of the  erosion   of the water.
                                                                         (
    13.   To  observe the bottom      of  the valley, its breadth,   in
 clination    and   nature.     The   vegetable   earth, its quantity
 and quality; fragments, either from neighbouring               moun
 tains, or brought from a distance, either angular or rounded;
 to examine whether they are more voluminous towards the
 top of the valley. Nature and depth of the strata which are
 below the vegetable earth ; whether the pebbles are larger
 in   the deepest strata    : nature of the rock which forms the
 solid basis of the valley.
     14.   Whether     a valley contains foreign pebbles,     that is to
 fay, which come from the neighbouring mountains : to exa
 mine to what height they are found on the sides of the
 mountains     ;  what may be their origin, and what way they
 may have been conveyed.
     15. In the valleys which contain no foreign pebbles, one
 may follow the traces of those which are there discovered,
 and thus ascend to the rock from which they were detached;
 this has often led to curious and useful discoveries.

from grand chains of mountains,           there are not found small
hills and even tertiary mountains,        which     seem to have been
formed by the accumulation          of  matters deposited by enor
mous currents that issued formerly from these valleys.
   3. Whether their strata do not descend on the                    fide,
whence the matter of which they are formed has                       pro
ceeded?
   4. Size and nature of the fragments, sand and earth, of
which they are composed.
   5. To observe the order which has been followed in the
successive deposits of the matters of which they are formed.
   6. To compare them with the substances produced by the
mountains, whether primitive or secondary, from which
they are supposed to have issued.
   7. To examine whether there are found there any vestiges
of organised bodies.
   8.  To examine whether there        are not found, in their ex
terior part or surface, strata that    seem   to have been deposited
by stagnant water, or at least water not much agitated ; or,
on the contrary, whether every thing in them seems to have
been transported     by some violent movement         ?

       Observations   to be made on Secondary        Mountains.
   1.  To determine with precision        the distinguishing charac
ters between     primitive and secondary mountains.              This is
difficult,  especially in the genera found equally in primitive
mountains,     such   as slate,  serpentines,      and some kinds       of
trapps    and  porphyry.      With   regard     to the   calcareous,     a
granulated fracture seems to characterise         the primitive.      M.
Fichtel, however, doubts this principle, and              believes   that
there are secondary       granulated, calcareous, and compact
primitives.
   2.  Is it certain,  as Dolomieu       asserts, that   in   secondary
mountains there are no strata composed             entirely  of granu
lated and crystallised   stones ?
                                                                   3. To

   3. "To determine the respective antiquity of the genera and;
species of the earths and stones which enter into the com
position of secondary mountains.                           Might    we not assign cha
racters by-           which, in the              fame genus, we might distinguish-
the most modern species and varieties                         ?
   4. Whether the secondary mountains are always inclined
in such a manner as to lean towards the nearest primitives ?
  5. Whether their superior stratum, especially in the com
pact calcareous, is not often a brecbe*, the angular frag
ments of which are for the most part of the fame nature as
the stratum              that serves them as a basis, and united by a
cement             of the   fame natures           ?
   5. (A). To observe in the chalk mountains the stints con
tained there ; their bulk, their form, 8cc. ; whether they
»re disposed             in    beds ; to reflect          on their origin     :     even   re
searches            on the petro-silex contained in the compact cal
careous stones ; and, lastly, the fame on the hard rognons, or
touch-stones contained in the slate mountains                             :   to ascertain
whether these petro-silex and rognons are not found in the
primitive mountains.
   6. Whether there are found in secondary mountains ves
tiges of organised bodies, and at what elevation. This obser
vation is important above all in the Austral hemispheres.
      7.   Whether             there are sound, either at their surface, or                 in
their interior parts,                rolled pebbles or blocks         of a nature dif
ferent from that               of the   fame mountain, and to what height                   || r.

XIII.    Fourth Communication from Dr. Thqrnton, Phy
  sician to the General Dispensary, relative to Pneumatic Me
   dicine.
                        Letter to  Dr. Thornton.
      Dear Sir,                                         Dulwich Common.
I   RETURN        you many thanks for your kind attentions to
Mrs. R. Your method of treatment, under Providence,              has cer
tainly performed a wonderful cure.           My   wife had not inhaled
the air three times before      I  perceived a very great alteration,
both in regard       to appetite     and spirits ; her strength,     in  a
week, was also      so   much restored that (he could with            ease
walk five miles, when before it was quite             a  fatigue to walk
one.    I  can with pleasure likewise add, that what alarmed
us both —the coldness of her extremities, and blackness
under the finger-nails — are both entirely removed, and her
nails now appear healthy. As my wife has not enjoyed such
good    health for several years       as  she has   experienced    these
last six months,    Mrs. R. unites with       me   in grateful acknow
ledgements to you.
              And   I  remain, dear sir, your's respectsolly,
                                                      M. Robinson.

     300                          On Pneumatic Medicine.
       Observations.  This lady, residing in a country feat, which
    has a delightful garden, and a good deal of ground attached
    to     it,   in   an open      situation, could not be supposed to wan;
    vital air in the blood.                 Such,      however, appeared        to be the
    fact.        In   such cafes   I    find by the eudiometer, that the Hood
    is   in fault, attracting but slowly into its bosom the vital prin
    ciple.         But   as even the most apparently incombustible bodies
    readily deflagrate in pure oxygen air, as steel, &c. the fame
    phenomenon might be expected in the human frame; and
    in the         present    instance       we   see   that this was actually per
    formed.           The good, however, of               a   temporary inhalation of
    a    super-oxygenated              air would have          been    lost,   unless     the
    blood had been altered.                     Steel was therefore       enjoined,        to
    gether with what              is   styled the phlogistic regimen           ;   and the
    event exactly corresponded                  with my       expectations     —the     radi
    cal defect was obviated, the attractive                      power in the blood
    was improved, and the blood, coming into contact with                                   a
    super-oxygenated              atmosphere,          readily imbibed    a    large pro
    portion of vital air.              The   blackness      under the finger-nails in
    consequence           soon disappeared,             the appetite    became      quick
    ened,        the spirits were increased,            and the blood freely passing
.   from the centre to the circumference, and from the circum
    ference back again to the heart, the phlogistic particles de
    composing the vital air in the blood in its                    passage,     hence the
    extremities, and the whole body, became permanently warm.
    — As     the above cafe may seem to some not sufficient to argue
    much in favour of pneumatic medicine,                       I     shall beg leave      to
    lay before the philosophic world the following extraordinary
    cure:
                          A      CASE OF MELANCHOLIA.
      Mr. Blundel,               æt. 49,    a   wholesale      linen-draper        on   Hol-
    born Hill, was            subject    to melancholia          above    thirty years     ;
    that     is,   he had frequent depression                 of spirits, without any
    assignable cause         ;   and this lowness was not casual, but would
    remain for months with great                         languor, and was accom
    panied frequently            with   a   diiiaste    of every thing   before agree
                                                                                        able.

                          A   Case   of Melancholia.                       jot
able.       Mr. Blundel's only relief was              a journey    into    the
country,        which    he was       accustomed     to   take   every    year.
Having two very eminent physicians as half-brothers,                   the ce
lebrated chemist        Dr. Bryan Higgins,        and   Dr. Haighton phy
sician to the Eastern Dispensary, the most eminent physiolo
gist  of this country,     every    thing that the    art of medicine could
do had been employed, but without any material advantage.
 Mr. Blundel wished, therefore, to make trial of the vital air ;
 and he inhaled it at first under the management of a self-taught
 genius, his neighbour         Mr. Varley, of Hatton-Housc, Hatton-
 Garden,       and  found at that time " an increase of strength"
 and    " his   spirits mended."          But what struck him       most was,
 " an    issue  which   used to discharge was, since his commencing
 the air, completely dried up.              Another thing       he remarked,
 " that     after walking he had varicose tumours in the veins of
 his legs; but that these did not appear,                  even   aster a long
 walk, since he had inhaled the vital air."                I will select a few
 more observations,          as made by      Mr. Blundel.
     **
        September 20.           Spirits much enlivened       after taking the
  vital air.
     "  September      22.      The    fame good     sensations have conti
  nued, although        I did not take the air yesterday.
     " September         23.      Found     my mind       tranquillized,     and
  somewhat elated towards evening              ; and  when   I awoke    the next
  morning,        perceived    a general    glow over the body ; the feet,
  which      used before to be     always cold, were comfortably warm ;
  the fingers glowed to their extremities, and I could clasp
  them with firmness ; before, they would feel cold and numbed,
  and     I  was obliged to rub them before             I  could close them.
  All   my family observe that my countenance looks less fallow.
      "   September 25.          Spirits continued throughout           the   day
  very good.        Sleep grateful.
      " September        26.     The    fame to-day.
       " September 27.            The   fame observations      to-day."
       I should mention,         that when     Mr.  Blundel applied to me,
   I desired     him  to continue the air        with Mr. Varley,        and or
                                                                            dered

JOJ                             On Vegetable Cuttings
dered a seton        in    the neck, as the issue was dried up.              I di
rected also bark, columbo, and prepared                kali,    to correct aci
dity and brace the stomach, as also to render the blood more
attractive of oxygen, and the body was kept regular with
aloetic pills ; and this plan speedily produced                 the blessing of
sound health,           which      has continued now upwards           of   fifteen
months, without                 any disagreeable   nervous     sensations,     and
without a single excursion being made into the country.
   Observations on this Cafe.   In the case of Mr. Russel,
which was melancholia,                recorded by   Dr.   Beddoes,      the cure
was effected without a seton             j how much       are we therefore to
attribute to this application in the present instance              ?   The dry
ing up the issue by the vital air, when employed alone, did
it not denote, from the absorption of this principle, an in
creased energy of the absorbents?    I have before noticed,
that where scrum was discharged, this has happened ; but
when matter is secreted, there is on the contrary a more
abundant discharge, or the serum is converted into laudable
pus.    In the          cafe    of Mr. Fixsen, St. Anne's-Street,           West
minster, an        issue    which could not be made to discharge,              be
gan immediately to pour out matter, upon the commence
ment of the inhalation of the medicinal air. The varicose veins
disappearing was           a strong   mark of increased energy in the cir
culating     vessels.     The    numbness   of the fingers going off, shewed
increased action remote from the heart ; the glow, the increase
of spirits, all     declare       in marked   expressions the influence          of
vital air ; and what makes me the more inclined to this opi
nion   is, that country air before used to afford the only relief.

                           of                 the late             by
  Mr. CuSTANCE, for making Vegetable Cuttings for the
  Microscope.                         Dr. Thornton, Lec
                           Communicated       by
  turer on      Medical Botany at Guy's Hospital, &c. &fc.
A      HE     first idea        of making   vegetable cuttings      to be      ex
amined        by   the microscope, originated from               the    famous
                                                                              Dr.

                               for   the Microscope.
                                                                             303
 3Dr.    Hookc    above a century ago, as may be seen                in his Mi-
 crographia.
       "  Charcoal, or a vegetable           burnt black," fays this emi
 nent philosopher,         " affords    an object no     less pleasant  than in
 structive; for     if you    take a small round piece         of charcoal, and
 break it short with your fingers, you may perceive it to break
 with a very smooth and sleek surface, almost like the surface
 of black sealing wax           :  this surface,  if it  be looked on    with an
 ordinary microscope, does manifest abundance of those pores,
  which are also visible to the eye in many kinds of wood,
  ranged round the         pith, both in      a kind    of circular order, and
  a radiant one.         Of    these there     are  a multitude in the sub
  stance   of the coal,     every where almost perforating and           drilling
  it from     end     to end ; by means         of which,      be the coal ever
  so   long, you may easily blow through                it; and this you may
  presently    find,    by wetting       one   end   of    it with spittle, and
  blowing at the other.
       " But this is not all :      for, besides those many great and con
  spicuous     irregular spots or pores, if a better microscope be
  made use of, there           will   appear   an infinite company        of   ex
  ceedingly small and very                regular pores,      so  thick and     so
   orderly   set,  and   so close to one      another, that they leave very
   little room or space between them to be filled with a solid
   body; for the apparent interstitia, or separating sides of these
   pores, seem so thin       in   some places, that the texture      of a honey
   comb cannot be more porous                 : though this be not
                                                                            every
   where so, the intercurrent partitions in some places being
   very much thicker in proportion to the holes.
        " Most   of  these small pores seemed to be pretty round, and
   were ranged      in rows that       radiated from the pith to the bark;
   they all of    them seemed         to be continued open pores,
                                                                         running
   the whole length of the stick ; and that they were all perfo
rated, I tried by breaking off a very thin sliver of the coal
   cross-ways, and then with my microscope diligently survey
   ing them     against     the light, for by that means           I was able to
   See   quite through them.
                                                                         " These

¦64               As*"'   distance' s Machine     for making
     " These pores       were so exceedingly small and thick, that          in
a line    of them,    T'T   part of an inch long,      I found,    by number
ing them, no less than 150 small pores ; and therefore, in a
line of them an inch long, must be no less than 2700 pores;
and in a circular area of an inch diameter, must be about
5,725,350 of the like pores ; so that a stick of an inch diame
ter may containe no less than seven hundred and twenty-five
thousand, besides 5 millions of pores, which would, I doubt
 not, seem even incredible, were not every one left to believe
 his own eyes.          Nay, having        since examined cocus, black
 and     green    ebony, lignum vitæ, &c.             I  found that all these
 woods have their pores abundantly smaller than those of soft
 li«rht wood ; in so much that those of guajacum seemed not
 above an eighth part of the bigness of the pores of beech, but
 then the interstitia were thicker;            so  prodigiously curious are
 the contrivances, pipes, or fluces by which the succus nutri-
  tius, or juyce of      a vegetable,   is conveyed from place to place."
      He   afterwards      fays,
                                 "I   took    a good    clear piece of cork,
  and, with a pen-knife sharpened              as keen as a      razor, I cut a
  piece   of it off,     and   thereby left the surface of it exceeding
  smooth; then examining it very diligently with a microscope,
  methought       I  could perceive it to appear         a little porous ; but
  I   could not    so   plainly distinguish them as to be sure that
  they were pores, much less what figure they were of: but
  judging from the lightness and yielding quality of the cork,
   that certainly the texture could not be so curious, but that
   possibly, if I could use some further diligence, I might find
   it  to be discernible with      a microscope,      I, with    the same (harp
   pen-knife, cut off from the former smooth surface an exceed
   ing thin piece of it ; and placing it on a black object plate,
   because    it was itself    a white body, and casting the light on it
   with    a deep plano-convex glass, I could exceeding plainly
    perceive    it to    be all perforated      and porous, much like a
    honey-comb,         but that the pores of it were not regular ; yet
    it was not unlike        a honey-comb in these particulars."
                                      5                                    This

                 Vegetable   Cuttings  for   the Microscope.             30$
     This   is the first rude   hint respecting    the mode   of cutting of
Vegetables,      since  which time cutting machines        have been con*
 trived by several ingenious mechanics, that might better per
 form this delicate operation.           In   1770   Dr.  Hill published a
 treatise,    in which     he explained the construction         of timber
 by means of vegetable cuttings examined by the microscope;
 and he in that work gives an account of a cutting engine,
 in which       a spiral knife is employed ; the invention, he fays,
 of Mr. Cummings.           The   late Mr. Adams, optician in Fleet-
 street, appears to have contrived a machine for cutting                thin
 sections     of wood, in    order that the texture      thereof might be
 more     visible to the microscope ; and in his Essays on the
 Microscope, he says, that this his invention was afterwards
 improved by         Mr. Cummings.         Notwithstanding       the appli
 cation of Dr. Hill, and of others who attempted                  to  bring
 this art to perfection, Custance, a common carpenter from
 Ipswich,      surpassed   every other,      and,   as Mr. Adams justly
 observed, continued unrivalled in his dexterity of prepar
 ing thin sections of wood, having brought this art to the
  highest perfection.        He cautiously     kept his method a secret
 from every one, and various conjectures were made in what
 way he accomplished          his unrivalled cuttings.       When    he was
 alive,   I   offered him fifty pounds for the discovery,        to disclose
 it  to the world for the promotion          of science,  and  in order the
 better    to accomplish my views           in my New Illustration of
 Linnæus,        where the organisation of vegetables is a particu
  lar object of consideration *. When pressed, he offered me
  the discovery for an hundred guineas, which thinking ex
  orbitant,    I  gave up all thoughts    of it  ;  but, soon after dying,
  he left    in his will, that     every   thing he    possessed  should be
  put up to public auction j and, among other things, his in
  vention of the cutting engine was particularly noticed in the
  catalogue.        They  were not, however, exposed to examina
   tion, but     I did not fail being at the     sale to embrace    this op
  portunity of bidding for the two engines, fearful that a mo-
      *

nopoly might be made of the art of preparing vegetable cut
 tings,    as   had    been   successfully      done       by Custance.          Al
 though the opposition was strong,            I was     the successful bidder,
 and became       possessed   of both engines, which             are constructed
 nearly upon the fame principle            ; and    I  am happv to embrace
 the present opportunity of communicating to the public so
 valuable an acquisition to philosophy and science.
                Cujlance's    best Cutting Engine described.
     Fig. I.   represents a view, and sig. a. a section,               of the cut
  ting machine.         It has the appearance         of   an oblong box, and
  the   sides  from the bottom        A   (fig. a.) up to B are made of
  brass.      A   piece    of hard mahogany,             C C, is fitted into
  the brass box, and sills the whole cavity down to a a,                        leav
  ing   a void    space at the bottom,          of    sufficient    size to admit
  the parts of the machine which                 work there,           and    which
  are described     below.      From the top to the bottom of the
  wood there is       a  perforation, of which the outline of fig. 3.
  may be considered           as   representing        a    horizontal       section,
  which      receives   easily a brass socket,          sig. 3, in which           the
  wood      (b) to be cut is secured          in   its place by means            of   a
   brass holdfast c, grooved like a float file, and pressed against
   the wood by the screw d.             This     socket,      with the holdfast,
   (which viewed         in front has     a fluted       appearance)         and   the
   piece of wood       is represented     in its     place     D,   sig.   1   and 2,
   where it is secured from shaking bv means of the piece t,
   fig. a, pressed against it by the screws, but not so tight as
   to prevent its being Taised when required by the micrometer
   screw to be yet described.       The   socket, which sills the perfora
   tion from the surface       D down to^,        has a horizontal division
   at b,  whkh    serves as a   bottom for the holdfast to            rest   on  ; the
   cavity of the socket below      b receives a piece       of metal i i, of which
   fig. 4, is an horizontal section ;          through this piece, which
   moves easily up or down in the socket,                 is a female screw,         in.
   which    the micrometer screw turns,           which may          be seen pass
   ing through i i in fig. 2. The micrometer                    screw,     the neck
   of which works in a plate m m, made fast                     to the bottom        of
   the piece     of mahogany        before    described        by means        of the

plate m m, as may be seen                            in the    figure,     and by the micro

which projects through the lower surface of m m. Therefore,
when the index is turned, the screw working                                            in   i    raises or
lowers i ; the latter by its form being prevented from turn

raised as much as the intended thickness                                  of the flip           to be cut,

described,           to rise exactly the same quantity— care being taken
to regulate the pressure communicated by the fide screw_/*in
such a manner as just to allow free action to the micrometer
screw, and yet to prevent any lateral deviation                                   in   the ascent          of
the socket.            A    portion of          the index wheel comes through the
front of the machine                     (0,   fig. 1.)    ;   and all that          is   necessary to
raise the wood, the parts being previously adjusted                                       in the man
ner described,              is   to lay hold         of    the knob that presents itself at
the opening, and move                     it        to the left,    a    half,   a   whole, or two
divisions, according to the thickness the flip                              is   wished to be cut.
These divisions are marked on the circumference of the index,
and you note the quantity that passes                           a   stationary         point marked
over the centre              of the opening.

                                               is

fit against         the   front         edge       of   the rule             G G.        The rule      H<
which is moveable with the knife                              r r,      is tapered from the end
H,     so as to be somewhat               narrower at the end next to the ca
vity   D, than         the diameter            of the         pieces         of wood that can           be
contained betwixt the holdfast                          (c,   fig. 3.) and the other side                 of
the socket.  From this the wonderful simplicity and accuracy
of the process, as performed                        by
                                this apparatus, must be ob
vious   ;      for the socket,          or in other words the piece of wood
from which the slip                is   to be cut, being raised to the desired
height         by
             turning the micrometer  all that  necessary           0,                  is                 is
to slide the rule H, with an even hand and pressure, along
between the rule              GG        and the wood to be                           cut ;   the     taper
form of the knife, or rather of its bed, causing                                            it    to shave
off, as the broad end comes nearer to the socket,                                           a    slip from
the surface exposed to its action.                            It   should be here remarked,
that    a      portion of the bed                  (the rule            H)    is   cut      away from
under the knife, from              r     to   r,   to allow the knife to pass freely
over      the wood as         it   performs its office.                       To       keep the wood
perfectly       fast   in its place while the slip                       is   cutting off, besides
the holdfast in the socket already described,                                      there     is   the fol
lowing contrivance            :—A         brass spur, u,             a   little thinner than the
rule H, having            a   circular notch at its widest end, which may
be moved or made fast at pleasure   means of the screw v,       by
is brought up tight against the wood to be cut (the wood
being embraced                by   the    circular notch),                     and      then screwed
fast ;    the opening at the narrow end of the spur,                                              through
which the screw           passes,        is   in   the form             of   a   slit, to allow      it   to
be adapted with ease to different sizes.
     As   the brass socket rises as well as the wood,                                       (and this     is
indispensible to secure the parallel rising                              of the wood            after each
cut,)     it   must be obvious, that when,                              by   being raised to allow
taking off repeated cuttings,                      it     has been             brought almost             to
the knife, the apparatus must be re-adjusted, and the wood
raised in the socket before more cuttings be taken off.
     It   need hardly be remarked,                            that the cutting knife                      is
                                                                                   •               ground

X V.    Remarkable In/lance of a Turkey Cock hatching Eggs.
    By M. Oedmann, From New Transactions of the Aca
    demy    of Sciences     at Stockholm.      Vol.  X.
Mi.ALE         fowls, which associate with       a plurality of females,
care so little for their posterity,       particularly in a wild state,
that they do not seem to have the least affinity to the young
when hatched, and contribute neither towards rearing nor
protecting them      ; on this account     M. Oedmann       considers the
following circumstance to be very singular; such, perhaps,
as was never before observed.            In the month of May 1789
a  turkey-hen was sitting upon eggs, and           as the   cock, in his
solitude,   began    to be uneasy      and to seem    dejected,    he was
allowed to remain in the fame place along with her.                    He
immediately fat down by the female,             and people    at first be
lieved that this was only a piece         of gallantry  ;  but they soon
found that he had taken some of the eggs from under the hen,
which he covered very carefully with his body. The maid, who
looked after the poultry, thought this mode of hatching would
be attended      with little   advantage,  and therefore put the eggs
back under the hen        ;  but the cock was no sooner at liberty
than he again carried some of them away as before. M. Ha-
felhuhn, the proprietor, when he observed this, resolved,
for the sake of experiment, to let the cock have his own way,
and    he caused    a nest    to be prepared    with   as  many eggs as
the animal's large body was able to cover. The cock seemed
to be highly pleased with this mark of confidence, fat with
                                                           to the care of
great patience on the eggs, and was so attentive
hatching them that he scarcely took time to go in search of

310                            Method of securing Trees
food.         At   the proper period 28 young ones were produced ;
and the cock, who was now in some measure                                    the mother of
so    numerous an offspring, appeared                            a good      deal   perplexed
when he saw             many little animals pecking around him and
                         so
requiring          his continual vigilance; but as it is well known
that turkeys are               so stupid and heedless             that they often do not
fee where they tread,                     it was not thought proper to trust the
cock with this young brood any longer, and#they were reared
in another manner. M. Carlson remarks on this circum
stance, that the total neglect                      of their young, ascribed to male
birds which associate with a                        plurality of females, is not ge
neral.         Geese are           of this kind,       and yet the gander protects
the young with the greatest care.                                But the      instance        of   a
turkey-cock fitting on eggs seems the more singular,                                     as   both
in    a   wild   and     a    tame state the males are accustomed                        to de
stroy the nests              of    the •females,      in order that they may                  have
them sooner free for pairing                    ;    and for this reason the cock is
carefully separated from the hen while (he is hatching.                                       The
instance related              by M. Ocdmann               is,   therefore,    the more re
markable.

from the destructive                    influence of«frost,       is   without doubt that
which nature itself                     presents,    and which requires to be only
a    little   assisted        by   art; that    is   to fay,     you must       deprive the
tree, which you wisti to defend from the frost,                            of all   its leaves,
at   a    period somewhat earlier than the time when they would
drop of themselves.                      The   sap    then will be less accumulated
in    the vessels;         will circulate more slowly,

so     much      as   if it    were thinner.              M. Stromcr          made some ex
periments which                 seem     to confirm the truth                of this     observa
tion.         He plucked            the leaves from a few tender                     branches of
a tree before the usual time of their falling                               ; and the conse
quence was, that the branches thus stripped withstood                                      a   con?
fiderable degree of frost without sustaining any injury, while
those which had not been deprived of their leaves artificially
were destroyed.                It      however, in regard to
                                    is to be observed,
this experiment, that all the leaves of the tree must not be
pulled at the fame time, but at three or four different periods
some weeks distant from each    other, yet in such a manner
that the last of the leaves be removed before the usual time
of their falling.              Were they all pulled             off' at the same time, a
sudden stoppage               of the circulation of              the        sap    would be oc
casioned,         which would expose the tree to slow but certain
destruction           *.
     * The following method of securing the                     blossom       of fruit-trees    from,
being damaged by early frosts, is mentioned in the Memoirs of the Royat
Society of Agriculture of Paris.                  A    rope is to be interwove           among the
branches of the tree, and one end of.it brought down so as to be immersed
in a bucket of water.          The    rope, it is said, will act as a conductor,           and con
vey the effects of the frost from the tree to the water.                    This    idea is ntt new,
for the following paiftge may be found                    in Colerus :      " If you    dig a trench
around the root of a tree, and hll it with water, or keep the roots moist
till it his bloomed, it will not             be       injured by the frost.          Or, in Spring,
suspend      a vessel filled    with water from the tree.              If    you wilh to preserve
the bloom from being hurt by the frost, place a vessel of water below                                it,
and the frost      will fall into it."       See his Haujbucbe         Wittenberg, 160S,           410,

                     LEARNED SOCIETIES.
                               DENMARK.
   A HE    Royal Academy           of Sciences     at  Copenhagen,         in
consequence     of Thot's      and Classen's    Institutions,   have pro
posed the following questions         as the subjects    of prizes  :
                I. For Thot's institution.
     The Society invites all       those competent to the task,           its
present members excepted, to transmit to it            a complete     essay,
founded on experience, respecting any point               of agriculture,
to be chosen at pleasure,        such for example      as improving the
cultivation of corn land, meadows, pasture grounds, or the
planting   of timber.        It would     give   the Society particular
pleasure to receive complete answers to the following questions.
     1. A catalogue,    with the botanical and provincial names,
of the different    weeds,    such as the common corn-marygold,
dog's-grass, vetches, &c. which are found among the various
kinds of grain, in any of the provinces subject to the Danish
government;       together with methods by which each of these
v\  eeds may be most effectually extirpated, and with the least
expence.
     2. A circumstantial account of the best process by which
poor or unfruitful      foil, of   a determined quality,       may be so
far improved     as to be    fit for cultivation ; together with an
estimate, calculated     on an average      of several years,   of the ex-
penecs and    of   the profits to be expected.
                                                                       3-  A

                            Learned Societtes.                           313
     3.  A  proper description of the different varieties of pota
toes,    which,     in proportion    to the length      of the summer      in
Denmark,        Norway, the Feræ           isles and Iceland,      might be
planted with the greatest advantage ; which                 can afford the
best nourishment for men and cattle, and whether, when used
in moderation, they         are sound and wholesome           food ?
     4.  A  description of the different kinds of oats, and their
common varieties.           Which of        these,    considering the    dif
 ference   in  the richness     of  the   foil,    and the greater    or  less
 care possible to be employed         in cultivating them, will      be most
 beneficial to the Danish provinces            ?
     The   papers must contain a clear botanical definition            of the
 kinds mentioned.          It will   also be agreeable to the Society,
 if the   author send drawings of the varieties of the oats.
      5. Though the Royal Chamber of Finance set on foot the
 planting of young timber on the moors of Jutland, and the
 Economical        Society encouraged         that undertaking       by pre
  miums      and   other inducements, the Society does not think
  the following question superfluous          :  What    means can be pro
  posed for raising plantations        of  trees with the least expence,
  and   in the surest and most       certain manner, on the heaths,
  moors, and other places unfit for corn land or meadows                 ?
      6. What are the kinds of grafs, besides red clover and- rye-
  grafs, which can be used in Denmark for sowing in the fields
  and for improving the pastures ?
      The author       must   give   such    a clear    description of these
  productions as may be intelligible             to farmers, together with
   the Danish and Linnean systematic names,                 and subjoin the
   different Danish      appellations under which           they are known
   to the country people.         He    must     describe  also the method
   of cultivating each kind; and if the plant be delineated in
   the Flora Danica, he must refer lo the figure. He must
   likewise give the method of cultivating each plant; and where
    that is unknown, by describing its duration,              the time of its
    blooming,    the  period  of its maturity, and the foil it requires,
    endeavour    to  render the farmer capable of cultivating it.
                                                                       7. The

314                              Learned Societies.
  7. The Agricultural Society long ago recommended the
white hawthorn, buckthorn, barberry, hazel, crab-apple
and willow for quickset hedges ; but as all these are not pro
per for the fame foil,           and as there is great want          of quickset
hedges in the stoney, sandy districts exposed to the wind, be
cause people are not acquainted with the kinds of trees that
can be used, or with the method of planting them, though
we    possess    indigenous           as    well as foreign trees of the bush
kind, which in this             respect have        been either tried    in   some
places or may be recommended, the Society requires to know
which of the       tree or bush kind, considering the different soils
and districts of Denmark, can be employed with the greatest
advantage        for quickset hedges,            an<l   what is the best method
of planting them          ?
     The author must give, along with the common and best
known kinds, the Danish                    systematic names; those least known
he must briefly describe,                  and in such a manner as to be un
derstood        by farmers.           In both      cafes   he must   give all the
Danish     trivial names, and the Linnean systematic appella
tion of each kind, with a reference to the figure in the Flora
Danica,     if it    be       there- represented.          The   observations    on
the utility of each kind of wood for quickset hedges, and the
method of planting     together it,                with    the determination     of
the foil which  requires, must
                     it                          rest   upon the grounds of cer
tain experience.
     Each of the papers on these subjects will be rewarded                        by
the Society, in proportion to its novelty and the importance
of   the observations          it   contains,      with    100   dollars; but the
best and fullest,         when more than one are transmitted, with
300 dollars.

in ploughing,       harrowing,    rolling, drawing corn-carts,        Sec.  ;
and also in more laborious works, such               as  drawing stone-
carts, waggons, cannon, &c.           ;  the Society  will  bestow a re

portance     of the  proposed improvements.
    The author      must write his name and place          of abode in      a

the fame device must be transmitted, post paid, before the
end    of June   1 799,  to Professor Abildgaard,       secretary to the
Society.
                               HOLLAND.
    The   second Teylerian Society have proposed the folsowing
prize questions for the year 1799 :
    As it is of great importance towards the improving and
extending every branch of physics             that the present state       of
our knowledge in that respect should be ascertained, and that
every thing which has been sufficiently proved by experience
should     be accurately distinguished       from what may be con
sidered only as conjecture, the Society requires to know what
is the present    state of our knowledge in regard to the aqueous
vapours     of the atmosphere? — How far can we explain, on
well founded experience, by what causes water is received
into the atmosphere        in the form of vapour, or in any other
manner, and retained         there ;    and to what causes is      it to be
ascribed that the water retained          in  the atmosphere     is disen
gaged and falls down under different forms?              Moreover, can
all aqueous      vapours be ascribed         merely to the disengage
ment of the water in the atmosphere,             or have any observa
                                                                       tions

tions been made which clearly shew that water sometimes is
produced in the atmosphere                   ?
   The Society will reward the author of that paper which
shall treat this subject in the clearest manner, and throw most
light upon        it,
              with gold medal of the value of 400 florins.
                                  a
   The answers must be written in the Dutch, Latin, French,
English or German (but not with German characters) in
the usual manner, and transmitted with sealed note con           a
taining the name of the author, to the house of the Teylerian
foundation at Haarlem, before the                    ill of April      1800, that the
prize may be adjudged before the                     1st   of November      the same
year.
   As no           was transmitted before the fixed period to
               answer
the physical prize question for 1797, the Society have thought
proper to propose          second time.
                              it      a   The prize       gold
                                                                            is
                                                                            a
medal of the fame value                    as the above.         The   question   is   as
follows   :
  What certain knowledge                     have we respecting         the nourish
ment and growth of plants                   ;    or how far can we at present
conclude, from certain and decisive experiments and observa
tions, what the substances or principles are which chiefly af
ford nourishment              to plants, and how they receive, secrete,
and assimilate them?                —What        circumstances relating to this
subject,      asserted       by    respectable    philosophers, are still to be
considered       as doubtful          ?   —By    what experiments might our
knowledge in this respect be with probability enlarged and
confirmed? —And lastly, What can be deduced from the
knowledge here               required respecting           the   nourishment       and
growth of plants, which might be practically applied in order
to cultivate useful plants in many kinds of foil with more
success   ?
  The chief object of                 the Society,   in both      the first divisions
of this question,            is,   that the present    state     of this part of our
knowledge respecting                  plants may be accurately ascertained,
and that what           is   fully proved        may be clearly distinguished
                                                                                  from

from what       rests   only upon weak grounds.             The intention of
this part of the question will therefore be sufficiently fulfilled,
though the author may not be able to enrich his answer with
new discoveries.
     Those who wish to become candidates                 for this prize must
pay attention to some             of the modern publications upon the
 fame subject, and in this respect much information                      may be
 obtained from F.         A. Humboldt's Aphorisms drawn from the
 chemical physiology of plants *.

      On the 13th of January last the Mineralogical Society of
 Jena celebrated, at the ducal palace there, the first anniver-
  fary of their establishment : on which occasion the director,
  Professor    Lenz,     gave a history     of the Institution,       and  of the
  progress    of the Society       ;   M. Samuel Nagy,        secretary    of  the
  Hungarian nation, read             a  chemico-mineralogical          history of
  Hungary ;      M. Von Ori of             Kots in Hungary,          delivered   a
  congratulatory address in              Latin; M. Aarn of Leibitz, in
   Hungary,      delineated      a view    of  the great importance        of mi
   neralogy to Hungary ;           Dr. Von Gerstenberg          shewed the     in
   fluence of mineralogy on the wants of human life and the
   prosperity    of   society ; and      M. Pansner, of Arnstadt,          gave a
   short view    of the     superstitious     employment of many species
   of  stones in ancient and modern times.
      The fitting was        closed by the Secretary returning             thanks

            BRITISH MINERALOGICAL SOCIETY.
     The want of      a  Society in this kingdom, whose attention
 should be directed to the analysis and reduction of our native
ores and minerals,          has been felt for a considerable             time.     It-
is with pleasure,       therefore, we announce that a Society un
 der the above title has recently been instituted, which pro
mises to be       of  considerable       public utility    ; as    it proposes to
analyse,    free   of  expence,        for the proprietors of mines or
 landed    estates, whatever substances they may meet with                         in
sufsicient quantity to render a knowledge                 of their component
parts a desirable object.           We hope, in our next Number, to
 be- able to   lay the plan of the Society before our readers.
   t  The Meisner is   a mountain     three miles from Cnssel, which, according
to measurement by the barometer, rises 1959 Paris feet above the surface of
the neighbouring river, and 2 184 feet above the level of the sea.            Its up
per part consists of masses  of basalres, some columns    of which     are 20 feet m
length, and from 5 to 8 inches in thickness.         It contains  also coal.    Ithas

    THE     following process for preparing aurum mujivum of a
most beautiful quality has been announced by Brugnatelli                        :
Precipitate     a  solution of the nitrat of tin by liquid fulphure of
potash,     dry the precipitate and put it into           a retort   with half
its weight of sulphur and a quarter of the                   muriat of am
monia ; you will then find the fulphure of tin formed at the
bottom of the retort, and of a most brilliant appearance.
     In a former Number of this Work (Vol. II. p. 331), when
 laying     before   our readers an account of the present              state  of
 Chemistry       in Germany, we mentioned the favourable ac
 count given by M. Van Mons of Brussels, of the Elementary
Treatise on Chemistry published by Professor                    Gren,     whose
death we announced             in our    last Number.        A   letter which
we have since received from            M. Scherer of Weimar,             speak
 ing of    Mr. Grcn's       death    and   of his writings, fays, " His
 System     of Chemistry, on account of its perspicuity and cor
  rectness, has obtained in Germany a decided preference over
 every other elementary work              of the kind."        This work we
  are happy to find has been translated             into English,      and   will
 soon be published in 2 volumes 8vo size.                 It contains all the
 facts relating to chemistry known up to 1796,                  as far as they
 come within the compass of an elementary treatise, explained
  on the principles of the new theory. The few discoveries
  fince made have,         we understand,        been added by the trans
  lator in occasional       notes ; and, at the end, an account           of  the
  two new metals, Tellurium and Chrome.

    He   placed that plant in a transparent vessel filled                        with water,
    and observed every day, at the extremity of the roots,                                         a
    small drop        of   a viscous matter.             This drop      he removed,           and
    next day there was another.                    All plants emit, in              the fame
    manner, from the extremities of their roots, and particularly
    during the night, small drops of                     a   liquid which is extremely
    prejudicial to them. It is hurtful also, very often, to those
    plants which are near them ; at other times it is useful to
    them     : thus oats suffer much from the serratula arvenjis ;
    flax,    from the euphorbia peplus and the scabious of the
    fields ;      wheat, from the erigeron                   acre ; sarrasin,       from the
spergula arvenjis               ;    and carrots, from comsrey.
       These phenomena may                     serve   to explain       why farmers            are
    obliged to let their lands rest a year; for, during that interval,
    this humour            has       time to be decomposed.                  By' the      same
    means may be explained, why land exhausted with one kind
    of plant        causes others to vegetate with vigour                    :   the fæces of
    the former hurt plants                    of the      fame     species, and      serve as
    manure to others.                  A    field, for example, exhausted                     with
    bearing clover,             if   sown with wheat,            will   produce     an abun
    dant crop, because the fæces of the clover are, without doubt,
    a manure for the wheat.
                                          MINERALOGY.
         A   very singular species             of iron       ore has lately been disco
    vered in Shropsliire, which may truly be considered as a na
    tional acquisition.                It yields, on     the first reduction, malleable
    iron,        instead   of   cast      iron, as is usual from other ores               ;    and
    the product is very large.                    From        an hundred parts            of       it,
    previously torrefied,               which we reduced in the                  assay   furnace
    in the common manner, we obtained                               a    malleable button
    which weighed               sixty-seven     parts.        The stratum, which              is   of

  the great thickness of      2 feet  4 inches, was discovered when
  digging for coal.
     Dr. A.    N.    Scherer, of Weimar, writes us, that Professor
  Abildgaard, of Copenhagen, has lately obtained from Green
  land   a fossil,  which, on analysis, is found to contain alumine
 in combination with the fluoric acid —a mineralogical phe
 nomenon not before met with.
     Sulphat of strontian, which has hitherto been          so scaroe   an
 article in this country, has lately been found in great quan
 tities in the neighbourhood of Bristol.              It was at first be
 lieved to be merely a variety        of sulphat of barytes, till Mr.
 William Clayfield, wishing to obtain some muriat of barytes,
 reduced a portion of the mineral in the muriatic acid, when
 its great solubility, with its needle-formed crystals,          soon  in
 dicated the presence of strontian.         In the neighbourhood of
 Ham-green         a variety of this  rare production is found break
 ing through the soil in such large          masses   that it has been
 made use     of in mending the      roads.
                   PHOSPHORESCENCE OF WOOD.
     Dr. Carradori, in      a paper on the phosphorescence      of wood,
 asserts   that phosphoric wood acquires           by putrefaction the
property     of attracting and absorbing light, and of retaining it
 mechanically.         To make it shine, it is sufficient to expose it
for some time to the sun.           A  bit of wood, which the author
examined, continued to shine under oil for two whole days.
 In that situation, says Dr. Carradori, it was not in contact
with oxygen        gas.
               DIURNAL MOTION OF THE EARTH.
    In    a work lately      published, entitled, De diuturno terra
motu      experimentis     physico-mathematicis      confirmato,    with
ninety      copper-plates,      the   author,   Professor   J.   Barptista
Guglielmi, of Bologna, giving an account of several ex
periments which he made on the falling of heavy bodies,
fays, that, in a height of 241 feet, he found a deviation               of

8 1 lines towards the east,     froma perpendiculardirection, which
amounts exactly to       as   much as, according to his calculation,
is produced by the diurnal motion of the earth.                De la Place,
of Paris,     disputes a part     of this deviation, and, according to
his calculation,      admits no more than five              lines. This is
adduced     as a  new proof of the rotatory motion of the earth.
                              PHYSIOLOGY.
    Dr. Carradori, in       a  letter to  M. Lasti on      the digestion  of
 nocturnal birds of prey, considers it           as  fully established that
 these birds digest vegetables.            It  results   from his experi
 ments, that they can be supported extremely well with that
 food, though it is repugnant to their nature.                Dr. Carradori
 has therefore destroyed the erroneous opinion that the gastric
juice of     these animals had an affinity only for animal sub
 stances:    what he establisties by his experiments, that carni
 vorous animals find nouristiment in the produce of plants,
 was before       rendered     probable by the discovery           made   by
 Fourcroy of the existence of gluten, albumen, and gelatinous
 matter in vegetables.
     The   fame    author has ascertained,          by new experiments,
  that breathing is necessary to aquatic frogs for the support of
 life. He observed, that these animals held underwater lived
  a much longer time when             the jars   were    open   than when
  they were stiut, and that their existence was prolonged in
  proportion to the volume of the air around them.                    Under
  water covered with a stratum            of oil  they lived only a stiort
  time.    In pure oil they         died  in the course of 40 minutes.
 The author was desirous to try also how far water was neces
  sary for supporting the life     of these animals. He       observed, that
  frogs kept in water up to the belly died a third sooner than
  those kept entirely dry.         Fisli inclosed in a jar partly filled
  with air, consumed      none of that fluid.

          Medical literature of the north.
    Professor   Pfaff of Kiel, and Dr. Scheel of Copenhagen,
have   announced a new periodical work, the object of which
is to  give an account of every thing that relates to the state
of medicine in the North, under which the editors compre
hend the Danistj States, including Holstein, Sweden, and the
northern part of Russia.         The work will      embrace      surgery as
well as medicine, both in theory and practice              ;   and physics
and    chemistry,    so  far as they are connected with these
branches of     science, will not    be excluded from their plan,        of
which the following arc the outlines,             i. The theory of me
dicine,     a. Practical medicine.        3. Surgery and midwifery.
4. Northern medical and chirurgical literature. 5. Medical
institutions and medical policy of the North. 6. Intelligence.
The    editors   have received      assurances   of   support     from the
principal    physicians in     the  North, among whom are Sax-
lorph, Abildgaard,       Calliscn, Hensler, Weber, Fischer, Pie-
din, Herholdt, &c.         The editors      do not mean to confine
themselves     to any regular periods       of publication ; but will
endeavour     to publish a number,        consisting of twelve sheets,
every    three   months.     The    first number      was    to appear   at
Easter 1799.
   Dr. K. A. Rudolphi,        also  of Greifswald,     has announced a
work somewhat        similar, to be entitled Swedish Annals of
Medicine and Natural History, two numbers to be published
annually,     according    as   materials can be procured.             The
editor, who was bom at Stockholm, means to make extracts
from every work on medicine or natural history printed in
Sweden;      and as a copy    of  every Swedish      publication of im
portance is procured for the academic library at Greifswald,
he hopes he shall be able to give in these Annals a complete
view of the present state of medicine and natural history in
his native country.       The    first part was      to be published at
Easter 1799, by Lange at Berlin.

    The following account of        the objects discussed by Lalande
 and the German astronomers,           &c. who met          last summer at
 Gotha,    has been published by Professor Bode               of Berlin, in
 his Astronomical Almanack for the year 1801.
    " In    the month of January 1798,              Lalande gave public
 notice that he intended, in the course              of the Summer, to
 make a tour to Gotha,        partly to   see   the celebrated observa
 tory at that place, and partly to pay            a visit    to his learned
 friend    and   old correspondent         Major       Von Zach.           On
 this occasion     he wished,    in particular,       to form a personal
 acquaintance with        several German         astronomers,        some    of
 whom had long kept up an epistolary                 correspondence      with
 him   ; and many     of them, among whom             I was   one, received
 the most flattering invitation to meet him.
    "I   resolved to undertake      this jaunt; to which           I  was en
 couraged, in particular,     by M. Von Hahn of Remplin, who,
 however, was not able        to accompany me.               I accordingly
 obtained his majesty's permission,         and      having learned that
 Lalande, with his niece, Madame le Fran^ais, had arrived at
 Gotha on the 25th of July, I set out on the 7th of August,
 bv Leipsig, Naumburg, and Erfurt ; and on the 9th reached
 Gotha, where I had the pleasure of becoming personally ac
quainted with the long celebrated and meritorious French
astronomer and his learned niece, and of embracing my
worthy friend Von Zach.           At   the duke's court         I  met with
the most gracious reception ;        but the unfavourableness           of the
weather deprived me, in a great measure,                of  the satisfaction
of using the noble instruments in the observatory ; for, dur
ing the time which I spent there so agreeably, the atmo
sphere    was overcast,    and   storms    and     rain prevailed.        The
alironomers and others present were           :   Professor    Kliigel, Pro
fessor  Gilbert,    and   M. Pister     secretary     of   the   post-office,
from Halle     ; Professor Seysser, from Gottingen ;            M. Kohler,
and   M.   Seyssert, from Dresden     ;  M. Schaubach, from Mein-
ingenj and M. Feer architect, from Zurich.                       The other
                                                                     German

  German literati who had received an invitation, sent excuses
  for not accepting it.
     " Among the      various astronomical and mathematical ob-
 jects discussed on this occasion were the following :
     " Lalande wished that the decimal system some time ago
 proposed in France to be used in astronomical and mathe
 matical    calculations, in the division of time and of the
 circle,  in instruments for long measure, in weights, coins,
 &c. might be introduced into Germany. We, on the other
 hand, represented to him the difficulties, in regard to com
 mon life, which opposed,           and   which would perhaps ever
 oppose, the general adoption        of this system, otherwise useful
 in calculation   ;  and  that men of letters were the least of all
 sit to remove   these difficulties   : we, however, agreed that in
 future we would favour this system more in our writings, in
 order to make it better known            ;  and we at the fame time
 expressed a hope that the        National Institute of Paris would
transmit to us the new tables for the decimal calculation, as
 soon as they were published,        which Lalande        promised    to use
 his interest to effect.
     " He mentioned also the      general adoption      of the new stand
 ard proposed   in France,     called the metre, or the linear unity
of 10,000,000 parts of        a quadrant      of   the earth's meridian ;
because,    in his opinion,     it was borrowed from nature itself,
and therefore was equally proper for all nations.                  But   we
could give    him   very little hope    in  regard to the introduction
of   the metre  in Germany       ; especially     as  the French foot is
already used    in comparing         measures,      and its exact    length
every where known.           We, however,           resolved  to give,    in
future, foreign measures according to the metre,                as we   for
merly gave them by the French foot, as soon as the exact
length of the former sliould be made known to us by the
grand measurement        now carrying on in France, but not yet
completed*.       We     agreed also to give in future all calcu-
          * This undertaking    has been  since finished.  Edit.

time,     as soon as  the editor of the Connotffance des Terns sliould
set   us the example.          Perhaps it will be possible also to in*
troduce this mean time into common life, in order to effect
a better regulation       of the going of    \vatche3.
     " Accurate    and more numerous observations            of the time    of
the moon's culmination were next recommended, as these
 might serve in determining the difference                of meridians of
 places ; also to insert in astronomical almanacks the time of
 the occultation of      stars  of the fifth and sixth magnitude,         be
 fore the first, and after the last quarter        of the moon, in order
 to give occasion to more frequent calculations of these                  dif
 ferences.      In calculating       the   oppositions of the superior
 planets, for examining the theory of their orbits, the fame
 method must absolutely be followed             ; and that given      in La-
 lande's Astronomy,         section 4162, was here proposed.
     " I produced    a  complete drawing of the fifteenth sheet, and
 the two engraved,         but not yet finished       sheets, tab. 11 and
 13, of my large Celestial          Alias,  and   the manuscript      of my
 Complete Catalogue of the Stars, and particularly the part
 respecting Dc la Caille's Southern Stars, which have never
 yet been numbered.            Lalande took this occasion         to observe
 that room might still be found on some of the celestial charts
 for new constellations, and wished to            see inserted   among the
  stars an aerostat, as the invention       of the French.      I embraced
 this opportunity,         contrary to my former firm resolution of
  introducing no new constellations, to propose, on the other
  hand, that     a  German discovery,        made 350 years ago,          viz.

     "  Lalande was convinced, at the fame time, bv ocular                 de

forests   of Thuringia, where       the duchess     gave a f£te     to the
company, and where we took several corresponding altitudes
of the fun with various ten-inch              sextants by    Troughton,
in order to determine the time arid height of the pole.
     " Lalande    had with him a chronometer by Berthoud the
elder at Paris.     The duke of Gotha       has   in his  possession    four
English     chronometers,     by Arnold,        Emery,     Mudge,       &c.
Major von Zach has one by Emery, and                      M. Seiffert of
Dresden one made by himself.          All  these were compared         with
pendulum       clocks, and with each other;          and their rate       of
going was found to be remarkably regular, which proved
that they were fit to be used in determining              the longitude.
Seiffert also (hewed,       merely to give pleasure to Lalande,             a
 clock constructed      by himself, according to      a  new invention,
 and having marked on the dial-plate the diurnal division                  of
 the day proposed      in France.     He   had likewise with him,         os
 his own workmanship,         a stop watch      with the decimal divi
 sion,  which   he presented to Madam le Francais.
     "  Some new instruments and maps were also exhibited and
 examined.       Among     these were an ocular heliometer,            to be
 applied to a Hersihel's       telescope,    invented by     M. Kohler,
 and constructed      by M. Seiffert   ;  the diaphragms       of the for
 mer, for determining the strength of the light of the stars,
 and his proposed vessel for an artificial water horizon;            a  map
 of   the Rhein   Thais, laid down by means of a Hadley's sex
 tant, by M. Feer of Zurich ; some slieets of the new map
 of the duchy of Wurtemberg,                by M. Bohncnberger of
 Tubingen,      measured and delineated        by means of like instru

of    the day, there was no discussion.           Lalande himself must
have been aware, that as the introduction             of this innovation
found, even in France,          and particularly in the provinces, so
great opposition, it would meet with much more in other
 countries.     It would also hardly find admission among those
 who have still any regard         for institutions which, thousands
of    years ago,   the first law-givers and astronomers          declared
 to be proper for civil life, and         which    have since   been   re
 tained through all ages.         Besides,    this new French calen
 dar, in making the year begin at the entrance of the fun
 into the equinoctial point, determined by astronomical cal
 culation, brings it back upon no solid and sure grounds ;
while we, on the other hand, by the              very simple method     of
intercalation,     can determine common            time backwards and
forwards for many centuries, and differ only one day from
astronomical time in the course of 3200 years."
     The Elector of Saxony has enriched the observatory                 at
Leipsic with      a considerable     number of astronomical instru
ments, which were before              preserved   in  the mathematical
hall at Dresden.
                       SYMPATHETIC INKS.
     On this  subject a correspondent        has sent us the following
communication        :
     "  Many   receipts   have been already       published  for making
inks, the writings with which remain invisible till brought
forth by heat 5 but many inconveniences attend even the best
of them.      Having     tried all  I  have been able to meet      with,
I  have found that some require          so much heat that the whole
paper is scorched       before the letters     make their appearance      ;
that in some the letters are indistinct when produced ; and
that in others the words are almost legible before the heat is
applied.     In  the course    of my experiments on this subject, I
hit upon a very simple        mixture    which obviates these incon
veniences ; as the writing done with it is perfectly invisible
till  heat be applied, and becomes very black           with  such a de
                                                                     gree

gree   of   heat   as will not injure the        paper.    It  is also very
durable, may be kept long before it is put to the fire, and
will   retain    its colour long afterwards.          It consists of sul
phuric acid,       and  three   times    the   quantity of water mixed
together.
   " The      thing is  so simple    that  I  can hardly think it can be
new   :  it  was,   however, unknown to me till           I  discovered    it ;
and  if it    has not before been published,         it may amuse some
of your     readers.
   " There      is one inconvenience attending this ink, which is
common to all of this nature : it injures the parts of the
paper on      which the    letters  are written.      All  these inks owe
their property to some corrosive substance, which being acted
upon by the fire, renders the writing visible, by reducing those
parts   of   the paper on which the          ink  has been applied, to a
kind of charcoal.

twisted      as    usual      and wound              round each other, but bound
together straight and in              a     parallel direction.                  The   celebrated
Muschembroek                  discovered,            by   several     experiments,             that
threads          and    cords, not twisted,               formed stronger ropes than

      Lagarde, a bookseller at Berlin, has begun an undertaking,
  never perhaps before attempted, at least in Germany.                   He
  means to publish a Greek edition of Homer, entirely printed
  from copper-plates.         Professor  Wolf,     at  Halle, is to   supply
  the text, and the work will be executed with the utmost
  care possible.      Jack   is to engrave the plates,       from the best
 specimens      of Greek writing.
                                  DEATHS.
      On the    16th  of December      last, at Halle, in     the 70th year
 of his   age,  John Reinhold Forster,       LL.D.     professor  of natural
 history in that university, member of the academy of sciences
 at Berlin, and      of other learned      societies.     He was born     at
 Dirschau,      in West    Prussia, in the month        of October 1729,
 and was formerly a Protestant           clergyman at Dantzig, from
 which     he went to Russia, and thence to England,              where he
pursued his favourite study, Natural History.               From    1772 to
 1775 he accompanied Capt. Cook               in his voyage round the
world.      On his return       he resided at   London, till      he was at
length invited to Halle, where, for 1 8 years, he was a mem
ber of the philosophical and medical faculties. Among his
works are     :  An Introduction     to  Mineralogy,      or,  An  accurate
Classification    osFq/Jils and Minerals, ^c. London,           1768, 8va.

Etc. London,       1778.    He was the author of          a. great many
productions in English,          Latin, or German,        and   of  several
papers    in  the Philosophical Transactions.         He translated into
English, Bougainville's Voyage round the World, and Kalm's,
Bossu's, and Reidsel's Travels.            He was employed likewise,
when in England,          in the Critical Review        ; and    he wrote
various detached papers          on different subjects,      which    have
been inserted        in foreign Journals and the Transactions of
learned academies.         His    son, George Forster# who also went
round the world with Capt. Cook, and was afterwards professor
of natural history at Cassel, died        at Paris, at the age   of 39, on
the 13th of February 1793.
    Not long    ago, at Hamburgh, the celebrated portrait and his
torical painter Hickel. He distinguished himself particularly
by his happy talent of giving good representations of family
 scenes and children.          He   studied   at  Vienna, and enjoyed
there for     a long time a considerable pension, which Joseph II.
however at length withdrew.                He resided after this some
 times in Swisserland, and sometimes in London and Paris.
 The    late queen     of France    often fat to   him,   as  did also the
 princess    of Lamballe,      who caused herself be painted some
 times    as a nosegay   girl,  and sometimes       as a fortune-teller or
 nun.      In   the year   1793 he began       to paint a sitting    of the
 British    house    of commons,       and most    of the portraits were
 striking likenesses.       From this painting,        which was 15 feet
 in breadth      and  11 in height,     he proposed publishing a       print
 by Cheeseman ; but, owing to some                 disappointment in re
 gard to the subscription, the undertaking was abandoned.
 During the last days of his life he made a painting of KIop-
  stock, and exceedingly like.          The poet is represented sitting
 and reading one of his favourite odes.              Hickel, at the time
  of his death, proposed to have a print from this painting, 19
  inches by 16, engraved by Huck,
     At Geneva, on the         33d   of January, Horace Benedict          de
  Saussure,     well known    as a  naturalist,   chemist, and minera
  logist. He was born in 1740, stood candidate for the mathe

prosector   of philosophy. He was a member of most of the
learned societies   in Europe,        and author       of many works; among
which   are, Travels through the                Alps, published first in quarto,
and afterwards in octavo ; Essays on Hygrometry,                              Observa

sophy also with two valuable instruments,                        a    portable hygro
meter and electrometer.               He had in his              possession a most
beautiful cabinet of natural history                    ; and   an herbal, remark
able not only for the number of plants it contained, but also
for their fine   state    of   preservation.
   On the 5th of February,                  at Bologna,         in the 55th year of
his   age, the celebrated            Galvani,           from whom          Galvanism,
which     has made so much noise                   in the philosophical world,
took its name.           It   is said that a       fit of illness, by which his
wife was attacked,            led him to the discovery               of his theory   re
specting     metallic         irritation.      The physician having pre
scribed for his wife          soup made      of boiled frogs, Galvani, who
was an affectionate husband, prepared them himself;                                  and

respecting the cryptogamia class of plants will secure him
immortal fame.            His    death      will   be   a   great loss to the Gene
ral Literary Journal of Jena, to which he was                          a   contributor,

the 19th of February he read a public lecture, next day he
was confined to bed, and on Sunday morning an inflamma

 Borda, an eminent mathematician, and one of the authors

 was     a Lieutenant      de Vaifsau du     Roi under the old French
  government, and with De la Crene and Pingr! made a voyage
  to America, in order to ascertain the utility of certain instru

    Bureau    des  Longitudes by      C. Bougainville.
       On the 7th of this month,          at his house    in Queen-square,
    Westminster, the Rev. Clayton Mordauut Cracherode,                  A. M.
    Student of Christ Church, Oxford,            F.R.A.S.    and one of the
    Trustees of the British Museum.
        Mr. Cracherode        was eminent for his erudition,       liberality
    of sentiment, and amiable manners. His learning he deco
     rated with a superior knowledge of the fine arts; and he em
     ployed a considerable       part of a large revenue in making col
                                                                      lections

   lections of what was best and most curious in literature and
   certain branches of the arts.        His library is unrivalled in its
   kind ;   and his cabinet     of prints, drawings and medals, is
   considered as     among the most select and valuable in a country
   that  possesses   so many of them. — But to his extensive know
  ledge    and pre-eminent        taste must be added the more solid
  qualities of candour, of liberality,        of  benevolence  ; and he
  presented them all to the world,        in which     he lived at large,
  in the form of an accomplished Gentleman, heightened by
  the unaffected piety of a sincere Christian.
     Mr. Cracherode has left a thousand pounds to Christ-
  Church, Oxford, where he was a student ; and his very rich
  collection of medals, and immense library, to the British
  Museum.

 Europe.       Mr. Strange was many years British Resident at
 Venice,     where, by his taste and indefatigable diligence, he
 formed one of the best collections of pictures, particularly of
 the Venetian school, now in England : his library also is
most extensive         and splendid.    As    a  naturalist, antiquary,
 and general       friend  and   promoter   of  the  arts and sciences,
his cabinet has always been considered as one of the choicest
in the kingdom.          By his will he     has directed the whole to
be sold; his pictures,        under the direction of     Mr. Wilson of
the European          Museum,      by private contract, after being
publicly exhibited; his books, by Messrs. Leigh and Sotheby;

 I   N the year 1792 the provisional executive council, sensi
ble os the advantages which might result to commerce, agri
culture, natural history, geography, medicine, &c. by a tour
through     the Ottoman empire, Egypt and Persia         ; persuaded
that these interesting countries had never           been considered
under a proper point of view, or had been considered only
partially, and that we had still much to learn respecting
them, made choice of       C. Bruguiere    and myself to accomplish
that object.
    After  some delays, we at length sailed from1 Marseilles,      in
April    1793,  in  a neutral vessel,   and, without touching any
where by the way, arrived at Constantinople, after         a pleasant
voyage, on the 21st      of May.

  Asia     and    Europe,      all  together       present     so  many pictures
  which     at once delight and astonisli.               One cannot help ad
  miring the natural beauty of the environs of Constantinople,
   and reflecting       at the fame        time on the happy situation of
   that large city, which can be             so speedily      supplied   with pro
   visions;    which is     so easy   to be defended,          and which      enjoy*
   the advantage of       a  port   so safe, so     commodious, and          of  such
   an extent.       But   if   we cast our eyes a little farther,            we be
   hold the two stiores of the entrance                 into the Black Sea, for
'
   the space     of  several leagues,      convulsed       by subterranean       fires.
   Different     strata   of lava,     decomposed          rocks, porphyry         and
   granites of various colours, more or                   less altered,   attest the
    slow and successive action         of   a great     volcano.      If we ascend
    a few leagues,     we discover,      for  a vast    extent, a mine of coal,
    which    the  Turks    have not yet found means to work.
       We remained          six weeks      in this capital of the Ottoman'
    empire, waiting till the         envoy extraordinary of the Republic
    sliould receive from the minister orders respecting our mission
    and allowance ; but the attention of government was at that
    time engaged with objects of more importance.                        Our letters
    remained unanswered, and we sliould have been thrown into
    great embarraslinent had not our pressing wants been supplied
    by the envoy of the Republic.
        After viewing this country,           so  interesting in every respect,
    ind   making an ample collection               of plants, birds,      sissies,   in

     feeds at different times to the national garden                 of plants, we
     set out for the Dardanelles,          by which means            we had it in
    our power either to proceed to the Archipelago in the spring,
     or to return to Constantinople in order to direct our course
     towards the southern ssiores of the Black Seaj to proceed
                                                                             through!

through     Armenia,       Georgia,   Ghilan, or Chirvan,         to    the-
borders   of  the Cafpiart sea ; afterwards     to traverse Persia from
north to south,       and   to return by the Persian      Gulph, Bus-
fora, Bagdad,       Mesopotamia and Aleppo.            As we did not,
however, hear from government, and could receive only                      a
part   of our allowance,      we confined ourselves to excursions         to
different   places in the neighbourhood        of the sea  of Marmora,
the channel     of  the Dardanelles,    I roade, Tenedos, Scio, some
parts    of  the coast     of Natolia,    My cone    and   Naxia, from
which we proceeded to Crete.
    Agreeably to our instructions, we had transmitted            to  Con
stantinople, to be reared in the garden of the ambassador's
palace, plants of a kind of apple-tree with oblong fruit of an
excellent flavour,        proper to be cultivated in any part of
France, but more particularly in the southern departments ;
plants of three kinds of oak not found in our forests or gar
dens—one kind proper for (hip-building — another a grand
cupule known in commerce by the name of avellonce, which
is the quercus agtfopt ( and lastly, that which furnishes the
galls of the Levant : we added also several shrubs destined to
enrich the national garden of plants.
    Though several well informed Europeans have traversed
this part of the Ottoman empire; though many of them have
 published interesting observations on the political relations of
 the Turks, their manners, usages, and religion;             and though
 we have excellent works on the plants and ancient history                 of
 these countries,      we, however, found that there           s   still art
 abundant harvest to be reaped, even in the            best -known part
 of natural history, that is to fay,        in  regard to plants.       Bus

cornelians and chalcedonies               m the fissures of the volcanic*
rocks, mines of ahim and sulphur, mineral waters of every
kind    ;  in  a word,       if  we recollect that no traveller has con
sidered this country           in regard to geology, that part       of natural
history     so    interesting,    which    by enabling us to observe          the
different strata of earth and stones, the direction and structure
 of mountains,          and to compare the         different fossils that one-
 meets with, must necessarily conduct to a certain knowledge
 of   the antiquity       of our globe, of    the laws to which it is sub
ject, and of the different catastrophes it has experienced, and
 of which some faint light has been transmitted to us by the
 fabulous history of antiquity, will be readily persuaded that
 our observations,           directed   to these objects,       cannot fail of
 being highly interesting.
     We     remained       four months at Candia; and              though twa
 years had elapsed since our departure              from Paris, we had re
 ceived no intelligence from government:                    We    were,   there
 fore,    of opinion, that it would          be absolutely necessary for us
 to renounce our first plans;            but  as we were desirous       of   em
 ploying our time in the most useful manner possible, we re
 solved to proceed            to Egypt,    and to traverse that country so
 abundant in subjects             of observation,      and as interesting for
 the politician and statesman, as for the philosopher, naturalist
 and antiquarian.
     The situation of          the French in Egypt         was extremely dis
 agreeable      :   their commerce had been interrupted,              and   they
 were in     a state    of   oppression   at Cairo.      Some of them had
 been maltreated, by the government,                  and the consul      of the
 Republic         enjoyed      no consideration.       Our   first care was to
 study the monstrous government                 of   the   Mamelouks,       their
 military      force     and    their manners;      to   make ourselves       ac
 quainted with the revenues               of Egypt,      the  present   state   of
 its commerce, and that which it might be susceptible                  of under
 a  just and enlightened government.               We examined the ports
 of Alexandria,         the road    of Aboukir, the Delta,        the course   of
 the    Nile,      its periodical inundation,         the canals which the
                                                                    negligence

                             EgJ'pt and Persia.                         341
 negligence of the Mamelouks             has suffered to be silled up, the
  monuments reared to gratify the pride of kings,                 and those
  which    have been     constructed       in consequence     of religious
 duties.    We    directed    our view, at the fame time, to the na
 tural productions of Egypt, and those which might be intro
duced into it by cultivation ; the fertility of its foil, and the
 diseases to which the inhabitants are exposed.              We enquired
 into the cause of the periodical winds.             In me   last place we
 examined whether the plague,             that malady    so sudden and so
 terrible in its effects, has its source in Egypt, as some travel
 lers have asserted, or whether it be there only casual and
epidemic.       Our   harvest,     in  regard   to natural    history, has
been very abundant         : we had an opportunity         of transmitting
 to the national     garclen     of plants    a third box of feeds from
the Archipelago,      Candia and Egypt.
    On   the 23d   of March       we received letters from the        tnvoy
extraordinary,      by which he invited us to quit Egypt and to
return to the shores of the Bosphorus            ;  because the time was
at length arrived      for carrying into effect the plans we had
formed.      "   Regions lying        farther to the East,"        said he,
 "  now invite you, and        I  wish to confer with you before you
proceed truther."
    Under the same cover there were two letters of C. Des-
forgues, minister of foreign affairs.           One was a copy of that
which the minister wrote to C. Descorches; in which he re
quested    from him an estimate of the sums necessary to be
expended,      in order that we might properly discharge                our
mission.     He    authorised      him    to supply   us   with whatever
sums might be requisite,          to procure such      guides and infor
mation    as the   nature of our mislion required,          and to obtain
those documents which were              indispensibly necessary for our
researches and      observations.        He concluded his       letter with
the following words       :   "In     all cafes these two observers of
nature    will   be subordinate       to your commands;           they will
give you an account of all their operations, and at the end
of   each   month you will transmit to me the result of their

and political state       of the countries through which they                            pass),
in order th it      I   may   give a      faithful representation              to the exe
cutive council, of their zeal, their labours, and their disco
veries."   — In     the other, the minister informed us, that he had
requested       C. Descorches        to give him an account                    of   the ordi
nary expences to which               we        would be subjected.                  He     con
cluded by desiring us to transmit our submission in writing
to C. Descorches, and to conform to the dispositions con
tained in the letter which he had                        addressed       to him.
   We      embraced      the. earliest         opportunity of complying, both
with the orders of the minister, and those of the envoy.                                    We
transmitted       our submission          ;    and, having terminated- our ob
servations       on Cairo and the neighbourhood, repaired,                               with
out delay, to Alexandria.                     We     sailed from that port on the
30th of April, and arrived at Constantinople after a naviga
tion of forty-eight days.  We had the pleasure of touching
at the isles      of Rhodes      and          Lero, which              we    had not before
seen.      The repairing of          a leak         in our      vessel    obliged us lo re
main eight days at the former; and we were detained                                   as   long
 at the latter on account            of       the   North winds.
    During this interval C. Descorches had                             been succeeded by
.C. Verniac.            We    therefore         delivered        to the latter a sketch
 of our operations, from                  the period            of our arrival in            the
 Levant;        a statement     of     the sums             we had          received; and a
 minute memoir on the situation                      of    the French         in Egypt, the
 government of the Mamelouks,                        the productions and revenue
 of the country,         the cultivation            of the land, on           its commerce,
 and    lastly on the improvements                        of which          the country was
 susceptible      *.    This memoir concluded with reflections                               ex

Captain Norden, with his attendants, arrived at Deir, or Dem, the first
large village or town in Nubia.  The cacheff of that place, a notorious
plunderer       of all who fell in his power, conducted himself towards the tra
vellers in so infamous a manner,                         as to oblige       the captain to relinquish      his
design of proceeding further,                      and return to Cairo.            When disputing about
some     of   the exorbitant demands                    of the cacheff,        one   of the company        re
minded him that they were underthe protection of the Grand Signior. To

of our prophets             has said            That   there would come Franks in disguise, who,
 by   little presents, and               by :   soothing and insinuating           behaviour,    would pass
every where,           examine the state of the country,                        go afterwards to make        a
report of      it,   and bring at last             a   great number of other Franks, who would

944                   Travels through Turkey,
for travelling into the interior parts of this country, so inte
resting in every point of view.            C. Verniac allowed us the
whole of our appointment, authorised              us to engage a drago
man, gave us      a letter    to the chief minister       of   the  king of
Persia,    another to the pacha of Bagdad, and, at the fame
time, various instructions both verbally and in writing.
     At the moment of pur          departure,    the Porte had      a design
 of constructing in       the    harbour of Constantinople          a bason
 after   the model    of that of Toulon        ;   and some Armenian
 merchants wislied to prevail on us to communicate to them
 a discovery we had made of an excellent kind of pozzolana,
 by offering   us the sum      of 30,000   piastres.     As   we were here
 under the orders of the Republic, we did not think ourselves
 at liberty to enter into any treaty with Armenians, in regard
 to our discoveries,    until we had apprised           the   envoy    of the
 Republic.     C. Verniac, who intended           to get this bason con
 structed by French engineers,          desired   us to reject the offers
 of the Armenians, promising           to procure us        a  more ample
 recompence from the Porte          ; and he immediately sent the first
 dragoman of the legation to the Turkish government, to com
 municate our discovery, and make an offer of our services.
 The Porte     seemed to accept        this offer with gratitude;         and
 having requested a note on the subject,                we    embraced     the
  earliest opportunity     of transmitting    to it a memoir, in which
  we said that we had discovered pozzolana pf an inferior
  quality near the channel of the Black Sea, in Prince's islands,
  and various islands      of  the Archipelago     ;  and some     of a supe
  rior quality, or at    least equal to   that of Italy, in the island
  pf Santorin.     The memoir concluded with a few details re
  specting the method       of employing both.
      The ministers of the Porte, when they received this me
  moir, informed the dragoman, that the Armenians had de
   manded for the discovery         6c,ooo    piastres, though they hast
   offered us only 30,000.        They added, that they would never
   forget the service which we rendered to them, and that their
   gratitude would be boundless           if  we     could effect what we
                                                                    promised.

promised.          On this    subject we had two interviews with the
Chelebi-Essendi         ;   and that minister twice gave us reason to
hope      that the Porte would reward, in             a  manner    worthy of
itself, the important discovery we had communicated.
     In   the mean time we were just on the p°int              of proceeding
on our journey            to Perfia.     The  necessary preparations were
already made,          and we were looking out for a caravan going
 to    Diarbekir,      when the Porte required           that we should re
pair to the isles of Santorin,           Milo,  and Argentiera, and trans
 mit    to  it some bags      of pozzolana, in order that previous ex
 periments might be made.                  For this purpose it freighted a
 French       vessel, and sent a chiaous to accompany us and bring
 back the specimens.             We were obliged to touch at Metelin
 to receive       from the captain pacha, then lying at anchor be
 fore that island, the necessary firmans.
      The inhabitants of Santorin, alarmed                 at this discover)',
 and     fearing that the Ottoman government would cause the
  earth to be dug up at their expence, and of course send
  Turkish       officers into the island, immediately assembled to
  execute the Grand Signior's orders, and to devise means for
  warding off the blow with which they were threatened.
  They thought they could do nothing be ter than to fend                   the
  primates to the Latin bisliop at whose house we Jodged,                  and
  to offer     us a present      if we would inform         the Porte that we
  had discovered none of the above substance in the island. We
  however, rejected the offer of these primates, and transmitted
   to Constantinople several bags silled with pozzolana of an ex
   cellent quality, which was in great abundance, and exceed
   ingly   easy    to be dug up.         We    depended on     C. Verniac for
   the promised       recompence to which we thought ourselves en
   titled by the importance of the discovery, by rejecting the
    offers of the Armenians, and the trouble,
                                                           dangers, and delay
    we had experienced.

under the name of Cimolus,                is entirely volcanic.        We    -mr
marked,       with pleasure,        that the Cimolean earth, which it
furnishes in abundance, is produced                 by   a  flow and gradual
decomposition of the porphyries occasioned                    by subterranean
fires.     I  collected specimens of that earth in all the states
through which it pastes. This observation will be interest
ing, no doubt, to mineralogists, and make them acquainted
with the origin of a substance hitherto little known.                        The
island of Milo is altogether volcanic.               It presents a vast port,
on the borders of which is a spring of warm aluminous
water ; a very warm grotto, where feather alum is formed ;
a volcano still burning,           and   a prodigious quantity         of  cata
combs.         The     island    of Santorin       is   remarkable for the
changes       effected    in it by     a volcano,     and the finking down
of   a great part    of  the island ; from which has resulted a kind
of port, more than two            leagues in extent, and from the bot
tom    of which       three   isles have been thrown            up at different
 known       periods.      The rupture occasioned by the almost cir
 cular sinking down of the island exhibits different strata of
 volcanic substances,        among which we observed several kinds
 of pozzolana.         That which        we sent to    Constantinople,        and
of which I        have specimens,        may one day serve for such ma
 ritime     constructions      as the      French     may think       proper to
 make in Egypt,          when they are once firmly establislied                 in
 that country.
     We touched         a second      time at Rhodes, proceeded thence
 to Baruth,       and afterwards       to Sayd,   with    a  view of going to
 Damascus to take advantage              of the departure      of a caravan    for
 Bagdad,      as we had been         taught to expect ; but, the caravan
 having departed         a  song time before,        we were obliged to rcr
 turn and take the route to Aleppo.                We      were   unwilling     to
 quit the coast of Syria without paying at Tyre                     a tribute of
 admiration to which that city was              so justly entitled.
     As   the    road   from Latakia        to Aleppo       is never   safe,   we
 waited some days for the departure of                  a caravan.       During
 that time we transmitted             to the   national garden        of plants
                                                                          a fifth

a fifth box    of    seeds,   from the islands we had visited,          and the
coasts   of Syria. On our arrival at Aleppo we employed our
selves   in examining the situation of the French in that city.
We collected information                respecting    the commerce carried
on by the Europeans with the inhabitants,                      and sent to    C.
Verniac      a memoir on that subject.                We   also made various
observations        in regard to natural history and geology.                We
procured several birds, and a few quadrupeds                    : after which
 we set out, towards the end                of winter, in company with          a
 caravan; and, passing through Orfa, Merdin, Nesbin,                         and
Mosul, arrived at Bagdad without any accident.

 II.   Process    of making Attar,          or Essential Oil of Roses.        By
     Lieut.   Gol.    PpLiER.          From the Asiatic Researches.
   1   HE     attar    is obtained       from the    roses by simple distilla
 tion, and the following is the mode               jn which I    have made it.
     A   quantity of fresh roses, for example forty pounds, are
 put in    a still  with    sixty pounds      of water, the   roses being left
 as they are       with their calyxes, but with the           stems cut close.
 The    mass is then well mixed together with the hands, and a
 gentle fire is made under the still : when the water begins to.
 grow hot, and fumes to rife, the cap of the still is put on,
 and    the pipe fixed ;          the chinks      are then well     luted    with
 paste, and cold water put on the refrigeratory at top                :   the re
  ceiver is also adapted          at the end    of  the pipe; and the fire is
  continued under the still, neither too violent, nor too weak.
 When the impregnated water begins                    to come   over,    and the
 /iill is very hot, the        sire is lessened   by gentle degrees, and the
  distillation     continued till thirty pounds of water are come
 over, which is generally done in about four or five hours :
 tilis rose-water        is to be poured         again   on  a fresh    quantity
  (forty pounds) of roses, and from fifteen to twenty pounds, of
                                                                            water

«^8                    Pro.-,ss    of making Attar,       dr
water are to be drawn by distillation, following the same pro
cess as before.     The rose-water thus made and cohobated, will
be found,     if  the roses were good and fresli, and the distilla
tion carefully performed, highly scented with the roses.                         It
is then poured into pans either of earthen ware or tinned
metal, and left exposed to the fresh air for the night.                       The
attar, or essence,       will    be  sound   in    the  morning congealed,
and swimming on the top                of the water ; this is to be care
fully separated and collected, either with a thin shell or a
skimmer, and poured into a phial.                    When a certain quan
tity has thus been obtained, the water and fæces must ba
separated from the clear essence, which, with respect to the
first, will not    be difficult to do, as the essence            congeals     with
a slight cold, and        the water may then be made to run off.
Jf,  after that, the essence        is kept fluid by heat, the fæces wil)
subside, and may be separated;              but   if die operation      has been
neatly performed,        these     will be little or none.       The   fæces are:
as   highly perfumed        as the essence,      and must be kept.          After
as   much of the        essence      has been      skimmed from the rose-
water    as  could be, the remaining water should be used for
fresh distillations, instead         of common       water,    at least as far as
it will go.
    The above      is the whole process        of making genuine          attar  of
 roses.     But  as the roses      of this country     give but a ver)- small
 quantity    of  essence,      and it is in high       esteem, various ways
 have been thought         of   to augment the quantity, though, at the
expence     of  the quality.        In this country, it      is usual to add to
 the roses, when put in the still, a quantity                  of fandal-wood
 raspings,    some more, some less, (from one to five tolahs, or
half ounces).         The    sandal     contains     a deal    of   essential  oil,
which     comes     over    freily in     the common distillation ; and,
 mixing with        the    rose-water     and    essence, becomes strongly
 impregnated with their perfume                :   the   imposition however
 cannot be concealed         ;   the essential oil    of sandal    will not con
 geal in common cold?              and its smell cannot be kept under,
                                                                               bus

tr.it will be apparent                  and        predominate in spite of every art.
In Cashemire they                  seldom use sandal to adulterate                      the attar ;
but     I    have     been        informed,           to      increase the quantity,           they
distill with the roses               a sweet-scented                 grass,    which       does not
communicate                    anv unpleasant               scent,    and     gives    the attar a
clear high          green colour              :    this   essence     also does not congeal
in a flight cold,               as that    of      roses.      Many other ways of             adul
teration have been practised,                             but all     so gross    and      palpable
that    I    shall say nothing                of them.
   The quantity of essential oil to be obtained                                from the roses is
very precarious and uncertain, as it depends not only on the
skill   of   the distiller,         but also on the quality of the roses and
the favourableness                  of    the       season     :   even     in Europe,       Where
the chemists are so perfect in their business,                                some, as      Tache-
nius, obtained only half an ounce of oil from one hundrrd
pounds of roses. — Homberg obtained one ounce from the
lame quantity              ;    and Hossman above two ounces. —The roses
in those instances were stripped of their calyxes, and only the
leaves used.          In this country nothing like either can                               be had ;
and to obtain four malhas (about one drachm and half) from
eighty        pounds,            which, deducting                    the    calyxes,       comes     to
something           less       than three drachms per hundred pounds of
rose-leaves,          the season must be very favourable, and the ope
ration carefully performed.
   In       the year 1787           I     had only sixteen tolahs, or about eight
ounces  of attar from fifty-four maunds, twenty-three seers
(43661b.) of roses produced from a field of thirty-three big-
gahs, or eleven Englisti acres, which comes to about two
drachms per one hundred pounds.
   The colour of the attar of                         roses    is no criterion        of   its good
ness, quality,                 or country.            T have       had, this year, attar of a
fine emerald green,                 of    a       bright yellow, and of a reddish hue,
from the same ground, and obtained by the same process,
only of       roses    collected          at different days.
    The      calyxes           do not         in any        shape diminish the quality               of
the attar,       nor impart                any green colour to                  it,   though per
                                                                                               haps

    haps they may augment the quantity             :  but the trouble necef^
    lary to strip them must,      and ought to, prevent its been eves
   put in practice.
    III.   Or! Primary     Ores of Iron.    By Mr.      David Ml'SHET/
       of the  Clyde Iron Works.        Communicated       by the Author.
    JLRTMARY           ores of iron   are so named      in contradistinction
   to ores which appear, like iron-stones, to have been formed by
   a secondary      agency.    Their   varieties are (till more numerous
   than those of iron-stones        ;  possessing various characteristic
   features,    which     amply distinguisli them from each other,
  either in their inherent properties and effects, or in the man
  ner of their fossil disposition.       Some are obedient to the mag
  net, others not.        This property is by no means dependent
  upon the quantity of iron existing in the ore : the ore from
  the island of Elba, some of which yields 70 to 80 per cent, of
  iron, is (lightly obedient to the magnet : the sine hæmatites
  and kidney of the Cumberland ore, which yield from 64 to
            cent, are not, in their native state, in the least degree
  70 per
 magnetic; while many of the Danish and Norwegian                      oresy
 Containing from         18  to 30 per cent,     are,  magnetic in a great
 degree.      I have formerly    mentioned, that where the magnetic
 property was inherent, it was more            a proof of the existence of
 iron, than     a criterion whereby to judge of the probable quan
 tity of metal in the ore.
     The colours which primary ores of iron exhibit                 are also
Very various.         The beautiful crystallised fractures of      the Elba
specimens,        the prismatic colours they exhibit,         the coloured
oxyde deposited in flowers upon their surface, and the general
appearance       which they have of fusion, strongly tead to a con-          .
elusion that fire has here been the immediate agent in the
production of such variegated forms. This conclusion is still
more forcibly impressed, after minutely examining and com
paring with them those very perfect crystals which are found
                                                                  amongst

                          On Primary Ores of Iron.                            *Jj
amongst      the    Cumberland ores.           These at once         convey the
idea    of the agency      of  water in their formation     :  if   the internal
cavities    of  some    of the pieces are examined, the proofs mul
tiply and become irrefragable. The chasms in which the cry
stals are found, and always formed, display the process of
 crystallization in all its various stages.           Crystals are found in
 finish and form proportioned to the               stage of   the operation       :
 some imperfect, and          of a clayey consistency and colour; others
 in    a more    finished    state, hard, but as yet unpolished            or dia
  phanous     :  some are encircled in a slimy membrane,                   which,
 when displaced, displays the crystals more or less transparent
 as the operation has been more or less perfect.                   I have found
  cavities in this ore quite           filled with    water, which          in this
  state had been transported          some hundred miles; the sides and
  bottoms of such chasms             always abounding with            a soft  mud
  composed       of   the1  finest  fragments of silex, free from every
  touch of asperity. Again, crystals arc found in this ore, which
  possess various degrees of pelluciditv; some of them very white;
  yet dull   ;   absorbing light, yet transmitting little.             Others are
  as    clear and transparent           as the   purest water     ;   their angles
   frequently decomposing light with all the vivid effects of the
   prism. Other varieties are          less diaphanous, but       possess   various
   tinges of colour; and increase in opacity in proportion as the
   colouring matter is present in the crystal.           Some        possess a gar
   net colour more or less intense,             and most   of them transmit
   less or more light.
       There is another variety of crystals among the Cumberland
    ore, exhibiting      a green   colour, which is owing to the presence
    of  an acid.     This, like the garnet coloured crystal, transmits
    light in a greater or lesser degree in proportion to the quan
    tity of iron present. There are also various prismatic crystals
    in this ore, of      a small size,    which owe their splendid and va
    riegated lustre to sulphur,          and which are easily tamislied by
     the application of heat.           Specimens also    of crystallized iron
     ore, in the form of razor blades, containing oxygen and car
     bon, are not uncommon            :   these resemble   more the Elba ore
                                                                                than

than any other variety          ;   yet, the         state     of the carbon              so   much*
resembling foffile plumbago,                so   unlike the carbon which the
Elba      specimens       afford, and      so   widely different from that ob
tained      by   fusion, together        with the smallness and regularity
of   the crystals,        their lustre and finish constitute                         a   wide   dif
ference between           these two ores.
     The   fine red oxyde which            so   much resembles cinnabar, and
which      is   found in abundance upon the Elba iron ore, ap
pears to me to be an oxyde                 of iron         deposited            by   the decom
position of fulphat of iron.               Thus        far   I      can fay, that         a    pow
der exactly similar was                 deposited upon the surface                        of    some
iron-stones exposed to              a   high temperature, in which                         I     had
ascertained       the presence       of the sulphuric acid. The various
shades     of colour which          appear upon the Elban ore, exactly
resemble those which may be passed                           upon ore, iron, or steel,
 by   exposing them under certain degrees                            of     heat to the action
of atmospheric air.             Its fracture          is   most           evidently vitrified,
and exactly resembles iron fully combined with oxygen,                                           af
terwards        reduced    by   fusion to an opaque and very ponderous
glass.  Like the Elban ore, such vitrifications, when broken^
display   perfect state of crystallization.
            a
 I    have even obtained specimens                    of this ponderous                  lava pos
sessing    a   variety and richness of colouring, equal to many of
the Elban specimens.
     Though the       agency   of water will more readily explain the
structure,       crystallization and deposition of fossils in general,
yet there are circumstances which most forcibly claim an ex
ception. The Elba ore, in my opinion,                                is   one   I
                                                                                :     conceive    it
to be iron oxydated           in fusion         by   the combination of                  a     quan

it   with other     ores    of iron.

    The form           and        appearance              of the   mass     of this   ore much
resembles          the excessively                 saturated specimens          of crude iron
and plumbago, described  in my paper upon the principles of
iron and steel, with an allowance, in the former for its Ion?
exposure          to the tarnishing effects                      of water      and other ele
ments     :   the agency of these has conferred a variety of colours
in flowers, though                 the principal colouring                of the   ore seems to
have been          the effects of oxygen combined                            with     the iron at
certain degrees of heat                  :    in its raw         state the magnet         has little
power over it.                   Of this     ore pulverised
                                      (which possessed a sine
reddifli brown colour, interspersed with mining specula of
magnetic iron ore, resembling plumbago produced in the
smelting furnace), I threw into an iron, vessel heated to red
ness 80       grains     :   a gas was disengaged,                   which, from          its smell,
I concluded was carbonic acid gas, for I had not at hand a
proper apparatus or lime-water to try it with : the ore deep
ened during ten                   minutes exposure,                  without    changing the
splendor          of   the small specula              ;    when cooled, it         was found to
have lost 2 grains = 2*25 per cent.
    I   next introduced into            in small pieces, $15

bright red heat              :    the residue weighed 282 ; so that there were
lost    of carbonic              acid, and perhaps a little water, 33 grains                        =
lo-7     per cent.               The     sine red,            brown,   and purple colours,
were now totally annihilated ; a slightly coloured powder was
attached to the stopper                      of    the     vessel; the ore was now             of     a
dull blueifh colour, much frittered, granulated, but not pul
verulent      :    the magnet in this state possessed a considerable                             de
gree     of influence             over       it,   but     by   no means in proportion to
the quantity of iron which                           it    contained —not even equal to
what     it   has on common iron-stones                          :   from this circumstance
I   inferred, that           a    considerable            quantity of oxygen still remain
ed fixed with the metal.                           In order       to ascertain this,      I   intro
duced the last product, weighing 282 grains, into                                     a   close ves
sel, mixed with charcoal dust                             :   the mixture was exposed for
nearly ten hours to                  a   bright red heat; the ore being then fe-

the charcoal having taken up 59/5 grains = 21 per cent.
   In this state the ore had lost all its colour, and had assumed
a    whitish limey tinge;               had increased in bulk,                          and      become
frittered, yet possessing               a considerable                 degree      of continuity               :
when the smallest degree of friction was applied, the metal
brightened, and sliewed                    a   beautiful disengaged                    state    of mal
leable     iron;     the pieces easily connected under a welding heat,
and received with facility impressions                                 from the hammer;                     it
now adhered in great abundance to the magnet.                                                The       small

     In   the subsequent part                  of this        paper,     I    shall confine my
self chiefly to those primary ores                         used        in Britain for the pro
duction of crude iron.                     The          effects produced                by   such ores,
when fused alone, are only to be learned                                     in this country, at
thole iron-works where the charcoal of wood                                            is   used.        The
number of charcoal furnaces however are decreasing; and
those at present used as such, are not supplied with wood for
anc-third of the year.                   These           ores are, in the charcoal fur
nace, capable of producing crude iron of all the various de
grees of carbonation._  Since the invention of coak pig- iron,
the proprietors of these furnaces have confined their manu

facture to the forge pig, or oxygenated                            crude iron, part of
which is used to make            a flpe      quality of bar-iron for the pur
pose -of manufacturing               intp wire: for thi3 end some of the
manufacturers prefer carbonated iron, from which to fabri
cate their bars,       in order that a great share of ductility,                        ela
sticity and strength may conjointly be united.                             British bar-
iron, thus manufactured, far exceeds the finest foreign marks,
in    its astonishing ductility         in     the wire-drawer's           gauge.
     When primary         ores       of iron       are introduced into            the pit-
coal blast furnace, forming by weight                       a   considerable propor
tion of the mixture, with the usual proportion                           of coaks,       the
result is always oxygenated                crude iron,          unfit for any purpose
but the forge manufacture. Experience, therefore, has taught
the smelter to use them in small quantities, proportioned to
the measure        of iron-stone applied                  at each charge        of    mate
rials.     Some have        renounced the                 use   of Cumberland and
Lancashire ores, as being incompatible with the existence                                    of
good melting       pig-iron      ;    and                      or against
                                               the advocating for
their    use   is at present a        matter of local opinion.   So much
is, however, decided regarding them, that primary ores of
iron in any proportion will, when improperly applied, pro
duce oxygenated         crude iron         ;   that iron-stone,
                                                 properly pro
portioned with coaks, affords the finest quality of crude jron                               ;
and, in the iron trade,          it   is   still   a   desideratum,     whether Cum
berland and Lancafliire               ores,        when smelted          with     pit-coal,
will     afford   in   the large way  quality of pig-iron equal to
                                               a
that presently         made from iron-stone.   On this interesting
subject   I    shall make   a    few observations.              I     deem   it   interest
ing, since,       in many    places on the coast of Scotland,                         coal    is
to be found in great quantity, where as yet                         a   sufficient quan
tity of iron-stone has not been discovered, or which from ap
pearances likely never           may: in such situations,                 favoured       by   a
ready communication,                 either to import materials, or to vend
raw      or manufactured products, the Cumberland                               and    Lan
cashire ores might be purchased                        and used     with   great econa-

    my, provided the great end could be answered of obtaining
    from them crude iron of all the various degrees of carbonation.
       These ores, cither in a raw or calcined state, being much
    richer in iron — nearly double — than the average mass of
    iron-stone?, are in the blast furnace more fusible, from their
    superior richness ; they descend                 so   rapidly to the bottom                     of
    the furnace, through the strata of ignited coaks, that-time is
    not given for imbibing               the carbonic principle ; part                     of the
    iron is separated highly oxygenated,                       and part          of it runs off
    precipitated in oxygen, and united with the                         scoria            or fused
    earths.    When this is found to be the cafe,                         and which is
    easily known by the               fracture, weight, and blackness of the
    lava — were         the manufacturers to add a farther proportion                             of
    fuel     to take up the remaining oxygen, then the whole,                                     or
    nearly the whole of the metal would be revived; still                                           it
    would        possess a   white fracture.         Were       the Cumberland                and
    Lancashire ores solely            used    with pit-coal,       were they deprived
    ftt"   their iron, and again that iron revived,                   though            possessed
    of     a highly      oxyaenated          fracture, the great object would be
    half    effected;      for it is obvious, that in this cafe the furnace,
    and      the quality of iron, are in the fame                    state       with      a blast
    furnace, affording           a   similar quality of metal where iron-stone
    and pit-coal coaks on'y are used.                     In   the latter case a small
•
    additional portion of fuel, per charge, enables                              the metal to
    take up a part         of   the carbon afforded by the fuel              :    the fracture
    of     the   metal     is,   hy   this combination,         or mixture, changed
    from white to grey blue              ;    its assumption     of this colour              is   in
proportion to the extra quantity of fuel. From this fact, and
from the parity of situation,    conclude that   I    similar                    by   a
treatment — the additional fuel being always proportioned to
the weight of metal in the ore — the metal of such ores might

      Accustomed to apply the ores by weight, a determinate
  quantity is frequently introduced into the furnace without
  adverting to its superior richness in iron, and the consequent
  extra proportion       of  fuel necessary to take up its relative pro
  portion   of oxygen.          The nature             and consequences       of this
  will  be better understood             by the following            example   ;  first
  premising, that the quantity of oxygen— which                         is the great
  evil to be got rid of —exists in              a  just proportion to the quan
  tity of iron.        Suppose       then       a blast or smelting furnace,
  burdened     in the following manner                as to coaks and    iron-stone:
  Coaks 400      lb. —Torrefied           iron-stone        of various      qualities
 420 -820 :       let this quantity be supposed to yield                 in the blast
 furnace 40 per cent,            then each charge will yield 168 lb.
 Let it also be supposed that this proportion of materials af
 forded super-carbonated            iron    ;   in this cafe there was present,
 not only    a   sufficient quantity of carbon to take up the oxy
 gen contained in the ore,              but( such an abundance as to unite
 with the iron and to form plumbago.                         Should it be wished
 to reduce the quality,         or to increase the quantity of the pig-
 iron, by rendering it            less     carbonated       ;  and should this be
 effected   by adding to the above                     mixture     a  small  box of
 Cumberland ore containing                  60 lb.,      then   a portion of iron,
 with its accompanying oxygen, (supposing the ore to yield in
 the blast furnace 55 per cent.) would be thrown into the
furnace equal to 33 Ibs.; and the total produce of iron, per
charge, would be 168 + 33- 201 pounds, making a sum
nearly equal        to  -j of  the original            quantity.     This, portion
would of course require               5  of additional        fuel to preserve the
original quality os the metal                 :    it is even presumable         that
the proportion       of  coaks increases in a greater ratio, owing to
the    speedy descent       of the ore through the furnace                : this in
crease   may be fairly estimated                  as  5 to 8.     The quantity of
fuel being now too little to take up all the oxygen, part                     of the
metal remains unrevived, and flows out,                         minutely divided,

with the air.
   If,   in order to correct the quality of the iron,                               a   portion of
the iron-stone          is            off-i

of this weight be estimated at 40 per cent, then the quantity
of metal taken from the total 201, will be equal to 24,
leaving for metal  produced at each charge 177 lbs. instead
of 168, as in the former cafe when the iron was super-car

  Small        as   this quantity may appear                      to be,      yet,      on many
occasions,        a    furnace will not admit of the addition without
altering the quality of its iron from the one extreme to the
other.        The manufacturer,                   finding his operation
                                                therefore,
with    ores      so   subtle and precarious, frequently abandons their
use,    in    the firm belief that their application, in quantity,                                   is
incompatible            with the existence                  of   good melting pig-iron               ;
whereas, had the ore received                        a  proportion of fuel adequate
to its superior richness,             it   is   at    least questionable whether the
exact fame consequences                 would have been entailed                        :    even in
the cafe of iron-stones, the manufacturer ought to consider
the quantity of iron contained in the ore, as also the nature
of the various mixtures, in order                           to ensure to himself             a   pro
duce     of   carbonated        crude iron.
  There are two ways which would most likely be attended
with the happiest effects in producing njelung pig-iron from
primary ores of iron with pit-coal,                              advantageous            to indivi
dual?, and to the improvement of the business in general                                             :
the one,       by
              process similar
                    a         its principles of preparation

oxygenating            the   ore     before     it    is    introduced into                 the blast
furnace.        To     ensure success in the former of these operations,
the following requisites would be necessary.
   1st. A narrow constructed furnace, of an unusual height, in
                                           5                                            descending

descending through which, the ore, previous to fusion, would
be exposed to a long cementation in contact with the coal ; by
which means the carbonaceous or fusible principle would
be conveyed               to the metal         in quantity,             and its quality thus
constituted previous to separation.
    2nd. The column of air necessary in this cafe would require
to be cool, dense, and quickly                         impelled;            the     diameter of
the discharging pipe not to exceed                         2   J   inches, but the column
of blast       able to support           6,   6\, or   7       inches of mercury.
    3rd. In the application of the ore                                  itself great attention
ought to be given to the quantity of iron contained,                                      as also
to the quantity of oxygen combined with                                     it,   in order that
a   quantity         of    coaks    might be applied                    adequate     to what      a
similar portion of iron would require     using iron-stone.        in
  4th. The ore should be dried      red heat, that what portion
                                                 in   a
of water         and sulphur        it   contained might gently be dissipated                    ;
care to be taken, however, to prevent                              a    high degree of heat,
that   a   greater quantity          of oxygen from                 the atmosphere         might
not be united to it.
    5th.       It   would be highly proper to reduce                         the ore to small
pieces     :   this would not only greatly facilitate the escape of
the water and sulphur                    by   diminishing the points of contact,
but also,           by   exposing   a    larger surface, enable the ore in thu
smelting furnace to take up the coally principle with greater
facility the pieces not to exceed
           ;                       or of an inch in their
                                                       J           }
thinnest diameters.
    6th. The earthy mixtures                     of    ores
                                                 being chiefly siliceous,
the    application           of pure calcareous earth as   flux or sol         a
vent would be requisite; and, according to existent circum
stances,       a    lime-stone, containing fine clay, slightly coloured
by    the presence            of    the oxyd        of iron, might                be used   :   the
bulk of        the pieces      of lime-stone ought                     also to be   a   matter of
attention, and should not greatly exceed the ore in size.
    In     the end, should               an association            of    these requisites pro
duce       the      desired effects           and crude            iron of all the various
degrees        of carbonation             be obtained from primary                       ores of

iron, it would render many situations in this country eligible
for iron-works,         which    are at present only so on account          of
the immense         profusion of    coal with    which they abound        ; it
would call into profitable existence             the   iron contained in
these vast and        extensive    mines of Cumberland           and    Lan-
caffiire  ;  confer spirit and activity on the manufacturer and
the landed      proprietor, in      a general   search after so profitable
and useful a mineral ;          and   would tend to throw new and
ample light upon many               valuable ores of various natures,
which      at this time lie dormant,         unexplored, and unappre
 ciated.
    The   second method likely to succeed in fabricating melting
pig-iron from primary ores would be to subject them to de-
oxygenation in the most economical way ; not severely, so
as to change them into malleable iron, but in a manner
which would still render them sufficiently fusible. The de
privation of oxygen in this manner, would enable the car
 bonaceous      principle to take immediate effect,          by penetrating
 the ore,     and constituting real fusibility       : it is even probable
 that the quantity of fuel used to effect this, in such simple
 constructed      furnaces as might be found answerable,               would
 afterwards     be saved     in the smelting furnace, and the ore
 rendered     equally    cheap in this state a= when raw — besides
 the great point in obtaining the wished for quality of iron.
    The coaly matter requisite to stratify the ore — previous to
 de-oxvgenation — would be the dust afforded by the coals in
 the present mode of coaking ; and which, from the tender
 nature of the coal, exists, at some works, in great quantities:
 it  is of no     real value, and,      by pasting it through sieves to
 render it of    an equality of size, it might be used to imbed the
 ore    without any other preparation.              Such matter    ae  this is
 capable    of protecting      the ore   for  a  much longer time than
 would      be requisite    in this operation     :  charcoal-dust,     made
  from    pit- coal,   is capable     of withstanding       a heat    equally
  violent   as   charcoal-dust      from wood, without         being sooner
  consumed ;       it is even less liable to      be   destroyed   when at
                                                                          any

any time in contact with external air, either in the process
of cementation for steel, or in the de-oxygenation of iron-
ores. Iron-ores thus stratified, exposed to              a state of complete
ignition, would in        8  or 10 hours nearly part with the whole
amount of mixtures, including oxygen, with which they
were combined ; the ore would be found penetrated with a
considerable     portion of carbon, and the metal existing in a state
nearly disengaged.           Their tendency, however, would much
depend upon the          various mixtures which composed the in
 dividual ores; their loss of weight,                their properties       and
 appearance,      also depending upon similar circumstances                with
 those   explained in the preparation of iron-stone in               a former
 paper.
     The  varieties    of  the primary       ores   of iron found in this
 country are much limited,            and chiefly possess the fame ex
 ternal characteristic forms — at least those which                have come
 within my knowledge —that of the                island   of lflay   excepted.
 Cumberland and Lancashire              seem   to be the two great depo
 sits for this mineral.        The    ore   of    the   former is found in
 large masses, fplinty,          and globulated, consisting         of various
  kidney    forms   and   hæmatites,     striated   and   smooth,    of blueisti
  and reddish colours.        The kidneys      are frequently large, com
  posed   of   successive layers     encrusting       a  nucleus    of   coarser
  ore.    The fplinty      pieces are   of   a light blueisti     colour,    and
  frequently afford        the most beautiful specimens             of various
  crystals,   principally     of  a  whitisli   colour,     of  a chalky,    and
  sometimes      of  a  pellucid appearance ; also garnet, more or
  less intense,    and green.       The most common shapes are pen
  tagonal    and    hexagonal pyramids,              with truncated bases.
  Some of these T have found measure i inch at the base :
  from this uncommon size, down to the most minute forms
  imaginable,       the   fame    figures   are found possessing purity,
  transparency, and finisli in the highest degree : these classes
   are of a whitish water colour, more or less pellucid.                 Garnet
  coloured crystals are found of the fame shape,                 but  of  a very
                                                                            small

 small size, none       of them measuring more than                  T'^  of an inch
 upon the base.                            /
     The various      (hades    of garnet, yellow, and green coloured
 crystals,   when found of a large size, have generally assumed
 the form      of   a prism,      a  cube, or a parallelopipedon                  with
 flattened    edges   :  none of these, however,             possess the transpa
 rency of the pure quartzose crystal.                The whole of        these forms
are   found in    chasms in the large masses               of splinty    ore  :  when
the cavity is broken up,              the groups of crystals              are found
occupying        all its sides, and projecting               their tops to each
other.      Not unfrequently          clusters     of  crystals are found          im
bedded in a thin stratum             of beautifully        crystallised    prismatic
iron-ore,       obedient to the magnet, and                possessed    of the   most
splendid     dazzling colours.
    The Lancashire        ore is composed          of  smaller masses,          softer,
and    of  a more greasy appearance              ; there are, however,            in it
all the former variety of crystals,                 though of a smaller size.
The quality of this        ore is also    much preferred in the blast fur
nace, whether in the process with pit-coal                         coaks, or with
the charcoal of wood.             This partiality         is owing to the        mix
tures in      it being more favourable to the existence of carbon
in   the blast furnace       :  day,     and not unfrequently calcareous
crystals,    are found      in this    ore   ;  whereas      the earthy mixture
of   the Cumberland         ore is chiefly siliceous,          with    a small    por
tion of sulphur.          Both of these ores,           in the kidney variety,
contain fine specimensof fossile plumbago.
    In  several places        in Scotland       iron ores have been disco
vered     resembling in point             of   appearance         those    of Cum
berland and Lancashire            :  sonic     individual      pieces     as rich    in
iron, but the average quality,               as   to contents in iron,           infe
rior.    The quantity hitherto found has been                    so  small, and its
locality    so insulated,       that  it  has never been,           to the manu
facturer, an object         of attention, nor of farther              search to the
proprietor.        In   the    West    Highlands         some transient          veins
have    been     found,     but their irregularity            of   disposition     has

     A vein, which indicated                a  large field of supply, was some
 years     ago traced        in the neighbourhood               of Muirkirk iron
 works, and its course followed for several miles.                      The kidney
 pieces    of this      ore are fully as        rich  and ponderous as those         of
 the Cumberland             vein.
     Salisbury Craggs,            in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh,
 afford also some very             good specimens of an irregular vein,
 which      still remains untraced ; apparently the fame                       ore is
 found on an estate belonging                    to the family      of Duhdonald,
 called    La Mancha,           10 miles south         of Edinburgh;       the lands
 of Cranston        also afford a similar ore           :  the quality   of the ore,
 in both of        these places,        may be reckoned upon the average
 to yield 42 per cent,           of iron.
      I  have seen some very sine specimens                    of iron-ore picked
 up in different parts of Fifeshire,                 where no vein could possi
 bly be discovered.
      The    finest Scotch         ore    I   have seen,       and which      possesses
  mixtures congenial to the existence                       of carbon in     the blast
 furnace,       is found in the           Ochil-hills,       not above two miles
  from the Devon iron-works.                         This     ore   is soft,    loosely
  striated,     of  a reddish      colour,       not very ponderous,         but pos
 sessing a superior        quantity of iron.
      The iron         ore  of the island of            I slay   is found regularly
  stratified,     and resembles,             in point of deposition, the          Nor
  wegian       and Danish           ores.       The   strata are almost vertical,
  and are found imbedded               in     a loose ochreous earth surround
  ed    with   soil  :   the fracture of this ore partakes of the nature
  of    the imbedding          earth    ;   it abounds with shining specula
  resembling file x, but which, upon closer examination, prove
  to be plates of slightly magnetic iron-ore.
       Having thus shortly            enumerated          some    of various indica
   tions of the existence of iron-ore in Britain,                     I shall subjoin
   the treatment         of two of them widely different in their                 fossile
   deposition,       their appearance,             and    their component parts ;
                                                                                   these

  364                      On Primary Ores          of Iron.
  these shall be, the ore       of the island of May, and             the Cumber
 land iron-ore.
     Of the    former     I pulverised   872 grs. which           I  threw into an
 iron   vessel    of  a red heat.    In  1 j   minutes, during which time
 no sensible smell was disengaged,              the powder assumed a com
 plete change        of colour,    and lost    in weight       12 grs.     The    ore
 was again returned into the furnace, and exposed to a bright
 red heat for 5 minutes,           in which time it lost farther 38 grs.
 — -in all 40 grs.=4"58 per cent.
     I next reduced to small pieces 2700 grs. of this ore, and
 subjected them to a high heat for 8 hours, partially exposed
 to air, in which           time 314 grs.          of volatile mixtures        were
 driven off, equal to 11 •2 per cent.
    The   ore had now assumed a reddish blue                   colour;     had be
 come friable, and much divided              ; it parted in small granulated
 masses,    like the fragments of quartz,                but was considerably
 magnetic.          The fracture     was    rough,        full of asperities    ;  it
 did not effervesce with acids, nor had it acquired                    any sensible
increase     of weight; when            pulverised,        the   sliining specula
 were most conspicuous, and very magnetic.                       Some of their
surfaces, by avoiding the one pole                 of   the magnet, and em
bracing the other, led me to suppose they had polarity.                           In
order to de-oxygenate             this  ore,     I  introduced 2040 grs. in
small pieces, mixed             with   charcoal,      into an iron test luted
with clay,         and exposed the mixture to              a  high red heat for
ten hours      :   the   ore then separated from             the   charcoal, and
weighed, was found to have lost, of volatile mixtures and
oxygen, 456 grs. = 22-3 per cent.; from which deducting
1 1 '2 as  the quantity of volatile mixtures, being the quantity
lost by simple torrefact ion as stated above, there remains                    in
per cent, for oxygen taken up by the charcoal.
    In this      state  the ore had assumed            a blueisti    colour  ;  had
become bulky and pulverulent, without exhibiting the smallest
fieri of malleability         : it was, however,            so  completely de-
oxvgcnated,          and the metal so much revived, as to deflagrate
with the rapidity of iron filings,
                                                                            J  next

   I next exposed of this ore in        small piees to* a similar tem
perature, in an open vessel,             -           -           1804-2 grs.
After eight hours       the fragments weighed               -    3260
Gamed in weight, by the combination of oxygen, 455-8 grs.
equal to 25*3 percent,        of de-oxygenated ore,           and to 19*6   of
raw ore.
   The magnetic virtue           so   eminently       manifested      in this
ore was now totally lost,        and the individual pieces had ac
quired a sensible increase of weight.                From this     ore  I ob
tained, by fusion, a button of oxygenated crude iron, equal
to           -                           -           56-5

The    specific gravity     of this specimen I found to             be — in a
raw state, 3-370; de-oxygenated, 3-060; oxydated                   and com
bined with 25-3 per cent, oxygen, 4-000.
   Of the many experiments I have made                      upon the Cum
berland iron-ore,         the following,     at the present time,         may
serve as a comparative treatment           with others.          Of this ore,
pulverised,     I threw into a red hot      vessel        -       218*5 grs.
Instantly a blue flame arose, and hovered nearly
half a minute upon the surface of the powder :
the   smell     was    sulphureous,     penetrating,        and
strong  :   the powder, after 5 minutes,         was taken
out, and weighed                    -              -
                                                                  212-5
Lost of water and sulphuric acid                      -        -      6 grs.
The colour was considerably           deepened,     and the mass had ac
quired    a  minute portion    of magnetic obedience.
   I next torrefied, of this ore, in an open test, -               3086 grs.
After   a   bright   heat   of eight hours, the        residue
weighed              -                                    -        1961

    In order   to dfe-oxygenate       this ore,     I  introduced,       mixed
 with charcoal, into an                                  -
                             open vessel,                            3894 grj.
 This mixture was exposed, under a high heat,
 for ten hours : when the ore was separated from
 the charcoal, it weighed                   -             -         2069
Total loss of volatile mixtures = 28-5 per cent.                      825 grs.
    In this short time the whole mass had become malleable,
highly polished,      and was      finely converted        :  when      heated,
the pieces      welded    together,      and were easily drawn into
small rods of good malleable iron.
    In another experiment       I exposed,    of the de-oxygenated ore,
to a still higher degree of heat than the former,                1 841  -5 gr $.
   The mass, when cool, weighed                   -              2489
Gained in weight, by the combination of oxygen, 647-5 grs.
equal to 35*16 of de-oxygenated ore, or 25- 14 of raw ore.
    The practical    analysis    of this   species    of the Cumberland

IV. Description of the Lacjba,                or Lac Insecl *.         By Mr.    W.
     Roxburgh, Surgeon on                      the   Madras        Establishment.
     Communicated          by   Dr. James Anderson.                       From the
     Asiatic Researches.
 OOME          pieces    of very fresh-looking         Lac, adhering        to small
 branches of Mimosa                cinerea, were        brought      me   from the
 mountains on the 20th of last month.                         I kept them care
 fully,    and to-day,        the 4th    of December, fourteen days from
 the time they came             from the hills, myriads pf exceedingly
 minute animals were observed creeping about the lac, and
 branches it adhered              to, and more        still  issuing    from small
 holes     over    the    surface    of   the   cells  :  other small      and per
  forated excrescences          were observed        with a     glass amongst      the
  perforations, from which the minute insects issued, regularly
  two to each hole, and crowned with some very fine white
  hairs.     When         the   hairs were rubbed off, two white spots
  appeared.           The animals, when single, ran about pretty
  briskly, but in general they were               so numerous       as to be   crowd
   ed over one another.            The body      is oblong,      tapering most to
   wards the tail, below plain, above convex, with                      a  double, or
   flat margin      :  laterally on the back part of the thorax are two
   small tubercles,         which may be the eyes : the body behind
   the thorax is          crossed     with twelve rings : legs six ; feelers
    (antennæ) half the           length of the body, jointed, hairy, each
   ending in two hairs            as  long   as the   antennæ      :  rump, a white
    point between two terminal hairs, which are as long as the
    body of the animal.                 The mouth          I  could not fee.        On
    opening the cells, the substance that they were formed of can
    not be better described,            with respect to appearance,            than by
    saying it is like the transparent amber that beads are made
    of: the external covering of the cells may                       be about    half  a
     line thick,      is remarkably strong,          and able to resist       injuries  :
        • This  discovery of   Mr. Roxburgh will bring Lac         a genut into the class
    Hemiptcra of Linueus.

   the partitions are much thinner                :  the cells are     in general      ir
   regular squares, pentagons and hexagons, about an eighth
   of an inch in diameter, and one quarter deep : they have no
   communication with each other.                     All  those   I  opened during
   the time the         animals were        issuing,    contained in one half, a
   small bag silled with       a  thick red jelly-like liquor, replete with
   what     I  take to be eggs         :  these bags,      or utriculi, adhere to
   the bottom of the cells,           and have each two necks, which pass
   through perforations in the external coat of the cells, form
   ing the fore-mentioned                excrescences,      and ending         in  some
  *ery sine hairs.          The other half of           the cells have a distinct
  ©pening,       and contain a white substance,               like some few fila
  ments of cotton rolled together, and numbers of the insects
  themselves ready to make their exit. Several of the fame in
  sects   I   observed to have drawn up their len-s, and to lie flat :
 they did not move on being touched, nor did they show any
  figns  of life with the        greatest irritation.
      December 5.        The fame minute hexapedes continue issuing
  from their cells in numbers : they are more lively, of a
 deepened red colour, and fewer of the motionless sort.                             To
 day   I saw    the mouth      :  it   is a flattened    point about the middle
 of the breast, which the little animal projects on being com
 pressed.
      December 6.        The male infects             I have   found       to-day    :   a
 few of them are constantly running among the females most'
 actively : as yet they are scarce more, I imagine, than one
 to 5000 females,           but twice their size.           The     head is obtuse;
 eyes black, very large ; antennae                  clavated,    feathered,       about
 £,  the length of the body            :  below the middle an articulation,
fiich   as those     in the legs    :   colour between the eyes a beautiful
shining green         :  neck very short        :   body oval, brown          :  abdo
men oblong, the length of body and head                        :   legs six   :  wings
membranaceous,              four, longer than the body, fixed to the
fides   of the thorax,           narrow       at    their insertions,        growing
                   a
broader for             of their length, then rounded ; the anterior
pair is twice the size of the posterior : a strong fibre runs
                                                                                 along

along their anterior margins                   :    they lie flat, like the wings of
a common fly when it walks or rests                                :    no hairs from the
rump       :   it springs most actively to               a considerable                 distance, on
being touched            :   mouth in the under part of the head                              :   max
illae transverse.             To-day    the    female insects                   continue issuing
in great numbers, and move about    on the 4th.            as
  December 7. The small red insects still more numerous^
and move about as before : winged insects, still very few,
continue active.               There have been fresh leaves and bits                                    of
the branchesof both Mimosa Cinerea and Corinda put into
the wide mouthed bottle with them : they walk over them
indifferently, without showing any preference, or inclination
to work or copulate.    I opened a cell whence I thought the
winged flies             had    come, and found                  several,            eight or ten,
more in         it,   struggling to shake off their incumbrances                              :    they
were in one            of    those utriculi mentioned on the 4th,                                 which
ends    in two mouths,               shut up with fine white hairs, but one
of them         was open for the exit               of   the flies          ;    the other would
no doubt have opened                   in   due time        :      this utriculus         I       found
now perfectly dry, and divided into cells                                       by   exceeding     thin
partitions.           I      imagine, before any             of        the flies         made their
escape,        it   might have contained about twenty.                                 In these mi
nute cells with the living flies, or whence they had made
their escape, were small dry dark-coloured compressed grains,
which may be the dried excrements                               of the flies *.

      The      Hindoos have fix na'nes for Lac         ;   but they generally call            itLacfhi
from the multitude           of small infects, who, as they believe, discharge                    it   from
their stomachs, and at length             destroy    the    tree       on   which they form their
colonies   :   a    fine Pippala   near Cristinanagar      is   now almost wholly destroyed

 JTiOOKE'sMicrographia was,                by the   Council of    the Royal
Society, ordered to be printed, November 23, 1664. —Speak
ing of charcoal, Hooke observes, that " the body to be
charred or coaled may be put into              a  crucible, pot, or any
other   vessel  that will endure to be made red-hot in the fire
without breaking, and then covered over with sand,                  so as  no
part of it be fullered to be open to the air            ;  then set into a
good lire, and there kept till the sand has continued red hot
for a quarter, half, an hour or two, or more, according to the
nature and bigness of the body to be coaled or charred; then
taking it out of the sire, and letting it stand till it be quite
cold, the body may be taken out of the sand well charred
and   cleansed    of   its   waterisli parts;    but in the taking of it
out, care must be had that the sand be very near cold, for
else, when it comes into the free air, it will take sire, and
readily burn away.           ,
   " This    may be clone also in any close vessel of glass, as a
retort, or the like ; and the several fluid substances that come
over may be received in a sit recipient, which            will  yet further
countenance this hypothesis : and their manner of charring
wood ingreat quantity comes much to the fame tiling, namely,
an application of       a  great heat to the bodv, and preserving           it
from the free     access    of the devouring air.     This may      be easily
learned from I lie History of Charring of Coal, most excellently
described    and published       by that most accomplished gentle
man, Mr. John Evelyn, in              the 100, 101, 103 pages          of his
Sylva  ; to which    I   shall therefore   refer the curious reader that
desires a  full information of it.
   "  Next,    we may learn what part          of  the wood    it  is that is
the combustible matter; for, since we shall find that none,                or
                                                                         v«ry

 Very little         of   those fluid substances that are driven over into
 the receiver are combusiible,                     and that most        of that which          is
 loft behind is so,        it follows, that the solid interstitia of the
 wood          are the combustible matter,   further, the reason why
 uncharred wood burns with                        a greater     flame than that which
 is charred, is as evident, because those waterish or volatile parts
issuing out          of   the fired wood, every way, not only shatter and
 open the body, the better for the sire to enter, but, issuing out
 in vapours or wind, they become like                          so   many little æolipiles,
 or bellows, whereby they blow and agitate the fired part, and
 conduce to the more speedy and violent consumption or dis
 solution of the body.
    " Thirdly, from the experiment of charring                                     of       coals
 (whereby we               fee       that notwithstanding            the great    heat,      and
 the duration             of   it,   the solid parts of die wood remain, whilst
 they arc preserved from the free access of the air undillipated)
 we       may learn, that which has not, that                         I   know of, been
 published or hinted, nay, not                     so   much    as   thought of,       by   any;
 and that in (hort               is   this.
      "     First, that the air in which we live, move, and breathe,
 and which encompasses very many, and cherislies most bodies
it   encompasses,               that this air     is   the menstruum,           or universal
 dissolvent         of    all sulphureous         * bodies.
      "     Secondly, that this action                  it   performs not till the body
 be first sufficiently heated, as we find requisite also to the dis
 solution of many other bodies                         by
                                   several other menstruums.
    " Thirdly, that this action of dissolution produces or ge
nerates         a   very great         heat,   and that       which    we call sire    ;     and
 this     is   common also to many dissolutions of other bodies made
 by   menstruums, of which                  could give multitudes of instances.

                                                       is               great     so           a
violence, and does                     so   minutely act and rapidly agitate                 the
smallest parts of the combustible matter, that                             it   produces      in

    the diaphanous medium                       of     the air, the action                or pulse of
    light, which, what it                 is,
                                           I         have elsewhere already                (hewn.
       "     Fifthly,          that the dissolution of sulphureous bodies                                 is
    made         by  a    substance inherent, and mixt                      with    the air, that         is
    like,    if      not the very fame with                   that which            is   fixt in salt
    peter, which by multitudes               of experiments that may be made
    with saltpeter, will,           I   think, most evidently be demonstrated.
       "     Sixthly, that in this               dissolution          of bodies          by   the air, a
    certain part           is   unifed and mixt, or dissolved and turned into
    the air, and made                 to fly up and down                    with    it    in the fame
.   manner           as   a    metalline, or other body dissolved into any men-
    siruums, does follow the motions and progresses of that men
    struum till           it   be precipitated.
       "    Seventhly, that           as there         is   one part that          is    dissoluble       by
    the air, so           are there other parts with which the parts                             of      the
    air mixing and uniting                    do make        a    coagulum,          or precipita
    tion,    as one        may call     it,   which causes            it   to be separated from
    the air   ;       but this precipitate             is   so    light, and in          so   small and
    rarified or porous clusters, that                   it   is   very volatile, and            is   easily
    carrved up            by    the motion       of   the air, though afterwards, when
    the heat and agitation that kept                          it      rarified ceases,         it    easily
    condenses,            and     commixt            with other indissoluble parts,                       it
    sticks    and         adheres to the next bodies                   it   meets withall        ;       and
    this    is   a   certain salt that may be extracted out of soot.
       "     Eighthly, that many indissoluble                              parts    being very apt
    and prompt to be rarified,                       and so, whilst they continue                         in
    that heat and agitation, are lighter than the ambient air, are
    thereby thrust and carryed upwards with great violence, and
     by    that means            carry along with them, not only that saline
    concrete     I        mentioned before,             but many terrestrial,                  or indis
    soluble' -and irrarifiable parts, nay, many parts also                                    which      are
y   dissoluble* but are not suffered to stay long enough                                       in    a   suf
    ficient heat to make them prompt and apt for that action.
    And       therefore. we find                in    soot, not only         a     part that, being
    continued longer in               a   competent heat, will be dissolved by
             %                                                                                           the

the air, or take fire and burn ; but a part also which is fixt,
terrestrial and irrarisiable,
   " Ninthly,           that    as there are             these several parts that                       will
rarifie and fly, or be driven up by the heat,                                          so    are there
many others, that              as   they are indissoluble by the aerial men
struum,        so are       they of such sluggish                  and gross parts,                     that
they are not easily rarified by heat, and therefore cannot be
raised     by   it;     the volatility or fixtness                 of    a   body seeming to
consist only      in this, that          the one is         of    a    texture, or has com
ponent parts that will be easily rarified into the form of air;
and the other, that it has such as will not, without much
ado, be brought to such a constitution ; and this is that part
which remains behind in                      a white body called                      ashes,       which
contains        a substance,            or salt, which chymists call alkali                                 :
what the particular natures of each of these bodies                                                are,    I
shall    not here examine, intending it in another place                                            ;   but
shall     rather add, that this hypothesis                            does so exactly agree
with all phænomena of                   sire, and so genuinely explicate each
particular circumstance that                    I   have hitherto observed, that it
is more than probable, that this cause which                                      I   have assigned
is the true, adequate,               real,    and only cause                 of       those phæno
mena ; and therefore                I   shall proceed a little further, to shew
the nature and           use   of the air.
   " Tenthly,           therefore       the dissolving parts of the air are but
few, that        is,   it   seems       of the nature of                 those saline men-
struums or spirits that have very much flegme mixt with
the spirits,      and        therefore       a      small parcel of                   it    is    quickly
glutted, and will dissolve no more                          j      and therefore, unless
some fresli part         of this menstruum                 be applied to the body to
be dissolved,          the action ceases, and                    the    body leaves                to     be
dissolved and to sliine, which                      is   the indication of                  it,   though
placed     or kept in the greatest heat;                          whereas             saltpeter
                                                                                                        is
                                                                                                        a
menstruum,            when melted             and red-hot,              that abounds more
with    those dissolvent particles, and therefore, as                             a    small quan
tity of   it   will    dissolve     a   great       sulphureous body,                       so   will   the
dissolution be very quick and violent.
                                                                                            « Thew,

     "    Therefore, in the eleventh place, it is observable,                                       that,
as    in other solutions,                 if   a   copious and quick supply of fresh
menstruum, though but weak, be poured                                        on or applied             to
the       dissoluble        boclv,        it quickly consumes it : so this menn
siruum of             the    air,    if     by bellows, or any other such contri
vance, it be copiously applied to the sliining body, is found
to dissolve it as soon                    and       as   violently      as      the more strong
menstruum of melted nitre.
     "    Therefore, twclfthly, it seems reasonable                                 to    think lhat
there is no such thing                     as      an element         of   fire that stiould at
tract or draw up the flame, or towards which the flame
should endeavour to ascend out of a desire or appetite of
uniting with that as its homogeneal primitive and generat
ing clement; but that that sliining transient body which we
call flame, is nothing                     else     but a mixture of air and volatile
sulphureous parts of dissoluble or combustible bodies, which
are acting upon each other whilst they ascend, that    flame                                  is,
seems to be     mixture of air and the combustible volatile parts
                     a
of     anv body, which parts the encompassing air does dissolve
or work upon, which                        action,        as   it   does intend the heat               of
the aerial parts of the dissolvent,      does    thereby further so          it
rarific those parts that are acting, or that are very near them,
whereby they growing much lighter than the heavie parts of
that menstruum that are more remote, are thereby pro
truded and driven upward                        ;    and this may be easily observed
also      in   dissolutions         made           by
                                         any other menstruum, especi
ally such as           either create heat or bubbles. Now, this action
of the menstruum or air on the dissoluble parts,                                     is   made with
such violence,               or     is    such,      that   it   imparts such            a   motion or
pulse to the diaphanous parts                            of the air,       as   1   have elsewhere
sliewn         is   requisite to produce light.

very little information from what has been (till                  of late)   writ-
ten   of it: but being       once well understood,          it will,     I  doubt
not, enable a man to render an intelligible, nay probable, if
not the true reason of all the phenomena of fire, which, as
it  has been     found by writers and philosophers of all ages a
matter of no small difficulty,           as   may be sufficiently under
stood by their strange hypotheses            and unintelligible         solutions
of    some few phænomena            of it;   so  will it   prove a matter         of
no small concern and            use  in human affairs,         as  I shall    else
where endeavour to manifest when                I come to shew the           use  of
the air in respiration, and for the preservation                    of  the life,
nay,     for the conservation       and restauration       of   the health and
natural constitution of mankind               as  well   as    all other aerial
 animals,     as also the uses     of this principle or propriety of             the
air in chymical,         mechanical, and other operations.                 In this
 place    I have  only time to hint an hypothesis, which, if God
permit me life and opportunity, I may elsewhere prosecute,
 improve and publish."
     This   appears   to be exactly the doctrine            of Mayow, who
 first published his treatise on respiration in 1668, and his
other treatises on the composition of nitre, &c. in 1674,
shewing clearly the priority of Hooke.

                          shewed me a receipt           he had procured for

 preparing an ink of that
 was to be dissolved in the nitrous acid, and a quantity of
                        to that of the cobalt dissolved,             was     to be

ceeded     with him,                     I    resolved to make some experiments to
ascertain        the point.                    My        first    object was to procure pure
cobalt ; but as                  I    was unwilling to sacrifice pure pieces of
any considerable                     size, I made choice of one which was visi
bly mixed with bismuth, iron                                       and quartz.               I   endeavoured
to separate the bismuth as much                                       as   possible,             and   also the
arsenic     if   it should           contain any, by bringing it slowly to a
red heat ; and               I   succeeded pretty well, as the bismuth flowed
from it in abundance; and the arsenic, the quantity of which
was small, was volatilised                           :     many globules of bismuth still
adhered to it.                   By bringing it                   repeatedly        to a red heat, and
then quenching it in water, it was reduced to such                                                     a state as
to be easily pulverised.                            Having           poured        nitrous acid upon
the powder,              I   obtained by digestion                         a beautiful rose red so
lution;     the      siliceous                 earth       was      separated           in the form of a
white slime, and by diluting                                     it with water there was de
posited a white powder,                             which         was oxyd     of bismuth. The
solution being filtered,                        I   added to it a          solution of potash, and
obtained         a   precipitate inclining more to                                  a   yellow than to a
red colour.              I
              again poured over it a little of the nitrous
acid, by which a part of the oxyd was re-dissolved of a red
colour: the remaining part, which had                                          a   dark brown colour,
was oxyd of iron.                             From the solution, by                         the addition       of
potash,     a    precipitate was formed, which                                      was now reddish.
Having by this process obtained it pure ; that I might now
prepare from it the wislied for red ink, I dissolved the washen
pure oxyd of cobalt in different acids.                                         That        dissolved in the
nitrous acid with                    a       mixture of nitre, gave                     a   green       ink like
the common               :   that dissolved in the sulphurous acid, with
out the addition of salts, gave                                  a reddish      ink, which remained
aster it was exposed to heat,                               and would not again disappear,
even     when        a       solution of nitre was applied                              ;    and       that dis
solved     in the             muriatic              acid gave          a green          ink, darker           and
more beautiful than the common.                                            By      dissolving          it,   how
ever, in the acetous acid, and adding                                      a   little nitre,      I    obtained
what   I   had       in view; for                   it   gave, on the aDDlication                      of heat,

           Description
   By Dr. F. W.  Aug.   Mubhard, of Gottingen. From
   Neues Journal der Physik, by Professor Gren., Vol. IV.
TiHIS            instrument, first described                      by    M.    de Saussure           in
the fourth volume of the Memoirs of the Royal Academy of
Sciences at Turin, has some resemblance                                                *,
                                                                        to the cyanometer
both in      regard to its object and construction.                       The principal
 difference       is,   that the latter shews                 the whole effect of the va
 pour and evaporation diffused                            throughout the atmosphere,-
 from the eye of the observer to the utmost boundary of his
 view  ;while the diaphanometer      on the other hand, de is,
 signed     to shew the greatness                    of
                                                 existing  the evaporations                         in
 any limited part of the atmosphere which surrounds us.
    The     measure          of       transparency        in     M.    de Saussure's       instru
 ment,      is   founded         on the proportion of the distances at which
 determined objects                   cease to     be visible    ;     and the point was to
 find objects, the disappearance of which, at                             a   certain distance,
 could be determined with the greatest accuracy. M. de
 Saussure found that the moment of disappearance can be ob
 served much              more accurately when                    a    black object       is   placed
 on    a   white ground, than when                        a   white object      is   placed on a
 black ground           ;    that the accuracy was                     still greater when the
 observation            was      made         in   the fun,       than in the (hade            ;   and
  that even       a      still    greater      degree         of accuracy       was obtained,
 when the white space surrounding                                a    black circle, was itself
  surrounded            by  a    circle or ground of             a    dark colour.        This      last

 circumstance was particularly remarkable, and an observation
 quite new.

 board, and           if    this paper or pasteboard be placed in such a
 manner           as to be exposed       fully to the light or the sun, if you
 then approach                  it at the distance of three or four feet, and
 afterwards          gradually recede from                 it,    keeping your eve con
 stantly directed towards                    the black circle,         it   will     appear always
 to decrease         in    size the farther you retire                 from        it,   and     at the
 distance   of 33 or 34 feet will have the appearance of point.                              a
 If    you continue  still to recede, you will see  again enlarge               it
 itself; and        it   will    seem       to form   a    kind of cloud, the darkness
 of which           decreases more and more according as the circum
 ference          becomes enlarged.   The cloud will appear still to
 increase in size, the farther you remove from                                  it;   but at length
it    will totally        disappear.          The moment of                the disappearance,
 however,          cannot be accurately ascertained                         ;      and the more
 experiments were repeated,                        the    more were the results                     dif
 ferent.          This     is   an observation           perfectly accurate              ;   and hav
 ing myself made   series of experiments under like circum
                                 a
 stances,  am the more convinced of the truth of it.
             I                                                                               <
      M.     de Sauflure,            having reflected            for   a    long time on the
means        of remedying this inconvenienev, sawclearlv, that,                                         as
long    as       this cloud took place, no accuracy could be obtained;
and he discovered                    that   it   appeared        in    consequence             of   the
contrast          formed        by   the white parts which were at the greatest
distance from the black circle.                          He thenre concluded,                    that   if
the ground was left white near this circle, and the parts of
the pasteboard at the greatest distance from   were covered                  it
with    a    dark colour, the cloud would no longer be visible, or at
least almost         totally disappear.
     This conjecture was confirmed                           by    experiment.                 M.       de
Saussure left        a     white space around the black circle equal in
breadth to its diameter,                      by   placing    a    circle of black paper
i,   line   in    diameter on the middle of                 a    white circle three lines

                   M.     De Saujsures Dlaphancmeter.                                379
in diameter,       so   that the black circle was only surrounded                      by
a white ring       a   line in breadth.               The whole       was pasted up
on a green ground.              A    green colour was chosen,                because    it
was dark enough to make the cloud disappear,                                   and    the
easiest to be     procured.
     The black circle,          surrounded           in this manner with white
on a green ground, disappeared at a much less distance,                             than
when it was on a           white ground of             a large size.
     If a perfectly      black circle, a line in diameter, be pasted on
the middle of       a   white ground exposed to the open light,                     I can
 observe    it at the distance          of from 44          to 45 feet    ;  but  if this
circle be surrounded           by    a  white ring        a  line in breadth, while
 the   rest  of the ground          is green,        I  lose   fight of it at the dis
 tance    of only 15 !- feet.
     According        to these principles              M.    de Sauflure delineated
 several black circles,           the diameters           of which       increased in a
 geometrical progression,             the exponent           of which     was   \,    His
 smallest circle was 4 or o-2 of               a  line in diameter; the second,
 07,   ;  the third, 0*45       ;   and so on to the sixteenth,              which was
  87-537, or about          7  inches     3  \  lines.       Each of these circles
 was surrounded           by a    white ring, the breadth of which was
 equal to the diameter             of  the circle, and the whole was pasted
 on a green ground.
     M.    de Sauflure,       for his experiments,                 selected   a  straight
  road or plain       of about        12    or 1500 feet in circumference,
  which towards the North was bounded by trees or an ascent.
  Those who repeat them, however, must pay attention to the
  following remarks: — When a person retires backwards, keep
  ing his eye constantly fixed on the pasteboard, the eye be
  comes fatigued, and soon ceases to perceive the circle; as soon
  therefore    as  it  ceases     to be distinguishable,              you must suffer
  your eyes to rest;          not, however, by stiutting them, for they
  would when again opened                    be dazzled by the light, but by
   turning them gradually to some                   less  illuminated object in the
   horizon.     When you have done this for about half a minute,
                                                                                       aud

and again directed your eyes to the pasteboard, the circle will
be again visible, and you must continue to recede till it dis
appear once more.           You        must then let your eyes rest a second
time in order to look at the circle again, and continue in
this manner till the circle becomes actually invisible.
     If you   wish to find an accurate                expression for the want                   of
transparency,       you must employ a number                        of circles,         the dia
meters     of which     increase according to a certain progression,
and a comparison         of      the distances          at which           they disappear
will give the law according               to which the transparency                       of   the
atmosphere        decreases at different distances.                       If    you wish to
compare the transparency of the atmosphere              on two days, or
in two different      places,      two circles will be sufficient for the
experiment.
     According      to these principles,           M.   dc Saussure caused to be
prepared a piece of white linen cloth eight feet square.   In
the middle of this square he sewed a perfect circle, two feet
in diameter, of beautiful black wool                    ;    around this circle he
left a white ring two feet in breadth, and the                                   rest    of the
square     was    covered     with       pale green.            In       the like manner,
and of the fame          materials,           he    prepared             another        square;
which      was, however, equal                to only         ,*T   of    the    size    of    the
former,     so   that each fide of       it   was   8   inches      ;     the black circle
in the middle        was two inches in                diameter, and the white
space around the circle was               1   inches also.
     If   two squares of this kind be suspended vertically and
parallel to each other,           so   that they may be both illuminated
in   an equal degree        by   the sun   ;    and     if   the atmosphere,              at the
moment when the experiment                     is   made, be perfectly transpa
rent, the circle of the large square, which  twelve times the       is
size of the other, must be seen at twelve times the distance.
In M.      de Saussure's experiments the small                       circle disappeared
at the distance      of 314      feet, and the large one at the distance
of 3588     feet, whereas        it    mould have disappeared at the dis
tance     of 3768. The      atmosphere,             therefore,       was not perfectly
                                                                                transparent.

transparent.         This arose from the thin vapours                which    at
that time were floating in it.
     It  is  of   great importance to ascertain the laws according
to which         the distinctness    of the visibility of an object de
creases,     either when the transparency of the medium through
which the object is viewed is lessened, or when the thickness
of the     stratum    of the medium is increased.            Lambert, in his
Photometry, has given an account of many ingenious experi
ments which           he made     on the decrease of the quantity             of
light, by its propagation through                  a medium        imperfectly
transparent        ; but  M.   de Saussure      is the   first who has con
sidered the decrease        of the   distinctness    with which an object
 is  seen   through such a medium at different distances.

      the Observatory.
  B EING permitted for             the tenth time to entertain the pub
  lic with    the progress    of  a science which has engaged my at
  tention fifty years,      I am happy in being able             to announce
  things still more interesting than on the last occasion               ;  and,
  in the first place, the conclusion of that grand operation the
  measurement        of  the earth, or     of  9^ degrees     of the meridian
  from Dunkirk to Barcelona.
       About    the middle    of January, Delambre, impatient            to be
  gin his fatiguing labours, proceeded, notwithstanding the cold
  and the rain, to prepare a base from Lieursaint                to Melun   ; to
   complete the wooden pyramids, which were seventy feet in
   height, and to measure the angles.
       On the 24th of February          he had already finished seven sta
   tions for the angles at the         base :   three men had been em
   ployed for fix weeks to cut down and remove from the high
                                                                            way

way six or seven hundred trees which interrupted the view                                of
the signals.
     On   the 17th     of April       he set out to measure the base from
Melun      to Lieursaint;       a   laborious operation, to which              so    much
attention was paid that, though                    assisted      by seven persons,
they measured only 180 toises                a day.
     On   the 3d      of June   the measurement             of   the base      of    three
leagues,      6075 toises, was finished at Lieursaint.
     On   the 30th      of June C. Delambre             set    out to measure the
base    of Perpignan, which             was terminated by the middle of
September.         At    the sanie time       C. Mechain            finished his tri
angles between         Rodez and Carcaffone, after being exposed
to illness,     impediments,          and   delays     of     every kind.           Being
more unfortunate, and               less robust   than his colleague,          his zeal
served only to torment him the more.
     On   the 17th     of November they            at length arrived at Paris,
after finishing their calculations, from which it appeared that
the two bases perfectly agreed.                   Thus this        immense          enter
prise   of   a new measurement            of the   earth, begun in the month
of June       1792,    by our two ablest astronomers,                    is at length
terminated ; and we fliall soon have                      the     results     so    much
wanted, for the size and figure of the earth, and perhaps for
its irregularities.       These        two astronomers           mean     also to de
termine again the latitude of Paris, which                          I   had    fixed      at
480 50' 15" three years ago, from two hundred observations,
made with an astronomical circle, for which we are indebted
to   C. Borda,        by diminishing        the    refraction of Bradly one
second, and this is all the uncertainty that remains.
     The grand labour of determining                  the position       of   the stars,
begun in 1789, has been carried to 47,000; and there re
mains only 2000 to complete the tour of the heavens                                 as   far
as the lower tropic.            By taking two         degrees beyond           it,   there
will    be 50,000.       C. Lefrancais        proposes to finish this labour
next winter.          Comets are at present the only part of astro
nomy in which little progress has been made                       j     but   it   is   now

about to engage the attention of our astronomers.                    I was de
sirous of preparing for them the only assistance which was
wanting, by giving them the positions of the stars in every
part of the heavens.          They will     never be able to observe co
mets without being obliged to have recourse                   to our 50,000
stars, and without being certain            of finding    there every     thing
they could wish       :  I know this by the experience               of  several
years.
    But   detractors     will  never be wanting to every             great and
important work        ;  they will     fay   it would    be much better to
have fewer stars, and to have their positions               ascertained    with
more accuracy.          They   are however mistaken;            it is the great
number of      stars  that supplies the data requisite for this labour:
a greater    precision is     useless   at present,    and   will   be so for a
long time.       Comets are never observed nearer than 30 se
conds, and yet they with to have the positions of the stars to
one second ; this is an evident absurdity, and a manifest im
possibility.     We     have then done every thing that was neces
sary and possible to be done ; and             I consider myself happy        in
having terminated my career, by procuring for astronomy                        a
monument which, on account of its magnitude, might have
 been thought impossible.            To   ssiew   the utility of C. Lefran-
 cais' labour, it will be sufficient to say, that in          a  zone of three
 hours, having two degrees of breadth, there were thirty new
 starsof the fifth and sixth, and between the sixth and the seventh
magnitudes, yet no more than three of them were known.
On    the 10th     of December       1789,    of  one hundred stars, thir
 teen   of which    were   of  the    sixth magnitude,       there was only
 one known     :  the other twelve are new to us.            This    is enough
to prove    how far we were from being acquainted with the
starry heavens,       and from knowing how many stars were vi
sible to the naked eye.        For that     reason   I  was induced to em-
                                                                                 '
ploy myself in this labour         as soon as      I was  able to procure      a
good instrument.          M.   Herschel has also undertaken a review
of the   heavens     with his twenty-feet          telescope,    but only for
the purpose of finding nebulæ, or objects difficult lo be seenl
                                                                            Our

Our labour      is more important, since         it gives the^xact      pofitiort
of all the   stars  which astronomers          may have occasion to use.
Herschel observes only things invisible, and astronomers                     have
need   of sensible objects that are always present to their view.
    We may       therefore    say   of C. Lefrancais, what Virgil             said
of Palinurus      : Sydcra cuncta notat tacito labentia           cœlo ;  for he
has really done what Palinurus never did.                  C. Lefrancais      has
already reduced 6000, and he promises 40CO for the present
year,   though       each    requires    thirty-fix    operations.       In    the
month of September            I  caused to be erected        in the Military
School     a   new       meridian      telescope     by Lenoir, with a
large object-glass by Caroche:              it is better placed        than the
former   ; the supports       have no connection         with    the roof, and
the instrument is        less subject   to vary by the changes          of  tem
perament.      With this instrument           we shall continue to deter
mine the right ascension of the principal stars of all our zones
of fifty thousand.
    The theory of      physical astronomy has also had a remarkable
epoch this year,          C. Laplace, to whom we are indebted for
an explanation        of   the acceleration of the moon, has found
that the apogeum and node have likewise secular equations;
and this noble discovery has been confirmed by a great num
ber of observations.         It would be useful to confirm it still far
ther, by the observations           of the middle ages,       of which      there
 arc a few.     The manuscript of Ibn-Iunis,              an Arabian      of  the
tenth century, contains valuable observations                :  the original is
 at Leyden,      and    we    have made fruitless efforts          to obtain     a
 copy of it.      C. Causiin,      one  of our    professors   of Arabic, of
 fered to go to Leyden and copy the observations                  ;  but  I  have
 found a copy among the manuscripts of                  J . Delisle, my pre
decessor   in  the College de France,          and    I hope we shall soon
have the results       of these valuable     observations.
    On the    19th    of March, the Institute         proposed,     as the sub
ject of  a prize, a comparison         of 500 observations of the moon,
with the    tables to determine better             the 23 equations       which
 we employ at present for the moon's motion                  j and    I  already
                                                                            know

 that subject.         Our prize will       serve to   terminate and render
  public     that   important      labour     which,    united to Laplace's
 theory, will bring the moon's tables,                and the calculation      of
 the longitude,          to a new degree        of precision.      If  errors  of
 three    myrametres (seven leagues) were formerly committed
 at sea   through the fault of the tables, they will soon be re
 duced to two or three.
     C.   Messier, who continues to search for comets, discovered
 one on the       1 2th   of April   1 798,   towards the Pleiades ; it was
 small, and without any tail, but of considerable brilliancy                 :  it
 could not be distinguished by the naked eye.                     It forms the
 twenty-first which C. Messier has discovered                     since    1758,
 and    the    forty-first    he has     observed.     The number of the
 comets now known is 88, according to the catalogue                       in my
 astronomyv         Dr. Burckhardt,         an able astronomer       of Gotha,
 who had been some months at Paris, lost no time to calcu
 late the orbit       of this comet, which          he did in two days,          a
 circumstance         very    extraordinary.        I   have    published      C.
 Messier's observations,           which Dr. Burckhardt          reduced     and
 calculated by employing              several positions    of  the new stare
 furnished by       C. Lefrancais, my nephew.              This comet was
 almost     as remote      from us    as the   fun, and its distance varied
little for a month.            It  ceased   to be visible after the 24th       of
May.        I  had traced out its course on pasteboard              for my au
ditors,     as  I   generally do, and any one could there fee its
distance and situation for each day.               C. Bouvard, at the ob
servatory,      made      also various observations,        which we shall
publish with those of C. Messier, until they appear more at
large in the Memoirs           of the National Institute, with          a  chart
of its    course,     as   C. Messier always      gave in the Memoirs          of
the    ci-devant       Academy.         Dr. Olbers     at Bremen       observed
it   also   as soon       as he was      informed     of it by   the   Journal
de   Paris.
    But   before this real comet, Paris resounded             with the report
pf    a pretended        comet.      On the 16th of January             a new
      Voi. Ill,                          C  c                            comet

^86                tiijhry os    Astronomy    for i?9$.
comet was announced on the Pont-Neuf, and many people
were frightened.        It  however turned out to be only Venus,
which was      seen during the open dav over the Luxembourg, at
a  time when 20,000 persons assembled to fee General Bona-»
parte had their eyes directed towards that quarter.                  With
proper attention, Vcnusmight be            seen  in the likemannerevery
19 months; but few people have time or opportunity to make
such observations.        On this    occasion the terror was singular.
A   piece called the Comet, or the         End of the World, was        re
presented at the Vaudeville.           Ruggicri exhibited an artificial
comet at the Lyceum           : it had   a  great resemblance       to the
beautiful     comet of 1744,       which     I  recollect to have     seen*
and    which    was the most astonishing os that century.-
   On the 6th         of December        1798,      in the evening,      C.
Bouvard      discovered     a small   comet in the constellation of
Hercules.        This makes the 89th. It was observed till the
tith, when it disappeared in Aquarius. It moved at the
rate of eighteen degrees per dav.             Though it appeared only
five days,    we have,     therefore, sufficient data to calculate its
orbit.     It  was seen at Bremen by Dr". Olbere.
    On the 21st of November a comic opera, called the Astro
nomer,      was represented at the theatre in the Rue Feydtain
It   is founded on a circumstance similar to that of the Total
Eclipse ; the first idea of which seems to have been borrowed
from Ltts Memoires Tuns.             It exhibits an old simpleton de
ceived while he pretends to observe a comet.
    On the 18th of January,            C. Dangos,       at Tarbes,    saw a
 comet pass over the fun like a black spot.                 This new and
 singular observation        may be useful        when we become ac
quainted with a great number of comets                ; but we are totally
 ignorant of the course of the one which was              seen that day on
 the fun's disk.
     An important and        celebrated   voyage has given new hopes
 to astronomy and geography.               On    the 16th    of March   go
 vernment expressed a desire of having select astronomers               and
 instruments for a secret expedition.              We    soon learned that

t could recommend only citizens Nouet,                           Gtuenot,           and    Me-
chain the       son.     They gladly embarked in this noble enter-
prize, and      set   out on the 24th of April. On the iothofMay
they sailed from Toulon, landed in Egypt on the 2d of                                     July ;
and I have no doubt that this voyage will be useful to geography,
and even astronomy. I have written to all the astronomers of
Europe to request them to co-operate, by corresponding ob
servations,    with those which will             be made by the astronomers
of that expedition.
   Young Bernier, of Montauban, was                          desirous        of sharing in
the voyage, but we applied for him too late.                             I   recommend
ed to the attention          of our     astronomers,          the level       of    the    Me
diterranean and the Red Sea, in which it has been often said
there is    a great     difference,       but    I   do not believe           it.   I      have,
written to Spain to procure information in regard to that of the
South Sea and the Gulph of Mexico, at the Isthmus                                             of   1
Panama, respecting                which   the        like difficulties            have    been,
started.
  The      observatory       of Gotha       is   the most beautiful and most
useful in Germany.               The duke    has expended             on     it   more than
200,000       livres.        No    prince or king in the present century
has followed his example.                 M. von Zach,                 the director           of
the observatory,        is   one   of   the most celebrated              astronomers          in
Europe.     I    had long wistied to visit and be acquainted with
the only monument                 of astronomy which            I        had not seen,
after the example        of Halley, who went from England                            to   Den
mark in 1679, to         see the observatory of Hevelius, to                        converse
with him,      and     examine the accuracy of his                    observations.          (
have found that         M. von Zach can                observe the polar star to                a,
second,    instead      of   a   hundred seconds, which we had of un
certainty.      Several       German astronomers, being informed of
this design, assembled there also.                     Our    conferences           served to
increase our emulation.      brought back 1200 ascensions

 sent to M. von Zach, in an important work he is about to
 publish on astronomy, in two volumes octavo, and of which
 two thirds are already printed.
     M. Bode brought from Berlin drawings of his thirteenth
 chart of the starry heavens.          There will be twenty in the
 whole; and this collection, of the utmost value to astrono
 mers, will contain 13,000 stars, or 8000 more than ever
were represented before.         He   has reduced 3000    of Lacaille's
 stars, and has observed 1500 himself to fill up vacancies; C.
 Lefraneais supplied him with the rest.                There will be
 found      in  it the   2000    nebulae    of Herschel,      and   from
 five to fix hundred double stars        of that  celebrated    astrono
mer.      We    have formed two new constellations, the Press           of
 Guttemberg, and Mongolsier's Balloon.
    M. Wurm       came to meet us from Wirtemberg,         the distance
of hundred leagues. The duke of Wirtemberg gave him a
     a
gratuity of 800 livres. He allured me that he would still col
late the new stereotype tables       of C. Firmin Diciot, in order
that this undertaking, which          must  ensure correctness to our
calculations for more than          a  century, may be rendered         as
perfect and useful as poslible.
    Messrs.    Klugel, Gilbert    and Pistor, came from        Halle,    a
celebrated     university in the king of Prussia's dominions,         and
M.     Schaubach     from Meinungcn.         M. Scyfler, of Gottin-
gen,     promised    us  some    observations   and   calculations,     of
which      we   are in want.      M. Kohler brought with him             a
new pholometer to measure the light of the stars, and               a re
flecting felenostatc,    which is   a very ingenious machine.         M.
Feer, of Zurich, brought        a chart of the Rinthal, constructed
from observations       with   a sextant.     All these philosophers
agreed     to recommend the       new system of measures, and to
employ the mean time and decimal reckoning in their cal
culations.       M.  SeytTert,  of Dresden,   gave me a stop watch,
with    the hour plate divided according to the decimal method
which was executed by himself.            We  w ent to the   top  of  the

will soon be improved by the            use  of  these   instruments, which
M.    von Zach has recommended and made better known,                        •
    This    useful   congress     would perhaps have been more nu
merous      ; but  M. Vega wrote        to me from Austria, that he was
not able to obtain permission to meet us at Gotha ; and,
what is still worse, he was obliged to fend my letter, and
 his own answer,          to   the minister     for his inspection.         The
king of       Prussia,   on the     other hand, made          an    addition of.
 ] 200   livres to the allowance of his astronomer             on account of
 this journey.        The    astronomer    of Gottingen,       though a sub
ject of    the king    of England, experienced no difficulty.
    An English Journal had hinted to the duke of Gotha,
 that a French astronomer might perhaps be employed with
 other revolutions than those of the heavenly bodies                    ;  but  I
 did not find that this suggestion diminislied in the least the
 favourable reception           I had been taught to expect.              We   at
 last separated,       after   being fully convinced of the utility of
 such conferences,        and with a resolution         of renewing them       as

390                Experiments an Vibrating Surfaces,
fore, were     so  much the more valuable ; but,"            as far as  I  know,
few besides himself have employed their attention on this
subject, and perhaps             because    it  requires    long    practice to
perform experiments of this nature,                  so as to   make progress
in    a branch       of  science    hitherto uncultivated.          But,     until
these experiments (hall more             engage the attention         of philo
sophers,     we    cannot expect that the subject will be much
illustrated; and therefore I conceive it may be of some utility
if I   here give a short account         of  the method      of making expe
riments on vibrating surfaces, which                I   hope will enable any
one to repeat them with facility.
    I  have for some time past turned             my attention to such ex
periments, and I flatter myself that I have made improver
ments in regard to those which Dr. Chladni announced in
his New Theory           of Sound.       By my experiments I          was con
ducted to many rules, a             knowledge of which will            render    it
very    easy to repeat these        experiments.      I  made them accord
ing    to the instructions         given by Dr. Chladni in the work
above mentioned, which appears to me, however, to be rather
too short.
    The vibration          figures   arise, it is well known, because
during the movement             of a surface, which is connected with
the sensation      of sound in our organs of hearing, some parts
of the    surface are at rest, -and others in motion.               If the    sur
face be strewed over with bodies               easily put in motion,         such
for example        as sand,      these during     the vibration remain on
the parts at rest, and are thrown               from the parts in motion.
The form of          the parts at rest, which         will  be shewn by the
sand that remains unmoved,                and which       in general     is sym
metric, is called         a vibration figure.       To produce       such a fi
gure, nothing is necessary but to know the method of bring
ing that part of the surface which you wish not to vibrate
into    a state   of  rest, and    of putting in motion that which you
wisti to vibrate      : on this depends the whole expertness of pro
ducing vibration figures.
    The   surfaces fittest      for being made to          vibratej are     panes,
                                                                                Pf

   of glass, though        the experiments will succeed equally well
   with plates of metal, or pieces of board, of a line or two in
   thickness.      One might now believe            that to produce fig. a.
   (Sec Plate   VIII.)     it would be necessary to damp, in particular,
   every point    of  the part to be kept at reft, viz. the two concen
   tric circles and the diameter, and to put in motion every part
  intended to be made to vibrate.              This, however, is not the
  cafe; for you need damp only the points a and b, and cause to
  vibrate one part c at the edge of the plate, for the movement
  is soon communicated to the other parts which you wish to
  vibrate, and the required figure will in this manner be pro
  duced.      How      and    why the movement takes place in this
  manner,      and. in no other,        is difficult to be explained,    and
  would     lead me too far, as       I  wish merely to give a few rules
  for making the experiments.
      The damping may           be best effected    by laying hold of the
  place to be damped         between two figures,       or by supporting it
 only by one singer.          This will    be comprehended more clearly
  by   turning to sig. 6. where the           hand is represented in that
 position necessary to hold the plate. In order to produce fig. 3.
 you must hold the plate horizontally, placing the thumb
 above at a, with the second singer diredtly below             it; and, be
 sides this, you must support           the point b on the under side     of
 the plate.      Is  you then rub the bow         of  a violin against  the
 plate at c, you      will   produce on the glass the figure      which   is
 delineated fig.     3. When       the point to be supported      or damp
 ed lies too near the centre of the plate, you may rest it on a
 cork, not too broad at the end, in contact with the glass, in
order to supply the place of the finger.             It is convenient also,
when you wish to damp several points at the circumference
of the glass, to place your thumb on the cork, and- use the
rest   of your    fingers for touching the parts which you wisti to
keep at rest.       For example, if you wish to produce fig. 4, on
an elliptic plate, the larger axis of which is to the lesser as 4
to 3, you must place the cork under the centre c of the plate;
put your thumb upon this point,                and then damp the two
                                      C   c 4                        points

  points of the edge p and q, as may be               seen   fig. 5. and make
   the plate to vibrate by rubbing the violin bow against it at r.
   There is still another convenient method of damping several
¦points      at the edge when you employ large                 plates.      Fig.  I.
   represents a strong square bit       of  metal    ab,    a   line in circum
   ference,    which is screwed to the edge of a table, or made fast
   in any other manner ; and a notch about as broad as the edge
   of the   plate is cut into one fide      of it with     a   file.   You then
   hold the plate, resting against          this bit of metal         by two or
   more finger3 when requisite, as at c and d ; by which means
   the edge of the plate will be damped in three points d, c, e%
   and in this manner, by putting the plate in vibration at_/i
   you can produce fig. 10.          In  cafes   of necessity you may. use
   the edge of    a table instead   of  the  bit of metal ; but it does not
   answer the purpose so well.
        To produce the vibration at any required place, a common
   violin bow rubbed with resin is the most proper instrument
    to be employed.       The hair     must not be too flack,           because    it
    is sometimes     necessary to press pretty         hard on the plate, in
 '
    order to produce the tone sooner.
        When you     wish to produce any particular figure, you must
    first form it In idea upon the plate, in order that you may be
    able to determine where        a  line at   rest  and where a vibrating
    part will occur.      The greatest     rest  will always       be where two
    or more lines at rest intersect         each other ; and such places
    must, in particular, be damped.             For example, in         fig. 7. you
    must clamp the part n, and stroke with the bow in/>. Fig. 11.
    may be produced with no less ease, if you hold the plate
    at r, and stroke with the bow           at/.     The   strongest vibration
    seems always to be in that part         of the   edge   which is bounded
    by a curve: for example, in fig. 8. and fig. 9. at n. To
    produce these figures, therefore, you must rub with the bow
    at n, and not at   r.
        You must, however, damp not only                 those points where
    two lines intersect each other, but endeavour                  to support      at
'
    least one which       is suited    to that figure and            to no othqr.
                                                                                 For

For       example,       when you support a and            b   (Jig. 2.),   and rub
with      the bow in c, sig. 7. also may be produced, because these
figures have both these points at rest.                   To produce     sig. 2.   you
support with one finger the part                 e, and rub with the bow in c;
and       in this manner         sig. 7. cannot be produced, because it has
not the point        e   at rest. One    of   the greatest difficulties in produ
cing the figures is to determine before hand the vibrating and
resting points which belong to a certain figure and to no
other.
   Hence it happens                 that when one is not able to support
those points which                distinguish       one figure from another,         if
the violin bow be rubbed against the plate, several hollow
tones are heard without the sand forming itself as expected.
One must therefore acquire by experience a readiness in being
able to search out, among these tones, that which belongs to
the required figure, and to produce it on the plate by rubbing
the bow against it.   But it requires great practice to deter
mine the figure previously from the tone, or to search out,
among various tones, that which belongs to the figure, and
to know how to make the plate vibrate in such a manner
that this tone alone, and not another, (hall be heard.                              For
this purpose             you must first listen, and then alter the mode              of
rubbing       ;   and as soon as the right tone is produced, you must
rub somewhat harder with the violin bow, by pressing it more
strongly against the edge of the plate. The latter must be
done        in particular in regard to high tones.                 As   soon as you
 have       acquired sufficient expertness              in this respect,    you can,
 as   I   myself have experienced,              determine before hand, with a
 considerabledegree of certainty, the figures to be produced,
 and even the most difficult.  This practice will be attended
 with the greatest advantage,                 if,
                                  when you rub the bow against
 the plate for the first time in order to produce figure, you        a
 continue the rubbing that the tone may be imprinted in the
 memory, and    you try, after some time, to produce the fame
                         It if

 forget what parts                of the plate,       and in what manner you
                                                                            damped;

 damped ; and you may mark these points by making a scratch
on the plate with              a   bit of flint.
     When the               plate has acquired the proper vibration,                              you
must endeavour                to keep          it in that    state       for some seconds,
which can            be best done by rubbing the bow several times                                  in
succeflion.             By    these means the sand                 will    be formed much
more accurately.
     Any      sort     of   glass may be employed for these experiments,
provided       its surface be smooth ; otherwise                          the sand         will fall
into the hollow               parts,       or be thrown         about in an irregular
manner.              The     surface      of   the common green glass                     is,   how
ever, not very              smooth, and often full of cavities.                            The     fi
gures, therefore, formed upon                      it    are not    so    clear and accurate
as those formed upon smooth white glass,                             which        is   the kind    I
employ.
     When          there     are several places            on the plate where there
are stripes        in the    mass    of    the glass, they hurt the experiments,
especially         in producing those figures where                        a   vibrating part
falls upon several              of     these stripes.        In     that cafe the figures
are not       so   symmetric         as   on other plates.          I      have  in my pos-
seslion,      for example,           a     circular plate of glass             20 inches in
diameter, on which                 I   was       never    able to produce              a    perfect
circle   on other plates, the circle always appearing like
         as                                                                                         a
very long ellipse. This plate contains    great many of the        a
above-mentioned stripes.   The flaws and knots which occur,
in   glass are not very hurtful.
     Common            glass plates,           when cut with           a    stone,      are very
sharp on the edge,                 and would soon             destroy the hair              of the
violin bow         :   on this account the edge must be rendered some
what smooth.                For that       purpose  I     employ       a   file or    a   piece    of
coarse hard free stone.                It   is   of no   great consequence,               accord
ing to my observations,                   whether the edges be very smooth or
roughly ground,               provided         they be     in   such      a   state    as not to
injure the         hair of    the bow.
     You   must endeavour                 to procure such plates as are pretty
equal    in   thickness.           It     may be said, in general, that                    a    plate
                                                                                                 the

the thinner it is will be       so much the fitter for these experi
ments, though in this respect there is a certain minimum.
In    small plates, such as those that arc circular, and not above
fix inches in diameter, the observation              is general ; but in
larger plates too great thinness is prejudicial. Besides, it will
be found that very thin glass is commonly very uneven, and,
as has been already said, must therefore            be unfit for the ex
periments.         If you  have a plate,    however, which       is on one
side thicker than on the other, you must endeavour              to produce
 the figure on the plate in such       a  manner that you can rub the
 violin bow      against the thinnest part.
     In   the last place, in practising the experiments, you must
 have glass plates     of different sizes,  such, for example, as circu
 lar ones of from four to twelve inches in diameter               :   for, on
 a small one      of four inches in diameter, you cannot produce
 three concentric circles with two or more diameters; and on
 a larger, for example,       of twelve inches    of diameter, you can
 not    so easily  produce a single     circle as on a circular plate of
 three inches diameter.         Sometimes it is difficult to make the
  figure appear on        a plate,  while on another it is very easy.
  Sometimes it appears only when you hold the plate in a cer
  tain place.      These are phenomena which arise partly from the
  unlike thickness of the       glass, and partly from the stripes and
  flaws in it.
      You   must not employ too fine sand, but rather that              which
  is coarser   5  because the former is easier thrown         from the vi
  brating parts, while the latter adheres            better   to them.       It
  must be     of   such a nature that when you incline              the glass-
  plate it may readily roll      off;  because,   in that  case,     it will be
  easily thrown from the vibrating parts.             It will  be   of advan
   tage that it be mixed with fine dust, which sliews peculiar
   phenomena during the experiments, as it collects itself at one
   place of the vibrating part.
       The plate     must be equally bestrewed        with   sand,     and not
    too thick,   as the  lines will then be exceedingly fine, and the
   figures will acquire a better defined appearance.
                                                                          Those

     Those who wish to exercise themselves in these experiments
may try to produce the figures spoken of by Dr. Chladni, in
his before-mentioned work, following his directions, and the
rules      here     given  :  but they must not be discouraged if the
figures are not produced on the first trials ; for, in general, to
learn the method of making the experiments requires some
time.
     The     above rules contain some general laws which vibrating
surfaces        follow  ;  but   as   my object here was to give only a
short view       of the manner in which experiments mult be made,
I   (hall    not enter into a further explanation of these laws, as I

TO THE EDITOR OF                  THE PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE,
        SIR,
 JN      the last edition      of Dr. Smyth's      Treatise  on the effects of
nitrous vapour in preventing and destroying contagion,                     I was
not     a  little surprised to find, at page 221, the following passage,
in    a  letter to Dr. Percival, dated August 1, 1796:
     "    Whether this will apply          to the small-pox,      I  cannot   say
 <*  from my own experience;             butl have been told by Dr. Rollo
 " surgeon to the         artillery, and Mr. Cruickshank professor- royal
 " of chemistry to          the academy,     that it destroys the miasma of
"    small-pox;        and that,    of two quantities of matter       taken for
 "   the purpose       of inoculation,    one was exposed to the nitrous
 "   vapour, the other not          :  the persons    inoculated      with   the
                                                                          "first

 *' first were not seized With the disease, whilst the inoculation
 "   took the usual effect when performed with the second."
     In     the conversation         which Dr. Rollo        and myself had        with
 Dr. Smyth, about the different methods of destroying conta
 gion, I gave it as my opinion, that the ox. muriatic acid, in
 the form of gas, deserved the preference, for the following
 reasons       :— 1st, From        its being a permanently elastic fluid, it
 was much more diffusible than the vapour of nitrous acid —
 and, 2ndly, from the facility                with which it          destroyed      the
 contagion of {mall-pox in the most concentrated state,                         I  had
 little doubt of its efficacy in eradicating contagions in gene
 ral.       I then mentioned the experiments with small-pox mat
 ter, which are related in the first edition of Dr. Rollo's Trea
 tise on Diabetes*.             How     the Doctor could confound this              aas
 with the vapour of nitrous acid, with which at that time                              I
 had made no trials, it is difficult to conceive                ; but however this
 may be, it is necessary the mistake                should    be corrected     :   for,
 although it be poffible,and even probable, that nitrous vapour
 may destroy the contagion of small-pox, yet it should never
 be admitted as a fact until proper and satisfactory                    experiments
 have been made.               In   the fame conversation          I mentioned      the
 method now employed                 at Woolwich for fumigating with                the
 sulphurous          acid, and which         we supposed had          some    advan
 tages over that usually practised.                  It consists in mixing inti
 mately two or three parts of pulverised sulphur with one                             of
 nitre    ;   a certain quantity        of this mixture, proportioned          to the
 size    of     the apartment,        is to be introduced into an iron pot,
      " Mr.     Cruicksticmk,   in March 1795, took two portions of recent small
pox matter from the same person, and exposed             one portion to this gas    (the
ox.mur. acid gas) for         a few minutes,   and with it inoculated    the left arms
of three drummers, while the right arms were inoculated with               some   of the
ether portion.       The   punctures of the left arms had no marks of inflamma
tion, except what simple puncture          produces, and they entirely disappeared
in  a few days.      But  the  right arms took on the variolous action, and in two
of the persons there was          a general  eruption.     This   experiment has been
since   repeated, and with the fame success.          Rollo on the Diabetes Mullilus,

and placed upon some bricks, or wet sand, in the middle of
the floor.  After the people have been removed, and the
windows, &c. closely fliut, the composition is to be                             set   on fire
by a live coal.            During the combustion                 a great quantity              of
sulphurous acid gas,               mixed with sulphuric acid in the                    state   of
vapour, is disengaged,               and    concentrated          to such a degree as
to force its way into the smallest apertures.
     In    the common method               of burning sulphur it            is impossible
to concentrate the sulphurous acid in this manner,                                     as the
combustion          ceases    when the pure air in the room,                           &c. is
nearly consumed; but in this cafe the oxygene is supplied by
the nitre, and, the combustion being carried                               on with great
rapidity, a prodigious quantity of gas, &c. is disengaged in a
very short space of time. — It is true that this mode of fumiga
tion cannot beputin practice while the patients are present: we
doubt much, however,                 if the   same objection is not applicable
to any other,   which shall be completely effectual in every
case ;for, to prevent the generation and spreading of conta
gion, is a very different thing from entirely eradicating                                      it,
after      it   has been     produced, and attached                   to   the clothing,
furniture, &c.
     The     process   for disengaging the oxygenated muriatic acid
gas,      in wards containing   offensive sores and infectious diseases,
is   also extremely simple           :— Four         ounces     of common         salt,   inti
mately mixed with two ounces of pulverised manganese, are
introduced into  cup or small bason to this mixture about
                       a                                    j
two ounces          of water         are first       added,     and    afterwards         three
ounces of the concentrated sulphuric acid in small portions at
atime, each portion beingsufncient to disengage such quantity                    a
of   gas as can be borne             with     ease    by   the patients    in the room          .-
when managed               in this way, the smell of the gas                 is   far from
being offensive,             and its effects in removing putrid                      and dis^
agreeable smells much superior to any other means we have
ever tried.        (See the note,        p.   397.)         We   do not, however,              by
any means deny the efficacy                   of   the nitrous vapour        :    our prin
cipal objection to           it,   arises only from its ready condensation,
                                                                                           and

and the difficulty of diffusing it completely.    But there is one                                       •
circumstance on which      the Doctor appears  to place some reli
ance, the truth of which we very much doubt, and that                                             is,
that, during the disengagement of the vapour of the nitrous
acid,   a   considerable         quantity of pure air,                 or oxygene gas,            is
at the fame time let loose                ;    an opinion         which      is   likewise sup
ported by       Mr. Keir. Now, from the generally                             received theory
respecting the difference between the white and orange-colour
ed vapour, (and            it   is   the last   which      is   almost       uniformly gene
rated in close vessels, or where pure air                             is   excluded,)     a    quite
opposite effect sliould take place, that                        is,   the production of the
white vapour should be accompanied                               by   a    diminution      of the
cxygene gas    the room or apartment.
                      in                                          In order        to satisfy my
 self with regard to this fact,                 I    made several experiments,                   the
 results    of which           were, that, when           a   cup containing          a   mixture
 of   heated nitre and               concentrated sulphuric acid was                       placed
 under      a   glass      jar inverted         over      water,        the air     in the jar,
 after the nitrous vapour had been condensed,                                     was found        to
 have the proportion                 of   its oxygene somewhat diminished,                        the
 difference being nearly             or 31 to 30. This dif
                                           as 93 to     90,
 ference, which could not be perceptible in   large chamber,                a
 having only the usual                      quantity       of nitrous vapour               diffused
                 it it,
 through                  is   but small, and        I    confess much             less   than was
 expected       :         proves,     however, that no oxygene gas                        is   disen
  gaged.        In   these trials the         jar,   after some time, was filled                with
  orange-coloured vapours                  ;   and this never failed to be the case,
  where the heat of the materials, and strength of the sulphuric
  acid, were sufficient to disengage any quantity of nitrous acid.
  In the     distillation of this acid,              it is    true, that     a    little pure air       is
  disengaged towards the end; but this never happens                                      until    the
  bottom of the retort becomes red, and then the acid itself                                            is
  decomposed,              which can            never     take        place in Dr. Smyth's

   XI. Report made to the French National Institute, ly C.
       Guyton an^DARCET, in regard to the Results of the
        Experiments       of C. Clouet,            on the different States             of
       Iron, and the Conversion of it            into   Cast Steel.         From    the
       Journal     des   Mines, No.      XLV.
     JL HE memoir of C. Clouet                    is entitled Results          of Ex
   periments on the different States of Iron.                    He    first treats    of
   the combinations         of iron   and carbon.          A  thirty-second part
   of carbon,        fays he,  is sufficient to convert iron into steel             :   a
   quantity of it equal to a sixth part           of the weight of the iron,
   gives    a steel    more   fusible   and    still   malleable     ;  but beyond
   that term it approaches          to cast-iron, and has no longer suf
   ficient tenacity.        By    increasing    the    dose  of carbon you in
   crease the fusibility,      and it     pastes     at length to the state           of
  grey    cast   iron.
       The particular kind of cast iron resulting from a combi
  nation of iron and glass, is the second object which engages
  the attention        of C. Clouet.        Glass never enters into it but
  in    a  very     small  quantity,     yet   its properties are           changed.
  This iron,         though exceedingly soft under the file, when
  brought only to         a cherry-red      heat, divides        itself under the
  hammer j when poured               into the ingot-mould, shrinks con
  siderably;       and when formed into plates, tempering gives
  them the grain of steel, and renders them more brittle, with
  out giving them more hardness.                      Charcoal      dust added        to
  glass changes        the result, and increases the fusibility;              but the
  dose has a sensible influence on the products.                      From     a thir
 tieth to      a   twentieth    in one part of iron             gives a very hard
 tempered       steel,   which   suffers  itself to be forged at a cherry-
 red heat, and which has all the properties of cast steel.                         By
 employing more carbon, you get only cast iron.
.     The affinity of iron for carbon is so great, that at a high
 degree of temperature it even takes it from carbonic acid.
 This     he proves by the following experiment               : — If you put into
                                                                          a  crucible

                      On the different Jlates    of Iron.                 40I
a crucible iron cut into small pieces, along            with   a  mixture   of
equal parts of carbonat of lime and argil, expose them to
the degree of heat necessary to weld iron, and maintain this
heat for an hour or more, according to the size               of   the cruci
ble   ;  the metal     when poured      into the ingot-mould wilj be
steel   similar to cast steel.
    The oxyds of iron are equally susceptible of                 passing to a
state of soft iron, steel, and cast iron, according              to the pro
portions of carbon employed.             The black oxyd of iron, the
state    of which    seems to be the       most unalterable,         becomes
iron when treated in the crucible with an equal                    volume of
charcoal powder:          by doubling     that quantity you will have
steel, and a progressive        augmentation gives it the characters
of white      and grey cast   iron.    In a word, C. Clouet observed
 the same transitions, and always depending on the respective
 quantities in treating      cast iron and the oxyd of iron, cast iron
 and forged iron, the oxyd         of iron   and iron, the oxyd        of iron
 and steel.      A  fifth part only of    cast  iron is necessary to ren
 der iron steel.       The iron and the oxyd do not unite inti
 mately     ; the   black oxyd mixed with           a half   less   of carbon
 than is necessary for its reduction, gives           a soft  iron, but not
 very tenacious, black and without a granulated fracture.                    A
  sixth part   of  the oxyd brings back common fleel to the state
 of iron, by treating them          together either in the forge or by
 cementation.
     At the    end   of his memoir C. Clouet          gives some observa
  tions on the method of producing            cast steel, and the     furnaces
  proper for that purpose.         He determines        the proportions      of
  the substances      to be fused;    the degree    of heat;      the precau
  tions to be employed in pouring them into the ingot-mould ;
  the method of forging this kind of steel ; the processes to be
  employed for assays, in a common forge, upon three or four
  pounds of matter        ; and the proportions to be given to a re
  verberating furnace to operate at the fame time with four cruci
  bles, containing each from twenty-three to twenty-fix pounds
  of   steel.   He remarks,     that ingredients     of saline glass cannot
     Vol.     Us.                     Dd                                     b«

                        On   the immediate       Conversion
  be employed with advantage             ;  that glass, too fusible, renders
  steel difficult    to be forged      ;   that steel kept a long time in
  fusion, takes up more glass than it ought                 ;  and lastly, that
  the metal must be stirred, and the glass taken carefully away
  before it is poured out, in order that it may not mix itself
  with   the steel.     After giving       a short   view of the observations
  of C. Clouet,          and    the   practical consequences which he
  deduces     from them, it would have remained for us only to
  lay before you some specimens produced by his operations,
  had we not thought it our duty to add the results of the ex
  periments which we made ourselves,                   by following   his pro
  cesses   for the     immediate conversion           of iron into   cast  steel,
  and of which it       is  of importance that we should           describe the
  principal circumstances.
      The members of the Council of Mines having permitted
  us to make use of the forge constructed in their laboratory, we
  put into   a  luted Hessian crucible        6  hectogrammes (1*23 Ib.) of
   the points of horse-stioe nails, and 4 (-81 lb) of a mixture of
   equal   parts   of   the   carbonat of lime            (white marble) and
   burnt clay, from a Hessian            crucible,     all reduced to powder.
   The mixture      was heaped       up to surround the iron fragments
,  on every fide    ;  and   the crucible placed upon its stand           in the
   middle of the furnace, the heat of which was urged by three
   blasts.    In our first trial we found, after about an hour and
   a half,   that the matter was fused             ;  but the crucible having
   burst, we were prevented          from pouring it out. On repeating
   the operation at the same forge, and                 in the same manner,
   we obtained an ingot         ;  a portion     of which      we  now submit
   to the inspection      of  the Class.        It forms    a square  bar, each
   face   of which    is from 26 to 27 millimetres             (about one inch
   English):
      The frequent         and    almost unavoidable accidents which
   crucibles experience by being exposed to the blast of bellows,
   made us think it a point of importance to ascertain whether
   the operation would succeed equally well in a reverberating
   furnace or any other wind furnace, as                 C. Clouet announces.
                                                                             We

                               of Iron      into    Cafl   Steel.                        403
  We    first employed        a  Macquer's furnace in one of the labora
 tories    of    the Polytechnic School.                  Though       its state    of   de
  rangement did not give us reason to hope for Uie whole effect
 of    the     principles      of    its   construction,          a pyrometric        piece
 placed in a separate crucible indicated that the heat had been
 carried to 151 degrees.                 The crucible did not appear to be
 either broken or cracked                 ;  yet     the    fusion was incomplete,
 and even a portion           of   the iron remained uncovered                  above the
 portion of the vitreous mass, without it being possible to dis
 cover the cause.
     We then         resolved to repeat           the    experiment at       a  founder's
 furnace     ;    and   C. Lecour,          asl'ayer   of the mint, was            so kind
 as   to permit us to operate with that in his laboratory.                              Our
 success exceeded            what we expected,                considering the size         of
the furnace.            A particular         description       of this operation         ap
 peared      to us the best means                  of satisfying the demand of
 government,           f nee    it tends        to establish the possibility of a
manufactory of this kind on a large scale, and to                              give from
observation the basis of this new art.
    We repaired to the laboratory of C. Lecour in                              the   mint,
with our colleague Vauquelin,                      who     assisted   us in our experi
ments. The wind furnace is constructed                            of brick.     The    fire
place a is a square cavity               of   25 centimetres (9/ 23 inches) on
each     internal face, 45 centimetres (i6-62 inches) in height,
terminated at the bottom by                   a   grate b    of  seven square bars 27
millimetres (one inch) in thickness, and raised 25 centimetres
 (9/23 inches) above the bottom of theasti-holc.                             The mouth
has an iron cover c, with hinges inclined about 25 degrees (fee
Plate    IX    )  from   a perpendicular. The tunnel                 dJ,   by which the
furnace is terminated, is built of bricks also.                          It commences
above the aperture           of   the cover, and first forms a square, each
face   of which internally            is equal to 25 centimetres; but it be
comes narrower as it ascends, so that each face at the extre
mity is     a   fifth  less.     This tunnel           rises,    inclined against the
wall,     to     the height         of   13
                                                 decimetres        (about four feet.)
It  is there connected with               a large       chimney raised about 15
                                          D    d  2,                              metrea

   404                  Experiments     on the immediate
   metres     (or 45 feet), the excess in the width of which is
   closed by a trap e moving on hinges when the furnace \»
   at work.       We    had previously put into a Hessian crucible           15
   centimetres (about 51 inches) in height, and 8 in diameter,
   367 grammes (6914 grains) of small iron nails, and 245
   grammes (4616 grains) of a mixture of carbonat of lime and
   burnt clay. This crucible was placed on its stand in the
                                                           *
  middle of the furnace.
      At one of      the corners    of the bottom     was placed     a small
  crucible of kaolin with           its  cover, and containing two of
  Wedgewood's          pyrometrical pieces, taken from two different
  boxes.       We readily     foresaw that in this position they would
  not receive the fame degree of heat as the crucible placed in the
  centre ; but it was a mode of estimation not to be neglected.
  The    fire   was kindled about half an hour after ten, and
  urged     at first very    slowly.     At one o'clock    we judged the
  fusion to be complete,            took away the vitreous part, and
  poured     the   matter into the ingot-mould.            A   part   of the
  matter remained fixed in the crucible,               because   too much
  time was employed in removing the last portions of the glass,
  and because perhaps a quarter of an hour more heat would .
  have been necessary;         but the moulded portion, by its form
 and grain, left no doubt          of proper fusion, and of its       perfect
 conversion into steel.          The pyrometric pieces, placed         at the
 corner of the furnace, gave one 136 degrees, and the other
 140; from which it may be inferred, that the matter in the
 large crucible was exposed to a heat           of about   150 degrees.
     "  Cast steel,"     fays Ferret in his     Memoir which       obtained
 the prize from the Society           of Arts   at Geneva,     " is judged
by most smiths intractable           ;  but it is still possible to over
come it by attention and address."               That of C. Clouet        re
quires the fame precautions, which depend on its peculiar
nature; and it affords a proof that it may be forged, and that
in this    state,   even though its grain be not rendered          finer by
tempering,        it will   bear a comparison      with  the English     cast
steel.     We     subjected    also to trial, by forging,    a small piece
                                                                  obtained

                       Conversion    of Iron   into Steel.                    403
obtained by fusion in         a  wind furnace      : the grain    of    its frac
ture, after having been forged, fully confirmed the opinion
which we formed of it when cast.
   The ingots      almost      always exhibit on their fracture small
cavities, which it might be supposed would                   produce faults
in   the   forging   ;   but   as  they are clear       and   free     from all
foreign matter, they form no obstacle to the union of all the
parts.     Resides, it    will  be easy to prevent this accident by a
flower cooling in the ingot mould, which will naturally take
place    in operating upon larger masses.                We ought not            to
omit that this steel, when forged into bars, is exadtly in that
state which Rinman indicates as one of the characters of cast
steel.    Its specific     gravity is to that of the finest steel, not
cast,  in the proportion of        7-917 to     779.
    However conclusive these results may be, it appears that
something would still be wanting,               if we did not     at the same
time produce      a specimen      of what      an able hand, accustomed
to   manage the English            cast   steel, can do    with    ours    in the
fabrication of those instruments to which Englisti                  steel    gives
so  much superiority       :  we have the satisfaction        of being able
to exhibit     this proof also of the utility of C. Clouet's dis
covery.
   A   bar of   steel   arising from the      cast made at    the Depot         des
Machines du Conservatoire,           was delivered by      C. Molard        to   C.
Lepetitwalle,     proprietor of the national manufactory of                   steel
razors at the Quinze-vingts,              faubourg Antoine.          He made
of it  three razors, viz. two without any preparation, and one
after having taken away the appercus (the name given to the
small fissures found at the surface              and on the edges).          This
artist declares,    that   "  the latter was manufactured with great
facility,   considering the quality of the metal               ;   that it will
bear comparison         with   those  of   the fine English      steel    named
Marschall and B. Huntzman               ;   and that all the three are ex
cellent for any beard whatever."
   Hitherto     we have      confined ourselves to an examination as
                                     D  d 3                                    the

                     Experiments        on the immediate
406
the   processes    and productions which have more particularly
attracted     the attention     of Government        ; but we cannot ter
minate this report without pointing out, in a few words, the
truths of the theory arising from them.                 It is well known
that iron does not become steel, but by assuming about
CV2013 of its weight of
                                  carbon : here it is furnished only in
the   state  of carbonic acid ; this      acid then is decomposed.        This
is  a very   important phenomenon, which the observation of
C.    Clouet has added to the proofs of the doctrine of the
French chemists. But how is this decomposition effected?                      —
It evidently     results from the eventual        or predisposing     affinity
which     a  portion of   the iron exercises upon the oxygen            of   the
acid, at the fame time that the remainder of the iron tends
to unite itself with       the carbon;       and a concurrence       of   these
attractions      produces     a   result    which   one would not have
expected,      and which would not indeed              have    been  possible
by simple affinity.           Thus in this operation the vitreous
flux is ahvavs seen charged with the oxyd os iron, the pre-
sence    of which     discovers     itself by  a very dark     green colour.
The experiment in which             the iron was not fused, has enabled
us to exhibit to vou        a  proof of it.     Hence it might perhaps
be inferred, that this ind'spenfible oxydation               of  a portion of
the iron occasions in the product             a decrease    of  so much the
more importance,          as iron only of the be          1  quality can be
employed in the operation.              This consideration      made us pay-
attention to the decrease, in order that we might                      at least
give some idea of its piobable limits.                   In the operation
conducted at the wind furnace, the decrease was not altogether
a  twelfth;     in another experiment made at the forge of the
School of Mines,         before C. Vauquelin, in 428 grammes at
iron there was      a loss  onlv of 19 grammes, that is to fav, less
than    a  twentv-second part.           We mav then rest assured that
this loss will be compensated             by the value which the        rest  of
the matter will acquire         ;  and    that, instead of increasing, it
must be uiminished when working                 on  a large scale,    for it is
                                                                      evident

                                    Conversion        of Iron         into Steel.                          407
    evident that it is produced                       chiefly by an accidental scorifica-
    tion,    and         always more in proportion to the surface than to
    the mass.
        It now remains that                     we should still make,                  in   regard to the
    process itself,             a remark which seems proper to shew the su
    periority of it to all those hitherto used for the conversion ot
    iron into steel.                 It     is well known that the great                        difficulty is
.   to make        it    take up the proper dose                           of carbon        ;    below that
    you have soft              steel ;       and above          it,   steel supersaturated            almost
    to the       state    of      cast      iron, and      as     refractory.           Ought not the
    quantity to be determined here                                    by   the concurrence            of    the
    forces   of     the affinity which operate the decomposition                                      of the
    carbonic acid             ?     The      degree    of saturation would                  be then con
    stant,       andproduct always uniform; and
                          the                         may be                                    it
    readily comprehended how much value this condition, which
    we mention only      probable, would add to the new method.
                                       as
       From these reflections, and the facts mentioned in this
    report, we conclude, that the observations                                      of C. Clouet on
    the different             states     of iron      diffuse     a    new light over the man
    ner of treating this metal                   ;    that the immediate conversion                          of
    soft iron        into       cast steel,      without              employing carbon, and                  by
    the decomposition of the carbonic acid,                                  is
                                                                             a      discovery         as   im
    portant for the advancement of the theory of chemical affi
    nities, as       valuable for increasing national industry;
                         it    is
    that,    by    the labours               of C. Clouet,             the processes            of this new
    art are already determined,                         in     such    a   manner       as to leave         no
    doubt of their succeeding                         in   a   large manufactory                 ;   that the
    steel   arising from them, when forged in bars, has all the ex
    ternal characters and intrinsic qualities                                 of the English               cast
    steel   of   the manufactories                 of Huntzman                and Marschall;               that
it     may be used for the same purposes,                                   and    be introduced            in
    competition with                it      into commerce, without fear of any dis
    tinction being made to its prejudice;                                  that   it   is   to be wished,
    in order to hasten the benefits of this discovery-, that govern
    ment would order from 15 to ao myriagrammes to be
    manufactured of this steel, the value of which, at the present

price, would be almost equivalent to the expence                 ;  that en
trusting the management of the first trials to C. Clouet,
would ensure the best success          ;  and lastly, that, in any event,
the free and unreserved communication which C. Clouet has
made      of this  discovery,    entitles him to the gratitude of his
countrymen, and to         a  national reward.
XII.      Extracl of    a Report made by      C.   Pictet, of        Geneva,
     to the Society   for  the Advancement       of   the  Arts    established
     in that City in regard        to   the Steel-Yards      of C. Paul.
     From the Journal des Mines, No.            XLF.
TiHE          place  of inspector of weights and measures, occu
 pied at    Geneva by C. Paul, having given him an opportu
 nity of carefully examining           a great   number of steel-yards,
 he has found reason to be convinced that the greater part of
 these instruments, and         particularly    the   Roman      sicel-vards,
 are constructed       on   bad   principles,   and    seem   to have been
 made bv artists unacquainted with the properties               of  the lever,
 lie    has succeeded in improving these instruments, and                 steel -
 vards in particular.        The latter, in    the common purposes            of
 commerce,        have   two advantages        over balances.         i. That
 their axis of suspension is not loaded with any other weight
 than that of the merchandise, the constant weight of the ap
  paratus itself excepted j while the axis cf the balance, be
  sides the weight of the instrument, sustains a weight double
  to that of the merchandise,            a. The use of the balance re
  quires   a considerable     assortment of weights, which causes a
  proportional increase      in  the price of the apparatus, indepen
  dently of the chances of error which it multiplies, and of the
  time employed in producing an equilibrium,                  i hese motives
  inducl-d C. Paul to employ his thoughts on the means of so
  far improving steel-yards,         that, either in delicate       operations
   o.f the arts,  or in those of the same kind which are often                  so
 'necessary    in the practice of the physical           sciences,   these in
                                                                    struments

                               C. Paul's new Steel-Yard.                                                4.09
struments           might be substituted                    with advantage               for common
balances.           In order            that    I may        better       explain in what the
improvements               of the          steel-yards            submitted to the Society
consist,      it will      be proper to point                      out what were the faults
of   the common ones.
     1. There were none            of them, in which the points of sus
pension        were       exactly in the prolongation of the line of the
divisions of the beam;                          a    circumstance which                       necessarily
changed the relation between                                the     arms       of    the      lever,       the
power and the resistance,                    according as the direction of the
beam was changed                        from a horizontal position. We have
seen steel-yards, in               which            a degree only             of   difference        in the
inclination          of    the      beam            produced the difference of more
than a pound in the result.
     2. When             the shell,            the beam, and weight, are made at
hazard,        a person            who         possesses        a   steel-yard         cannot know
when the instrument is deranged; and even an artist cannot
repair        it,   but    by      repeated           trials,       and with         a   great      loss     of
time.
     3.   The construction of                        the    common             steel-yards,          which
have      a   small and        a   large side, renders                   it   necessary        to invert
them frequently                :   a    laborious operation when these instru
ments are heavy, and which exposes the axes to the danger
of   damage           by   the effect of the shocks which                                that turning
occasions.
     As   these double sides renders                        it   necessary to have               a     beam
very straight, in order that                           it   may be less faulty,                it   readily
bends,        which       is   a   new source of error;                    and, the face which
bears the numbers being narrow in proportion,                                            it   is   difficult
to form on          it    numbers sufficiently visible.                              These inconve
niences are all avoided                        by   the construction               of C. Paul, which
presents, besides, several other advantages not possessed                                              by   the
old steel-yards.
 I.       The       centres        of   the movement                of   suspension,          or the two
constant centres, are placed on the exact line of the divisions of
the beam        ;    an elevation almost                     imperceptible in the axis of
                                                                                                            the

410                                       Description        of
the beam, destined to compensate                            for the very flight flexion
of the bar, alone           excepted.
  2. The apparatus,                   by the construction of the beam, is
balanced below its centre                         of motion;          so   that when            no
weight is suspended, the beam naturally remains horizontal,
and resumes that position when removed from    as also when                it,
the steel-yard            is    loaded        and     the weight      is   at the division,
which ought to shew how much the merchandise weighs.
The horizontal situation in this steel-yard, as well as in the
others,  known
           is       means of the tongue, which rises verti
                                by
cally above the axis of suspension.
  3. It may be discovered that the steel-yard
                                                                                 is   deranged,
if,   when not loaded,               the beam does not remain horizontal.
  4. The advantage of great and     small side (which in the
                                          a                  a
others augments the extent of their power of weighing)                                          is
supplied        by   a   very simple            process,     w    hich accomplishes the
fame end        with      some additional advantages.                      This       process    is
to employ,           on the fame                division,     different weights.             The
numbers of the divisions on the bar, point out the degree of
heaviness expressed   die corresponding weights.
                                     by             For ex
ample, when the large weight of the large steel-yard weighs
eighteen pounds, each division                          it   passes   over       on the bar     is
equivalent to         a    pound     ;    the small weight, weighing eighteen
limes    less   than the large one, will represent, on each of these
divisions, the eighteenth part of                            a    pound    or ounce      ;   and
the    opposite          face    of the bar           is   marked     by   pounds at each
eighteenth division.                  In this construction,            therefore,       we have
the advantage            of being             able,    by   employing both weights at
once, to ascertain, for example, almost within an ounce, the
weight of 500 pounds of merchandise.     will be sufficient           It
to add what     indicated
                      is                         by
                           the small weight in ounces, to
that of the large one in pounds, after an equilibrium has
been obtained              by    the position         of    the two weights,            viz. the
large one placed at the next pound below its real weight,
and the small one at the division which determines the num
ber of ounces to be added,
                                                                                           5.   Aa

                        C. Paul's     nezu  Sleel-Yard.                    411
    5. As the beam is divided only on one side, it may have
 the form of a thin bar, which renders it much less suscepti
 ble of being bent by the action of the weight, and affords
 room for making the figures more visible on both the faces.
    6.   In  these steel-yards        the disposition    of   the axes is not
only such       that the beam          represents  a   mathematical       lever
without weight        ;   but in the principle of its division, the in
 terval between      every two divisions is a determined           and aliquot
 part of the distance between the two fixed points of suspen
 sion ; and each of the two weights employed has for its ab
 solute weight      the unity      of  the weight     it represents,    multi
 plied by the number of the divisions contained in the intervals
 between the two constant centres of motion.                      Thus, sup
posing the arms of the steel-yard divided in such a manner
 that ten divisions are exactly contained in the distance be
 tween the two constant            centres   of motion,     a  weight to ex
 press the pounds on each division             of  the beam        must  really
weigh ten pounds;           that to point out the ounces on the sam»
divisions, must weigh ten ounces, &c. So that the fame steel-
vard may be adapted             to any system     of   measures      whatever,
 and in particular to the decimal system, by varying the abso
 lute heaviness of the weights, and their relation with each
other.      The application of this principle will be seen here
after   in the description of the steel-yard, to which C. Paul,
 with   great propriety,       has given the name         of universal steel
yard.
    But,   to trace out, in a few words, the             advantages     of  the
 steel-yards     constructed      by C. Paul for commercial purposes,
 I stiall only observe,        1.  That   the buyer and seller are certain
 of  the   correctness      of  the instrument,      if  the beam      remains
 horizontal     when it is unloaded and in its usual                  position.
 2. That     these   steel -yards have       one suspension      less than the
 old ones,     and arc so much more simple.               3. That by      these
 means we obtain,          with the      greatest facility, by employing
 two weights, the exact weight of merchandise, with all the
 approximation that can be desired, and even with a greater
                        5                                             precision

 412                                 Description    of
 precision than that given by common balances. There are
 few of these which, when loaded with 500 pounds at each
 end, are decidedly sensible of an ounce ; and the steel-yards
 of C. Paul         possess   that advantage,      and cost one     half  less  than
 balances of equal force.               4. In   the last place we may verify,
 every       moment, the justness           of   the weights,     by the trans
 position which their ratio to each other will                        permit;     for
 example, by observing whether, when the weight of one
 pound is brought back one division, and the weight of one
 ounce carried          forwards eighteen divisions, the equilibrium
 still    remains.
     If, instead of ascertaining the weight of the merchandise
in pounds, you wished to find it according to the new system
in decagrammes, hectogrammes and kilogrammes, it will be
sufficient to substitute,          fir  the ordinary weights, an assortment
of      three    weights bearing the above              names.        These    three
weights are the decuple one of the other;                    and     the   absolute
weight of that called kilogramme, is to the absolute weight of
that called pound, in the exact ratio of these two quantities.
It may         be here    seen, that,       by adapting to the fleel-yard           a
system       of  three weights, we may arrive at the second decimal,
or the centiemes of the unity of the weights employed, and
even without adding or changing any thing                     in   the division    of
the beam.
     It    is on this      simple and advantageous           principle that C.
Paul has constructed             his universal feel-yard, which I am go
ing to describe.            It  serves for weighing in the usual manner,
and according to any system of weights, all ponderable bodies
to     the precision      of half     a grain in the weight         of  a hundred
ounces       ;  that is to fay,      of  a decigramme in the weight             of  a
kilogramme, or, in other words, of a ten thousandth part.
    It is employed, besides, for ascertaining the specific gravity
of   solids,      of liquids, and       even  of   the air itself,    by processes
extremely simple,            and which       do not require many sub-divi
sions in the weights.              This complete       apparatus     is represent

                                          C. Paul's new Steel-Yard.                                               413
           The       beam           A B of this steel-yard               is constructed                on the fame
     principles            as the         commercial steel-yard,                    but of much smaller
     dimensions *.                    The      sliears are suspended by a screw to a cross
     bar of wood supported by two pillars, which rest on the two
     extremities                of    a    small       wooden box furnished                            with three
.    drawers, . and which serves                             as     the stand of the apparatus.
     This          beam is divided into 200 parts,                                beginning at its centre
     of motion.                     The division              is    differently              marked         on     the
     two           faces   :    on the anterior face the numbers follow each
     other from 10 to 200, proceeding towards the extremity ; and
     on the other face, represented apart at F, the numbers are
     marked in the opposite direction.                                        I   shall soon explain the
     use       of this difference in                  the order       of numeration.
           The small frame G                         is destined to prevent the oscillation                         of
     the beam, and it is placed at the proper height by means of the
     nut and screw by which                                it is suspended.               Above the beam
     is seen a small cross bar                        of   brass,    suspended by its two extre
     mities from                    the    cross bar        of wood.              Different weights are
     hooked to             it,      each having its particular value marked on it.
     And, in          the last place,            a     small mercurial thermometer having
     the two most usual divisions, and destined to point out the
     temperature                of    the air and the water during the experiments.
     The       axis     of      suspension           of    the steel-yard              rests    upon two beds
     of    very hard well-polished                         steel.    The      case      is     the fame, but in
    a   reversed situation,                   with     the axis      which         supports the hook               C,
     that      serves      for suspending different parts of the apparatus ac
    cording to the purpose to which                                 it   is   to be applied.
       When you wisli to employ    as                         it      a    common steel-yard,                     you
    suspend from                it    the brass shell         E, which             is    an exact counter
    balance for the weight of the beam                                        when unloaded.                      The

   by placing at the proper place, on the beam, the weight and
   its fractions corresponding with the system of weights adopt

           When you            wish then to try the specific gravity                                  of   a     solid,

  is       well known that the difference                           of   these weights,                employed
  as       a    divisor of the total weight                    in    air, gives for quotient the
  specific gravity.                  Care must be taken,                  as in all experiments
  of       the kind, that no bubble                       of air     adheres lo that part                    of    the
  apparatus               immersed         in   the      water, or to the substance,                               the

 remove the small weight to the division                O  at the end    of the

where the equilibrium will be restored, the beam being hori
zontal.      Mark the division         at   which      the large weight is
found, and add two cyphers           ;  to  this  number add the indica
tion immediately         resulting from the position            of  the small
 weight, and the sum of these two numbers gives the specific
 gravity of the liquid, or its ratio with the weight of distilled
 water to   a ten  thousandth part.
     The balloon      N   is destined     for trying the weight of any
 given kind of gas compared with that of atmospheric air, in
 the following      manner     : —The     weight entitled air tare is ar
 ranged    in such a manner that when placed                    in the notch,

 by the air-pump        and suspended        from the hook of the          steel
 yard.   If the   steel-yard   Is not then in equilibrium,          it is a sign
 that the instrument is deranged,              or that the vacuum is not
 perfect.    The air, the relative weight of which in                regard to
 atmospheric air you wi(h to ascertain,            is to be introduced into
 the balloon, and the weight marked            air  is to be moved alongthe

  the balloon,      the weight     of the     gas    actually inclosed in it.

   Not    satisfied   with having procured         to   philosophers, and
those fond    of   accurate experiments, an instrument extremely
convenient for the closet, and of very extensive use, C. Paul
has endeavoured         to render this apparatus        portable, and has
constructed     various pocket steel-yards,       with which the nicest
experiments may be made,             and the quality       of gold coin   be
ascertained     by the trial of its specific gravity.              They  are
constructed exactly on the same principles                  as  the  Roman
small steel-yard, but are necessarily less extensive in their use.
They cannot        be employed,      for example, in determining the
specific gravity     of an aeriform fluid,   and do not extend beyond
100 deniers       of weight,     (about 120 grammes ;) but as they
possess  all the advantages of a balance, besides those peculiar
to themselves, they are extremely convenient for philosophers
who arc obliged to travel.

XIII. A      new, easy, and cheap Method of impregnating Water
   with Carbonic Acid Gas.               Communicated         by Dr. A. N.
   ScHERER,         Counsellor   of Mines to theDuke of Saxe Weimar.
Dr.         FIERLINGER            has   proposed      the   following   very
simple method for impregnating              water with carbonic acid
                                                                        gas.

gas.      He fills common round bottles with water, inverts
them carefully under water in order to prevent any air from
entering, and charges them in the usual method with car
bonic             He then corks the bottles, thus filled,
            acid gas.
under the water, with a ventilated stopper, immerses them
under water in a proper cylindrical, -almost tubular shaped
vessel, a feet high,              and of         a   proportionate width to the dia
meter of the bottle, in order to apply, by means of hydro
static laws, a great pressurewith a small quantity of water.
The bottles thus filled with the gis, and entirely immersed,
imbibe water by means of the affinity the carbonic acid gas
has for  in such manner that they are nearly filled and
            it,                   a                                                     ;
water    thereby obtained, impregnated with an equal volume
          is
of gas, the water having lodged itself in the interstices of the
gas.      It pretty strong, and can be made still more so.
               is
This method                has,       besides its          conveniency and        cheapness,
still other advantages                ;    the degree      of impregnation may be
                                                       column of water under which
                  is by
regulated                 the height of the
the bottle                immersed,         and the water             is   prepared    in   those
vessels     out of which              it   is   to be drank,        and this prevents that
escape      of    gas       which always              takes place      when poured from
one vessel to another, especially                          if   the water be strongly im
pregnated.                The above-mentioned                     ventilated stoppers         are
corks fitted exactly to the bottles, perforated length-ways,                                   by
holes drilled through them,                          the uppermost         orifices   of which

  Shadwell,        had been subject to occasional             attacks    of this dis
  ease   for eight years past.            In one attack,       some years ago,       a
  skin formed over the right eye,                     which      was removed        by
  a caustic powder blown into it by order of                      Mr. Sharp,      and
  fight was restored in about              a  month   :  this eye has, however,

  marked advantage, previous to her parents making application
  to me.       When       I saw her, her right eye was much inflamed,
  and the upper lips and cheeks                   were   tumefied     in  a  frightful
  degree.      It was a new cafe, that required much consideration.
  Were the        vessels    in  a   state   of inflammation from tone, or
  from debility       ?    Examining the arms            I  found them remark
  ably blue and mottled, the feet were always uncommonly
  cold, the appetite craving, or              else none, very flatulent, great
  distention of the abdomen at times, and a tendency to chlo
  rosis.     The    pulse small,        and quick.        I  accordingly ordered

                             GERMANY.
  A HE     following question has been proposed        as the subject of
a prize by the Royal Society       of Gottingen,      to be    answered
before the first of November       1 800.
    As it has been ascertained     by numerous experiments that a
great quantity    of vaporific (caloris vaporifici)      , or, as it is
called, latent heat,    is carried off by the steam      of water, boil
ing in  an open vessel,    and soon dispersed,    which, however,       if
caresolly collected through tubes and pipes properly disposed,
might be of great utility in various purposes in economy
and manufactures, the Society embraces this opportunity of
requesting   mathematicians and philosophers to turn their at
tention to this subject,      and   to endeavour, as far as possible,
to establish a more accurate theory than any yet given            of the
motion of steam.
    The Royal Society requires, therefore, I. An investigation,
both by experiment and calculation, of the laws, or at least
 the general laws,   of the steam  of boiling water     passing through
tubes   of  a certain length and size ; the matter         of the  tubes
 and the degree   of heat of the surrounding medium being given,
 as well as other data which it is not necessary to mention            to
 those acquainted with the nature       of this elastic fluid.
    II. When    these laws are  in  some measure established,     to de
 duce from them what degree          of heat can be communicated,
 in a given time,    by  a given quantity of steam thus conveyed
 through tubes,    with a given quantity of cold water, or water
dt any given temperament.
                                  Eea                                The

 420              Prize   Questions and Proceedings       of
     The Electoral Jablownfki Society of        the Sciences, at      Leip-
  sic, have proposed the following      questions,    as  the subject   of a
  prize for the year 1799 :
      History. An explanation, proved by authentic docu
  ments, of the origin, rights and principal destination of the
  dignity of Earl in the northern kingdoms.
      Mathematics. A more accurate determination,                     com
  pared   with experience, of the laws of     resistance to fluid bodies
  impelling in an oblique direction.
     Physical-economy.              Application   of our    present know
 ledge respecting     the different kinds of air, particularly to phy
 sics and economy.
     The prize is   a  gold medal of the value      of 34     ducats.    No
 papers will be     received but such    as are  written in French or
 in Latin    ;  and they must be accompanied        with     a sealed note,
 containing the author's name and place of residence.

     The Batavian Economical Society,             authorised    by the   Di
 rectory of the Batavian republic,           has proposed the following
 question     as   the subject  of  a prize,   to be answered either by
 natives or foreigners       :
     Are    there    any means     hitherto unknown,       and sufficiently
  effective,    to restore so     completely,    without the mixture       of
 pernicious       ingredients,    the taste and smell of stinking and
  corrupted water, as to render it a pure, cooling, and whole
  some beverage .' And what are these means ?
                                                                    A  satis-

     A    satisfactory        answer to this question                  will entitle     the author
to   a   prize of 6000 florins.                   In     the answer care must be taken,
1st,     That        the means           be not too expensive,                or attended with
too much trouble                  ;    that they do not occasion too great a con
sumption of fuel              ;       and that they can be employed                      at sea, on
board vessels heavily laden, and often exposed to violent agita
tion. — id, That the means do not require too much art, and
may be easily             applied, even by seamen.                           — 3d, That they
be proved by experiments capable                         of producing the fame ef
fects     in    every temperature.                — 4th, That they be not hurtful,
by corroding the copper                        vessels   in which ship's provisions              are
boiled, or in any other manner.
     If the     inventor          of    such means, after              ascertaining their ef
fect, will communicate his secret, without concealing any
part of    to the commissioner of the Society,
               it,                             that   may                       so          it
be subjected           to trial in any determined place or ship,                             and   if
it   shall be found to answer after several experiments,                                    he   will
receive     a        third part of the premium.                         The    rest    of   the sum
will     be paid as soon as the Society have been convinced                                           of
the certainty of the result of these means,                             by   experiments made
in different climates,                  and      by   the opinion     of competent judges.
     The Society, however,                       retains to       itselfa right of dividing
the prize among several competitors,                                should the means pro
posed      by    each be equally efficacious.

    In  the public fitting       of the National          Institute on the 4th
of  January, the following report was read                of the labours of the
 Class of the Physical Sciences during the preceding quarter.
    Among the various objects which for three months have
 occupied the Class of the Physical Sciences, were two new
kinds of plants presented              bv C. Lheritier.         The    first,  dis
 covered    at Madagascar          by C. Bruguiere during his voyage
 round the world with Kerguelen, will be distinguistied                    by the
name of Bruguiera.               The    second,     discovered    at the Isle    of
 France    by the same botanist, belongs to the family                      of the
 Orchis   ; as it is  a parasite    plant that entwines itself around the
 trunks of trees, C. Lheritier means, on that account, to call it
Rbizodendrum.
    There is     a    tree,    originally     from     America,     the     youn<>
 branches of which,           while in      a state    of vegetation,     are co
 vered   with  a viscous     matter, which, however slightly touched,
 adheres strongly to the fingers, and renders them black.                        C.
 Vauquelin     considers      it  as a   principle different from all those
 known in       the    vegetable       kingdom    ;   but which approaches
 nearer to the guni6 than to any other substance.                     The pro
  duction of this fort of gum has made the                   name of Uobinia
                        to the tree in question, to distinguish it from
 viscosa be given

We     are indebted     to  C. Mechaut,    associate  of the Institute,

     The difficulty of collecting     the various productions     of dif
ferent climates, has been justly considered as one of the greatest
obstacles to the studv and progress of natural history.               This
difficulty no longer exists in regard to the plants growing
 in the territories of Tunis and Algiers.           The public     is now
 in   possession   of a Complete     Flora of Mount Atlas,        so  long
 wished for by botanists; and we are indebted           for that obliga
 tion to C. Desfontaines.
     C.   Broussonet,    whom the love of science conducted to the
 same part      of Africa,    has given an account    of   the particular
  processes employed at Fez and          Tetuan,   for preparing those
 goat skins of which         morocco leather of different colours is
  manufactured.
      C. Testier    has shewn     how beneficial it would be to en
  courage,     in the maritime provinces of France, the manufac
  turing of pitch-rope        paper,  such as that used for sheathing
  of   ships,   by employing oakum procured from old ropes, &c.
      The    fame author has observed      a  singular fact, the cause
  of   which is not yet known.         He  observed,   in  several places,
  milk newly drawn from the cow, and of a beautiful white
  colour, to become blue in the course of two or three days,
  and remain lo even after it had been boiled. We are assured
   that this phenomenon         docs not depend cither on the age or
   health of the cows, on the dairieSj the         vessels   in which the
   milk    is preserved,    nor on any want of care or cleanliness.
   The whole produce of the milk, though blue, is of                a good
   quality,    and may be ate without       any inconvenience.          It is
   not improbable that this colour may be owing to some plants
   of the nature of woad or indigo, on which cows sometimes
   feed in summer.        But this is only conjecture;      and C. Testier
                                                                 proposes.

proposes,          with     a view       of discovering the truth, to make
the necessary             researches      and experiments in those places
where the phenomenon has been observed *.
      In   a memoir on a new classification    C. Lamarck      of   shells,
has shewn the necessity of increasing the number of genera,
and of abridging the characters' by which they are distin
guished. This number he carries to a hundred and seven
teen.          Linnæus       and    other naturalists made it only sixty.
By     means       of this classification, we may more                        easily reduce
to its particular genus, all the testaceous animals with which
we wish to be acquainted.
      In   the numerous family of the spiders                           there    are some
called miners and masons,                     because they construct for them
selves subterranean                cavities or galleries, which they {hut
with       a   kind of trap-door.             C. Latreille,         associate   of the In
stitute,       has pointed out the characters peculiar to this indus
trious family,            and the means          of preventing their being con
founded with other insects                    of the fame name* but of a dif
ferent species.
      It   is well known that phosphorus, and several saline com
binations of the phosphoric acid, have been found by che
mists in urine.            By new researches C. Fourcroy and Vau-
quelin have          discovered, in that liquid, alumine and the phos-
phat of magnesia.      They have seen that a peculiar animal
matter, by which urine is characterised, and which gives it
all its properties, forms there, very speedily, ammonia, which
makes the phosphat               of     magnesia        pass   into the class of triple
salts, renders it much less soluble than before, and susceptible
of being precipitated in laminæ or crystalline needles. These
two chemists have given an account of the spontaneous
changes it experiences,                 and     (hewn that the examination               of

    Sir Joseph Banks, president of the Royal Society of

Fezzan on the 12th of September, with camels,                     horses and
some    merchandise. He        assumes the character       of  a merchant,
but not very rich,         that he may not afford           temptation to
avarice.    When in Egypt lie accidentally met with              a  country
man of his own, who had long resided there, and embraced
the Mahometan          religion.    He    had made     three journeys to
Mecca, and       spoke the Turkish         and   Arabic   languages      with
great fluency.     He    was on the point       of returning    to Europe ;
but, at the request of Horneman,           he consented to accompany
him on his journey.          Horneman       means to proceed         to Fez
zan     and thence to Cashna.          He will remain       as  long    as he
can in the interior of Africa ; and return either towards the
west by Senegambia, or towards the east by Ethiopia.                      He
still enjoys good health; has withstood the climate of the
country, and is silled with zeal and ardour.                  His letter to
Sir Joseph Banks       bore the impression       of Bonaparte's official
seal, and was delivered       to Sir Joseph by. the French agent in
England for the exchange          of prisoners.      Sir Joseph, in Von
Zach's Ephemerides for February, does justice to the French
by a compliment for the scrupulous delivery of this letter."
    The following     is an extract    of  a letter from   M.     Horneman
to Profejsor Heeren at Gottingen,            dated Cairo,     October 14,
j 707,      "I  am as well at present        as can be expected         ; my
health has not     in   the least suffered from the climate, though
it is   very different from      that of Europe.         I   have    not yet
been able to examine thoroughly the ruins of Alexandria,
because there are too many of the free Arabs roving about
the city.     But, in   order that   I might not be idle,       I  examined
the different kinds of stones, and carried away specimens.                   It
was no part of my plan to make researches into the antiqui
ties  in  the neighbourhood       of Cairo, until      1  had studied      the
language     of the  inhabitants.       As I had a     good opportunity,
however, to visit    the pyramids of Giza, I did not neglect it;
and though the       shortness of the time I could employ would
not allow me to make many new observations,                 I received this
                                                                       benefis

  benefit from the excursion, that          I am better acquainted      with
 the country, and the      easiest   method of travelling through it.
     "I  first ascended the great pyramid, and            had got about a
 sixth part of the way towards the summit, when                  I  was ob
 liged to return that       I  might not detain          my companions^
 M. Hope      and  Major Schwarz, who           wished to enter it.    This,
 however, we found        impossible ; because         the entrance was
 choked up with sand, which               it was necessary to remove.
 That   we might not lose time,         I  proposed to    Major Schwarz
 to take a    walkthrough the neighbouring district, to examine
 the different kinds of stones.           This we did with as much
 speed  as possible,   and returned in about an hour and a half.
 Before we came back        M. Hope       had been at the sarcophagus,
 but had again come out and returned to the                 vessel,  which
 lay at the distance of about ten minutes walk from the large
 pyramid.
    "I   now intend to go back with two of Murad Bey's peo
 ple, and to take a complete plan of all the pyramids, with the
 surrounding district,     and   a section      of  these edifices  also,  if
 possible ;   to go somewhat       farther than other travellers       have
 done ; and, above all, to examine the springs               in the large
 pyramid, which      I consider to be difficult, but not impossible.
    " Just   now (Oct. 1797) is the best time for travelling in
Eorypt.      Peace every where prevails, for all are afraid of
Murad Bey.         An Englishman of           the name   of Brown     seems
to have taken advantage         of this favourahle period. Before
he proceeded      to Darfoor, he had been in Upper Egypt ; at
Siivab     (the  ancient tempk of Jupiter Ammon), and the
Llfke Natron.        He remained       above      two years at Darfoor
without beinc able to procure leave to return, until he at
length obtained it by an accident.              People here fay that he
observes great silence,     and therefore        they scarcely know any
thing of his discoveries.
    " There is at present an Abyssinian bishop here, of whom
I have   made several enquiries respecting Bruce.            He informed
                                                                        me,

 me, that an Englishman, Jacobo Bruce, had been in Abyssinia;
 that he was in great favour with the king and nobles of the
 country  ;  that he frequently observed the sun with an instru
 ment like that used by seamen         ;  that he often asked respect
 ing the Sources     of the Nile, and that he at length undertook
 a journey thither.       The bishop said that he had not been
 acquainted with this traveller himself; but that his father
 had known him personally,           and    had    frequently spoken         os
 him. This worthy bishop, therefore,           has cleared Bruce        of the
 accusation    made against him> that he had never been                 at the
 sources  of   the Nile."
    Under    the head    of  discoveries   in Africa, we       are happy to
 announce,      that   the Public     will   soon     be    gratified with
 an account of       Mr.   Brown's travels into        that,   little known
 quarter of the world.      Mr. Brown       some years ago went from
 Cairo  to Seewah, and in the rains          of  Oasis there       found the
 remains of a remarkable chapel, which he conjectures, and
with   some probability,      to  have belonged to          the celebrated
temple of Jupiter Ammon.            He afterwards went along with
the Soudan caravan, and paid             a visit to   the Great Oajis or
Alwah, to which no European               before    him   had ever pene
trated ; and     which   is laid clown very accurately              in Major
Rennet's map, published in the Proceedings of the African
Association.      Mr. Brown then travelled through a desert of
considerable extent, and at length arrived at Darfoor, in 15°
15' north latitude, which stands a little to the east of Haraza
on the map above-mentioned.               Here    he found        two cities,
lying   at the distance      of two   days journey      of    a camel from
each other. One       of them was     the king's residence ; the orHer
was inhabited by merchants.             In  the latter   of  these cities he
remained two years and ten months in an unpleasant situa
tion, as he was often ordered to attend at court, and was not
suffered to go to any distance from his habitation;                  owing to
an accident, however, he at length found means to depart,
and returned by the way of Egypt and Syria.
                                                                     Astro-

                                   Transit   of Mercury.                       431
                                     ASTRONOMY.
     The     of Mercury over the sun's disk is a phenome
             transit
non of the utmot importance to astronomy, as it affords the
means of improving the theory and tables of that planet ; but
the late phenomenon                  of this kind, which took         place on the
7th of May, was deserving of the more attention, as a transit
of Mercury at the descending node of his orbit had never
been observed           in    its whole duration.
                                   These transits, in gene
ral,    are much more uncommon than those at the ascending
nodes.         Ever since mankind                began to view the heavens,
Mercury had             been observed          only three times under the like
circumstances,               and   unfortunately      each    observation was in
complete.          In the year          1661      the ingress of the planet into
the fun was seen, but not its egress;                      and in the years
                                                                            1753
and 1786 the egress only was observed.  It is much, there
fore, to be wished that the weather had been more favour
able during the late transit,                as   the fame phenomenon,        under
the like circumstances, will not occur before the year 1833.
According to an observation made by a gentleman at Green
wich, on this           transit,   on Tuesday the 7th, with a seven sect
telescope by           Dr.    Herschel, the aperture of which was con
tracted, the internal contact with the                       SW limb of     the fun
happened          at 4h 38' 33", and the egress at 4h 31'               34"   p. m.
mean time. The ingress was not                     seen   on account of the cloudi
ness    of   the morning.
     Mercury           has    at all times afforded    much occupation to
astronomers ; because,                 to observe that planet, is a matter of
considerable           difficulty.      The  great Copernicus died without
ever     having seen           it,   and therefore could believe only in its
existence.         The        celebrated     Maesilinus,     the tutor of the im
mortal Kepler, used to                say that this planet was calculated only
to expose astronomers                 to the danger of losing their reputation:
so     that when he knew              of any one employed in tracing out         its
intricate course,             he advised him to employ his time on some
                                                                              better

guage,        that he might be able to read the old observations                          in
Ptolomy's Almagest in the original, and, of course, to ex
plain them better; and in the younger part of his life he
used to get on the tops of the houses, before fun-rife, to have
a view of Mercury above the foggy horizon of Paris.                                  It   is
natural, therefore, to suppose, that, after much labour and      so
exertion, Lalande would have given the                      best tables   of Mercurv;
and this was really the cafe,                so   far as they surpassed         in accu
racy      the    old tables         of Halley        and    Caslini.      He waited,
therefore, with anxious expectation for the transit of this
planet over the fun's disk on the 4th of May 1786.     His
observations          on that occasion       were to be the touchstone             of his
tables, and to reward him at length for the incessant pains
and labour he had bestowed on them for nearly half century.                 a
The       treacherous         however, instead of sanctioning
                             Hermes,
these tables, proved that the author had erred more than half
an hour         t.     Since       that time Triefnecker              of Vienna,     and
lately Oriani of Milan, have employed themselves                                on this
planet    :   and as the last, in particular, first calculated the per-

overcome this intractable planet, and could with Virgil ex

    Much,        however, was still wanting ; and we are happy tp
inform those fond of astronomy, that a respectable astrono
mer, Major von Zach,             has just announced a complete new
set  of    tables   of Mercury,     in which not only the perturba
tions of Venus, calculated by Oriani, but those also occa
sioned by the earth in Mercury, and which Oriani has
omitted, will be taken into account.                 An   exalted amateur
of astronomy is employed in calculating them, and they
will be printed at his expence.             Major von Zach informs us
also, that he will have the pleasure of transmitting them to
all the astronomers in Europe.              As these tables are not in
tended      for  the  booksellers' shops, every person fond of astro
nomy, who wisties to procure a copy of the work, will re
ceive one gratis, on applying to           Major von Zach        at Gotha.
                                  BOTANY.
    A    singular and      ingenious method of multiplying the
tongue-leaved         eucomis  or fritillary (Fritillaria regia, l.) is
described in Professor Hedwig's Collection of Memoirs and
Observations on Subjects of Botany and Economy.                          This
fritillary is called, by Lamarck, Bajile a epi couronni-. When
this beautiful plant of the lily kind is in full flower and
vigour, the flowers, leaves, and the upper part of the bulb
must      be    cut,   and  wrapped up in several            folds of sized
writing paper,        so that the whole be exactly covered.            They
are then to be moderately compressed               between     two pieces of
board    ;   and at the end    of  some months        several small    bulbs
will   be seen formed      at the lower extremity.         I  cultivate,  says
C. Willemet, who           has made known the above observation,

 at   Nancy.      It requires     to be kept during winter       in  the hot
  house.
                                   MEDICINE.
      Doctor Lentin,       a celebrated physician of Germany, has
  lately published,     in  the Transactions of the Royal Society of
'
  Gottingen, some observations on Caries of the Bones, and the
  cure of that disease.       In his opinion it     depends on a chemical
  decomposition of the phosphst of lime, produced by the pu
  trefaction of the gelatinous matter contained in the bones.
  In   consequence     of this      idea,  he was     authorised   to believe
  that the phosphoric acid administered                 externally might    be
  useful    in that disease;     and experience,      from what he relates,
  seems to confirm it.          lie   gives internally from ten to twenty
  drops in any proper vehicle           ; and externally, one part      of the
   fame    acid with seven parts of distilled water. He fays, he
   observed that the peculiar fetid odour of carious bones was
   in  a little time removed,         and   that  a cure   speedily followed.
   1 le, however, adds,        that persons afflicted    w  iih hemorrhoidal
   symptoms,      as  well   as women when subject to their courses,
   were a little irritated by this remedy.
       Knaksted has published, in the Memoirs of the Institute
    of Petersburgh, for     the treatment      of  the fick, that the root   of
    common elecampane            (Inula belenium), given both internally
    and externally,      is a  very efficacious remedy for tetters, the
    itch, and other cutaneous diseases.

                 it is possible for mutilations produced in the bodies
of animals, either by accident or by artificial means, especi
ally when repeated through a whole series of generations,
to degenerate         in the course of time into hereditary marks of
 distinction,       seems a      priori    to be incontrovertible.          At any
 rate,   I  should     be glad to fee the physiologist           who can assign
 a reason     why this     ssiould not be as possible as the transmission

    We       arc told by     Sir Kenclm Digby*, that the tail of a cat
having been           cut off when young, some of the kittens, which she
afterwards brought forth, were always without tails.                                        Nath.
Highmorefj who in explaining                               the    nature of generation
differs so much from                 Sir Kenclm,           fays that he saw a bitch
which wanted almost the whole tail from the rump, and that
the half of her young were brought                                    into the world with-
tails, and the other half without.                           Busson          J   asserts   that he
saw dogs,            the ears and tails of which had been cropped for
many generations, and which transferred this mutilation,
cither totally or in part, to their posterity.
     M. R. Masch, of New Strelitz,                          gives an account,                in the
Naturforfcber§, of               a   butcher's dog, the tail of which, ac
cording to custom, had been cut off, and which having co
pulated with a she-wolf, that had been caught, the latter
produced three bastards.   Among these was a male, half
grey like the father, and born with a cropped tail; so that the
casual mutilation of the dog, as the author fays, was trans
ferred to this bastard.
     We      are told by       D. Forster      ||,   that    it   has been remarked                  in
to the father, whether grey-hound,             spaniel, fcc.           in   regard   to colour and
bodily conformation       ;    and derived nothing          more from            their   mother,     the
Spanish bitch, than the singularity of having only the third part of                        a   tail, or
«o tail at all."

 at last, come into the world               with  some articulations        fewer'
 in  the tail.      Busson * has enlarged           pretty fully on this sub
ject, and endeavoured            to prove, by the help       of anatomy, that
 the callosities on the breast-bone and knees                 of the camel are
merely the consequence of their subjection, and the force by
which these animals of burden, as is well known, are obliged
 to kneel down ; and             as   the young camels, when brought
forth,     have     callosities    of   the like kind,      he gives this as a
proof of the hereditary transmission                of  such variations      pro
duced by art.
               II.   Instances atrlting the Human Species.
     Cardans        speaks    of thq well known ancient               custom     of
 the Peruvians of Puerto Vlcgo, who                  pressed   between boards
 the heads of their new-born children.                   This custom, how
 ever, became afterwards             like a second nature;       so that, in the
 course    of time, children were brought                i'ntp the world     with
heads     formed in that singular manner:               and Cardan expressly
 fays, that this flajness         of  the head was originally the work           of
 art, and not of nature.               Con/lat igitur, to use his own ex
 pressions,     bumanam formam multis modis variari, tum'arle,
 turn diuturna succejjione.             Hippocrates, in his work upon air,
 water and climate,           mentions something of the like kind in
 regard to the Macrocepbalt,              a  people on the borders        of the
Black Sea, who          pressed    the heads of their new-born children;
 and    this practice repeated, through many generations, pro
 duced at length an hereditary distinction ; so that the chil
 dren were born with heads of               a  particular form.     "At    first,"

4             On the Pojsibiltty of Mutilations in Bodies
came nature.        Those who had the largest heads were con
sidered as the noblest ; and for this reason the           Macrocfbali
pressed the yet pliable tender heads          of their children with
their hands, and forced them to extend in length by bandages
and other means. This artificial process gave occalion to the
subsequent increase of size in the head among these people,
so  that artificial means were no longer requisite for that pur
pose." Hippocrates, however, adds in           a short   section:   "That
in his time their        heads   had no longer that singular form
completely,       because   they had entirely neglected        the above
 artificial means of formation."         But that this    very little con
 tradicts his preceding account and opinion is (hewn by the
 intermediate passages, where he endeavours to explain the
 phenomenon from his well known theory of generation.
 " The generative        matter,"   fays he,
                                                "  is collected from all
                                                                           x
 parts   of  the body.    From found bodies it        comes found, and
 from    diseased    bodies  diseased.    Now,    as bald heads,      blue
 eyes, and overgrown bodies are transmitted             in families,   and
 the like rule takes place in other circumstances          of conforma
 tion, why should not children with great heads be produced
 by great headed parents?"         Hippocrates, therefore, evidently
 meant only that in the           course  of time Nature       sometimes
 abandons forms flic has assumed,          and   returns again to the
 original.
    Aristotle, in his work on the generation of animals, speak
 ing of the grounds on which the theory of Hippocrates re
 specting generation is founded, fays :
                                                  " It is very probable
 for this reason, besides others, that children not only resemble
 their parents in internal and innate properties, but even in
external marks which are merely casual               ;  for there are in
 stances     of moles being transmitted from parents to their
 children, and on the very fame parts of the body. He him
 self quotes a Chaldean, who, having        a mole on his arm, trans
  mitted it to his son, though in the latter it was not           so appa
  rent  as  in  the father.   Pliny  also, where he treats     of marks,
 moles, and the like, being sometimes           inherited by children,

               becoming hereditary      Marks of tiiJlinBion.                5
 adds, by way       of  example    :   Quarto partu Dacorum originis
 nota in bracbio redditur.         In my opinion, this      passage   alludes
 to the hereditary transmission         of  moles   among the Dacians,
 Illyrians, &c. who, according             to the testimony    of many of
 the Ancients,       were distinguished by this singularity.
     The   late  M.   Osann once came to me, full of astonishment,
 and told me that he had met with a similar instance in the
 family of a staff-officer, who lived in the neighbourhood.
 The father in his younger days had received               a wound in the
 little finger of his right hand, which had                 been   rendered
 crooked during the cure         ;   and his son and daughter were
 born each with the little finger of the same hand crooked.                  I
 have since seen both the father and daughter, and have been
convinced, by inspecting'their hands, of the truth             of the  above
information.
     A  literary man of very great acuteness, when conversing
with me on this subject, started the following objection :
 " If    artificial mutilations      can become     hereditary, children
born    of circumcised     parents     must often be born without the
foreskin, which does not appear to be the cafe."                   At that
time    I  was acquainted      with only one instance of this kind
in Stcph. Gerlach's Journal j but one example did not ap
pear to me to be of any peculiar weight.                 I, however, once
happened       to ask a  Jew of this     place,   a man not destitute of
learning,      and well acquainted       with   the ritual   of his nation     .
respecting      this circumstance, and was told that it frequently
happened       that the children of the Jews were brought into
the world with so short         a foreskin that      it required    an    ex
perienced       and careful hand to circumcise them.               This iiv
nate deficiency is distinguiflicd         by  a particular Hebrew         ap
pellation, nauld mobl, or born circumcised. His own father,
who had circumcised above 700 boys, and who was cele
brated on account of his expertnets in this cafe, not at ail
uncommon,          often spoke of the difficulty      of performing the
operation under such circumstances.               In   a  word, what had
appeared to me an argument against the hereditary                 tnmsmis-

lion of artificial mutilations, became unexpectedly an im
portant argument in its favour. I will, however, readily
acknowledges that all the cafes above mentioned may not be
of    equal authenticity, and equally incontrovertible ; but even
though the least improbable mould be rejected,                                   there    will
still remain, to support the probability of the thing, as many
as could be desired for a proposition which cannot well be
proved by direct experiments made for the purpose.

      guiere,           undertaken     by orderof the French Government,
      through         the    Ottoman   Empire, Egypt and Persia, during
      the Years             1792, 93, 94, 95, 96 and                  97*.
                       [Concluded from the       last   Volume, p. 347.]
    A HIS  journey was extremely interesting; for, besides
the great number of objects which we collected, and the ob
servations we had occasion to make, we were surprised to see
    a country exceedingly fertile, yet almost a desert,                           and often
volcanic, exhibiting, at every step, vestiges of ancient cities.
    We    crossed           the Euphrates        and      the    Tigris on wretched
    wooden boats            ; and   two rivers, which flow from the moun
    tains of Curdistan, on boats formed of                       a   number of inflated
    (kins joined together.             I   (hall describe,           with some minute
    ness, this simple method               of   crossing rivers, because it might
    be employed with advantage in Europe,                             on account of the
    facility and trifling expence of transporting a great number
    of (kins ; of inflating them in a moment, and uniting them
    firmly together by means of the branches of trees ; and of
    conveying,          in this manner,          over the largest rivers, a whole
    army without any danger.

 hopes    of his    recovery.       His   astrologer    had read in the stars
 the fatal sentence;       the kiaya pacha and some           of the grandees
 were already        forming      intrigues to succeed him, and               the
janissaries were taking up arms to fell their services to the
 highest bidder. The Arabs of the desert, and of Mesopo
 tamia, waited only for the moment of his death to plunder
 the caravans and rob travellers.                  This city was threatened
 with   a general      insurrection.      Commerce was suspended; and
 it   was    impossible      for us     to continue      our journey.        The
 pacha     begged us to give him our advice, until we should
 have an opportunity           of  setting out for Persia.       We thought
 ourselves      bound to comply with his request,                and    had the
 satisfaction to restore him to health in the course of a few
 days.      From that moment order was                  every where re-esta
 blished   ;   and the kiaya alone          paid, with his head,         for the
 steps he had taken          to assume      the    place   of his benefactor.
 The pacha mewed us every mark of gratitude, made us a
  present of two sine Arabian horses, and gave us letters of re
  commendation to the khan of Kermancha, and the ministers
  of the king of       Persia.
     We did not          delay a moment           to provide ourselves       with
  Persian     dresses,   and whatever         else   was   necessary;    and de
  parted on the 16th of May 1796, with the regret of leaving
  behind us       a   box containing         several very     valuable jewels,
  destined as presents to the Persian court,              which    the envoy    of
  the republic at Constantinople was to have sent after us.
      The   usual heat at Bagdad, during some hours                  of the day,
  is from      no°to U3°Fahr.               On the      day  of our departure
                                                      °
   the thermometer was already at 99^                   Fahr. We had here
   an opportunity of seeing a phenomenon which                      explains the
   origin and cause of that singular and transitory wind which
   destroys     men and        animals,     if proper precautions         are not
   taken to guard against its effects.
      On our arrival at Kermancha, the first city                of   Persia,   we
    waited on the khan, made              him acquainted       with the object
    of our    travels,    and    delivered     to   him   the  letter  from the
                                          B 4                               pacha

 8                      Travels through Turkey,
 pacha of Bagdad.           The khan      asked us many questions         re
 specting   the different states    of Europe, with which         he seemed
to be little acquainted, and respecting our manners and cus
toms. He dwelt most en the countries of the Ottoman
empire which        we     had traversed,     and particularly Bagdad,
because    in that city the aflies of AH are preserved. He gave
orders to one of his officers to accompany us to court, and
procured us the necessary passports.             On   the ist   of June we
 arrived at Teheran, where we learned that the king ancHiis
ministers had set out in the beginning of spring on an expe
 dition, the object of which was supposed to be the conquest
of all Chorazan.
    I was    highly pleased with the idea           of undertaking this
journey, and I considered it as a fortunate circumstance that
 the king was at the head of an army in one of the most in
teresting provinces of           Persia;   into   which      no   European
 traveller had penetrated,        and  which     produces      the most re
 markable plants,        as  well  as  the greater      part   of  the drugs
 brought to us from the Eastern countries;               but C. Bruguiere
 had been      ill for   a  long time, and was threatened             with a
 dysentery.      The dragoman himself          was indisposed,      and rea
 sons were not wanting to dissuade me from undertaking the
 journey.
              " It is not positively known," said some, " where
 the king is; and it is dangerous to approach the army in
 this country, because people arc plundered, and even killed,
 before   they can be known and protected.                 It will require
 more than a month to reach Chorazan, and the king must
 return in two."          These reasons did not counterbalance the
 advantages which were likely to result, from this journey,                to
 natural    history    and    geography ;     but   I  reflected    that  the
 health of my colleague was becoming daily worse,                   aud that
 he was incapable of supporting the fatigues               of travelling    fa
 far, during the hottest        season   of  the year.      It  would    have
 been necessary to traverse the Mazandaran,               a   hot, marshy,
 and   extremely unhealthful          district ;  and    besides this,    the
 dragoman refused to accompany us.                 We then         agreed to.
                                                                         wail

                           Egypt and Persia.                              9
wait for the king in the environs of Teheran,             in order that
we might take advantage         of  the season proper for researches
in   regard   to natural history;      for collecting     feeds, and for
enabling     C.   Bruguiere to re-establish     his health with more
facility.
   . We   were obliged to negotiate,    and to make some pecuniary
sacrifices,  before we could obtain permission        to quit the town,
and reside in a village at the bottom of mount Albours.
Teheran contained hostages from all the great cities of the
empire, whom Mehemet             had   caused to assemble there for
his security   ;  so that people might enter the city, but could
not depart from it without the express leave          of the governor ;
and the latter did not let flip so fine an opportunity           of forcing
us to expend a little money.          As we    foresaw     that the pre
 sents left behind might be retarded,         and not even reach us,
 we thought it prudent not to make any mention                   of them.
 We     had  it in our power, indeed,-       to offer the governor a
 watch and some arms;           but we sliould thus have entered
 into an engagement        to give   other presents to his principal
 officers, and, on the king's arrival, having nothing suffi
 ciently beautiful to offer to his ministers, and our presents
 being detained      at Bagdad under a pretence          that the roads
 were not safe,     we should    have been considered       as  impostors,
 and should      have   lost that confidence      which our conduct
 ought to have inspired.
     The king,   after taking possession   of Mesched     and all   Chora-
 zan, and after      having destroyed      Charok-Shah         the last de
 scendant   of Thamas-Kouli-Khan,          and carried away his trea
 sures, returned to Teheran.          He made his entry into that
 new capital towards the end of September 1796; and, two
 days after, we had an audience         of  the prime minister,        with
 whom we had reason to be satisfied.             We     endeavoured       to
 secure the friendsliip     of the  chief  secretary,  an active,     judi
 cious, enterprising man, and as well informed                as  could be
 expected in Persia.        We   spoke to him of the new govern
 ment established      in France ; and,     at the same time, made
                                                                       him

lO                      Travels through Turkey,
him acquainted        with its resources, population, triumphs and
power.      We     received   from him some interesting details        re
specting    the manners,      religion and government of the Per
sians,   as well     as a circumstantial        history  of the troubles
which had        desolated that unhappy country since the de
thronement of Shah Hussein, and particularly since the death
of Nadir Shah.
    On   the 4th    of October    we obtained from the minister an
audience to take leave ; and, some days              after, his principal
secretary gave us a letter addressed to the French republic,               a
copy,   of which     I immediately dispatched, reserving the ori
ginal,   which    I  have  since presented to the directory.
    We now made haste to complete our observations and to
return to Bagdad, as we already foresaw the storm which still
involves that country in all the horrors of a civil war.              We
quitted Teheran on the 15th of October, and pursued the
 road to Ispahan.          We had made an ample collection of
 objects of natural history, and of medals.            We    had acquired
also very correct information          respecting   the   population,   re
 venues and forces      of Persia;   the late revolution, and the stats
 of its commerce.         Our   travels,   however, would have been
 incomplete,      had we not     seen   the ancient capital of the em
 pire, and the     seat  of the sophis. We remained a month               at
 Ispahan, and on the 21st of December arrived at Bagdad.
     Some European travellers have traversed Persia,              and have
  given us accounts more or less correct of that empire. They
  have made us acquainted with the industry and commerce
 of  the Persians ; given us long details respecting          the religion
 and followers of Mahomet            ;   and have described     the palace
  and gardens     of Shah Abbas       and his successors, as well as the
  public edifices of Ispahan.          But   the history   of the troubles
  of Persia    since the death      of Nadir Shah;        the changes     in
  manners, agriculture and industry, which must have been
  effected there by intestine wars, that continued for more
  than sixty years;       the formation       of  a  new empire, more
  powerful than Persia itself,      which    extends   from Candahar to
                                                                 Caslnnire*

                             Egypt and Persia.                                       n
Caslimire,      from     Caboul   to the       country          of the Moguls,
comprehending the fertile banks of the                      Indus, cannot fail of
giving new interest to a new narration.                     In   regard to natural
productions, it will be seen, by an account of the different
objects which I shall not fail soon to publish, how little they
are known, and how curious and important the greater part
of them      are.
   Persia is an elevated country, covered with snow                          in winter
from the Caspian sea to Ispahan ; and in summer, dry and
exceedingly warm.    It consists of mountains remarkably
high, and of immense plains, for the most part uncultivated.
What must astonish every traveller                    is,
                                       that throughout the
whole empire no production can be obtained without water
ing   neither corn nor vines grow there but
      :                                            means of             by
water. No trees   or shrubs are ever seen, but such as have
been      planted, reared       and    watered         by     the    hand of man.
Water      is   every where necessary      ;    and yet          in this country        it
 isnaturally wanting.    It was requisite, therefore, that the
 industry  of the inhabitants should supply this deficieacy                              by
 subterranean channels, which convey water from all quarters,
 and end at      a   common reservoir.          By taking           advantage     of the     j
 declivity of the ground, they then draw off different streams,
 near which they form habitations more or less considerable,
 according as the water, more or               less    abundant,            admits of a
 greater or less degree of cultivation.
    Though wounded, at the distance of six days journey from
 Bagdad,        by
             band of Curdes, while assisting my colleague
                     a
 when about to' fall into their hands, was, however, soon
                                                      I
 able to continue our         journey; but C. Bruguiere,                     whose      life
 was almost daily threatened in Persia,                     and whose health was
  still uncertain, could not for           a   long time be prevailed on to
  proceed.        Nearly fix months elapsed before   was            I            able    to
  persuade       him to set out       in
                                  order to return home.                           Several
  times, on the approach of the fine season, did                      I      threaten    to
 if aye him   but could never resolve to do
                ;        I                                            so,   as   my con
                                                                                  science

 IX                      Travels through Truiey,
 science would not have ceased to reproach me, had my com
 panion,     after my departure, terminated his career at a dis
 tance from hia friend and fellow traveller.
     During the time       I resided at Bagdad waiting       for the per
 fect re-establishment       of C. Bruguiere's health,       I  employed
myself in collecting different materials for            a history   of our
 travels.     I have seen the ruins     of Seleucia, Ctesiphon, the
 site formerly occupied by the celebrated          Babylon ; the towers
called those     of Nimrod, which neither time nor           the hand    of
man has been able entirely to destroy,             and which still excite
the admiration of travellers.
     I had  in Egypt     and Syria observed the      Arabs, that nation
so   singular, and respecting       whom travellers have spoken          so
differently.      I had studied their manners, their customs,          and
the form of their government.              It still remained for me to
live among        them, to travel     with them, to frequent their
tents, and to receive from their hands simple, frugal, and
wholesome food.
    As particular circumstances obliged           me at Bagdad to ex
ercise the functions       of  a physician,   I  readily embraced     that
opportunity of seeing the interior part of the Mahometan
habitations,      and   of becoming     acquainted     with  the state  of
their harems, and the women shut up in them.               No traveller,
perhaps, has been able to collect,         in this    respect,   so  many
singular anecdotes.
    We    departed     from Bagdad on the ist         of May 1797, in
company with        a  caravan destined   for Aleppo. We remained
sixty-five days on the banks of the Euphrates, and in the
desert employed our time in preparing plants, collecting in
fects,   skinning birds and quadrupeds, and in making obser
vations on the Arabs j the climate, foil, and productions               of
these countries.         We    made only     a short   stay at Aleppo,
where we found        a letter  from C. Aubert Dubayet, in which,
after some compliments           on account of our couduct, he re
quested we would return by the shortest route to France.

                             Egypt and Verjia.                                13
    This invitation was perfectly          agreeable     to our wishes ; but
it  was   indispensably     necessary that we should            pass   through
Constantinople.           Could we leave behind us            a scattered    col
lection,    the fruit of five years labour and observations, ex
posed to the dangers         of the sea   and of dilapidation       ?  Is it not
certain that objects of natural history, almost all of a perish
able nature,       must    be taken     care   of during quarantines by
hands accustomed            to   manage      them?       How easily might
manuscripts have been carried away ? We had left some
boxes under the care of a merchant at Constantinople, and
others   in  an apartment        of the ambassador's          palace.     There
was a great        number at Scio,         and    some at Latakia.           We
considered      it as our duty to unite the whole,             and   to convey
 them all to Paris ourselves,         in order that it might            be seen,
 on our arrival,      whether we had accomplished                the   views    of
 government, and          whether we had not deceived the expecta
 tions of the learned.
     We wrote      to the ambassador to make him acquainted                 with
 the motives which induced us to take the way of Constanti
 nople.      We wrote, at the fame time, to the consuls of
 Tripoli   and Cyprus,        begging them to inform us when the
 first ship sailed for the Archipelago          ;  after  which    we repaired
 to Latakia,      where we found only a wretched Venetian ship,
 in which the consul advised us not to embark, as the Alge-
 rines, for some time past, had insulted the flag of that ex
 piring republic.         We then resolved to proceed to Cyprus,
 and to traverse       that  island, though in the most dangerous
  season ; to repair afterwards to the coast of Caramania, and
 to    proceed     thence to Constantinople,               by   crossing     Asia
  Minor.      This journey was         one    of  the most interesting we
  undertook, both in regard            to natural      history and       the   in
  formation we collected respecting            the manners       of  the  Turks,
  in  a country       little known,      little frequented, and           yet   so
  worthy of attention.
     We    arrived at Constantinople in the end             of October,       and
  should have departed thence           in  the Serieuse,     some time after,
                                                                              had

t\                        Travels through Turkey,
had we received our boxes from Scio,                 and    those we left at
Cyprus.       The     ambassador     was employed          in procuring us a
paflage in the Brune           to Athens    and   Corfu, just at the time
of his   death.       After that event, all our efforts to procure a
safe and   direct paflage to France being useless, we thought
we should be sheltered from all danger, and free from
all reproach,       if  we proceeded      to our isles in the Levant,
by crossing      the isthmus of Corinth.                It was certainly of
much      importance        for us not     to   fall     into   the hands of
the English,       whose      {hips covered     the Mediterranean.             It
would have given us great              pain to fee our enemies            profit
by our labours, and reap the fruit of all our dangers                       and
fatigues.
   We wrote       to   C. Carra Saint Cyr,       charge d'affaires       of the
republic at the Ottoman Porte,             to inform       him of our plan,
and obtain his approbation            ;  and at the fame time to ask
some pecuniary assistance,           and make him adjust             the  state
ment of the sums advanced               to us since        our arrival in the
Levant.       We     received a favourable answer,            and such as was-
suited to our circumstances.
   It may not be superfluous           here to observe, that we had for
a long time reminded the Porte of the services we had ren
dered to    it in   regard     to the pozzolana       ;   a service it perhaps
thought it had sufficiently rewarded by the flattering letter
which the ReiaEffendi charged us to deliver to the minister
of foreign      affairs,     accompanied       with      a  present    of 2000
piastres.     We mould certainly          have refused, from any other
government,        a sum so small       and   so  ill proportioned       to our
labour, expences,          and the importance of the discovery, and,
in particular,      so    far below the promises made to us ; but a
government       so   little susceptible of honest and generous con
duct, would        not have been sensible of the motive of our
refusal.
    We left Constantinople with              a  favourable wind on the
30th of April, in a Turkish boat we                had hired      ; touched at
one of the castles of the Dardanelles,             and different points        of
                        7                                                    the

                            Egypt and Persia.                                   1$
the Troade,       and, for the second time, traversed that fertile
country.       We    paid a visit to the ancient site          of Troy    ;   saw
the sources of      the Scamander ; went along the shores                of the
Simois,     and thence      proceeded      to examine the ruins of the
Troy of Alexander.           We     stopped    half   a day at Ipsera ; went
on shore at Cape Sunium to             fee the    remains of the temple of
Minerva,      and     arrived at Athens on the 6th of May.                    We
did not remain above          twenty days in that city, which                  ex

 respecting     the present state of Athens and the neighbouring
 country,     to compare it with what it was formerly.                   I have
 seen   Mount Hymettus, the marble               quarries;   of Pentelica, the
 cities  of Eleusis    and Megara.        We     passed   through the Straits
 ef Salamis, where          the Persian       fleets   were    destroyed    ;  and
  traversed    the Isthmus      to    embark again          on the Gulph of

     It was time to terminate our observations                on the Ottoman
  empire, and to quit these countries, now barbarous, though
  formerly the feat of the arts,            sciences    and philosophy.         , It
  was   time to place      ourselves     under the ægis of the republic.
  We arrived        at  Corfu on the 14th of July,                after  having
  touched    at Cephalonia,       Ithaca, and Parga.            We performed
  quarantine      for   ai days.      It  was    not yet finistied,     and we
  began    to   think of continuing our journey through Italy,
  though embarrassed with a considerable collection, when C.
   Comeyras, commissary general of the directory, arrived. We
   immediately applied to him in order to procure                   a passage     to
   Ancona.       He    gave us reason        to hope that he would soon
   assign to us for that purpose         a small vessel belonging         to the
   republic ; and, in the mean time,              I  traversed the island and
   environs, sometimes alone, and sometimes with my colleague,
   to procure information        respecting      the natural productions          of

   On the 9th of September we          sailed  in the Brune frigate
for Butrento, where we spent the day,         and arrived at Ancona
in the  course  of a few days.     My colleague, who          had been
almost always indisposed      and   in    a state  of suffering    since
our tour through Persia, here terminated his career,             on the
3d of October 1798, in consequence of a malignant fever
brought on by fatigue. He has left a family in want, whom

drupeds, birds, reptiles, river fisti, insects, shells and minerals,
as well as  of medals,    engraved     stones, and other objects       of
antiquity.    I have Egyptian idols and mummies;             a selection
of drugs, most    of them unknown in Europe          ; a series  of  the-
medicines employed in Persia j and, in the           last place, some
rare and valuable manuscripts.          I  have just sent to the na

desert of Arabia, Syria, Cyprus, Asia Minor and Greece, in
order to be there sown and cultivated.           A  great number       of
those   which we   sent home before, have been already           reared,
and are in a thriving condition.

I   T  is well known that the Dutch kept their process for pre
paring turnsol blue a very great secret; and, in order to
mislead the public,         pretended      that it was made            from rags
dyed with the juice of the fun-flower                 (Heliantbus)j front
which it obtained its name.            Since the late revolution, how
ever,    in Holland, the true method employed by the Dutch
for preparing this colour has been discovered) and the process
is as follows :— That kind of lichen called orchil (Lichen ro*
tclla), or when that cannot be procured, the large oaK mofsj
after being dried and cleaned, is reduced to powoer, and by
means of        a kind of oil-press the powder is forced through a
brass sieve, the holes      of which     are small.       The      fisted powder
is then thrbwri into a trough and mixed              with an alkali called
*uetas;   which is nothing      else  than the     asheS     of wine       lees,   in
the proportion         of half a pound       of  ashes to one pound                of
powder;         This mixture     is  moistened      with      a    little   human
urine,     for that bf other aniirtals contains           less   ammonia,          by
which     a fermentation is produced ; and the mdistness is still
kept up by the addition of more urine:                       As soon as the
 mixture assumes a red colour, it is poured into another
trough     ;  is  again moistened        with urine*        and      then stirred
 round in order that the fermentation may be renewed;                              In
 the course of       a few days it acquires a blueifli colour, and is
then carefully mixed with            a  third part of very pure pulve
 rised potash j after     which the mixture           is put into           wooden
 pails, three feel in height, and             about half         a    foot broad.
 When       the third   fermentation takes place* and the                 paste   has
 acquired a considerably dark blue colour,                 it   is mixed        with
 chalk or pulverised marble,          and stirred well round that the
 whole may be completely united.               This     last substance          gives
 the colour no higher quality,           and is intended merely to add

     Professor
                    Hildebrant,             of Erlangen*.
 T,HOUGH               gold and silver have this common property,
 that they (hew little affinity for oxygen, and their calces can
 therefore be revived merely by ignition               ;  their difference      in
 other respects is       so great,    that scarcely any two metals can
 be more unlike.           Not only      is their colour     totally different,
 and the specific gravity         of gold   far greater than that      of silver,
 but silver,      in  the dry way,      forms a perfect      union with sul
 phur ; and in the wet way,               with   the sulphuric and nitrous
 acids; whereas gold has no affinity for these substances.
      If the transmutation        of  metals were therefore possible, the
  conversion       of  silver into gold would          be   very  improbable.
  We must, however,             consider    nothing     impossible   in nature,
  the impossibility of which             cannot be demonstrated         a priori.
  Each century, and, in the              present    active   age, every      short
  period of a century, discovers          new phenomena, some          of which
   are   of  such a nature that        they would      be considered      as  im
  possible, were not their reality sully confirmed by experience.
 ,    I  entertain no dread then of being ridiculed by the un
   prejudiced philosopher, if I call the attention of chemists to
   a phenomenon in which silver appear; to be converted into
   gold.      It is a well known process, which I repeat in every
   course    of my Lectures,       to dissolve  lilver that contains copper
   in pure nitrous acid, to precipitate the pure silver bv common
   salt (muriat of soda), in the form of horn silver (muriat of
   silver), and then to separate the silver from the latter by
   fusion with       mineral alkali.         An experienced chemist as-

fared me, that when silver is revived in this manner, it is in
part converted       into gold.        Since that time    I   have frequently
re-dissolved      in pure nitrous acid the silver which              I obtained
 from horn silver, and always found               a small quantity of black
 powder remaining at the bottom, which seemed to have all
 the properties     of gold.
     My  process for reviving the horn silver is perfectly simple:
 I  pour into a deep crucible a bottom of alkali an inch high,
 and form in it a hemispherical cavity with the round end of
 a cupel   rammer.        I  then put the horn silver, well pounded,
and mixed with as much alkali (neither                of them moistened)j
 into this cavity, cover the             whole with a thin stratum of
alkali, and apply a slow heat, till the whole mass comes to
 red fusion ; by which means the revived silver is enabled to
 fink down and         collect itself at the bottom.             As    vegetable
 alkali (potash) produces the fame effect as the mineral (soda),
 I employ the former because it is cheaper. I find by ex-*
 perience, that, to form          a  moist ball of the horn silver and
 alkali, is not only unnecessary,             but even prejudicial     ;  for the
moist mixture is tenacious, and unavoidably adheres to the
fingers and the vessels, thereby causing waste.                   As   the horn
silver is so extremely fusible,           and at the same time a flux for
earths, aiid     as it easily penetrates the crucible, the principal
object   in   reviving, according to the above method, is to in
crease the heat       by very slow degrees,          suffering the charcoal
to burn only gently for two hours around the bottom                       of the
crucible,     that   the    horn silver       may be in a      state   of  fusion
before the crucible has been long ignited.                 By    these means
the alkali is enabled          to   join itself gradually    to the muriatic
acid, and at the same time               so   completely    that, when        the
heat is increased      till  the alkali is in a red fusion, there is no
longer horn silver but metallic silver present, which there
fore may come in contact with the crucible without any
danger.
    For dissolving      the    revived     silver  I employ nitrous acid,
which    I  first purify by barvtes from the sulphuric acid, and

Enlightened chemists, however, will scarcely believe in this
transmutation, and will rather suspect some deception.      I
confess that       I   do not myself believe in               it,   and  I      explain the
appearance         of gold from the              revived horn silver             in the fol
lowing manner i^Notwithstanding the great difference be
tween gold and silver, some silver                  is   almost always present in
pure gold    ;     and    a   little gold   is   in like manner almost always
present     in   pure silver (in those commonly                     called pure).           The
case   is   the fame in these metals when                     worked,           particularly
in coins,     even where they are not alloyed one with the other.
In all the ducats             I    have     hitherto tried, even in those                       of
Holland,     Ifound, on dissolving them in aqua regia, a little
silver deposited in the form of horn silver.    In all French
crowns, even in the sine Harz florins which arc perfectly free
from copper,       I      found    a   little gold, which, when they were
dissolvedin the nitrous acid, was thrown down in dark                                  a
coloured precipitate, which could not proceed from the                                          al
loying.  Dutch ducats, for example, arc not, as far as                                          I
know, alloyed with silver; and no one certainly will believe
that the gold found in the Harz florins and French                                     crowns
was purposely added to them.                      The metal of            these coins has
from nature         a    small    portion       of foreign metals          ;     the gold        a
little silver,     and     the silver       a   little gold,        as   long    as   it   is   not

     It may be readily comprehended, that every chemist, unless
 he has very little experience in such processes, when he
 wishes to precipitate silver as horn silver, will first pour off
 and filter the clear solution of silver and copper from                                        the

terwards found in the fame silver, when revived from horn-
silver, could not be a portion                  of the   same gold      of which          a   part
had been deposited on the first solution                      of   the impure silver.

    the Observatory.
                [Concluded    from the last Volume, page 389.]
 I    SAW       at Strasburgh the         first slieets   of  a new map        of
Swisserland      constructed     by  M. Weiss,        to whom      M. Tralles
communicated          his triangles and bases.             This map is       ex
tremely well engraved,            and gives us an interesting topogra
phy of Helvetia.
    I  paid a visit,    in my    passage, to the observatory         of Man-
heim,      which     had   afforded    me so much          pleasure  in 1791;
but   I  found the instruments packed                up in boxes      and de
posited in vaults        which     the bombs had scarcely respected,
and waiting there for peace,            without which neither science
nor happiness         can exist.      The minister d'Arberg, whom I
requested to second the zeal           of M. Barry, shewed me every
mark of friendship.

    3^                   History      of Astronomy for 1798.
      On the 15th of December 1797, Tycho Brahe's birth
    day, Dr. J. Ch. Burckhard arrived at my house, This able
    astronomer, born at Leipfic on the 30th of April 1773,
    came to reinforce the astronomical corps in F ranee ; and he
    is engaged in a German pranflatjon of Laplace's Mecbanique
    Celeste, or La Tbeorie de VAttrgQion* now in the press. This
    important work will give the jast degree of perfection to our
    tables : two hundred pages of it are already printed.
      On the sarpe day I requested Gen.enal Bonaparte to pro
    cure a good instrument for the observatory; and on the 19th
    of March the government granted me 3000 livres to pur
    chase the seven and             half feet mural quadrant of C. le
                                      a
    Monnier.We               had long solicited good instruments for the
observatory. C. Cassini, when director in 1785, had ob
    tained a fund for that purpose                from the minister Breteuil ;
but      he had not time to make use               of it.        When   I   was direc
tor      in    1795     I    renewed       my solicitations,       and we were        at
length able to procure,                   the first time, for the most beautiful
observatory in the universe, an instrument worthy of France*.
The Bureau            des    Longitudes       has sent thither      an achromatic
telescope; but that is not sufficient.
   On the 30th of April I requested from General Bonaparte
10,000 livres lo erect the mural quadrant and the meridian
telescope of the observatory ; and to make at Paris observa
tions to correspond             with      thpsc made by his astronomers.              He
departed        top soon ; but Ncufchatcau,               the French minister,          iss
worthy        0/    remedying that deficiency, and gives us reason to

ecliptic corresponds, within second or two, with the table

    Op the 20th of June the Institute decreed                  the prize for
time-keepers,      used   in ascertaining the longitude at sea, to
two chronometers made by C. Louis Berthoud, the going of
which    was    observed    by C. Messier and myself during fix
months.       I carried one of them to Gotha; and                  I  had the
satisfaction of finding that a journey of two hundred leagues,
in  a carriage, did not make the change of                 a second per day
in its movement.         The Institute will       propose,     on the 4th of
January,     as  the subject    of   a prize to be adjudged            in two
years,  the theory of the comet           of 1770, which       was proposed
by the Academy in 1792.             It   has not hitherto been pofllbje
to calculate this comet but in an orbit              of   five years, and a
revolution    so short is  improbable.
   The Memoirs of the Institute for the Year IV. have ap
peared,     They contain my Theory of Mercury, the result
of forty years researches.          This was the first memoir read
in  the first sitting  of the first class    of the   Institute^ on the 1st
of January 1796.
    The Bureau des Longitudes            has published two volumes          of
the Connoijfance      des Terns   for the years      VIII.     and   IX., the
additions to which were edited under my                 inspection. It hag
determined that this work, in future, shall contain 500 pages,
 jn order that we may insert in it our observations and calcu
lations.     These two volumes contain a number of important
articles  : new catalogues of the stars ; tables of the moon'g
horary motion by Delambre              ;   observations      of Mercury by
Vidal, the great       and astonishing observer          of that planet, to
 whom we are indebted for being able to say that the obser
 vations of Mercury,        so rare and so      difficult before his time,
 are at present as numerous as those            of the other planets, and
 leave nothing more to be wished for on that head.                     He has
 alone done more than all the other astronomers                 of the world,
 either ancient or modern         ;   and    we may now dispense with
 employing      our attention on that subject.                C. Vidal    must
 make every other astronomer despair             of exceeding him.

         An   interesting memoir,                accompanied with            a   trigonome
    trical chart,      serving to reduce the apparent distance                             of    the
    moon from the sun, or from                   a star, to the true distance,                  and
                             of navigation, has just appeared, by
    to resolve other questions
    J. R. Maingon, lieutenant de frigate. This ingenious chart,
    of great utility to the navy, was engraved by order of the
    minister,        and   published at the d^pot.                   It will supply              the
    place of the large charts of AJargetts, and enable navigators
    to substitute operations with a pair of compasses for calcu
    lation.
     ,The Geographical Ephemcrides, undertaken by M. von
    Zach, of Golha, at the commencement of the year, are a
    remarkable and useful work,                  ,as there are     found in them every
    month       curious        observations;           information         respecting           new
    books and charts, new voyages and geographical maps, such
    .as those    of Ireland, Africa              and the Black Sea,              of   so   much
    importance at          a   time when         the    public     attention is directed
    towards these countries            ;     also       portraits,    such       as   those       of
    Herschel, Delambre, Sir Joseph Banks, &c.                          ;   in a word, every
    thing     that can be interesting to astronomers,                         geographers
    and navigators.            An   extensive correspondence                with all coun-
k
    tries enables      M. von Zach           to form a mutual communication
'
    between learned men, even the most distant from each other.
    The only inconvenience                 is,
                                  that the German language    not                           is
    sufficiently cultivated in the South.     have requested that

     M.  Triesneckcr,        of Vienna,       has published a considerable
work on eclipses of the fun and planets.                  He   has calculated
more than 150 observations, and the tediousness of such la
bour is well known.             Scarcely any thing of the kind had
been done        in 1760, when          I  began to give an example of
these calculations.
     We   are informed that a volume              of Bradley 's observations,
so   long expected,         has been       published at London. M. de
Mendoza published,            also at   London, in 1797, researches in
 regard    to solving the       principal problems of nautical astro
 nomy, with tables of versed sines for every ten seconds, and
 an auxiliary table which reduces the discovery of the true
 distance    to the addition        of five versed sines.
     We    have received the Ephemerides              of Bologna for       twelve
 years, from 1799 to 1810, by C. Mateucci,                       assisted   by C.
  Alamanni, Gugliclmini, Sacchetti, and Cantcrzani                       the son.
  Since the commencement of the present century,                       the   Aca
  demy of Sciences always published the Ephemerides for ten
  years.     The      last volumes are         by Desplaces, Lacaille and
  myself.      I   finiflied   at the     year   1800, old style:       the em
  barrassed state      of commerce         prevented   me from immediately
  finding    a    bookseller, and        I  therefore  renounced these cal
  culations.        The astronomers of Bologna,              more      fortunate,
  have    supplied      this deficiency;         and we    sliall have      twelve
  years materials to         assist  those    who wifli to make almanacks
  for that period.
      The Ephemerides of Milan contain the result of an im
   portant labour of C. Oriani, on the method of correcting the
   elements of the tables of Mercury by observation ; and many
   interesting observations         of C. Reggio and De Cesaris.
       M. Schrotcr, of Lilienthal, has published the second vo
   lume of his Astronomical Colletlions, which, besides other
    things,   contains the apparent diameters of the satellites:
                                                                             nine-

   M.   Bode, at Berlin, has published              a   new volume of his
Ephemerides        for the year 1801,          and a third supplementary
volume    ; which contain many astronomical observations                     and
memoirs, by the German, French and English astronomers.
This work, like that of M. von Zach,                  is a repertory which
no astronomer can be without.
   We     have received also a folio volume           of logarithmic tables,
published in 1794, by          M.    Vega, an officer      of artillery in the
«mperor's service.         Wlacq's       tables,   published in 1638 and
1633, had become exceedingly scarce; they were never re
printed,    and    yet  they were often wanted.                M. Vega      has,
therefore, rendered         a great     service   to mathematics          by rer
publishing that valuable edition.
   M.    Schubert has published, in German,                   at Petersburgh,
a large treatise    of astronomy, in three volumes quarto, form
ing altogether nearly 900 pages.
   The Billiotbeque Britannique of Geneva, for March                         and
April, contain interesting details respecting the method em
ployed by M. Blair to correct the difference of refrangibility
in telescopes. Essential oils, a solution of corrosive sublimate
in spirit of wine, with the addition of a little sal ammoniac;
 butter (muriat)       of antimony diluted in              a little   ether or
alcahol, mixed         with     a   few drops of the muriatic               acid,
answered      the purpose        extremely well,         when    inclosed     be
tween two lenses of crown glass *.                He formed a very good
object glass     with   a solution     of  sal  ammoniac        and mercurial
 sublimate (muriat of ammonia and mercury).                        He has dis
 covered that these different substances have not a like distri
 bution of colours,

 to correct the aberration         of sphericity.        This curious paper

hack the manuscript for three years.                We are obliged       to  C.
Pictet for having made it known in his excellent collection
the Bibliotbeque Britannique : the author calls these tele
scopes aplanatic, or without error.
    I   have published a new edition          of Rivard's Treatise on the
Sphere and the Calendar           5   a well written      elementary book,
which      has been useful      for half a century.         I  have added to
it the Republican Calendar, remonstrating against the defi
ciency of intercalation, as the decree of October the 3d
 1798 was not       in that   respect     agreeable     to what    I  had de
livered to     C. Romme.
     C. Francois     de Neufchateau         signalised   his entrance into
 the ministry by ordering an Astronomical Bibliography                    to be
printed.       I  brought with me from Germany a great many
 articles for this work; and I have found that no kind of
 bibliography can        be complete without           the co-operation of
 many       persons   in different countries.          The period of the
 death of the great Copernicus was still a problem, which I
 resolved during my journey.              He died on the nth of June
 1543, though Gassendi and Weidler say the 24th of May,
 and Planche the nth of July, in the interesting collection
 of Ephemerides, where the memorable events of each day
 are recorded.       I  have caused more than sixty manuscripts to
 be examined       in  the national      library.     C. Legrand,       one of
 the librarians of that celebrated            repository, gave me an ac
 count of many others         ;   so   that we are making advances' in
 this part of astronomical erudition.
     We     have received the observations          of C. Ratte      at Mont-
 pellier, C. Thulis       at Marseilles,      and   C. Vidal    at Mirepoix:
 those    of the last-mentioned astronomer             are  of  a very extra
 ordinary kind.         C. Vidal       saw   Mercury      at the distance     of
 three-fourths of       a degree    from the fun.        The beauty of      the
 climate, the perfection of his instrument, and the excellence
 of his    sight, have produced observations          as valuable    as singu
  lar :  I  have spoken    of them before.
                                                                           The

go                  tiijlory of AJlronomy for 1798.
    The direction of the observatory               at Amsterdam, belonging
to the Society Felix Mentis, has                 been entrusted       to M. Cal-
koen.     He    has been        at Gotha to exercise          himself with     M.
von Zach     ;  and    has     begun    a course       of  observations    which
will   be useful     in   a    country where none were ever made,
though the want of            a  navy must induce the government to
open their eyes in regard            to an object so necessary to navi
gators.    In vain did I        go to Amsterdam in 1774;               the Stadt-
holder and the Grand               Pensionary promised             every  thing  I
wished, and did nothing.              M.   van Swinden afterwards           made
some exertions, the effects           of which begin         to be felt.
    C. Henry, who went from Manheim                       to Petersburgh, has
been able to restore activity to the observatory                 of that capital.
He    has caused t      1 be    erected   the     large   mural quadrant by
Bird, which       had remained a long time in the packing-box,
and which Rumouski never made use of.
    M. Piazzi,      the astronomer           of Palermo,        is preparing to
measure a degree.            I   have   sent    him     an exact metre, and
they are employed on a complete                  circle.
    The minister, Pleville-Peley,             has increased        the salaries of
 the astronomers          belonging       to    the    marine observatory       at
 Marseilles,     where Thulis makes               continued       and   important
observations.
    The   survey   of Corsica, or description of that island, begun
 thirty vears     ago, has been finished.                 The large triangles
were laid down by C. Tranchot;                       the   minuter      operations
 were performed by a great number                   of  assistants.   The minis
 ter of finance        having commissioned me to examine this
 labour,   I   have   reason      to think that it is sufficiently correct
 to be taken as     a   model, should         a  like plan be adopted in re
 gard to all the departments of France, which would be highly
 useful.
     C. Perny, who        had been sent to Belgium, and who, since
  1795,  has   formed     forty triangles at Bruges, Ghent, Ostend,
 Antwerp, Middelburgh,              &c.    has     set  out for the Batavian

    On the 24th of January the Institute proposed to the
Directory to request the different powers of Europe to fend
learned men to France, to assist in establishing the new
measures,        and to sanction that establishment.                 Eleven have
 arrived from Denmark,               Spain,    Italy   and      Holland:       from
 Denmark,        M. Bugge,       director of the observatory, and known
 by some        important works;           from Spain,          Messrs.     Gabriel
 Ciscar and Augustine 1'edrayes; from the Batavian republic,
 C. van Swinden and Æneæ, the former well known by some
 excellent works on natural philosophy                 ;    from Tuscany,        M.
 Fabbroni     ;   from Sardinia,         Count     Balbo,       the minister       at
 Paris; from Helvetia, C. Tralles;                  from      1  ic Ligurian re
 public, C. Moltedo ; from              the  Cisalpine republic, C. Mas-
 cheroni,      from whom           General Bonaparte brought us what
 will  serve as a lesson to our most famous                 geometricians      ; and
  from the Roman republic, C. Franchini.
     On the      23d   of June     the legislative   body made         a law, that
  the Bureau       des  Longitudes should preserve the original stand
  ard of the metre, or of that new measure destined to be in
  future the type of all measures, and to prevent hereafter
  that confusion which has hitherto prevailed in the measures
  of all countries.
     Astronomv has         so  few proselytes     that   I   am happy in being
   able to fav that      Dr. Burckhardt,        who came from Gotha last
   year,   continues to labour with us at Paris, and that he is
   already one of our belt astronomers.
      Delambre        had    as   assistants  in his immense labour                C.
   Tranchot,       already well known           by the great         operations in
   Corsica, and        young     C. Poniard, who             devotes    himself to
   astronomy, arid who cannot fail to make                        a rapid progress
   under such      a master.      Astronomy has need of             a few   recruits;
   and   I do every     thing in my power         to procure them         ;  but the
   career   is laborious,        and    not lucrative     :   this is sufficient to
   explain why we have            so few.

ing    and good          moral qualities.                    Being       obliged to apply to
commerce,           he    is   not yet able to indulge his taste for astro
nomy     ;    but     he       calculates observations, and even                                makes

I announced the death of Toafdo, which happened at Padua
on the       1   8th of November.                       As      I      published     a   particular
eloge    of that       useful      astronomer in the Magazin Encyclope-
dique*,      I    shall here add nothing on the subjects except that
his place        is   supplied           in    the     observatory           of Padua           by   his

appointed administrateur general des pastes on account of
the esteem which Reveilliere-Lepaux,             the director, had for
his merit.       His new appointment did not                prevent    him
from applying to astronomy : talents rarely conduct to for

    Alexis John Peter Paucton died on the 15th of June. He
was born on the 10th of February 1732, near Lussan, and
is known by his Metrology, an immense collection                     of the
 measures    of all countries, which       appeared    in 1780. I pro
posed that labour,       and  furnished him with the greater part
 of the foreign measures ; but he added many researches, dis
 sertations,   and calculations respecting the ancient measures,
population and agriculture.            He employed himself on other
 parts  of the mathematics,       such as the Screw       of Archimedes.
 In the year      1781    he published a Theory         of   the  Laws of
 future, in which      he refuted     Newton and Nollet,          and esta
 blished a new geometrical foot of 123^ lines.                In that work
 he spoke of the pyramids of Egypt, &c.                  He was so fully
 persuaded    of the importance of his        discoveries,     that he as
 sumed this motto      :  E ptttco   veritas.    In the    last place,    he
 was    employed in reducing into decimal measures                 the  im
  mense number       of foreign     measures,   when the economy          of

and all those good qualities which could be wished. This
loss, a very great      one to astronomy, threw Beauchamp into
despair, and disgusted him with a voyage to Arabia; but the
minister sent him to        join Bonaparte      and the men    of letters
assembled     in Egypt,       where he will certainly contribute to
the success of that important            expedition,   in regard to the
geographical and astronomical parts.
    M. Reccardj who        had published various observations,       died
at Konigsberg on the 3d          of October.
    We     have   lost  lately also John      Francis Calle.    He was
born on the 25th of October 1744, at Versailles, where he
received a good education, and acquired an early taste for the
mathematics.         In   1768 he came to Paris, where he had an
opportunity of being more thoroughly instructed.                In 1774
he formed some distinguished pupils for the school              of engi
neers,    where the examinations          were strict, and admission
difficult to be obtained.         In  1779 he gained the prize pro
posed by the Society          of Arts   at Geneva,    for escapements.
In    1783 he completed his edition          of Gardiner's    Tables    of
Logarithms,       which were exceedingly convenient, of great
utility,   and   very Correct; and which possessed advantages
above all the others.         In  1788 he was appointed professor       of
hydrography at Vannes, afterwards at Dunkirk              ; and in 1792
he returned to Paris,          and was for a few years professor des
ingenieurs    geographies at the depdt      of war.    This  place hav
 ing   been suppressed,      he continued to teach in Paris, where
 he was always considered          as one  of the    best mathematical
 masters to whom pupils could apply.
     In  1795   he published the new stereotype          edition of the
 Tables of Logarithms, considerably enlarged with logarithmic
 tables of the sines, according to the new decimal division of
 the circle.    These are the first which ever appeared.        Towards
  the end   of   1797    he presented to the     National Institute the
                                                                     plan

   These labours had injured his health;            he had been a long
time asthmatic, and notwithstanding his condition he pub
lished, that yearj an excellent memoir on finding the longi
tude at     sea,  under the modest title of         A  Supplement     to the
Trigonometry and Navigation            of Bezout.      He   died   on the
 14th of November 1798, leaving behind him a daughter,
born at Vannes in 1793.            According to a tradition in the
family,      he was descended from Descartes.           I have not been
able to obtain the genealogy of his family; but it is sufficient
for the glory of Calle,        that he has done honour to          a  name
 so celebrated.
 VI.  Progress     of Dr. Mitch      ill   's  Mind in investigating      the
    Cause os the Pestilential Dislempers         which visit the Cities     of
    America in Summer and Autumn.                 Being a Developement
    of bis   Theory   of Pestilential Fluids,       as published     to   the
    World in     1 795,  and the succeeding Years *.
 JT had      a long time appeared       to    him, that what     had been
 mentioned by medical writers and lecturers under the names
 of miasma and contagion, was not treated of with the pre
 cision and certainty of knowledge, but discussed with all the
 indistinctness and conjecture of something only              guessed      at.
 And, while      a student at   Edinburgh,      he supposed the doctrine
 taught    in  the  university of the sedative operation of these
 poisons was true, until he heard from Dr. Brown, while at
 tending his lectures, a contrary opinion.
    Delivering his sentiments        on stimulants,     Brown had       said,
 "  Venena et contagiones incertius e6dem spectant."                   (Ele
 ments Medicinæ,          cap.  a. §  xi.)     This  implied   a doubt     in'
 Brown's mind, whether these classes of objects were stimu-
                      From an American Correspondent.
                                    D   %                              Jams.

g6"                    On  Dr. MitchilVs       Theory
lants or not.      This doubt is repeated in § xix. where, ex
pressing  his ideas of the manner the exciting powers act upon
excitability,    he seems to consider poisons and contagions as
exceptions to the general rule of action:
                                                    "  nifi quod venena
et contagiones excipi posse videntur."           And although, in the
two following paragraphs, he endeavours              to shew that these
substances    ajejlimulants, and     act upon the      living body after
the manner of other stimuli,         still he is so  wholly    silent as to
their nature and constitution, and          so entirely destitute of ex
perimental proof or demonstrative            reasoning, and withal       so
brief and   general in his remarks, that nothing solid and satis
factory is afforded in that part of his work which treats of
these matters.
    In conversation      with  this original      though      unfortunate
man, Dr.       Mitchill acquired incorrect information on the
matter of these poisonous substances and their manner of
acting  ;  the sum of Brown's         reasoning   but tending to fliew
that, as all other substances according to his hypothesis were
stimulants, poisons and contagions could not, from the nature
and analogy of things, act in any other way than by stimu
lation too.
    Thus it    appeared   to  Dr. Mitchill, when          he returned to
America in 1787, that that        field   of physical     science,   which
included the production,        operation, and extinguishment            of
poisonous fluids, lay almost waste and uncultivated. On turn
ing over the Encyclopædia, there scarcely appeared a subject
whose investigation promised greater good to mankind, or
fairer fame to the investigator, than the history of these nox
ious productions.       Not long    after this time the Medical        So
ciety of the State       of Delaware       proposed   a   prize-question,
" What was        the hurtful power which produced             the febrile
distempers of that region?" And Dr. Mitchill was solicited
by his friend Dr. Ed. Miller, then secretary of the society, to
compete for the prize.         But being at that time engaged in
the study of the     law, and also in the politics of his coun
try as a member of the legislature, be declined undertaking.
                                                                       any

 anything of     the   kind; but      observed,      "  that the mischievoua
matter would       be found        to   be   a gas, and an analysis of a
 portion of the atmosphere               there   would not fail to detect
 •what fort   of gas it was."
   Being     devoted      to other pursuits,         the subject of poisons
 hardly occurred to him afterwards,                that he recollects, as a
theme for contemplation,              until the year 1795, when the
following incidents         set  him seriously to thinking.         While on
a tour, that summer, towards the northern country,                       he had
ascended     towards the         sources   of   the   Kaats-kill,   and     been
engaged     among the         sublime and picturesque          scenery   of the
Blue Mountains, in the State of New York.                      On   a' shoulder
of the   eastern fide      of   a ridge, called the Pine Orchard,              he
very narrowly escaped being bitten                  by one of the rattle
snakes   which    infest that zone        of the mountains.          This    ser
pent, of the full-grown and largest size,                  lay basking in the
sun-stiine.    The    voyager      had walked       within   a foot and   a  half
of him     before he was discovered.              The agitation and whiz
zing  noise   of his rattle     led first to   his detection. When seen,
he was bent into        a  coil, and his head was erected apparently
to strike.    The   suddenness       of  the surprise, and the grand and
novel aspect of the animal,               prevented      for a moment         the
emotions of fear.          Dr. Mitchill, however, was soon brought
to his recollection by the cries and shouts of his companions,
who were terrified at the extremity of his danger.                       In the
mean time the animal crept quietly away, and Dr.                       Mitchill
escaped unhurt.         By the joint        efforts   of the company, this
fcrpent and his mate were drawn from their lurking-place
and killed.      In the dissection of their bodies, in which he
was aided    by William Cutting, Esq. and others, Dr. Mitchill
had an opportunity          of examining their fangs, jaws,             and re
ceptacles   of venom.           So narrow an escape, as it induced
him   to reflect,    led him afterwards to conclude,               that there
was very little of philosophical              information      to be derived
from Mead's        Mechanical        Account      of  Poisons  j and that in
                                       D   3                        Fonuna's

38                    On  Dr. MitcbilPs Theory
Fontana's Experiments, the general exciting cause           of  plague
and pestilence had been left unexplored.
    Another occurrence, during that excursion, had directed
his attention to the subject of poisons.          Dr. William M.
Ross, one of the party, had discovered that the Rbus Toxico-
dendron     grew at the foot of the Blue Mountains. And a
parcel of the leaves and stems of the plant were collected
and carried home, with the intent of repeating Alderson's
experiments with this venomous vegetable,              on persons af
flicted with palsy.
    From this tour     as  he was returning to the city        of New
York, he     learned with sorrow at Paughkeepsie,      a town eighty
miles distant, that    a  malignant    distemper    had broken out
during his absence, and that among other persons Dr. Mala-
chi Treat, then physician of the port,          had been carried     off
by it. Hastening back with all speed,          he saw and conversed
with   a number     of physicians,   and   found them divided in
opinion,     whether the yellow-fever,      for  so  the  disease   was
 called, existed in the city or not.      The majority    seemed dis
 posed to doubt or deny the fact.         A   short  time, however,
 was sufficient to convince all persons whatever, that            a  fad
 and terrible malady had made its appearance          among the in
 habitants.
    Impressed    a* he was  with  ideas about poisons,     it appeared
 to him at once, that the exciting cause of the endemic sick
 ness  of New York,    was as much a poison as the fluids secreted
 by the rattle-snake or the toxicodendron.          There was a dif
 ference, however, between the venom of pestilence and the
 poisons strictly denominated animal and vegetable; because
 the two latter were always the effect of vascular and glandular
  action with secretion    in living bodies ; whereas the former
 was the result of new combinations taking place in organized
  substances during their putrefaction and decay,         without any
  thing   like a secretory   function.     Herein, then,      seemed to
  consist the distinction    between   what might be called Com
                                                                   mon

 mon      Poison      and    Specific Poison;               the one being pro
duced by the corruption   of dead bodies, the other afforded by
secretion going on in living ones.
   The decisive method of gaining information concerning
this    Common Poison (venenum universale)                           must neces
sarily be an examination of every individual process going on
during the complicated work of animal and vegetable disor
ganization.       For this     purpose      Dr. MitchUl         had      planned a
set of experiments. But, before undertaking these, he de
termined to watch the operation of the poison already pro
duced,   it what it might, and
          be                                    observe    in what manner it
wrought the destruction of life.                 And, for this       purpose,     he
remained in the city until, the sickness was abating ; having
omitted no opportunity to witness                and collect facts          as they
occurred in the midst          of   pestilence   and death.
      Much   observation,in circumstances where the per
                               and
sons best calculated to make researches in science rarely
choose to expose themselves,             had led      Dr. Mitchill        to believe
that the history of         azote,      both in living and dead bodies,
would throw       aworld of light upon this department of phy
sics.     Accordingly he went to Plandome, hk country resi
dence on       Long Island,         and became        convinced,, by experi
ments made on the air extricated                 in   the abdomen         of putre
fying animals, that it was not merely carbonic acid gas, but
consisted also    of a    large quantity     of azotic air.         It   is remark
able, that, to avoid the obloquy too often levelled at experi
ments, he was obliged to conduct his processes with all pos
sible secrecy.
      But azotic air alone      seemed to possess         too little activity to
excite    the    horrid symptoms which                constituted    and charac
terised    the   distemper      he    had   so    lately witnessed.         Yet   he
knew, and there was no need           of any new experiment to prove
it,   that this very azote      did not always evaporate with caloric
in    the form   of air  ;   but in higher degrees of heat than that
of October, when his experiments were made, this acidifiable
hajis frequently connected itself with oxygen, and constituted
                                       D    4                                a   very

4d                             On      Dr. MitcbUVs          Theory
a very peculiar and destructive                      acid.        Such an acid poison,
he became persuaded, had deprived                            Mr. Hewson, Dr. Walsh,
Mr. Jones,            and other dissectors,           of their lives, by being ad
mitted to        a surface denuded                of skin. Dr. Latham's fact of
the servant poisoned by touching an agnail on his finger with
the flesh of a putrid hare which he was skinning, is of the
fame kind.              Immersion of these carcases in strong solutions
of alkaline           salts,    or the mere sprinkling them with pot-ash
or soda, would, he thought, have prevented those unpleasant
accidents.
     In   such cases           the product formed by the chemical union,
of -azote with oxygen, mingled with more or                                   less   of water,
and existing in a liquid form, poisoned onlv when the parts
of a living animal were brought into contact with      as                              it,   it
bespreads the surface                  which       produced       it.    But Dr. Mitchill
was convinced, that, in higher temperatures,                              when the surface
of   the earth was heated                       to 116 degrees, and even to 130              of
Fahrenheit's scale, this liquid poison took on occasionally                                  a
vaporisic        or aerial form, and was copious enough sometimes
to taint or infect             a   chamber,        a   house,     a     neighbourhood,       or
even      a   city.      In the former             case   it   injured none but those
who meddled with                     it,   in   the spots where         it   was produced    ;
in   the latter        it    rose into the atmosphere,                  and sallied forth    in
quest     of   prey, to distances               indefinitely remote.
  About this period of the inquiry Dr. Mitchill made an
excursion through  part of the State of New York, in con
                                a
sequence        of     an appointment from the Society for promoting
Agriculture, Arts and Manufactures,                               to explore       the natural
productions             of     the     country,        and    especially      to     determine
whether any mines of coal existed                            in   the neighbourhood          of
Hudson's          River.did not appear that any considerable
                                It
quantities of that article of fuel were to be found; but was                            it
           in the course of the expedition, that, in some
ascertained,                                                                                 of
the manufactories, where the alkaline salt of burnt-wood                                     is
extracted         to form the pot-ash and pearl-ash                          of commerce,
there was enough                 of        oxygenated azote        in the    atmosphere      \a
                                                                                      combine

                           of Pestilential Fluids.                       41
tombine with        a portion    of the alkali crystallising about the
 letch-tubs,     and   to    constitute salt-petre. The labourers at
 pot-ash works, though much exposed to night air, were                  sel
 dom visited by the ordinary fevers of the climate.
     His attention being thus called         to the properties   of alkalis,
 was soon engaged in a more minute investigation of the his
 tory of pot-asli, by the following incident.             Dr. Mitchill re
 ceived from the Chamber            of Commerce in Glasgow, a letter
  complaining of the bad quality of certain barrels of pot-ash
.and pearl-asli exported from New York under the inspector's
 brand, and proved by the bleacher at Paisley, to whom it had
  been fold, to possess hardly any qualities for whitening           goods.
  This letter was accompanied with a notorial copy of the pro
  ceedings in a suit at law brought by the bleacher at Parsley,
  plaintiff, against the commission merchant in Glasgow, de
  fendant, for damages on account of having fold him unmer
  chantable alkali ; in which the Court gave judgment for the
  plaintiff.    These papers were submitted to the Chamber of
  Commerce        in New York.           In   consequence     of this, Dr.
  Mitchill    was requested by the president         of that body,   a short
  time after, to visit with him the stores of the public inspectors
  of pot-am     and pearl-asli     in the city of New York.         Among
  many other facts which were collected during this visitation,
  it was related by the inspectors, that, while the labourers in
  the pot-asli store kept themselves            at home and were     within
   the influence of the alkali, the pestilential air of the city had
  not affected any of them with           disease ; and   Dr. Mitchill dis
  covered afterwards, that        if these  very labourers exposed them
   selves to the   noxious gas in the air abroad, they sickened and
   died like other people.
      While    these things were under consideration, the Legisla
   ture of the State assembled.           At that time      there was con
   siderable  conversation     throughout the United States concern
   ing  the internal and domestic means           of defending  the country
   from invasion by      a  foreign enemy.         A  man appeared with a
   project   for setting      up a manufacture         of salt-pctre in the
                                                                     neigh-

 4A                  On Dr. WitchilVs Theory,         &c.
 neighbourhood       of the city of New York.            On this project
 Dr. Mitchill was       consulted.       The man's intention      was to
 have    petitioned for the privilege          of having the dirt      and.
 scrapings    of the    streets as a reward for keeping them clean.
 And from this         mass    of nuisance,    -whose   vapour in the hot
season gave the people their        yellow severs,    he intended to ex
 tract the nitre.      Aster much consideration of the project it
 was finally given up,      as  about that time the Secretary     of State
 reported    to Congress that a         considerable    quantity of that
 material had been brought to           Philadelphia from some part of
 the western country, and that any quantity required               for the
 public defence might be procured from that quarter.
    From a comparison of all the facts which had thus come
 to hi* knowledge, Dr.         Mitchill found that     some  of the prin
 ciples   in which     he had      been   instructed, were    not so well
 established' as they ought to have          been.    A   number   of the
 darling prejudices of his education were in danger of being
 overturned. And he, for some time, experienced no small;
 degree   of affliction   at the thought     of rejecting much of what
 he had learned      from books and lectures, concerning             acids
 and alkalis, as groundless        and untenable doctrine.
    The fluids, whether liquid or aeriform, which pot-ash
 could coerce, and which, as they emane from putrefying
 bodies, combine with that alkaline salt into nitre, thus ap
 peared to be the very noxious miasmata              which vitiated the
 atmosphere     and rendered       it sickly and unwholesome, when
 there was too little       alkali or none at all to attract them.
 These seemed to be evidence enough to convince him, and
 any body else who would examine the facts as he had done,
 that some combination of azote with oxygen was the simplest
 and most common form of poison.
    At   the  seme    time he was perfectly aware that what he
 thus called     a  poison, was what mankind             knew under the
 name of the nitrous acid        ;  that nitre was called a great anti
septic ; that the acid was classed among the mineral acids, and
 was reckoned a great antiseptic too ;         with  a multitude   of say
                                                                      ings

ings of this fort.             He     therefore     apprehended         that the old and
rigid adherents           to these names, and to the modes                      of thinking
associated     with them, would                   scarcely have patience              enough
to listen to any modernised,                   or, as they would term               it,   new
fangled statement of the facts.                      This difficulty         was the more
formidable,          as   it   was found necessary eventually to make an
innovation upon the French nomenclature itself.
   To facilitate his own conceptions of things, rather than to
affect novelty or attract proselytes,                        and also to render his ex
pressions    of      these things more correct and easy, he proposed
what he deemed an allowable amendment to the nomencla
ture, by expunging azote,                      azotic, nitrous, nitric and their
derivatives, and \.akmgfepton                       for the radical term, with sep-
tous, septic,         &c.       as the preferable             epithets.       He conceived
 he had    a   right to make use               of   a   nomenclature of his own,              if
 he pleased    ;     while others,         if  they preferred          it,   were at liberty
 to adhere to the old one.

    Crude Iron.   By Mr. David Mushet              the Clyde                   of
    Iron Works.                Communicated             by   the Author.
 TiHE          tenacious            lava     which      is   formed when iron ores or
 iron stones are fused without the addition of any other sub
 stance,     first    led to the application                  of   calcareous       earths,     in
 various proportions             ;    that   a   fluid sufficiently thin and divided
 might      be formed,              and      the iron        disengaged       from its vitrid
 connections, precipitated to the bottom of the furnace. If
 the nature and mixture of the ore are well understood, the
 quantity of lime necessary to restore                        a   just equilibrium of pro
  portion      in    the       lava   will    be readily attained
                                                the metal, no             ;
  longer incorporated with or suspended in the mass, will be
  come completely revived, and flow from the furnace suffi
  ciently purified from its earthy mixtures.
                                                                                          Before

    44                         On the   Use    of Calcareous          Stones in
         Before this principle was understood                          and generally acted
    upon, the result             in iron, from           a   given quantity of ore, must
    have      been very uncertain,                   and its real value in the smelting
    furnace falsely appreciated                  :    even at this advanced              period      of
    improvement, and attainment of scientific knowledge,                                         it is
    much to he doubted                  if the       principle of application            of calca
    reous earths, in the blast furnace, is radically understood.
         If an    almost total want              of knowledge concerning the na
    ture, proportions, and variety                  of the earths united to the ores,
    prevail at the various manufactories of iron in Britain, we
    are not to wonder that tlie application                       of lime-stone is subject
    k>   great error, and productive                     of hurtful    consequences.
         In   the smelting process               the three        great        springs of action
    and government in the manufacture                                 ought to be — a com
    plete revival         of all     the metal contained              in   the ore — to confer
    value upon           it,   by   reviving   it     saturated   with     a    sufficient quan
    tity of carbon — and                to use ever)' endeavour to increase the
    quantity      :   still, however, keeping in eye the produce of iron
    from the ore, and its quality                    ;   both of which may be easily
    impaired bv too much eagerness after quantity.
      To deprive an ore of its iron,  that no portion        so                          ofit   fliaH
    escape     in   the scoria unrevived, two things are indispenfibk                                :
i    .   The      metal        contained in the ore must be presented                           to   a
portion of fuel sufficient to take up the oxvgen from the
metal,  a. As this revivification goes on in the manner of                                           a
    metallic        perspiration upon the softened surfaces                         of    the ore,
    another agent ought to be present to facilitate the separation,
    bv uniting with the earthy parts of the ore                            ;   forming   athinly
    divided lava, no longer capable of retaining the                                 globules of
metal, or of preventing the congenial affinity of the carbonic
principle from taking full effect for the improvement of the
quality of the iron.
         Experience has shewn, that an excess                              of any particular
.earth        may        be     corrected        by      applying     one opposite            in its
¦effects      ;   and that the addition                of lime, in various proportions,
is       found      in   most       cafes to answer the desired end                 :    this once
-                                                                                   understood,

                      the   ManufaQure of 'Crude Iron,                                           43
tmderstood,       it will    be easily comprehended, that as iron stones
and ores     possess    widely different proportions of mixture, their
fusion will be productive of vitrid fcoriæ, various in their
degrees     of division       and tenacity.          This       leads to a conclusion,
the justice of which cannot be doubted, that since the various
mixtures of iron ores are productive of lava,                                     which tends
more or      less to keep the           iron from separation,                     it   becomes      a
necessary study to obviate the imperfections                            of   such mixtures,
¦and   at all times to regulate               the proportion            of   the calcareous
earth, from       a   knowledge of these mixtures and their effects,
and not from an             implicit     reverence        to the customs               of   a senior
wstablisliment.
   If    the various classes              of iron     stones are fused                 in contact
\vith charcoal, without                 the addition       of   a   flux or solvent,              the
result    is,   from calcareous iron stone,                a    larger portion of iron
proportioned to the intrinsic richness of the ore, than from
argillaceous iron stone; and from the latter,                            a    larger produce
of iron, than from             an ore whose          chief mixture            was silex: the
scoria produced             in the respective        operations always demon
strates, from its colour and opacity, the probable quantity                                        of
iron which still remains to be taken up.
   There are some calcareous iron stones which contain lime
almost sufficient to form the necessary quality of scoria, the
colour      of which, when              freed from the metal, possesses                      a   con
 siderable degree        of transparency. When      number of these a
 iron stones are        used in the blast furnace, much less quantity
                                                                    a
of calcareous          earths      is   necessary.        It    sometimes              happens      at
 iron works,          whose     chief supply         is   derived from             a   calcareous
 field of iron stone, that,              by
                            using great proportion of an in
                                                     a
 dividual ore surcharged with lime, the operations of the
 furnace are obstructed, and consequences entailed fatal to the
 interestof the manufacturer. From an excess of pure calca
 reous earth being present in the furnace, the scoria, thick and
 curdled, becomes              attached        to the fides         and bottom                 of the
 furnace    j    the quantity hourly increases, till                         it   has accumu
 lated to such        a     degree as to intercept the ascent                      of       the blast,

either totally rejected, or used in the most sparing quantities                                     s
whereas, had the quantity of calcareous                                earth   been propor
tioned to that contained in the iron stone, the fame ore might
have been advantageoufly smelted,                            and   a   considerable          quan
tity of lime saved.                  The     same happy effects might also have
been produced              by   combining with the calcareous iron stone,
one containing          a   large         proportion of clay or sand                ;   in    some
situations,      where      a   variety of lime              stones are found, the fame
consequences           may be effected                    by   applying one          less    pure,
mixed with        a    proportion of clay and silex.
     A   similar excess of clay in the argillaceous genus of iroa
stones,     is   fraught with the fame fatal effects to the produce
in metal from          the blast furnace             j    and many such ores                of iron
are totally rejected, merely because their improper application
was found productive of consequent                              effects.       The fusibility
of lime and clay, individually, much facilitated   the ad
                                                     is                              by

excess      in the   ores, they ought either to be combined                                  in   the
blast furnace        with       siliceous         iron stone, or treated with               a   lime
stone containing           a    considerable           portion of sand.
  Again,                  in the manufacturing of crude iron,
                 instances occur
where ores sufficiently rich in iron are totally rejected, as
being incapable of affording    quality of crude iron for the
                                                   a
purpose      of melting.              It     is   found that an excess of soch iron
stone always changes                  the colour of the scoria,                     and      that   a
considerable portion                  of the         metal     goes to effectuate                 this
change in the state of an oxyde united with the fused earths.
These ores are of the most fusible nature, combined with                                            a
heavy proportion            of       silex  ;but still capable of being treated
in   such   a    manner         as   to afford their iron of valuable quality,
                                                                        a
^hen this mixture                    is   fully   ascertained,      the fusibility           of the

   From this it will appear evident, that the addition of cal
careous earths, in just proportions, will form with most ores
a vitrid alloy,        thinly divided,        and to which               the metal has            so
little affinity, that it becomes abandoned                         by the former at ast
early    stage   of   separation,       and, being exposed to the combina
tion of the carbon,                is beneficially and             richly revived-,               In
this operation lime maybe considered                               as    introducing         into
the furnace a considerable                quantity of carbonic acidj                        [it   is
always used in the raw state] which becomes decomposed in
such  manner as to furnish the iron with
        a                                  small portion of         a
carbonaceous           matter.         The   effects    of this         extension       of prin
ciple are however much limited,                        as the carbon afforded                     by
the decomposition of the carbonic acid can never enable the
iron     to take up this principle              from     it   in        a    crude concrete
state, capable         of constituting fusibility,             ft       may, however,             by
uniting to       it   in   a   neutral state, call     it into metallic existence4
and enable the carbon afforded                     by   the fuel to distribute its
fusible principle over             a   larger portion of metal.                     Lime-stone
therefore ought never to be considered                        as   a    general        substitute
for fuel in the blast furnace, though in some                               cases    the effects
produced         by   its application are similar.             Its influence extends
no farther than to correct the unequal mixtures                                  of some    ores)
and facilitate their separation                and carbonation               ;   an improper
application         of     its kind     or quantity         may be productive                     of
evils    of   as great      magnitude        as those   it   was meant to remove.
In no        cafe where       a   just proportion of ores and mixtures exist
in   the furnace, and where the result from                             a    real scarcity         os'
fuel    is   Oxygenated          iron, can the addition            of lime confer car*
bonatioh to the metal.
     These facts render the application                     of lime-stone              a   mattes
of attention,         and not       of chance, depending on an accurate
knowledge of               the    component parts of the ores and their
effects,      and     not on certain           portions        being           customary at
works of similar establishment*                        When         a       scarcity    of lime
exists     in the     blast      furnace, and     a    superior quantity of clay

  48                    On the Use      of Calcareous       Stones in
and silex is combined with the iron stones, the lava will flow
 from the furnace comparatively cold, tenacious, and of a
 brown       or pale dirty green colour,                containing         iron   :  when
 the mixture is just,              the colour of the scoria is pure white,
 enamelled with            a  variety of blue shades, waving, circular, or
formed in straight delicate lines, arifing from a peculiar ex
 isting modification of a minute portion of the metal. Should
 lime be added in excess, the quality                   of the iron will not               be
 improved,         but the quantity considerably diminished.                          This
 loss takes place in two ways ; when                    the iron is oxygenated,
 the presence of an extra quantity of fused earths facilitates
 the oxydation of the metal, whenever it comes into contact
 with atmospheric air *.                The    strong current         of air from        the
 discharging         pipe affords       ample opportunity for this oxyda
 tion;    the      small globules of metal deflagrate and become
 combined with a great portion of oxygen ; the want of car
 bon in the furnace prevents                  any part of the oxygen                  from
 being again removed j the oxydated                       iron incorporates with
   * As    I  have frequent occasion      to use the two verbs,        to oxygenate,      and
to oxydatc,      I  shall express the precise meaning          I   attach   to two words
which are sometimes indiscriminately               used, and to which it has been
thought    thnr    M.   Lavoisier   had affixed no separate     or distinct meaning.         1
have  used oxygenate to express the progressive combination                of oxygen with
the metal, without, however,          destroying its metallic fracture,       or exhibiting
internally the smallest appearance of an oxyde.               Oxydation,      on the other
hand,   I have always used to express the final consequence of the combina
tion of oxygen with iron, and the complete change from a metallic state
to that of a detached friable oxyde.             For example,       crude   iron run from
the furnace, of a white fracture,          is said to be oxygenated.            In  cooling,
being exposed       to atmospheric      air, it acquires    a   considerable quantity       of
blucifh oxyde;        its surface nay then justly be said         to be oxydated.        It is
the fame with malleable iron and steel; each of these suffer in quality from
the affinity oxygen       has to combine       with them,      at   a  high temperature,
before the least diminution         of metallic   fracture    takes place;      and in that
state I  have always         considered  them    as oxygenated.          When, however,
this was    past,   and the combination      of oxygen had destroyed every property
ef metal, I have considered this only          as a state  of oxydation.
                                                                                        the.

the scoria floating upon the surface of the precipitated metal,
changes        its colour,         and    in issuing from the furnace conveys
a complete change                 of form       and deposition.
     Should      it,   however, happen that an extra quantity of lime
is   added when the iron                 is   already     richly carbonated, then the
metal lost      is   no longer in the           state    of fused pxyde incorporated

with     the scoria, but            in   small      metallic globules, completely
enveloped,       unable to penetrate the curdled mass and find their
way to the bottom of the furnace.                               This curious phenome-'
non arises from the peculiar nature of fused calcareous                                   earth,
which, while           it   possesses    no great degree of tenacity                 as   a   fluid,
yet forms       a    consistency    through which iron with all its supe
rior density         is   not able to penetrate when cold, such scoriae

of this scoria, obtained from the blast furnace, with triple
strata     of regularly deposited globules of super-carbonated
crude      iron, from half an inch to the smallest diameter.
     The      strict analogy existing betwixt                    lime stones and ores,
in   the variety and proportions                    of    the earths combined                  with
each, renders the investigation of both equally necessary, and
requisite to be performed in connection with each other.
     There      are       advantages           to   be    derived     from
                                                                thorough     a
knowledge            of     the    component parts of iron stones, which
may not at first sight                    strike        the manufacturer         :    where          a
variety of situations                offer,     this knowledge will direct him
•to an       establishment           where the iron stones are of                    a    nature
most likely to suit his views.      Where melting pig iron for
sale    is  the chief object, calcareous iron stones mixed with
silex    and nearly destitute of clay possess the greatest advan
tages.        Iron     made from this class                of   ores never possesses any
great degree           of strength; this, however, in                  the casting            busi
ness:in general,    reckoned its greatest property

fused with less fuel, less waste of metal, and the articles made
from     it   exceed those made from stronger iron, in the smooth
ness    of their       surface and in the solidity                of their parts.
     Vol. IV.                                       E                            Analogous

£6                      On    the Use       of   Calcareous     Stones
     Analogous to these facts,                    we daily fee the superiority                of
situation evinced, and cœleris paribus larger products in iron
obtained from           a general       use      of   calcareous     iron       stones than
any other.          This superiority               is derived      from the congenial
mixture of         the ore, combined with a large proportion                         of   limey
which facilitates             the carbonation           of   the metal ; and           united
with a just portion of sand to constitute                          fusibility,       the same
column        of    blast     will, in        the     same time,         reduce      a much
greater quantity            of   it,   affording the iron at the same time
sufficiently carbonated, than of other iron stones differently
combined.
     On the other hand, where                      the intention      of    the manufac
turer   is   to fabricate        a   quality of iron         possessed     of   every requi
site for converting into good malleable iron,                            calcareous         iron
stones,      in quantity, ought                  to be avoided,      arid those        of   the
argillaceous            and      siliceous        classes    substituted.         Those of
equalised      mixtures          of earth, combined with pure argilla
ceous ores, afford             the strongest quality of crude iron; capable
of being melted to advantage for the construction of heavy
pieces of machinery, or used for the purposes of the forge.
In the use of these classes, however, g>eat strength and quan
tity will be frequently found at variance, when the quality of
the metal          is   wished       to be preserved            carbonated       :   this also
arises from the nature                 of   the mixture       in   the iron stone;          clay
in quantity, united with various proportions of lime, forms
an alloy, more difficult to fuse than where lime in quantity
is   united with various proportions of silex.
     Where nature             has bestowed mixtures productive                       of   every
quality of crude iron,                 the proper arrangement               of   ores would*
become simple and easy; just combinations of mixture super
sede the necessity of changing the quality of the lime stone
added for     a    flux, or of having recourse to various qualities of                        it,
in order      to assist or correct the deficiency                   of   the native mix
ture.        Wherever the ores are of                  a    structure thus deficient,         it
then becomes the province of the manufacturer to ascertain
the mixture of the individual ores which compose his supply,
                                                        and

                  in the Manufaflure         of Crude Iron.                   51
and to restore that equilibrium of parts by the proper appli
cation of superadded earths, which experiment and observa
tion have proved to determine            a  certain quality of iron.
    Those works whose situation             enables   them to draw their
supply from fields of iron stone, impressed with all the vari
ous characters      of mixture,       possess   many advantages which
those more insulated       are frequently deprived         of.   With equal
ease   ought the manufacturer             to be able     in  'these cases     to
fabricate with certainty       a  quality of iron capable of forming
to advantage the most minute piece of casting, or the heaviest
piece of ordnance ; at pleasure he might form a quality sit
for the forge,     or of value in the pig iron market.                In short,
where such variety of ores exist, iron of every quality, com
prising fusibility and strength,          may at pleasure be manufac
tured, suited to the many and various wants of                      a  foundry
and    forge.
    Failing,   howev'er,  of this universal      assortrhent    of iron   stone,
 nature has in many places kindly formed                 a  competent sub
stitute, in the great variety and quantity           of lime     stone   which
are found     within   easy reach     of   the  blast furnace; possessing
component parts widely different from each other;                       from a
state  of  the greatest purity,     to the heaviest alloy        of  heteroge
neous mixtures       j sometimes      so  far debased    as  not to be justly
appreciated when ranked under the class of lime-stones.
    A want of analytical knowledge in the manufacturer may
often lead to the purchase         of  such qualities as may be super
fluous, from the variety of his ores, or which are diametri
 cally opposite    in quality    to those which ought to have beert
 applied. I shall here annex the analysis of the princip'al
 lime-stones used at the Clyde Iron Works, which from their
 superior situation, having easy access to the eastern or western
 oceans,     can at pleasure      draw their supplies         from    a greater'
 number of quarters than any other work in Britain.
    The   silence  of provincial historians        respecting     the consti
 tuent parts of various limes is            a second   inducement to fur
nish such a table, which may enable the husbandman to                        de-*

resembles          chalk,     and    differs    only   from       it  in  its  hardness,

      From what has been stated, we are led to inquire into the
  •ause    which produces effects          so  widely different in the fusi
  bility and strength of crude iron.               The    existence    of calcare
  ous, argillaceous and siliceous earths in the blast furnace, has
  been mentioned as effecting these changes ; and it has been
  also noticed that, under certain mixtures              of these, determinate
  qualities of   crude iron are produced.
      If  a  predominancy         of    calcareous      earth     is used    as the
  standard for comparison,           with   a local proportion        of fuel, we
 find that in proportion          as. the  lime is diminished in quantity,
 and clay added through the medium                   of  the ore, the quantity
 of   metal   produced      will   be less, but its        strength    greatly in-r
 preased ; and      if the argillaceous        ores are pure, the carbona-
 fion of the metal will             be little altered.         Should     siliceous
 mixtures be applied in place of argillaceous, we find that, in
 proportion as lime decreases, and the quantity of sand in the
furnace is augmented, the quality of the iron becomes less
carbonated,       less   fusible, and its small           portion of strength
greatly impaired :         sand through the medium of the ore may
be added, so as to render the iron as brittle                  as glass,    and as
white in the fracture          as silver.
     Again, let    a   predominancy of siliceous earths in the blast
furnace be the standard for comparison                ; in proportion     as these
are diminished by the addition             of argillaceous       ores, the metal
will   pass from the     state  of extreme brittleness and oxygenation,
to a state comparatively stronger and containing more carbon.
Should calcareous iron stones be added,                     their addition will

immediately correct the pernicious effects of the silex,                  and
facilitate the carbonation of the metal             ;  but will not confer
any great degree of additional strength.              Lime may be added
to such excess      as to render the      continuity of the particles of
iron   so small as to be easily       divided into granulated masses,
forming     a true    plumbago.
    From    a  consideration of these results, we are led to attri
bute to calcareous        earths the property      of facilitating the   car
bonation of the metal where an improper combination exists;
which property is derived from the carbon of the acid with
which they are neutralised. To argillaceous ores we ascribe
strength, without having the tendency of destroying the
carbon, merely because these ores contain a very considerable
portion of lime ; their union counteracts the natural fusibility
imposed      by lime, and at the same time is productive of
strength.       Siliceous iron stones are viewed less favourably,
being nearly destitute of lime; the iron in the furnace
varies in principle from the development of its mixtures,
and only depends upon the quantity of carbon furnished by
the fuel to become          saturated     with  a sufficiency   to constitute
fusibility.
    The    exclusive predominancy           of lime   and silex apart tends
in the smelting          process   to    reduce   crude iron      to its  two.
greatest extremes        of quality, carbonation         and  oxvgenation ;
both of which        states are   equally destitute of strength.         Clay
 acts as the restorer      of  these disproportions,       and by a happy
combination         produces    the   medium      of   the   two extremes,
which     is strength    and undiminiihed        quality.
    Were     siliceous    iron stones universally combined with               a
larger portion of oxygen than the other classes, another clue
 would be furnished to explain why siliceous                 mixtures were
 less congenial to the existence          of carbon in    the blast furnace,
 than those of lime and clay           ;   and  why the metal       obtained
 from the former is always more oxygenated                    with the fame
 portion of fuel than that obtained from the latter. Although
 1 am convinced that this frequently is the cafe, yet, as I have
                                                                           not

VIII.      Account           of    Bugs found in hollow Trees, with Observa
            tions on that Phenomenon^               By S. Oedman *.
IT        is
          a       well known prejudice among the country people in
Sweden, that they believe the house bug takes up its residence
in   the common yellow wall lichen,                                  which grows under the
juniper      bushes,           &c.   ;     but,      as    far     as   I   have    been     able to
learn,      no entomologist ever yet found the real house bug in
standing trees, and therefore                              the following new observation
seems to be worthy                       of attention.             Last August some work
men,        who             were cutting             wood on an island                   in Namdo
Sound,           sat   down under               a   hollow alder          tree in order          to    cat
their dinner.                One of them having accidentally made                                a   noise
near the trunk,                    aroused      a    bat     {"J esp.    murinus),       which was
immediately                 seen    to    fly   out from         a      hole in the       side       of it.
Being desirous to know whether there were any more animals
of       the fame           kind in the trunk,               these wood-cutters gave                  it a
violent stroke,               and     a   mass was heard                 to drop,    which one of
them pulled out with his hand, and found to consist merely
of bugs.        impossible they could be deceived in regard
                       It    is
to vermin              so   well known          ;    and what rendered                   the circum
stance       still      more certain, was, that they found under the
wings of the bat, real bugs, which had taken up their abode
there, together with the usual insects that infest these ani

quarts.   M. Blix, who was at great pains to examine this

hollow           tree     two concave         places        filled with straw                    and soft
earth, in which the bats probably kept their young                                           ;    for the
old ones when                   they sleep generally suspend themselves                                by
the hooks            of their wings.             Some time after,             M, BHx having
heard that a bat had been seen                        to    fly   into   a       hollow          tree on
the island where he resided,                      repaired        to the place, and drove
from the tree thirty-seven bats.                           It     accidentally came into
his head to examine with                     a   stick     the roof      of their dwelling;
and when he drew out the                         stick he observed           the end of                 it
covered with bugs.                    He     made     no farther examination till a
few days before Christmas, when the tree was felled                                       ;       but at
this time neither bats nor bugs were to be seen.                                        He, how
ever,    discovered              that this tree had lodged guests of various
descriptions          ;      for the lower part had been inhabited by bats                              ;
the roof         of     the cavitv      by   bugs;       the middle bv. nut-peckers,
and the top               of   the tree bv    not altogether
                                                 a   squirrel.         It    is
improbable that the bugs had been carried thither from some
habitation            by     the bats, especially          as   they were found,                  in   the
first cafe, on an island totally separated from                                   the continent,
and on       which           there was not       a   single house.           It    is   more diffi
cult to explain how such    multitude of bugs could find
                                              a
nourishment on two or three dozen of bats   but instances                    ;
have been known                  of    stone buildings infested               with such             ver
min, remaining                 above   a   year uninhabited,             and yet these in-i
sects,   so   far from being extirpated, have not even been lessened.
We can           scarcely then give any other explanation,                                   than by
supposing that bugs eat each other when they have no other
nourisliment   and that the loss thence occasioned
                        ;                          supplied                             is
by   their        great        multiplication.           The         cause       why     no        bugs
were found when the last mentioned                                   tree was       felled, may
have been, that they were destroyed                             by   the birds.         In confir
mation of the above,                  M. Carlson         adds the following circum
stance   :       "    In the     year 1777,"          fays he,

rotten stake,             that had been used for                a    support in         a        hedge,
which      was          so   covered with house bugs that                    it   resenabled           an

formed part of           a  building, or been near one              ;   but   I was as
sured by a peasant that he had cut it down not far from the
spot, and that it had never been employed for any other pur
pose.       As this       stake was not         hollow,       and    could afford no
shelter to bats,         it does not appear           how these bugs could be
conveyed         to it from     a house.      There is reason to conjecture,
rather, that these insects live and propagate even in timber.
That they         are able to endure the winter cold is beyond all
doubt.         I   exposed     a piece     of furniture         to the open air for
three years, and every summer bugs                        were    observed upon        it
jn   great abundance.

 I   F   a   tin bason be filled with soap-suds,                      lime-water,      or
 a strong       ley, which is still better, and              if  you then lay hold
 of   the bason with           both your hands, having first moistened
 them with pure water, and                   apply the tip of your tongue to
 the fluid in the bason, you will immediately be sensible of an
 acid    taste    upon your tongue, which is in contact with the
 alkaline liquor.            This  taste is very      perceptible, and, for the
 moment, pretty strong              ;  but it is changed          afterwards into a
 different one, less acid but more saline and pungent, until it
 at last becomes          alkaline and sharp in proportion                  as the fluid
 acts more upon the tongue, and as the activity                          of its peculiar
  taste   and its       chemical power, more called forth, produce a
  greater effect in regard to the sensation of acidity occasioned
 by the       stream     of the electric fluid, which, by                 a   continued
  circulation,       passes   from the tin to the alkaline liquor, thence
  to the tongue, then through the person to the water, and
  thence to the tin again.               I explain the phenomenon in this

manner, according to my principles ; and indeed                                       it cannot
be explained in any other,                   as every          thing tends to confirm
my assertion, and to prove it in various ways.                             The contact of
different conductors,               particularly              the
                                                             metallic, including
pyrites and other minerals                as       well as charcoal, which I call
dry conductors, or of the sr/1 class, with moist conductors,
or conductors of the second class, agitates or disturbs the elec
tric fluid, or gives it a certain impulse.                           Do not    afle     in what
manner        :   it is enough that it is a principle, and                          a   general
principle.          This impulse, whether produced                        by attraction or
any other force, is different or unlike,                            both in regard to the
different metals and to the different moist conductors,                                  so   that
the direction, or at             least the       power, with which the electric
fluid is impelled or excited, is different when the conductor
A        is applied to the conductor                   B,    and    to another      C.        In   a
perfect circle of conductors, where either one of the second
class is placed between two different from each other of the
iirst class, or, contrariwise,                   one        of the    first class     is placed
between           two of the second class different from each other,
an electric stream            is occasioned             by the predominating force
cither to the right or to the                    left — a     circulation of this fluid,
which       ceases    only when the circle is broken,                        and which is
renewed when the circle is again rendered complete.                                           Thia
method of connecting the different conductors will be more
readily comprehended by turning                              to the figures,        (plate     I,)
where the capital letters denote                        the different conductors or
exciters smoteursj of the first class, and the small letters those
of   the     second     class.     Fig.      I    and a express the                 two cafes
above mentioned.
     I   consider    it as   almost superfluous              to observe, that when the
circle consists merely of two kinds of conductors, however
different or however numerous the pieces may be of which
each       consists (as fig. 3, 4, 5 and                    6), two    equal    powers are
opposed to each other ; that                     is,   the electric fluid      is     impelled
with equal force in two different directions, and consequently
                                                                                               no

eapable    of exciting       convulsive           movements.
      There are other        cafes, however, and other modes                              of com
bination, where the powers are equally in equilibrium,                                           and
where no current of the electric fluid can take place                                      ;    or, at
least, none      of   such a force          as to   make an impression                         on the
tenderest nerves, or to excite any convulsive                        movement in the
best prepared frog that may be placed in the circle, notwith
standing the intervention               of two or more different kinds of
metals.        This     is the cafe when each              of   these metals is placed
between      two moist conductors, or of the second class, and
which     are very nearly         of   the fame kind, as sig. 7                     ;    or when,
in    a circle   of   three pieces,          two of them of the fame metal,
and one of a different metal, are                    so   connected, that the latter
is immediately between the other two,                           as sig. 8.
      When one of         the ends of the middle piece                         of       metal    A    Is
immediately applied to one of the two pieces Z, but, instead
  immediately touching with the other end, the other piece Z
•of
touches     an intermediate conductor                     of   the second class, either
great or small, either a drop                    of water,     a piece    of raw or boil
ed flesh,    or of sponge not moist, paste of meal, jelly, soap,
cheese,     or the white of an egg boiled to hardness, in this
new combination,             represented by fig. 9, (where a conductor
of    the second class m is between two                   of   the first class,          A     and   Z)
the powers are no longer opposed to each other                                  ;       and this is
sufficient to determine an electric stream.                           When g,                  there
fore, in fig. 9,        is a prepared            frog, it will always be violently
agitated as often as this circle is made complete.
      It may     be readily perceived              that the two last experiments,
represented        by fig.   8 and          9, coincide with those announced
by     M. Humboldt, where               a drop      of water,       a small             bit of fresh
meat, or       a very       of any fluid, performs the whole
                         thin    stratum
wonder.   When another drop of water, or any other aqueous
conductor, is applied betwen the other end of A and the
other corresponding piece                   Z     (as (hewn sig. 10), each piece
of metal         is insulated,         as    I    (hall express          it,   between               two
                                                                                           aqueoua

aqueous conductors                 :   but then the powers from right ter left,
and from left to right,                  are again completely opposed to each
other;      consequently               the electric stream is impeded, and the
frog remains without any movement.        It    therefore, abso     is,
lutely necessary that two different metals or conductors of the
first class (hould be                  in immediate contact with              each   other,
on the one fide, while with their opposite ends they touch
conductors of the second class.
     We might           consider this mutual                contact of two different
metals      as the       immediate cause which puts the electric fluid
in motion,          instead        of ascribing that power             to the contact        of
the two metals with the moist conductors.                        Thus, for ex
ample, in fig.           i,    instead       of admitting two different actions,
at least,     in   regard to the             magnitude of the power, one where
A    comes in contact with a, and another where Z- comes                                    in
contact: with a also,                   by   which    an electric current arises            in
the direction from                 Z    to   A, we might          suppose only one         ac
tion at the point where                      A   comes     in contact with Z, which
impells the fluid             in   that direction.          In both       suppositions     the
result,     as     may be          easily seen,       is   the fame.        But though      I
have reasons for adopting the first as true rather than the                                 se
cond, yet the latter represents the proposition with more sim
plicity, and        it   may be convenient to adhere to                     it   in the ex
planation,         as   it    affords    a    readier view    of it.        We may then
fay, that in the cafes                  of fig. 3, 4, 5,      6,  J   and    to, no      effect
will   be produced, because here there                       is   no mutual contact          of
different metals         :     that the effect also, according to fig.               8,   will
be    null,      because       A, on two           opposite sides,   is   in contact with
Z     and Z, and the actions therefore                      are in equilibrium        ;    and
lastly, that an electric current will be occasioned in fig. 9,                               by
the action which arises from the contact of A and Z, and
which       is   counteracted             by     no other contact of the like kind.

we shall        now try what will be the result,                            according to mv
principles, with four pieces of metal, two of which are of
one kind ; for example, zinc, when connected with moist
conductors of different kinds.
'
    I   shall first observe, that when they are connected                               in   a    cir
cle,    as at     fig.    u,     the powers which                 endeavour to put the
electric fluid in a streaming                     movement will be opposed to
each other, and in perfect equilibrium,                           and that consequent
ly no movement can take place in the frog, here supposed to
be the moist conductor a or a part                           of   it,    however irritable
and well prepared               it   may be   ;   and   if   the experiment be made
with accuracy and               the necessary precaution,                    so   that the me
tals, in particular,            be very clean and dry at the points                      of con
tact,    will perfectly confirm what
         it                                              I        have       above said      :    the
frog will experience no agitation, no                        convulsive           movement.
    These movements, on the other hand, took place, as might
be foreseen from my principles,                     as   often         as
                                                                        I     omitted one of
the middle pieces, or changed the order.
    The conductors of                the second class,      which in all the figures
are denoted          by   small letters, may be          cups with water, in whieb
the ends of the pieces of metal denoted  the large letters are    by
immersed     or sponges or other bodies which have imbibed
              ;
aqueous moisture.                They may          be either large or small                  ;    and
may consist of one or more pieces,                       provided            they be     in      pro
per contact      :    they may also be persons,                   if   their skin be moist
ened at the places              of contact, &c.              By the          last method the
experiments will be very beautiful                       and incessant,              when the
circle consists          of three or     more persons         (I       have formed           it   fre
quently often and even more), of two or more frogs                                               pro
perly prepared, and of four pieces of metal, two of silver and
two of iron,             tin,    and    particularly         zinc.          The change of
effect, when you change the connection,                                is   striking.
    Let   the position be as             represented          in fig.        12,    where        g   is
the prepared          frog, which the two persons                                 hold in their
                                                                        p,

 are held also by these persons, and                            A, A, two               pieces    of silver,
 which      are held by a third person, denoted also by p.                                         It   must*
 not be forgotten that the hands should be very moist,                                              as   the
 dry skin is not            a    conductor            sufficiently strong.                   As in this
 chain the actions of the electric exciters are opposed to each
 other and in exact equilibrium,                           as may be readily perceived,
 no convulsion or agitation in the frog will take place.
  Now, let one of the metallic pieces A, Z, which stand bcr
tween the two persons p, p, or between any other moist con
ductors, be left in combination                            as   it is   ;    and let the position
of    the two other metallic pieces                       A, Z,   be reversed, by convert
ing sig. 13 into fig.       that the actions, instead of being
                                  13     (so
contrary, will act together to impel the electric fluid to one
side or to produce the fame current)     or introduce between    ;
A  and     another
            Z      person, or  any other  conductor of the                                                   se
cond class,          so   that the chain be formed as in fig.                              14; or       take
away one of the pieces                  A, Z, in fig.             12, and make the chain
like those of fig.          15 and 17          ;     or,   in   the last place, remove the
whole two pieces                A, Z, either in            the one or the other side, as
represented          fig.   17    (by which               means    it       will   correspond           with
fig. 1, as the whole chain                     p,                 may be considered

single moist conductor                 of   the second class)                ;   in all these com
binations, which                are represented             by    fig. 13, 14, 15, 16, and
 17, the actions arising from the metallic contacts are no
longer contrary to each other, or in equilibrium, as they were
in   fig.   1a
             ;       consequently           an electric stream                   is    produced, and
the frog g, which               I   suppose           to    be properly prepared,                       and
which forms          a    part of the chain, will be violently agitated as
often as the circle, when broken at any one                                            place, particu
larly between metal and metal,                             is   again restored.
     In   regard to the experiment where                           a        moist conductor,                 or
one    of the    second class,           is    to be introduced between                          the two
pieces      A,   Z   (fig. 14), that           is,   between two different metals,                           a
drop of water, or           a    small bit         of     moistened           sponge,        or   a     thin
stratum      of any fluid,          soap,      or any other viscous matter, will
be quite sufficient, as          I     have already observed respecting                            fig. 9.
                                                    5                                                 This

This surprising experiment I generally make in such a man
ner, that, instead of the piece of metal, I employ a cup or
spoon filled with water, and then cause the person who holds
the perfectly dry and pure stick of tin to touch with that
stick sometimes the perfectly dry             sides   of the    spoon or cup,
and sometimes the water contained in them.                       It is wonder
ful to fee, that       as  by the latter method the violent agitation
of the frog      never ceases,     the first method, which corresponds
with    fig. 12, does not produce         the    least  irritation;   unless by
accident there be         a small   drop of water, or       a thin stratum    of
moisture, at the place of contact, by which the                     case repre
sented      fig. 14 would         be   restored.        This    may serve to
sliew with what care and attention the experiment must be
made,      in order      to guard against error or deception,             which
might     so easily arise, and every       where exhibit anomalies.
    When       I  introduce water       or any other moist body, great
or small, not merely between             one pair of metallic pieces A,
Z,    as  fig. 14, but between two pairs,             as represented    fig. 18,
each piece       of metal is      between     like moist conductors, and
by these means all the actions are again rendered contrary or
brought into equilibrium            ; or, according to the other mode
of viewing the matter, there is no longer any action, for want
of the mutual contact of two different metals, which, as we
have     seen, is certainly necessary to excite              an electric cur
rent;     and    it  is always found that the frog experiences                no
agitation.
    I  shall   not enlarge farther on these combinations, which
 may be varied         ad infinitum with a greater number of me
 tallic pieces, and by which one may be enabled to foretel the
 phenomena which, according to my principles, will always
be found to take place.             It will  be sufficient, for the present,
 to draw this conclusion,           that in     a  circle consisting     merely
 of two conductors,           however different they may be, their
mutual contact can produce no electric stream sufficient                       to
 excite    sensibility or muscular movement ; and that, on the
 contrary, this effect infallibly follows            as  often  as the  chain is

    formed      of   three conductors,         one of one class, and two                dif
    ferent from each other of another class, which come into
    mutual contact with each other, and that this effect will be
    stronger the greater the difference is between the latter ; that
    in other cafes, where there are more than three different
    conductors,            the effect either is not produced or will be pro
    duced in different degrees, according as the forces, called
    forth by the different combinations, which will be expanded
    at each heterogeneous                contact, and which are often in op
    position and endeavour to impel the electric fluid in opposite
    directions,        are     perfectly in equilibrium                with   each   other,
    (which must            be a very rare cafe)          or when the sum of those
    which exert            themselves      in one direction           is more or less ex
    ceeded by the sum            of   those which act in another direction.
         I   shall here however leave the two complex combinations,
    and return to the simple                  cafes,         those with   three    different
    conductors,            represented     by fig.      i,    which are more demon-

    or conductors of the first class which are in contact with
    each other,            and are applied on the other fide to moist con
    ductors or conductors of the second class.                          This method     has
    been      commonly employed since Galvani's discovery,                           and is
    in    exact proportion with the diversity                    of   metals on which      I
    consider the whole phenomena to depend.
      The other method of combination, which                              is expressed by
    fig. 2, or that of a metal placed between two different moist
    conductors, for example, between water on the one fide,
    and an aqueous,            saponaceous,         or saline fluid on the other,

    ferent persons,           both foreigners           and     others, among which
    was that of            M. Humboldt,            and       though    I wrote    to several
    correspondents            respecting     it,   that       light has not yet been

that though with tin alone, placed between water and an
alkaline liquor, you obtain nearly the effect which                             is   produced
 by   two   of the   most different metals, as silver and                       zinc, com
bined with any conductor whatever of                         the second class          ;     you
can obtain the fame, and even in                  a    higher degree, with iron
alone or silver alone, when the iron                     is     introduced between
water on the one               side and nitrous acid on the other,                               or
when the silver           is   applied      between water and              a     solution of

other as usual,        it   will    be strongly agitated            and violently con
vulsed when you connect the water                      in both       glasses         bya     bow

lead, or, what         is   better, silver and        zinc;     but this will               by   no
means be the case when the two metals are less different                                         in

     3. To endeavour to determine the respective ages of the
  different kinds of primitive mountains;                both compound,
  such as granite, porphyry, gneiss ; and simple,             as slate, ser

one mass, even the best characterised,           do not give certain in
dications   of   stratification   or divisions by strata, though less
regular than those of schistous mountains.
   6. Whether in the bases of granite mountains the mani
festation  of   strata be not hurt by the number             of fissures,  or
spontaneous     and irregular divisions.
   7.  Whether,      even in the separate blocks         of granite, an at

men, who wish to make mill-stones or other works more ex
tensive  in one direction than another,           to prefer attacking the
stone in a determined direction.
   8.  Whether the indications of the stratification are not
observed in the interior part of granite mountains, as well as
near their surface.
   8.  A. Whether among the granites in                 a mass,   and those
decidedly veined,         there    are not    found such      intermediary
shades that    it is difficult   to mark the line       of separation.

   11.  To   ascertain     the truth of the assertion of the Pliny of
France,    that in proportion as people dig into a mountain,
the summit and sides of which consist of granite, the granites,
instead   of being found more          solid   and    more beautiful      the
farther they advance, change, on the contrary, below a cer

       17.   Were the granites in            a mass first deposited,          because
   they were       less   soluble? and did they crystallise after the
   quantity or dissolving force of the waters began to diminish ?
   and was it for        a  contrary reason that the gneiss,                mica and
   magnesian stones crystallised            later   ?

       2. To observe,        above all,       the transitions through            which
    nature has passed, when, having produced                      one genus or one
    order of mountains,         she began to produce           a different genus or
    order; for there is no change of order which                        has not been
    the effect     of a revolution       ;   and   it  is in the transitions,      that

  4. Having found these transitions, or any others, in some
mountains, if they are not then found in other mountains,
you must examine whether their absence does not arise from
their having been destroyed                            ;     vestiges      of them               are to     be
sought for; and                if it   appears that they never existed, you must
endeavour to discover,                         in    the     nature and              position of the
mountains, what may have been the cause of their absence*.

XI.        Observations on the Manvfatlure                             of the Acetite of               Copper
           or Verdigrise, Verdet, &c. By                             J. A. CHAPTAL.f
 1 HE                acetite    of     copper is one           of    the preparations                  of that
metal most frequently used in the arts.                                    It    is not only one            of
the principal resources of painting, but upon many occasions
is employed with great advantage in dyeing.                                            Almost all the
oxydes          of    copper obtained by the action                        of        saline substances
have        a   blue colour,             more or            less    inclining          to green,          and
almost all the neutral salts corrode the metal, and                                                produce
that oxyde              which is          called          verdigrise.           It    is    sufficient to
bring them into contact with the copper, or to immerse the
metallic plates in a saline solution, and afterwards to expose
them to the air to dry.
      Those acids which oxydate the copper by their decompo
sition, produce an effect like that of neutral salts. The oxyde
is.   of   a    soft blueish-green                  colour; their action                    is so speedy,
that       if the     copper be exposed to the vapour                            of them for             some
minutes its surface                     will     be        immediately           oxydated.                The
oxygenated              muriatic acid produces that effect                                 as   well    as the
vapour of the nitric acid, and even those of the sulphuric
acid. A phenomenon which cannot escape the eye of an
      •   The   best method         of observing mountains,             in order to acquire a tho
rough knowledge            of them,        is,   not to confine oneself merely to follow the
valleys, but to intersect also, as much as possible,                       the principal          chains and
the branches detached from them                      in    the direction    of their breadth.             C.

75                   The Process followed at Montpellier in
observer,           is,   that the oxydes           of copper obtained                by   fire are
yery different from those produced                                by   the decomposition         of
acids on that metal.                  The colour of them                   is   grey, instead    of
being green   and when the calcination
                     ;                   continued   long               is                 a
time at   violent heat, they may be concentrated to a red
                a
oxyde of         a   blood colour.            This phenomenon was                      observed
by Kunckel                in his chemical laboratory.
     Saline substances are not the only ones capable of oxydat-
ing       copper green.            All   oils and fat matters produce the fame
effect.         Even water, when left for                         a    considerable     time in
copper vessels, causes an oxydation.                                   But what will       appear
very extraordinary              is,
                     that the greater part of these substances
have no sensible effect upon copper,     except when cold.
Those salts even which corrode that metal when left at rest
in   vessels, do not attack              it   in    so   sensible      a   manner when in         a
state      of ebullition.
     Of     all the preparations of copper                         by   oxydation,      there     is
none more valuable than that made by vinegar. All the
verdigrise used in commerce prepared   that acid, and
                                                   is                   by                        it

the Academy of Paris for 1750 and 1753, may be seen       very                             a
exact description             of   the process then followed at Montpellier
for making           verdigrise     ;    but as that process has been much
improved, and as -at present the husks                            of grapes       are employed
instead         of the      stalks,   a    method far more economical,                         since
wine       is   no longer used, the following account of the man
ner of manufacturing verdigrise,                            as now practised,         may be      of
Utility to the public.
   The first materials used for this purpose are copper and the
husks or skins of grapes lest aster the last pressing.  The
copper employed  was  formerly all imported  from   Sweden                                        ;
but at present         brought from different foundries esta

blished at Saint Bel, Lyons, Avignon, Bedarieux, Montpellier,
&c.        It   is   in round       plates    half      a   line in thickness, and from
twenty to twenty-five                      inches in diameter.                   Each plate       at
                                                                                   Montpellier

                   the ManufaBur'^ng        of Verdigrlsi.              73
Montpellier is divided into twenty-five laminae, forming
almost all oblong squares of from four to six inches in length,
three in breadth, and weighing              about four ounces.        They
are beat separately       with the hammer on an anvil            to smooth
their surfaces, and to give the copper the necessary consistence.
Without this precaution it would exfoliate, and it would
be more difficult to scrape the surface in order to detach the
oxydated crust.         Besides this, scales      of pure  metal would be
taken off, which would hasten the consumption of the copper.
    The    husks     of  grapes,   known      at   Montpellier under    the
name of racque,           were   formerly thrown on the dung-hill
after the poultry had picked out the small stones contained
in them. At present they are preserved for making verdi-
grise, and sold at the rate        of from    fifteen to twenty livres per
muid.       The preparation of them             is as follows  :  After the
vintage is finished, the husks are subjected to the press, in
order to extract all the wine with which they may be im
 pregnated,      and they are then put into vats,           where they are
 pressed    down with the feet to fill up all the vacuities and
 render    the mass as compact          as possible.      The coverings of
 these vats are carefully fastened down, and they are preserved
 for  use  in  a  dry cool place.
    These husks are not always          of the     fame quality: when the
 grapes contain little      of  the saccharine matter, when the sea
 son has been rainy,         the fermentation        incomplete,    or when
 the wine is not generous, the husks are attended with several
 faults.     1.  They    are difficult   to be preserved,     and there     is
 great    danger     of their   soon being spoilt.        2. They produce
 very little effect, cannot be easily heated, fend forth very            lit
 tle of the acetous odour, and make the plates of copper sweat
  without     shewing efflorescence        on their surface.       Indepen
  dently of the nature of the grapes and the state of the wine,
  the quality of the hulks varies also according as they have
  been    expressed    with more or      less care.     Husks which have
  not been much pressed, produce a far greater effect than those
  which have been dried. Tjo explain their different effects,
                                                                             it

   74               The Process followed at Montpell'ur in
   it will   be sufficient to observe           that their action is propor
   tioned to the quantity of wine they retain,                 as  it  is- that liquor
   alone which can             pass   to the slate    of vinegar.          When     the
   husks therefore        are destined for a verdigrise manufactory, care
  must be taken to express them only weakly,                      in order to      pre
  serve more       of their acidifiable principle.
      When        a sufficient quantity        of  copper     and     of   husks    has
  been provided, nothing remains but to proceed to the opera
  tions, which are generally performed in cellars.                         They may
  be performed         also on a ground floor         if it  be somewhat        damp,
  if the    temperature be subject to little variation,                 and  if  there
  be not too much light.               The    first operation is to make the
  husks ferment,         which     is called avina.         For that     purpose one
  of  the vats is opened,           and the husks are put into two others
  of  equal size, taking          care to expose them as little as possible
 to the air, and not to compress them.                    One vat full of husks
  ought to sill two, and to occupy a double space after this
  operation.         In  some manufactories the husks contained in a
 vat are distributed into twenty or twenty-five earthen                         vessels
 or jars called oulcs, and which are generally sixteen inches in
  height, fourteen in diameter at the belly, and about twelve
 at the mouth.            When       the   husks    have    been    put into these
 vessels,      they are covered         by putting the lid merely on the
 opening without pressing it down.                   The    covers are      of  straw,
 and made for that purpose.                  In this     slate    the    husks    soon
 heat   ;    and this change may be known by thrusting the hand
into them, and by the sour smell which they begin to exhale.
 The fermentation           first takes place at the bottom           of the   vessel,
 and gradually ascending extends itself to the whole mass.                           It
 proceeds       to 30 or 35 degrees         of Reaumur.
     At    the end    of  three or four days the heat decreases, and at
 length      ceases   entirely;     and as the manufacturers apprehend
 the loss     of  a portion     of  the vinegar by the natural effect             of  a
 heat     too    much      prolonged,      they take care after three days
fermentation to remove the husks from the fermenting vessels,
in order that they may sooner cool. Those who employ vats
                                                                             remove

                     the ManufaSuring of Verdigrise.                     75
remove      them into jars, and those who use jars put them into
others.       Besides the loss    of the  acetous spirit, too gjeat heat
inclines      the mass at the bottom of the            vessel  to become
mouldy,         which renders it unfit         for making       verdigrise.
Some manufacturers, to increase the effect of the husks, form
them into heaps, which they besprinkle with generous wine
before they bring them to ferment.
     The fermentation        does not always take place at the fame
time, nor with the fame energy.              Sometimes it commences
 in twenty-four       hours, and sometimes      it has not begun at the
 end     of three weeks.       The heat   sometimes    will rife  to such a
 height that the hand cannot be kept in the mass,                  and that
 the acetous odour is        so strong   that one can hardly approach
 the    vessels ;  while at others the heat is hardly sensible,         and
 soon vanishes.        There are even instances of the husks becom
 ing putrid and mouldy without turning acid.                  The fermen
  tation is afiisted and promoted by raising the heat                of  the
  place by means         of chasing-dishes, by covering the           vessels
  with cloths, by shutting the doors, and by airing the mase
  with more care. The differences in the fermentation depend,
  1. On the temperature of the air: in summer the fermentation
  is speedier.     2. On the nature of the husks     :  those  which    arise
  from very saccharine grapes heat more easily.                  3. On the
  volume of the mass       :  a larger mass ferments sooner, and with
  more strength,       than  a small   one.   4. On the contact of the
  air  :  the best aired husks ferment best.
      At   the fame time that the husks        are made to ferment, a
   preliminary      preparation     called desafouga is given to the
   plates   of copper which are used for the first time. This
   operation is not employed for those which have been al
   ready used,      and consists in dissolving verdigrise in water          in
   an, earthen vessel,     and rubbing over each plate with a piece
   of    coarse   linen dipped in this solution.           The plates are
   then immediately placed close to each other, and left in that
   manner to dry.         Sometimes      the plates are   only laid on the
                                                                          top

)&            The Process followed at Montpelfier in
top of tlie fermented husks, or placed under those which have
been already used for causing the copper to oxydate.             It has
teen observed, that when the operation called desafouga has
not been employed, the plates grow black at the first opera
tion,  instead  of becoming green.
    When the      plates are thus prepared, and the husks have
been brought to ferment, the workmen try whether the lat
ter are proper for the process, by placing under them a plate
of copper,    and leaving it buried there for twenty-four        hours.
If   the plate of copper,     after   this period, is found covered
with   a smooth green      crust, in such a manner that none of
the metal appears,       they are then thought fit for being "dis
posed in layers with the copper.          On the other hand,   if drops
of water    are observed on the surface      of the plates, the   plates
are said to sweat,     and it is concluded      that the heat of the
husks has not sufficiently subsided.        They consequently defer
making another trial till the next day.           When they are as
sured that the husks are     in a proper state, they form them into
layers in the following manner          :
    The  plates are all put into a box,     which,   instead of having
a bottom, is divided      in the middle by     a wooden grate.      The
plates   disposed   on this grate are       so  strongly heated    by a
chafing-dish placed under them, that the woman employed
in this labour    is sometimes      obliged to take them up with a
cloth,    in order that  she  may not burn her hands.         As    soon
 as  they have acquired that heat, they are put into the jars in
 layers with the husks.       Each jar is then closed with    a cover
 ing of  straw, and left to oxydate.       This period is called co'ua,
 to hatch.    Thirty or forty pounds of copper, more or less ac
 cording to    the thickness of the plates, are put into each
jar.    At the   end  often, twelve, fifteen, or twenty days, the
jar is opened ;     and if the husks are white, it is time to take
 out the plates.    The   crystals are then seen detached, and        of a
 silky appearance    on their surface.    The  husks are thrown back,
 and tke plates are put in what is called relai.         For that pur
                                                                     pose

pose they are immediately deposited irt a comer                   of the cellar
on    sticks ranged on the floor.          They are placed in an upright
position,        one leaning against       the other; and at the end of
two or three days they are moistened,               by taking them up in
handfulls         and    immersing them in water in earthen pans.
They are deposited quite wet in their former position, and
left there for seven or eight days ; after which they are once
or twice immersed again.                This immersion        and drying are
renewed        six or eight    times, every seven or eight days.              As
the plates formerly were put into wine, these immersions
were called one wins, two wines, three wines, according to
the number of times.               By this    process  the plates      swell up,
 the green is nourished, and a coat of verdigrise is formed on
 all their surfaces, which may be easily detached by scraping
 them with         a  knife.
      Each jar furnishes five or six pounds of verdigrise at escli
 operation. It is then called frefli verdigrise, moist verdigrise,
  fkc.      This verdigrise     is fold in that state by the       manufactu
  rers to people who dry it for foreign               exportation.       In this
  first   state    it  is only a paste,     which   is carefully pounded       in
  large wooden troughs,             and then put into bags             of white
  leather, a foot in height and ten inches in diameter. These
  bags are exposed to the air or the sun, and are left in that
   state  till  the verdigrise   has acquired the proper degree           of dry
  ness.     By this operation it      decreases about fifty per cent., more
  or   less   according to its primitive state.           It   is said to stand
  proof by the knife, when the point of that instrument pushed
   against a cake of verdigrise through the skin cannot pene
   trate it.
       The     plates    of copper which       have been already used are
   again employed for the same operation,                till they    are almost
   completely consumed.             Instead   of heating them artificially,
   as above mentioned, they are sometimes               exposed      only to the
   sun.      The    same plates   will  serve" sometimes     for ten years, but
 ,  they are often wori>out           in two or three.          This, however,
                                                                         depends

;S              On the Manufacture      of Verdigrise.
depends    on the quality of the copper.         That which     is ex
tremely smooth, well beat, and very compact, is always molt
esteemed.
   Formerly moist verdigrise could not be sold till its quality
had been previously ascertained ; and for that purpose          it was
carried to a public warehouse,       where it was fold after that
point had been determined.
   By comparing this process with that described by Montet,
it will be found that the changes introduced are much in fa
vour   of the new.    Formerly the workmen took the stalks           of
the grapes dried in the fun, and began by immersing them for
eight days in vinajse (the residuum of the distillation of wine
for making brandy).     They then suffered the moisture to drain
off through a basket, after which they put about sour pounds
into a jar, and poured over them three or four pints of wine.
The stalks were made to imbibe a large portion of the wine,
by stirring them strongly with       the hand; the jar was then
covered,   and   the stalks were suffered to ferment.        The fer
mentation cojnmenced sooner or later, according to the na
ture os the wine and the temperature of the air.         But after it
had once begun, the wine became turbid, and exhaled           a strong
odour of vinegar.      At length the heat decreased, and the
stalks  were then    taken   out and the wine was drawn off.
When     the stalks were a little drained,    they were disposed in
layers with the plates of copper, and the operation was con
tinued in the fame manner         as with the husks.       When the
plates  were taken from the jars to be put       in rclui,  instead  of
immersing them in pure water, as is done at present, they
were moistened three or four times with four wine, which
was called giving them three or four wines.
   It  may be easily    seen  that there is   a great saving in the
process followed at present, since the manufacturers no longer
use wine,   which enhanced      the price  of the verdigrise. Some
have   condemned, in the new process, the pra6tice of using
the copper
       3ppe/ too soon ; but this objection fell to the ground,
                                                                 when

*' JT OR             several     years       past      tallow candles           with wooden
wicks have been prepared,                        in   large quantities,         by     the candle-
makers at Munich,                    and much             used in that neighbourhoods
I    have burnt them during the whole winter,                                  and never wish
to   use     any other kind,           as they are attended                with        several ad
vantages which common tallow candles do not possess. They
afford about the fame quantity of light as   wax candle;                       a

crackle or run,  The candle-makers here keep the method
of preparing           these candles as secret as they can                         ;    but
                                                                                          I      shall
communicate              to the public what                I     have been able to learn
respecting       the process.
     "   The only           difference           between these candles                   and       the
common           tallow candles               is,     that the ground work of the
wick       consists    of   a    very thin flip           of wood, bound round                    to   a
considerable           thickness with very fine unspun cotton                            ;    but in
such     a   manner that the size of the wick does not much ex
ceed that     wick of
                 of   the                    a   common candle.         The cotton                     is
wound round the wick                          by    the      hand; but in general                it    is
done       by   means       of   a   reel,   which      I     have not yet been able to
see.       The thin flips of wood                      are furnished to the candle-

their appearance,       are cut into the proper form by means           ofa
knife, without the application of any machine.                  They      are
for the   most     part somewhat square,        and     not completely
rounded.       The candle-makers        often prepare      these flips     of
wood also themselves,        when they have none ready by them,
and   for that purpose use pine, willow, and other kinds                   of
wood, though they commonly employ fir.               For making       these
candles it is necessary to have the purest           tallow   :  a pound
will be sufficient to make six or seven,     which    cost 25 kreutzers.
The price of common moulded             candles  with cotton wicks is
22 kreutzers ; but as the former burn much longer, they
are on the whole cheaper."
   Another method of making the wicks             is as follows :    Take
shoots   of   the pine-tree a year old,     scrape   off  the bark,      and
when they are become perfectly dry scrape them again all
round till they are reduced to the size ofa small straw. When
the above wood cannot be procured,            well dried common fir
twigs of   "a  year old, and of the fame strength, may be pre
pared in the like manner.          These rods are then to be rubbed
over with wax or tallow,          till they  are covered     with   a   thin
coating of either of these substances ; after which they must
be rolled dn a smooth           table in very fine carded          cotton,
drawn out to about the length of the rod or candle-mould.
Care however must be taken that by this rolling no inequali
ties may arise on the rod, and that the cotton may be every
where of' equal thickness, though at the upper part a little
more   of it may      be applied.    After this preparation the wick
will have acquired the size       of the barrel ofa    small   quill;    and
the more accurately the size           of the wick is proportioned
to that   of the candle mould, the        candles   will burn    so much
the better, clearer and longer, as will soon be found by            a  little
experience     : these wicks are then to be placed very exactly            in
the middle of the mould, and retained in that position, and good
tallow, fresh if possible, previously melted with a little water,
must be poured round them ; but even old and rancid tallow
will not run,     if the  wicks be properly made.
                                                                    These

    These candles, besides burning longer than the common
ones, have also this advantage,                that they do not flare, and
that they arc       less  prejudicial to the eyes of those who are ac
customed       to read or write at night.            It  is however to be ob
served,     that  a   pair of sharp       scissars   must     be employed for
snuffing them, and that in performing                      that operation care
must be taken not to break or derange                   the  wick.

being, in fact,       a detail of the experiments with tungsten, on
which the conclusions there given were established.
    "   Having     subjected     to experiment an oxyd hitherto              little
known,       I mean the tungstic oxyd, I               soon discovered     that it
is one    of  the most valuable substances for receiving and fixing
vegetable       colours.       I   digested     the juice    of   the red plum
with     the white       oxyd of tungsten, procured from wolfram,
that is to fay,         in the    state   in which it is considered as an
acid.      The liquor      lost a great deal      of its colour, and the me
tallic oxyd became of           a very   dark red violet.        I  decanted the
liquor,     and boiled      it on   a  new portion of the tungsten.              It
assumed the same colour, and the liquor still retained                    a  faint
(hade    of  red.     The liquor being filtered and diluted with wa
ter,   to defend       it from the action of the sire, was treated a
third     time with fresh oxyd.              It then remained colourless,
and the oxyd         of  tungsten was found coloured as much as the
first.

     " It was not               now necessary to examine the liquor by re
agents, for principles which no longer existed                                   in   it,      but to try
whether the colour adhering to the oxyd was fixed there in
such     a   manner          as to      promise any advantages to dyeing, or al
least to painting.                    Water boiled             a    long time, and in suc
cession,          on this oxyd rather darkened than weakened                                        its co
lour.        This water               made no impression                 upon turnsol paper.
Though limpid,                  it     assumed,          by   the addition           of   the muria
tic acid,     a     shade         of   a   pale    rose red       colour;      and        by   the addi
tion of pot-ash,             a     greenish         shade     ;   but these colours totally
disappeared            in   a     few minutes,            and could not be made to re
appear,           bypouring over them fresh acid and fresti alkali.
What         is   more remarkable, the hydro-sulphure brought back
a   flight tint of violet, which did not disappear.
     "   A   portion of the coloured oxyd of tungsten was mixed
up with gum water, and with                              a    brush daubed over             a    piece     of
paper.        The           stratum being dry,                 a    thin     scale   of   it    was de
tached, in order to be exposed to the rays of the fan,                                              and at
the end           of nine         days      the colour was               neither changed nor
weakened.              Another             scale was immersed              in the acetous acid;
and being immediately drawn out and dried,                                       it   was found to
have experienced                   no change.                As little     effect was produced
upon     it       by   the acetic acid.              Lime          water applied to            it   left no
sensible          traces     of        its effect.        The       cafe was the fame                 with
ammonia.                A    solution of soap only weakened                          the tint with
out changing                it.        A    solution of potash             made a red spot,                in
which the violet                  shade was destroyed.                   A   solution of the car-
bonat of potash produced an alteration still more sensible,
the part which had been touched inclining rather to yellow
than to red.                A     solution of alum, even concentrated, effect
ed no change.                     A    sheet   of    paper,        tinged with the colour                  of
this oxyd, being kept for twenty-four                                   hours in     a    close     jar,   at
the bottom             of which was               some        hydro-sulphure,             no change
whatever was observed.                            In the      last place,    a   sheet     of this     pa

the latter lost all its colour,          while that of the former was not
sensibly weakened.
     " The    kind of lake formed by the union of vegetable co
louring matter with the oxyd of tungsten may be considered,
therefore,       as  having been subjected           to the strongest      test  by
the principles most           destructive      to colours,     and   which Ber-
thollet considers        as  the    nearest,    in point of strength, to the
continued action of the air and light.
     "I   fliall   pass  over a great      number       of other experiments
 less  direct, or at least      less conclusive, respecting other vegeta
 ble colouring matters, and observe only that the oxyd                            of
 lead, which seems to have so little action on the red juice                      of
 stoned fruits,       attacks tumsol very strongly;            that an infusion
 of tumsol,       rendered     red by the acetous acid, passes to a wine
 colour when treated with iron,                  and   is then    in the   state  of
 violet juices which become green                  by alkalies;     that the acid
 juice of yellow fruits, melons for example, gives to the oxyd
  of tungsten only a faint shade of blue, which turns grey by
  repented washing;          and that, on the other hand,              this oxyd,
  digested in infusions         of curcuma (turmeric)           and tumsol, be
  comes charged with their colours, and gives them a fixity
  of which one would not have supposed them susceptible."

trance of air in the like manner.This balloon, represented
by A (Plate II.), has two cocks B C with conical stoppers,
and united to the tubes bv the fame means as those in the
gazometer above mentioned*.                                    Within       the    balloon     is a
small crucible of platina, d, suspended by two wires of the
fame metal from the plate of copper by which the balloon
is shut.           The cock B            serves to connect the tube                        with an
air pump, and by these means to empty the balloon of at
mospheric air. By the cock C, the oxygen gas, contained
in    the gazometer         G,     is introduced ; but as this gas ought to
be as dry as possible before it is admitted into the balloon,                                      I
have applied between                it   and the gazometer a glass cylinder,
II,     silled with a salt         which strongly attracts the moisture of
the gas.           The    salt    which I found most effectual in this ex
periment was that used and recommended by Saussure for
drying atmospheric                 airs.             It   is the alkali        which remains
after the decrepitation              of    a     mixture of equal parts of nitre
and crude tartar, and which has been kept at                                      a red heat for
an hour.
     The     salt in the tube         II must             not be pulverised,         but divided
into small fragments, in order that the gas mav penetrate
through           it,   and come in contact with                           a   greater     portion
of               The tubes

is  connected with the gazometer and the balloon, must be
pliable, because   would be too difficult to place the cylinder
                          it
H      in   such   a    position    as    to be united with the balloon and
gazometer           by   means      of   tubes not capable                  of being bent.      I
employ pliable tubes of gum elastic,                                 the   ends of which        arc
fastened to the copper pipes screwed into the cocks.

ihg   glass.     I  have observed      that phosphorus wrapt up in a
particular     manner inflames spontaneously               when the air is
rarefied    to a certain degree     ;   and   I employ the       result  of this
observation to inflame the phosphorus in the balloon.
    By means of this         apparatus    I  have   several times, both        in
the course of my lectures and on other occasions,                   shewn the
production        of   the phosphoric       acid   by the combustion           of
phosphorus in oxvgen gas,             as described      by Lavoisier in the
Memoirs of         the   Academy      of Sciences for the year 1777,
(page 65.)         In my experiments I         have generally burnt sixty
grains of phosphorus.           They     have shewn that the weight           of
the phosphoric acid produced is always nearly equal to that
of  the phosphorus burnt, and             of  the oxygen gas employed.
 I calculated     the results by the method described             by Lavoisier
in his Treatise of Chemistry (vol. ii.)              ;  but it is not neces
sary they should be inserted           here,   as the composition        of  the
phosphoric acid has been sufficiently established by the accu
rate experiments         of Lavoisier.      My object, in describing         the
apparatus      I employed,      was merely to enable those who wish
to repeat the experiments to do so by an easier method, and
with more certainty than according to that proposed by him.
It  must here be observed,        that   as the   phosphorus, by my pro
cess, inflames in rarefied air, there is no danger that the sud
den expansion        of   the air, produced by the           intense    heat os
the inflamed phosphorus,              will  burst   the glass    ; to   prevent
which, in Lavoisier's method, requires great caution, as he
himself has remarked.              That the balloon during the com
bustion may be as little heated as possible, I suffer the air,
 after   the   inflammation,       to    pass   gradually,     and    in small
 quantity,     into the glass globe, and sor that reason do not
open the cock until the flame begins to be extinguished.                      In
 this manner the experiment may be performed without any
danger.

lyn, my experiments           on the combustion          of phosphorus in the
 so called vacuum of          an air pump.           Had professor Gottling,         •
 and other German chemists                who have observed phosphorus
 to stiinein azotic gas, paid more attention to what these ex
periments clearly establish,             they would not have             made     so
much noise respecting-             a  phenomenon which is             so  like the
 shining of phosphorus before               it inflames in air highly rare
 fied.    This shining of phosphorus in an imperfect vacuum,
shews       that the small quantity of oxygen gas contained
 in atmospheric air          so   highly     rarefied,    is still   sufficient to
occasion      that luminous appearance            ;   and as it is well known
that it is absolutely impossible            to produce azotic gas           which
does not contain some oxygen gas,                   they might have        seen  by
mv experiments,.,          that the small quantity os oxygen which
must have been contained in their azotic gas was sufficient
to produce that light which they observed.
     I shall    here   only add,        that phosphoric        will not       shine
at all in azotic gas which contains no oxygen gas.                          This   I
stiewed, on the        1 8th  of January 1794, in my             lectures    at the
Teyjerian Institute.           I  introduced        azotic gas over mercury,
and      freed    it totally       from     oxygen gas by introducing
phosphorus        into   it on   the   point of a bent iron wire, which
I   passed   up through the mercury,              so as to    bring the phos
phorus in contact with            a piece    of ignited iron previously in
troduced into the receiver.               All the oxygen       gas united itself
in   a moment with the volatilized phosphorus;                       and another
bit of phosphorus, which               after the    coolipg.of     the apparatus
I   made to rife through the quicksilver                 into the azotic gas,
which in that manner was freed from all oxygen, did not
stiine.      A  small bubble         of atmospheric air      was     sufficient to
reproduce the shining.              It was then seen diffused throughout
the whole gas, in the fame manner as when atmospheric air
is admitted into an exhausted receiver in which phosphorus
has ceased to be luminous.                I  sliewed,   in the course of the
fame      lecture, that phosphorus does not mine in                      a perfect
                                                                         vacuum.

through the quicksilver of a barometer, and it exhibited no
light*.         In order that this experiment may completely suc
ceed, you must employ a barometer,                         the tube     of which    has
been well freed from atmospheric air, by boiling the quick
silver in the tube.            If you      use a   barometer the quicksilver of
which       has not been boiled,               the small quantity of air con
tained in it will be sufficient to make the phosphorus lu
minous       ;  but this appearance             will   be  of  short duration,      be
cause the exhausted             space      of   such    a barometer can contain
only a very small quantity                 of oxygen      gas.

proached very near to this discovery, and to that also, made              by the author,
of phosphorus inflaming in vacuo.                He drew some    lines with phosphorus
on a piece of paper, and         suspended     it within the receiver of an air pump.
"  After long pumping,''          says he,
                                              "  the luminous    appearance was appa
rently brighter."        See   the   Philosophical Transuclians, vol. x,xiv, p. 1865.

junction with M. D'Alemc,             at  Paris, and which correspond exactly with
those of Hawkfbee.          See his (Sours    Je Cbvmie, Paris 1687, p. 577. Lavoi

    tA "       Constant Reader," in a letter of i$d May,              but which did   not
reach us in time for our last Number, proposed the following question:
                                               G4                                "What

88                           Method     to determine the
your readers,         I have  had many opportunities          of being convinced
that it is not       so generally known        as  it ought.    Since    I  first ven
tured to give public lectures on optics, and to explain the va
rious constructions of telescopes and microscopes,                      I  have fre
quently been            applied to, to procure those instruments for
people residing at a distance from the metropolis, aud to.
prove them before sending them off. I have also been fre
quently requested by those who had purchased such instru
ments to give an opinion of their goodness, and to determine
their magnifying powers ; from which I have found that the
manufacturers of those instruments too generally are in the
habit of over-rating            their powers *, to the great disappoint
ment of the buyer, who finds, when too late, that they will
i:ot perform what he had been taught to expect from them.
    From what I have stated, it appeared to me, that a method
to determine the magnifying                    power of telescopes,           without
much trouble or expense,                and yet sufficiently exact for most
purposes,         might be thought worth a place in your useful pub
lication.         There are various methods of doing the fame
thin"-, and each have their particular advantages                         and disad
vantages        :  some arc expensive        ;  others require long calcula
tions    :   some       are attended with much trouble ; and others
require particular situations, which cannot always be com
manded.            The method I mostly            use can be       universally ap-
     " What       is  the method   used   by opticians   to ascertain the magnifying
power of     telescopes   ? and how c!o they prove how many times the object is
magnified,      when seen through the same •"
   The     present paper, he will see, furnishes a satisfactory answer. F.r.iT.
    • Even that eminent artist Mr.
                                           James Short, who rendered himself so
jufity famous       by bringing  the reflecting telescope   to a deeree   of perfection
unknown before his time, too often over-rated the power of his                telescopes,
though not in the fame shameful degree that some                makers     now      do.   I
would not however         be understood as making      this censure general:      I  know
ene artist whose reflecting telescopes       exceed even those of Short, and whose
telescopes     I  have never once found of less magnifying          power     than thev
were fold for;        and ! hope there arc others who are above being guilty of
to mean an artifice.

may be proper, in the first place, to                               state       the fense in which
I   use    the term magnifying power                           of a   telescope; for it is                 dif
ferently understood                 by different persons                    :    also to distinguish
between          the object          itself,     and      the magnified image of the
object looked at,              as seen         in the      field     of     the telescope.                 The
difference in size, between the object viewed with the naked
eye and its image as seen                        in the     field     of        the telescope,           con
stituting the magnifying power of the telescope,                                          the question
 is,How ought this difference to                               be expressed         ?     Should         it   be
expressed in comparison of their
                      a                                        respective diameters, areas,
or solidity       ?    For instance,             if  a   piece       of   paper      of   three inches
square, crossed each way by three lines, and thus divided                                                    in
to nine squares, be placed at                        a   distance,        and viewed by                a   tele
scope that causes one                    of    those squares to appear as large as
 the whole paper, at the fame distance, appears to the naked
 eye   j   if    we compare this effect                    by   the difference in diameter,
 we should say, the instrument magnifies three times but as                                        :
 one square appears as large, when seen through the telescope,
 as the whole nine do to the eye unassisted                                              by   that instru
    ment, might           it   not be asserted, with equal truth, that                                     it
                                                                                                           is
    magnified nine times                 ?     The latter           appears        as reasonable               as
    the former     ;      hut,      as   in this cafe the                 paper appears, when
    viewed by the telescope, of the same dimensions                                           as   it   would
    do to the naked eye when placed atone third the

CO                   Method lo determine the
distance of   ioo yards, can     be as distinctly read as        it could
by the eye   at the distance of  one yard ; and      it is owing   to this
astonishing property that the heavenly bodies can be con
templated    as  though they were only the one,             two, three,
four, or five hundredth part the distance that they are in re
ality.
   The planets, for instance,        have nothing      in their  appear
ance to the naked eye, that would engage our particular at
tention, or enable us to distinguish them from the fixed stars,
except their being observed to change their places amongst
the fixed stars, sometimes      moving from west to east, then
for  a season  remaining stationary, having no apparent motion
at all ; then again, to have a little motion from east to west,
which    keeps increasing acertain time, when        it again  decreases,
until they once more become            stationary.     They were thus
distinguished from the fixed stars long before telescopes were
 invented, and on this account were called erratics, or wan
dering stars,    their real and regular motions and periods be
 ing   at that time unknown.          But, by the      assistance   of the
telescope,   in   each   of them may        be observed what excites
 astonishment and claims our particular attention, especially
if the instruments are good of their kind, and magnify from
 two to four hundred times.         In viewing Saturn, the slowest,
and    now  known    to be  the most    distant planet of all, except
 the Georgium      Sidus, instead of a pale solitary wanderer, he
 is found to be accompanied with six or seven moons, re
 volving round him at stated, fixed, and regular periods, and
 to be encompassed with (a greater wonder still) a double ring,
 no where touching him, but suspended              so as to have    its in
 side edge every where twenty-one           thousand miles from his
 body.     The planet Jupiter     is observed    to have several belts
 that appear,    though upon his body, as having several spots,
 by which his diurnal motion on his axis is determined to be
 much quicker than that of our earth, being performed in
  about eight hours, notwithstanding           he is so much larger.
                                                                        He

He is       also seen to be accompanied with four moons, or satel
lites, revolving in certain periods : even their eclipses, which
afford an excellent method for determining the longitude of
places on our earth, can be distinctly seen.                                        Mars      is observed
to have           some        spots near one                   of his      poles,     by which he is
known to have a diurnal rotation round his axis. The beau
tiful planet Venus,                      that now adorns our.evening sky, is ob
served to wax and wane like our moon;                                              sometimes           being
merely        a   crescent, then horned like the moon only a few
days old, then gibbous, afterwards full ; exhibiting different
phases like our moon, and thus affording an incontestible
proof of the Newtonian system of astronomy, now universal
ly adopted by men of science in every part of the world *.
  1 he planet Mercury, though but seldom seen, yet deserves
our attention, as he more frequently than Venus passes be
twixt the fun                 and us,           appearing like             a     patch upon the disc
of the fun,                  and        thus,          to those        that know how to                 avail
themselves             of     these phenomena,                         gives      additional proof          of
the truth         of    the present                    system.         The     splendid       face     of our
moon,         in her various                   phases, offers so many similarities                          to
the earth which we inhabit,                                as leave      but little room to doubt
she is destined for the fame grand end, an habitation for                                                  in-
   •   The truth of           this system has been proved by innumerable observations
made with this excellent instrument, by men every way qualified                                      to judge,
who with unwearied diligence,                           and without any bias or motive whatever
but    a    strong desire          to    search        out the truth,        have examined and proved
every part of          it,   and fixed         it      upon too strong       a   basis to be overturned      or
refuted      by   the ignorant           or    interested,          who pretend to do        so   without pos
sessing     one single qualification                    to enable them to form         a    proper judgment
in this matter,         or    a    single     pretension        but what     is   founded    in    the grossest
ignorance, accompanied with the most consummate assurance.                                         But enough
of this at present.               Perhaps         at   a   suture opportunity      I   may offer some re
marks upon, and throw together some of the leading features of the New
tonian system,          for the sake           of      those   who, for want of better information,
are daily duped out of their money                             by   the contemptible jargon of even the
most       ignorant and stupid of mankind.
                                                                                                    telligenfc

additional light to us, and a convenient habitation for others;
while        she,   in return,       receives     a like benefit        from the earth,
which        answers the purpose          of a luminary to her. She is seen
to    have broad seas,               bounded with rocky (hores ; extended
continents,            diversified    with hill and          dale ; deep valleys and
towering mountains ; mountains, whose                                 extended    shadows
can be traced, and as distinctly                        seen, as the shadow-               of    a
sun-dial       ;   and, lately discovered (owing to the great improve
ments made in telescopes), volcanic or burning mountains.
  An easy method to determine the magnifying power of
those instruments,              whose         excellence      it is    to have made us
intimately acquainted with the various phenomena above
mentioned, and which give us sources of enjoyment from the
contemplation              of distant     terrestrial        objects,    of which our
forefathers had no conception,                        cannot but be acceptable                  to
many, especially             to those who have               not the opportunity of
employing the more expensive processes that are resorted to
for   the same end.
     The     simplest method            is,to measure the emergent pencil
or cone of light, as            it    appears in the eye-hole of the tele
scope,       and to divide the diameter                 of the aperture of the              ob
ject-glass,         if it
                       is     an achromatic,            or of the great milla,              isa
reflector,          by   the diameter of this emergent pencil, and
it   will    give the magnifying     power. For this purpose,  take                   I
a       of thin writing paper,
     piece                      little            a           more than two inches
in length, and about half an inch in                          breadth    ;I   draw with
a   good pen, or other proper instrument, the line a,                            b,   fig. 28,

to make it more transparent.            I  sometimes    omit making the
lines  i,   2, 3, &c. and content myself with numbering every
second     hole made by the dividers ; the numbers are to ex
press,  in hundredths of an inch,         the distance   of the lines a, bt
and a, c, at those points where they are placed.               Being thus
provided,     I adjust the telescope to distinct vision,        by looking
at some distant object, and then take            off the eye-hole, if the
telescope will admit it to come off, which reflectors always do,
but the night eye-pieces of achromatics do not without taking
away the first glass also.       Having now directed the telescope
to the open day-light, I take the divided paper in one hand,
and a hand magnifier to view it with in the other, and ap
ply the paper to measure the diameter               of the bright pencil
of light as it emerges from* the eye-glass,          and at that distance
 where it appears least in diameter, as at c, fig. 29, where the
 rays  of light, having    passed   the lens a, converging to       c,  there
 cross   each    other, and proceed         diverging   to  d and   e :   this
 place, where the paper is to be applied, will be easily known
 by observing, with your hand magnifier, (which should be
 of  an inch,    or at most an inch and half focus,)            where the
 bright   spot, as at d, fig. 28,       appears distinct and well de
 fined at the edges, and the filaments of the paper diclinctly
 seen at   the same time.       A   place on the paper may be found,
 where the bright spot will just sill up the space between the
lines a, b, and a, c.       Suppose this takes place at d, where             it
 will   be extremely       near   the third     division,   and  of   course
 three hundredths       of  an inch   in diameter     ; and suppose your
 telescope to be a   30-inch achromatic,        and the diameter       of the
 object glass two inches and one tenth, or 210 such divisions;
 these,   divided by three, will give 70 for the magnifying
 power of your instrument.           Suppose, with a different eye
 piece, the pencil of light only occupied the space between
 the lines at ;, it would be one and one half of those divi
sions:    in this   cafe divide 210,       the hundredths     of   an inch
 contained in the diameter of your object glass, by 1/5, and
                                                                             it

with some other eve-piece the beam of light fills the lines at
the fourth division : divide your 2 1 o by 4, and it will give 5 2*5
or 52, for the power.            If your     paper    be oiled    with   good
linseed    oil that    has been      boiled, such     as  the painters call
drying oil, it will last for many years, and have this advan
tage over the instruments made for this purpose which are
 sold  for3l. 3s. that,      as the screw for receiving the dark glass
 projects beyond the place where the paper should be held,
 the paper will bend, and             thus can be introduced into its
 proper situation without producing any sensible error.                  An
 other method, which          I sometimes      use in confirmation of the
 former, and which cannot fail to produce full conviction on
 the mind, is as follows : I measure the space occupied by a
 number of the courses of brick in some modern brick build
 ing, which, upon an average,               will be found to have eight
 courses in two feet       :  hence each course        is three- inches.       I
 then cut      a piece   of paper   three inches in height, and nearly
 of  the length     of  a brick, which is about nine inches,           so that
 it may represent a brick, but with this advantage, that its
 edges will be much better defined; and fixing the paper
 against    the wall (see fig. 27),       place the    telescope    to be ex
 amined at the distance of 50 or 100 yards from the                      wall ;
 and     looking through the telescope                at   the   paper with
 one eye, and at the same time with the other eve look
 ing    past the telescope,       I  observe what       extent   of wall    the
  mainlined       image of the        paper   appears    to cover.     I  then
  count the courses of bricks in that extent, which gives the
 magnifying power of the telescope.                 This method will       ap
  pear   a  little difficult at first, but, by      a few    trials, will be
  come    so   familiar,   that the paper, as       seen   by the telescope,
  may be easily compared with the bricks                 seen   by the other
  eye.
     I  intended to have added            several   other observations on
  subjects     nearly related to the above ; but having exceeded
                                                                             the

 M,     LR.  GREGORY, M. P. of Berner's-street, who                  had been

 all the symptoms of phthisis pulmonalis.                 He   expectorated      a
quantity of thick, opaque,             and yellowish matter which sunk
 in water,     had disturbed        nights,  was greatly wasted,       and his
 breathing was short and interrupted.                 He took by my          order
  (which was executed by Mr. Leaton, a very ingenious apo
 thecary and able chemist, who lives in Bridge-street, West
 minster) from four to fix quarts hydro-azote daily, mixed
 with twelve of atmospheric air, and at the same time had a
 mixture of myrrh and bark, with opiates occasionally                      ;   and
 under this treatment the cough w.is soon diminished, and in
  six weeks the patient was restored to health, and has conti
 nued free from every complaint these eight months                       ;    even
  a   cold now      passes     off without     exciting    any symptoms of
  alarm.      Dr. Hooper, of the Mary-le-bone Infirmary, and
  several   others of the Faculty, who have seen this cafe, think
  that it may     be, produced as       a very strong    argument in favour
  of the pneumatic practice.

   The hydro-azote         is made by burning æther under a           bell-
glass, when the oxygen unites           with the hydrogen and forms
water,    and the retidue is      azotic air; a species of heavy, in
flammable,      or hydrogen air, and some æther in the             state  of
vapour, and      a  small proportion      of  fixed air.    I have myself
inhaled ten quarts of this pure,          and the pulse has funk from
eighty to seventy beats in a minute,              and continued so for a
quarter  bf  an hour or more.        It is  very grateful to the lungs ;
and   I  flatter myself, that this new species of air, first em
ployed by me, may prove hereafter a valuable acquisition to
the ars medendi.         As we brace the constitution with tonic
medicines, thereis danger of local inflammation,               which this
appears    to obviate;       or, has the hydro-azote         any peculiar
healing quality      ?
     XVII.     Biographical Memoirs          ofM. de Saussure.
                       By  A.  P. Decandolle f.
 H.orace Benedict                  de Saussure         was born at Ge
neva in 1740.          His father, an intelligent farmer, to whom
we are indebted for some memoirs relating to rural economy,
resided at Conches, a place situated on the banks of the Arve,
at the distance     of half   a league  from Geneva      ; and this coun
try life, added to an active education, expanded              no doubt in
yoitng De     Saussure that physical strength        so necessary to    the
naturalist who devotes himself to travel.             He repaired daily
to town to enjoy the advantage of public instruction; and as
he lived at the bottom         of Salevc,    a mountain which he has
since rendered      celebrated, he amused himself frequently with
ascending its     steep   and rugged sides.      Being thus surrounded
by the phenomena of nature, and at the same time aided
by study, he conceived a taste for natural history, and avoid
ed the error both       of the learned, who form        theories  without

                                                                   having

having been out       of their  closets,    and of those farmers who,
living too     near   to nature, are incapable          of admiring her
beauties.
   His   earliest passion was botany        :  a variegated   soil, abund
ant in plants of different kinds, invites the inhabitant of the
banks of the Leman to cultivate that agreeable science.                This
taste   produced     an intimacy     between      De   Saussure    and    the
great   Haller.     He   paid him a visit in the year 1764, during
his retreat to Bex; and he relates in his travels how much he
admired "that astonishing man, who excelled in every part                  of
the natural sciences.        De  Saussure was induced also to study
the vegetable      kingdom, by his connexion with Ch. Bonnet,
who had married his aunt, and who soon                 set a just value on
the rising talents of his nephew.           Bonnet was then employed
on the leaves of plants.        De   Saussure studied these organs         of
vegetables    also, and he published the result         of his  researches,
under the title of Observations on the bark of leaves.                 This
small    work,   which appeared soon after the year 1760, con
tains new observations        on the epidermis of leaves,            and   in
particular on themiliary glands by which they are covered*.
   About that period the place of professor of philosophy fall
ing vacant, it was conferred upon De Saussure, who was then
only twenty -one years of age.              Experience proves, that if
premature rewards extinguish the zeal of those who labour
merely for themselves, they, on the contrary, strengthen                it in
those who labour only for truth.             At  that time the two pro
fessors  of philosophy    at Geneva taught physics and logic alter
nately.     De Saussure discharged this double taste with equal
success.     He gave to his course of logic a practical, and, as
one may fay, experimental turn           ;    and his method     of  teach
ing, which      began by studying the fenses to arrive at the ge
neral laws of the understanding, announced already an able
observer    of nature.
   Physics however were the part for which he had the greatest
taste, and   which conducted him           to the study      of chemistry
    * He had
               resumed this subject eighteen months before his death.

and mineralogy.        He then began his          travels   through the
mountains      ; not now to examine their vegetable productions,
but to study the mountains themselves,             either in the stones
of  which they are composed, or the disposition of their masses.
Geology,      a science which was then         scarcely    in  existence,
added charms to his numerous excursions             through the Alps ;
and it was then that the talents      of  the great philosopher were
really displayed.      During   the first fifteen or twenty years       of
his professorship, he employed himself by turns in discharging
the duties of his office, and in traversing the different moun
 tains in the neighbourhood of Geneva.               He   even extended
 his excursions on one    side as far as the banks of the Rhine, and
 on the other to Piedmont.        At the fame time       he undertook a
journey     to Auvergne to examine there the extinguished vol
 canoes,   and another to Paris, England, and Holland.              After
 that he visited Italy, and even Sicily.         These were not mere
journeys for the purpose of reaching any particular place. He
 undertook them only with         a view of studying nature ; never
 travelled   but surrounded    by even- instrument that could be
 of use to   him, and never   set out until he had drawn up a plan
 of  the experiments     and observations      he intended to make.
 He   often fays in his works, that he had found this method
 exceedingly useful.
    In  the year 1779 he published the first volume of his Tra
 vels through the Alps, which contains a minute description of
 the environs of Geneva, and an excursion          as far as Chamouni,
 a village ,at the bottom     of Mont-Blanc.           Philosophers will
 read there with pleasure      the description    of his   magnetometer.
 The more      he examined mountains, the more was he sensible
 of the importance of mineralogy.            To  study it with advan
 tage, he learned the German language;             and it may be seen,
 in  the last volumes   of his Travels, how much new mineralo-
 gical knowledge he had acquired.
    Amidst his numerous excursions          through the Alps, and at
 the time of the political troubles of Geneva in 1782, he found
 means     to make his beautiful experiments on hygrometry,
                                                                   which

  \vhich he published in 1783 under the title of Essays on Hy-
 grometry. This work, the best that ever came from his pen,
 established fully his reputation as a philosopher. We are in
 debted       to him also for the invention            of a new hygrometer.
  Deluc had already invented his whalebone hygrometer; and
  on that account there arose between him and De Saussure a
  sort   of  contest,   which    degenerated        into   a pretty    violent dis
  pute.
      In   the year 1786 De Saussure resigned the professor's chair,
 which he had filled for about twenty-five years,                     to his pupil
  and    fellow-labourer Pictet, who discharged with reputation
 the duties of an office rendered more difficult by succeeding
 so   eminent     a  philosopher.
      When De        Saussure was invited by the state to take a share
 in   the public education, he made              it one  of the  subjects    of his
 meditations, and presented the plan                 of  a  reform in the edu
 cation of Geneva, the tendency of which was, to make young
 people early acquainted with the natural sciences and mathe
 matics.       He   even wished that their physical education should
 not be neglected,          and   with that view          proposed      gymnastic
 exercises.      This plan, which excited much attention in a city
 where every one is convinced of the importance of education,
 found admirers and partisans            ;  but the poverty of its pecuniary
 resources was an obstacle to every important innovation.                         It
 was besides feared that, by altering established forms, they
 might lose the substance,           and that things might be changed
for the worse.         The   Genevese were attached            to their old sys
 tem of education         ; and  they had reason to be            so,   because   it
 had not only proved the means                of diffusing knowledge gene
 rally amongst them, but had             called forth the talents of several
 eminent mathematicians* and philosophers f.

cation alone.      He   superintended      himself the education of his
two sons and     a daughter, who have shewn themselves worthy
of   such an instructor.       His daughter        to the charms        of   her
 sex  unites an extensive      knowledge of         the natural sciences ;
 and his eldest son       has already made himself known by his
 physical  and chemical labours.
    The   second volume       of his Travels      was published in 1785.
 It contains   a description      of   the  Alps around Mont-Blanc,
 which the author considers as a mineralogist, a geologist,                 and
 a philosopher.       He    gives    also some interesting experiments
 on electricity, and    a  description of his electrometer,           the most
perfect we have.       We     are indebted     to him also for several in
 struments   of measurement,        such as his    cy  ammeter, destined to
 measure the degree     of the  blueness    of the   heavens, which varies
 according to the elevation of the observer            : his diapbanometer,
or instrument for measuring the transparency                   of   the atmo
sphere ; and his anemometer,          which, by means of a kind of ba
lance, weighs the force of the wind.
    Some years after the publication of the second volume                     of
his Travels, De Saussure was admitted                 as a  foreign associate
of the Academy       of Sciences of Paris;        and Geneva could then
boast   of having two of its citizens in that class, which con
sisted  onlv of -seven members. De Saussure not only did ho
nour to his country         :  he loved and       served it.     He    was the
founder of the Society of Arts, to which Geneva is indebt
ed for the    high     state   of   prosperity   it has attained        within
the last thirty years.          He   presided over that society         till the
last moment     of his life, and one of his fondest           wislies was the
preservation   of this useful establistiment.
    In  consequence      of M.    de Saussure's       fatiguing labours in
the Council of Two Hundred, of which                     he was a member,
and afterwards      in the National Assembly, his health began

 activity    ;    and after that accident he revised the two last vo
 lumes of his Travels, which appeared in 1796.                        They'con-
 tain an account of his excursions to the mountains of Pied
mont and Swisserland,               and in particular      of his journey to the
summit of Mont-Blanc.                   These volumes, instead of exhibit
ing any marks of his malady, present an enormous mass                             of
new facts and observations                  of   the   utmost    importance       to
physics.
      He   rendered       also an important        service to that science by
publisliing the Agenda*, which terminate his fourth volume,
and in which that, great man, surviving himself, conducts
the young naturalist through the middle of mountains, and
teaches him the method                of observing them with advantage.
These Agenda are a               proof os his genius, and of the strength
of mind which            he retained     amidst his sufferings.       It  was also
during his illness that he published Observations on the fusi
bility ofjiones by the blow-pipe, and that he directed the ex
periments made on the height of the bed of the                    Arve*. Hav
ing gone for the fake of his health to the baths of Plombiers,
he still observed the mountains at a distance, and caused to
be brought           to him specimens         of   the strata which        he per
ceived      in the       steepest   rocks.     lie   had   announced that he
would conclude his Travels with some ideas on the primitive
state     of   the    earth   ;  but the more he acquired new facts,
and the more he meditated                 on the subject, the more uncer
tain did his opinions become in regard to those grand revo
lutions which preceded the present epoch. In general he
was a Neptunian; that is to fay, ascribed all the revolutions
of our globe           to water.       He admitted       the  possibility of the
mountains having been thrown up by elastic fluids disen
gaged from the cavities of the earth.

worse, he still entertained     hopes   of recovery  ; and th e  French
government having appointed          him professor of philosophy at
the Special School of Paris, he did not despair of being one
day able to fill that office : but his strength was exhausted, a
general languor succeeded the vigour he had always enjoyed,
his flow and embarrassed          pronunciation     no longer corre
sponded with the vivacity        of his mind, and formed       a melan
choly contrast with the pleasantness          by which he had been
formerly distinguished.        It was a painful spectacle to see this
great man reduced         thus to imbecility at an age when me
ditation is beneficial, and when he ought at least to have en
joyed the fruits of his reputation and labours.

 all the remedies which medicine enlightened by the physical
sciences    could afford   —all   assistance was useless.      The vital
 power quitted him with flow and painful steps. Towards the
fceginning of autumn last year his decay became more visible,
 his mind lost all its activity, and on the 32d of March 1799
 he terminated his brilliant career, at the age of 59, lamented
 by a family to whom he was dear —by a country to which
 he had done       honour —and by Europe, the knowledge of

examined the means            of remedying         the  alteration in the
movement of watches, occasioned by changes of tempera
ture. He proposed, for this purpose, that the balance sliould
be composed     of different metals;       and he examined by calcu
lation what ought to be the form of the parts to render the vis
inertia constant, while the oscillating mass dilates or contracts.

 .    On  a new Principle     in Tanning, by George Biggin, Esq.
 From      the experiments adduced in this paper it appears,            that
 elm bark is the       least  powerful of any, and that oak            bark
 in winter     is not so powerful as      in spring in    the proportion
  of 30   to 128.
      On Lime employed for manure by Smythson Tennant, Esq.
 This paper contains much useful practical information re
 specting the effects produced by different kinds of lime-stones.
 One kind, found        near Doncaster,       proves highly detrimental
  to the land on which it is laid,         however sparingly,'      so as to'
  destroy almost    entirely all vegetation      : this mischievous pro
 perty is found to be owing to the presence of a portion of
   magnesia.     Near Ferry-bridge, on the other hand, a lime
  stone is found which proves       highly fertilizing     applied   in any
 quantity.      This  paper is accompanied with a table            of  diffe
 rent pernicious      lime-stones found in various parts of the
  kingdom.
      The reading of a    paper on the Decomposition           of Borax by
  Professor Crell, and     an interesting one on Shells and Bones,
   by Charles Hatchet, Esq. terminated the session, which was
   closed on the 13th instant.
                             AEROSTATION.
      Several of the foreign journals have announced an inven
   tion of Professor Danzel for directing an air balloon through
  the atmosphere.        The following is a fliort account of the
  method. M. Danzel has constructed two cylinders or axles,
  to the ends of which are fixed, in the form of a cross, four
  fails or oars, moveable at the point of their Insertion into the
   cylinder, in such a manner that, when made to move round
   by means of a handle, the eight oars, like the cogs          of a water
                                 5                                      Will

io8                                Aerostation.
mill wheel,        present in succession to the                 air sometimes          their
flat   side and sometimes       their edge.
   To    cause each oar to turn back on itself about the fourth
part of a circle,         M. Danzel          has not only left sufficient                 play
at the point where the stick                 of    each       oar is inserted        in the
cylinder, but has placed the stick in such a manner that the
air itself makes the oar fall back, at each turn, with the ne
cessary velocity and precision.                   It    must here       be understood
that the two cylinders,            armed with their four oars or fails,
are destined to occupy one each side                     of   the balloon, four oars
on each side.
   It is    well known that aerostation                  has a resemblance           to fly
ing or swimming          rather than to sailing, since every aerostat
is immersed         in the air as a bird, or as a fisli is immersed in
water   ; whereas       the effort      of   a vessel is      divided between two
elements,      one   of which, the water,                 gives it a great point            of
support, and the other, the air, is very                        easy to     be divided.
But    the aerostat being totally immersed                     in   the air, it was ne
cessary to      find out a movement which, though                               circular,
should not destroy at each               half turn       the effect    of   the preced
ing    one ; for, the resistance being equal in the whole circum
ference,      it is evident that the support must be diminiflicd                            or
even    annulled, if      possible,      in one half of the circle, and be
retained      full and perfect in the other.                  This M. Danzel              has
effected,     by presenting        to    the      air sometimes          the edge and
sometimes          the flat part      of the fails on           each side, in turns
and with great regularity. The result  that during   con      is,                 a
tinued rotation each cylinder produces  strong current of       a
air hehind, and rarefaction before; and this current, which
continues without          intermission,          is
                                                         ver)' sensible.

dent then that        a   body suspended               in air at rest,    if    thefc twe
cylinders are attached to    must advance towards the rarefied

•ach half turn the force of the water overcomes the resistance
of the air, in      the proportion       of  a thousand to one ; hut      if the
wheel with its immoveable cogs were entirely immersed in
a current of water, it is evident that it would not turn at all,
because the water would make two efforts in opposite direc
tions on the upper and lower cogs.                  If we  now suppose such
a cogged wheel totally immersed                in  stagnant water, and that
by means of any power it is made to turn on itself, it will
only agitate the water without producing a current ; and if
it   be free to advance         or recede,      it will do neither.       But  if
 the cogs are rendered moveable by                M. Danzel's method, in
 such a manner that the wheel presents alternately at each                   half
 turn the flat side and the edge, it will necessarily advance, and
 occasion a current         of water behind it.
                                 NAVIGATION.
      M.   Danzel       has   invented also an hydraulic          machine for
 making      a   ship or boat        advance     during a calm, and even
  against a   current.       The mechanism of this machine                is ex
 tremely simple       ;   and   if  we did not know that the simplest
  means are often discovered            the latest, we might      be surprised
 that it should         not have been found out before.                It con-
  fists of  a long pole,        to the anterior extremity        of which an
  apparatus,      shaped like a drawer without              back or front, is
  attached     in   such    a manner        that when pustied forwards it
  folds itself back under the pole, to which                it as  it  were ad
  heres,   and presents to the water the thin              cutting    surface   of
  its three edges, viz. of the bottom and two fides, which can
  neither oppose to the water a resistance capable of preventing
  the pole from penetrating farther, or of making the ship
   recede.
      When      the pole,    which    is pustied forwards from the vessel,
  has attained      to its  full reach, the drawer        as soon as    the pole
  is pulled back assumes           a vertical position, and presents to the
  water its whole cavity. By these means it embraces a column
  of water, which, without finding               means to escape, presses on
                                                                           a  fur

   a surface rrrach larger than that             of  a common oar. and keep*
   the drawer immoveable               ;  fo that those who draw the pole
   towards them, instead of making the                     vessel to recede,   cause
   it   to advance.        This machine,           which may        be multiplied
   more conveniently than oars, has this vinose advantage over
  the latter, that it opposes to the water                  a resistance  infinitely
  superior, while the pafEve re-action of this resistance renders
  the labour of the mariners less laborious and more effectual.

       The following note has been lately published by Delaknde
  in one of the French Journals :
       **
          M. Von      Zach, director of the observatory             of Gotha, the
  most     celebrated      and    most      useful   astronomer of Germany,
  and whom        I  visited   last summer, informs me,             in one   of his
  fetters,   that on the 25th of December he saw the thermo
  meter at 21" Fahr. below o°. In the duchv of Wirtem-
  berg it was at 24% at Augsbourg 25°,                     at  Manhein      19°, at
  Vienna i8°,        at Amsterdam           i6:,   at Dresden      4' as at   Paris;
  but at Copenhagen, which                   is much     farther north,     ft  vu
  only at 10 degrees.            Thus the cause of this great cold did
 not come from the north, but probably from Siberia and
 Tartary.       I  am accused        of having predicted that the winter
 Would be moderate.             This is not correct. Some weak per
son had said,       in   one  of the Journals, that every 400 years the
winter was       severe,     and    that the last one corresponded             with
 that period.         I  replied, that the period          of 400   years had no
 foundation      ; and     that,   if   there were     any probable means         of
 foretelling any thing, it would be by the period of 18 years :
 it has succeeded sometimes.                  M. Toaldo asserts, that in Italy
it    succeeds always;        and     it was this which           promised     us  a
moderate       winter.       On this       fide the   Alps, and the Pyrenees,
local circumstances, which cannot be explained,                           derange
often our calculation and the period.                    I  gave that conjecture
therefore     only      as  probability,        but it has been improperly
considered     as a prediction."              Lalanm.

                        INOCULATION OF SHEEP.
     It   appears that the practice      of inoculating       sheep for the
small-pox is now common in Germany.                      We    are informed
that a      M.   von Hofman caused this operation to be performed
on his whole flock, and that not one of them died.                 A scratch
was       made     in   the   skin of the right hind leg, three or four
inches from the hoof, and a small drop of matter squeezed
from a ripe pustule was rubbed into the wound.                      A  plaster
 an     inch and a quarter long,        and an inch       broad, was then
applied over it.           Professor Beckmann,      to whom we are         in
 debted for this article, fays he does not know whether'it                 has
 been      proved      by experience    that flieep     inoculated in this
 manner are secured             against future infection.         This point
 indeed does not seem to be yet determined ;                  otherwise, the
 Royal Society of Gottingen would not have made it the sub
ject of      a prize question.

  apoplexy, Charles           Theodore,    elector Palatine,       who   as   a
  friend to the arts and sciences deserves a conspicuous              place  in
  the annals of literature.           A chronological catalogue of his
 institutions may be found           in F. P. Wundts Essay towards a
 general History of the Palatinate           of  the Rhine.      In the year
  1763 he founded the Academy                 of Sciences      at  Manheim,
  which       since   its establishment     has certainly      been   of great
  utility by its      researches   into ancient history and geography.
  At     the fame time that the Academy was founded, a Cabinet
  of Antiquities was begun. In             1769 the Physical Economical
  Society at Lautern            was established;    and   in  1774 the   High
  School,       which in      1784 was transferred      to Heidelberg      and
  united       with    the University    of that place. The German
   Literary Society          at  Manheim established in 1775 was
   founded also by this Prince, as well           as the  Cabinet of Natu

School of Midwifery, and the School for attending on the
Sick. He augmented the Court Library at Manheim with
the scarcest and most valuable works           ; expended considerable
sums   on the Observatory of that city, and raised it to be
one of the first not only in Germany but in Europe.                        To
encourage    and  promote   the    fine arts,   he  established    in   1775
the Academy of Drawing and Sculpture at Manheim, a Hall
for copying Paintings with a valuable collection of pictures,
and the German National Theatre, which, by the zeal of
M. vonDalberg        and the talents    of excellent performers,        soon
became one     of  the most celebrated       in Germany.

TO THE     EDITOR OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE.
        SIR,
   IN   a collection  of minerals in my possession there are seve
ral specimens     which I suspect to contain Mr. Klaproth's
new semi-metal uranite ; but as they are handsome,                  and not
large, am     unwilling   to sacrifice    them to analysis to know
their contents.
   If  any of your mineralogical           readers    can, through the
channel of your useful Magazine, point out by what means
the presence of uranite can be ascertained in such small pieces
only  as  can be detached from cabinet specimens,                I  fliall be
much obliged to him.
   By giving this      a place    in your next Number, you wiH

L HILOSOPIIERS                         were acquainted only with
                                 formerly
the longitudinal        vibrations of the air in a sounding pipe,
where, as is well known, the pipe or tube itself is not the                                so
norous body, but the column of air contained in                           it,   which,
according to the direction of its length, contracts and expands
in    various ways.        That    solid     bodies    also can vibrate          in the
direction of their length,          according to the same laws,                      as   the
above elastic fluid in  pipe; and that the laws of this longi
                             a

Vibration,   I    first shewed in regard to strings in my discoveries
respecting     the Theory of Sounds, and in regard                              to        rods

  Rods.       A  string can extend and contract itself cithqr wholly
' in the direction of its length, or divide itself into two, three;
  four, or more parts, each of which is suhject to a movement
  of the like kind.          The   tones,     which   in comparison of the
  transversal tones arc exceedingly high, are to each other as
  the numbers i, 2, 3, 4, £cc, or as the number of the vi
  brating parts.         '1 hey so far correspond         with the transversal
  tones, that in the fame kind of vibration they are in the in
  verse ratio of the length of th<; strings ; but totally differ
   from them in this,          that the thickness and extension of the
   string are of no account, and that, for this reason, more de
   pends upon the nature of the substance.
                                                             Thus the tone of
   a brass string is about            a sixth  or a seventh higher than the
   tone of a cat-srut siring;       ;   and the tone    of  a steel   string is a
   fourth or nearly a fifth higher than the tone of a brass strings
   On the other hand, in the transversal vibrations of a string,
    the tone,     as is   well known,        does not depend on the quality
    of  the substance,      tut   on the length,      weight,    and   degree   of
    tension.      A  siring, therefore, which vibrates longitudinally,
    is not to be considered so much as a thread-like body ren
    dered elastic by tension, but as a piece of matter extended
    in length, and which vibrates exactly in                 the fame manner
    as a rod or staff fastened at both ends.              When     a staff is free
    at both ends, in its first manner of longitudinal                  vibration,
     there is a certain point in the           middle at which the vibra
     tions of each half stop       ;   in  the next there    are  two, each at
     the distance     of   a fourth part from the end ; and           in the fol
     lowing    there are three,       &c.     The  tones correspond      with the
     natural series    of   the numbers        1, 2, 3, 4, Sec.     If  a rod    b«
     fastened at one end during the first kind              of longitudinal vi
     bration, the alternate expansion           and contraction of the whole
      rod take place in such a manner that they stop at the fixed
      end ;  in  the next tone there is a resting point at the distance
      of one-third from the           free end;    and in the following there
      are two,   &c.      The   tones correspond       with the numbers 1,3,
      e, 7, &c.j    and the first     of  these tones is an octave lower than
                                                                                the

                             of Strings     an J    Rods.                     1 15
 the first tone of the same rod when perfectly free.                    All kinds
 of longitudinal        vibrations can        be best produced         by proper
 friction or nibbing in the direction of the length with the
 singer,   or any soft substance rubbed over with pounded resin,
 and on glass rods,        of which     those used for thermometers and
 barometers are the fittest, with            a wet     fag bestrewed with fine
 sand; from     which it      is evident that the rubbing must be per
 formed within        a  vibrating part, and that the rod must                  be
 gently held between two fingers of the other hand at any of
 the resting points, but at no other place.                 In  pipes the higher
 tones are produced         by   a stronger    and somewhat        different me
 thod of blowing.           In   a pipe open at        both ends, the column
of air contained in it vibrates like                a   rod  free at both ends ;
and the column in a pipe close at one end, like a rod                      which
is fixed at one end.          In  all longitudinal        vibrations, the tones,
during the fame kind of vibration,                    depend     merely on the
length of the sonorous body, and on the quality of the sub
 stance : the thickness, and other circumstances in regard to
form, are of no consideration.                 I   have examined every sub
stance     which    I   could obtain in           a  sufficiently long rod-like
form, in regard to longitudinal vibration; for example, many
kinds of wood and metal, also glass, whalebone, Sec.                         The
specific gravity makes no difference                ;  for sir-wood, glass, and

    As found    is conducted also by longitudinal               vibrations, since
 n  portion of air, or of any other substance, is obliged by the
impulse of the sonorous body to contract and again expand
itself,   a more accurate          knowledge of longitudinal vibration
may serve to determine with what velocity sound is conducted
through hard bodies.              Count Giordr.no Riccati, in his ex
cellent work on Strings or Elastic Fibres*,                     has proved that
found    passes  through      a space   filled with air, of a given length,

Kewton in his Prindpia * savs the fame thing in another
manner, for he          asserts     that each stroke (pulfusj                      passes        through
twice the length of an open pipe;                                   but he calls             a    double
vibration,       that     is,   a    contraction and expansion,                           a       stroke   ;
whereas      Riccati and others, agreeably                             to the common mode
of expression, call each contraction,                          as   well     as each     expansion,
a   vibration.         The      principles on which                     this proposition de
pends, seem to be            of     such   a    general          nature that they may be
applied to hard bodies; and thus we may at least admit, with
the greatest probability, that found passes through everybody
in the fame time in which that body, when        vibrates freely,             it
makes one longitudinal vibration.                                We     arc taught               by   expe
dience, that found moves through the air with     velocity of                        a
about 1040 Paris feet in   second; we learn also from expe
                                          a
riments and calculation, that                        in   a   stiut pipe       of    five feet, and
an open pipe of ten feet, 100 vibrations are made in second.                                 a
According, then, to the above proposition, sound must pass-
through ten times               a   hundred, that                is,   1000 feet in          a    second.
That the velocity            is      being about 1040 feet,
                                  somewhat greater,
does not however contradict the proposition for the column                    :

a  little longer than that contained in the pipe as Count Ric                  3
 cati has proved in the before-mentioned work, and as pcoplfe
 may be easily convinced through experience,     holding ther                       by
 hand close to the mouth of pipe, w here the vibration of the
                                                a
 air will be strongly felt. Hard bodies,  the above proposi            if
 tion be universally true, must conduct sound with greater ve
 locity in proportion as the tone    higher, which    emitted

     Professor    Wunsch, in            some papers       which he      read before
the Academy of              Berlin* in         1788 and 1789, made known
experiments to which he was led by Hook's Micrographia,
and from which he infers, that found moves with infinite
velocity through hard bodies, or with the fame velocity as
 light. It follows, however, from the experiments which
 were made with a series               of wooden laths not of considerable
 length,      that found was conducted through these sooner than,
through the air.
     Hard bodies, in            regard to the strength          with which they
 convey sound,            seem to exceed          air ;   so  that we may conse
 quently admit that air, though the most common conductor
 of sound, is however one of the worst conductors of it. Isa
 man holds one end of a stick in his teeth, and applies the other
 to a sounding body, he will clearly hear the sound of it though
his ears be stopped           ; and     in this manner two persons, almost
deaf,     could hear all the notes of my euphon                    f,  even    in pia

one was playing,        and having a tobacco-pipe       in his  mouth,    the bowl    of

lent observations           on the capability of hard bodies to conduct,
 found,       in the Memoirs of the Academy of Turin for 1/yQ
 and    1 79 1.     Articulated tones also are conducted exceedingly
 well through hard bodies,                 as  I  found by experiments which
 I    nade with some of my friends.                         Two persons who had
stopped their ears could converse with each other when they
 held    a  long stick, or        a  series    of   sticks,    between       their teeth,
 or rested their teeth against them. It is all the fame whether
 the person who speaks rests the stick against his throat or hii
 breast,      or when one         rests   tbe stick which he holds in his
 teeth against some vessel               into which the other speaks.                   The
 effect    will    be greater      the more the vessel is capable                 of a tre
 mulous movement.                  It  appeared       to be strongest           with   glass
 and    porcelain        vessels   ;  with copper kettles, wooden boxes,
 aud earthen pots, it was weaker. Sticks of glass and next
 fir-wood        conducted the sound best.                    '1  he sound could also
 be heard when a thread was held between                           theteeth by both,

in the like manner, to keep up a conversation, and to be able to Understand
the least whisper.        His  son made this beneficial       discovery the subject of an

the sound was modified           in a manner      a  little different.      By
resting   a stick   or other body against        the    temples,   the fore
head, and the external cartilaginous part of the ear, sound is
conveyed       to the   interior organs of hearing, as will readily
appear if you hold your watch to these parts of another per
son   who has slopped up his cars.              From this it appears, as
well   as   from many known            experiments made in regard to
healing under water,           that in most       of our books on the
elements     of  physics,  in which in general accousiies have had
the undeserved fate of being treated in a much more imper
fect manner        than other parts of philosophy, sound is very
improperly considered only as a vibration of the air, and the
theory of it referred to the head of          Air.     Hearing is nothing
else  than, by means of the organs of hearing, to be sensible
of  the tremulous movement            of an elastic body, whether this
tremulous movement be conveyed through the air, or any
other fluid or hard body, to the auricular nerves.                  It is also
 essentially   the fame whether, as is usually the case, the sound
be conveyed       through the internal part of the ear, or whether
it  be communicated through any other part                 of the body.      It
certainly would be worth the trouble to make experiments
to try whether it might not be possible that deaf and dumb
people, when the deficiency lies only in the external                 organs
of the    ear,   the auricular nerve being perfect, could not, by
 the above method         of conducting found,       be made to hcai: dis
 tinctly words articulated        as well  as  other sounds.

similarity to the threads of common spiders                           :   and
Pereboom            has lately discovered          a  kind of       beetle       furnished
with a vesicle on its back, from the hinder part of which, on
both sides, proceed              two threads that extend over the extre
mity of        the body,        and end     in    a double thread, sometimes
ten or more ells in length              ; and     this thread is supposed to be
what is commonly called the Gossamer.
     After many         years experience and observations                   made almost
daily when this phenomenon appeared,                            I flatter myself that
    * In  the country, during autumn, certain threads are seen hanging from
the trees, or extended on the bushes, and even the grafs,                      which, when
agitated by the       wind, detach themselves from the branches,              are transported
to others, and aie joined or separated         at the pleasure     of   the breeze.    People
in walking often find their faces, hair, and clothes, covered with them.
They     are generally called the threads       of St. Martin (filets        de. St. Martin),
because     it is about St. Martin's day that they appear in the greatest               abun
dance.       When the moisture of the atmosphere and the dew attach them
selves   to these threads and become congealed,             so that     the threads appear
 thicker    and whiter,     the peasants   call them      the hair of the Virgin Mary
 (ch-veiix     de  la Fierge Marie).     Having one day         asked     them the cause of
 this production,       they unanimously     replied,   and without variation,          that it
 was the vapours of the earth,         which   at that season are thicker          and denser.
 I   had no great confidence         in this opinion      :   but I soon learned the real
 truth;    for, being in a field ovei spread       with heath in the time of autumn,
 I   observed     that   almost all the hcath-bufhes        were covered with spiders
 rvebs,    and when these were opened           I  found     inclosed     in each    a spider.
 These spiders were small, of         a red colour,     and marked with spots;            their
  feet were short, and the head was large in propoition                 to the belly.     Such
 spiders webs are found among the low shrubs that grow                       near the earth,
  at the bottom      of stalks of corn which have       been left standing by the reap
 ers, and in the bustles.         When the wind       is strong it      breaks these     webs,
  carries away a part of them,        which    are scattered    over the ground and the
  trees, and hence come the threads of St. .Martin.                Huetiana,       Amsterdam

I am       able to resolve the                 problem respecting                its origin.            In
my opinion the gossamer arises from nothing                                      else    than a cer
tain kind of field-spiders, which are, however,                                         so   small ants
active, that they almost always escape notice, unless the ob
server is endowed               with           great       acuteness    of fight.             I    would

                    it has already no name, the gossamer
spider (aranea obtexlrixj : I shall here give a short descrip

                         ;                      covered with insu      is
lated hairs.
  These insects first appear in the beginning of October, in
woods, gardens, and meadows, where their eggs may be
hatched unhurt and unmolested, and thence spread them
selves over whole districts, that during all the month of
                                                      so
October and till the middle of November they may be found
on the dry fields throughout all Europe; and                                     as     they produce
a    numerous progeny, extensive tracts may sometimes                                             be seen
swarming with them.                            The young, which                 have not attained
to their full growth,                     are not larger than the point                       of  a    pin;
they are black, with grey feet,                             and almost    imperceptible to
the naked eye.                 In the beginning                    of October, when very
few        of them           have     been           hatched,       one observes                  only in
the sunshine  few single threads of their webs, which they
                         a
extend from twig to twig, or from straw to straw but about                              ;
 the middle of the month                               their threads become more per-,
 ceptible; and towards the end,                            if   people stand or place them
 selves      in   such   a    position that they can                see the      sun-beams play
 ing on the          tender threads,                   they perceive hedges,                 meadows,
 corn-fields,            stubble land,            and even          whole districts, covered
 with       a   sine white          thick      sort    of gauze.        This        spider        belongs

threads from one place to another, and which Linnæus, on
that account, includes in               a   particular division.             The threads,
swing        to the smallness      of       the animal,            arc fo delicate          that a
singleone cannot be distinguished by the naked eye unless
when the fun shines upon it. A thread, to be visible at other
times, must be composed of at least                          six threads     twisted toge
ther ; and such          a   thread,    as the single ones               arc exceedingly
brittle and do not readily unite, may be again easily divided
into     its component          threads.            During         the serene calm days
of   the above months these animals carry on their occupation
with great diligence,             especially          after the morning fogs have
disappeared.          Between the hours of twelve and two, how
ever, is the period when their great industry excites most
admiration.   If people are possessed of good eye-sight, or are
furnished with a magnifying glass, they may find among the
barley stubble such a multitude of these spiders employed                                           in
extending their threads, that the fields appear                              as   if   covered,
with swarms of gnats, and they perform their labour                                                 so
Ipeedily that they seem to fly from one stubble to another.
     These tender         threads,      which           are      extended      over         whole
fields,       particularly      in the       last      half of October,                become
twisted together by the gentlest                       breath of wind,
                                                  and form
perceptible threads, that, being broken loose by a stronger
wind,        are united       into thick threads, and even balls, that
float through          the    atmosphere.              They are known then in
Germany by the name of the                         flying summer*, because the
summer seems     as it were to fly away at the fame time.
The spiders also are then conveyed along in them ; and it is
not uncommon                 to find    these         animals        entwisted         in    such
threads which have been caught                        f.

     All   the spiders,          however, found in these threads or balls,
tnust not be considered                     as       the     animals by which they were
prepared ; for other kinds                           of     spiders,   common             in   harvest,
arc sometimes             entangled in these threads                         and carried along
with them.               1 hus, for example, the black and white spotted
tree-spider, and the                  so   called chestnut-spider, are often found
inclosed in the gossamer together with their habitations, and
must obey the impulse                      of    the winds.
  These webs, which consist of threads clofcjy joined toge
ther, serve the insects as nets, in which they catch very small
black flies, gnats, and winged tree-Ike, the juices of which
they fuck for their  nourishment.  The gossamer, therefore,
is often found silled with the dried husks of such infects.
     The    above,        in my opinion,                    is the real origin            of   the gos
samer.           But why        do these spiders appear only                         in   the time    of
harvest      ?   why not earlier                 ?   and why are they not found like
the    house       and        field-spiders throughout the whole summer?
—These           objections obviate themselves.                            They      appear at that
period for the fame reason that may-bugs smayhafferj appear
in    the month          of May. They                     are as necessary in their order to
preserve the equilibrium                     os the balance            of Nature          as the may-r
bugs are in May. Single spiders of this kind, however, may
be found the whole summer through, as single may-bugs are
found in harvest.                 To        those who know                   that exactly about
this time those birds, for whose nourishment insects have been
assigned, undertake their emigrations,                                     and that the larks         in
particular,        which are               so    fond of spiders,             then leave us, the
above       phenomenon will not appear wonderful, but will ra
ther be considered                as a wife regulation                       of Nature.          Those
¦who       wish to be convinced of the truth of this observation
need only to shoot a lark at that period and to open it hnme-
sphere ; and when these threads and balls are examined,                              they will alwavs
be found to contain spiders,                which have prepared               these substances     to en
able them to       fly   without wings, and               to procure themselves an easy passage to

 j 24              Remarks on       Mr.  Sheldrake's
diately.   These insects,      together with        the grains    of barley
which drop from the ears, must indemnify these                birds, which
stop in many places on their passage in great numbers, for
the loss of the summer insects.
    After what has     been said,    I  do not think that the white
ness  of the threads, which        arises from nothing else than the
dews that fall at that period, or their clamminess when rub
bed between the fingers, not observed in the threads of other
spiders, and which is occasioned             by the fineness         of the
threads, that   so easily  insinuate themselves         into the cavites of
the (kin, can be brought as any objection against this mode
of explanation. These phenomena can have no weight un
less we ascribe     these threads      to the common spider.            It is
likewise very improbable that the gossamer is produced, as
M.    Pereboom asserts, by his beetle          ;   which however must
excite our admiration,       because, like the spider, it weaves for
itself a net, either to   serve  it as a habitation,       or as the means
 of catching its prey.
III.   Remarks on    Mr. Sheldrake's               Dissertation on Paint
    ing in Oil in the Manner of the         Venetians.        By  Mr. Eo-
    WABD Dayes. Communicated                  by the     Author*
 X   ERSUADED           that  Mr. Sheldrake labours under             a mis
take, which may       lead others into a practice difficult in itself
 and dangerous to the durability of their works,                I (hall offer
 no apology for the following remarks on his Dissertation *.
    That the Venetians primed with distemper, is true ; but
 ihc colour  used was not a brown, as stated by             Mr. Sheldrake*
 but a red, known at present by the name of Venetian red.
 Some artists at this time employ the fame colour, previously
calcined, in a new Venetian method              :   I fay a new one, for
 there are two or three.        One of the secrets consists in prim-

of    size or paste, and      afterwards     brustiing it over with the
above calcined-red.
     The method of working up the picture in                a state   of black
and white was certainly practised               at times by some        of the
 Venetians     ;  but in that cafe the ground was no object, as
the whole effect of colour was afterwards                acquired by glaz
 ing:    this  is observable    in  the  pictures   of Tintoret,    and suffi
 ciently accounts for the perished             state   they appear under.
 On the contrary, where the             red ground was used,         the light
 and extreme dark are the only part where the colour lays                  in a
 body.    Mr. Sheldrake      observes, hedoes     "not   pretend to degrade
 painting to the rank of a mechanical art, that may be infal
 libly   practised   by  a receipt."      If the  Venetians had       possessed
 no higher recommendation to notice than mere colouring,
 they would not have so strongly arrested our attention ; on
 the contrary, the compositions of Titian, Paul Veronese, &c.
 will   ever rank among the first.           The   present rage for colour
 is like preferring person to mind, and had it prevailed in the
 time of Swift, would certainly have procured some of our
  professors a situation at Lagoda.
     The author of        the Dissertation must certainly have             mis
 taken the words of Sir Joshua, or not understood                 them.     Sir
  Joshua could never have said that harmony was to be pro
  duced by       " an unity    of light and an unity of shadow per
  vading the whole;" or, in other words, (as I understand it,)
  by reducing the whole of the lights to one colour, as is im
  plied by the word unity.           Such   a practice would destroy the
  brilliancy which the author wishes to obtain from glazing.
  The simile afterwards introduced, contradicts entirely such
   an inference.      "A    picture, to   possess  harmony of colouring,
  should look as if it was painted with one colour; and, when
   the cbiaro-oscuro was complete, the colour of each object
   should be glazed over it." Sir Joslma was in the simile de
   scribing his own practice, and which will, for a short time,
   produce a greater        brilliancy    in the light.       Instead     of an
                                                                       "   unity

   ti6                  Remarks      on  Mr. Shchtrah's
  tc
      unity of light,"       the word harmony must           have     been used;
  as  harmony of light and unity of              {hade   are common terms.
  In  note 43, on     Du Frefnoy 's Art of Painting, he (Sir Joshua)
  expressly fays    :
                       " And for the fake of harmony, the colours,
  however distinguished in their light, fliould be nearly of the
 same colour in their shadows, of a
                        -  "  simple unity of (hade,
                 ¦* As all were from     One single palette spread."
     Every one knows that the harmony of the picture depends
 greatly on the shadows              not being disturbed           with colour.
 That Sir Joshua was acquainted with the method of bring
 ing forward his pictures in a state of black and white, and
 glazing for the colours even in his draperies, is too true, as
 is known to all acquainted with his practice, and was, I be
 lieve, the reason of their not standing.                   His method was,
 with ivory black, vermilion              (used in the carnations),            and
 white,    to bring forward his pictures to their full effect,                 and
 then to glaze for all the colours.            It mould     be observed, that
 this method might only be practised at times, but                    I  had my
 self several opportunities of seeing it.
     All  the advantages       obtained by the practice of glazing,              as
 it is called,    are so transitory, that they may be literally said
 to be but the vision of a day.             Whether this       arises from the
 gum in what is termed               maguilp *, (a composition o( two
 parts mastic varnish and one of drying oil,) mostly employed
 for the purpose, or want of body of colour, I do not pretend
 to determine, though I think both may contribute to effect
 their destruction ; the colour by flying off, and the gum by
    * The above composition,      when mixed on the palette,       forms a consist
ence like honey, with which the colours work exceedingly free.            There are
various compositions for maguisps;      some using   wax    dissolved   in nut oil,
others rosin and sugar of lead      in the same solvent, wax in spirits of tur
pentine,  &c  : though   I  must own a preference for the drying       oil and var
nish for diluting the colours for the touches or pluming on a part, but for
the mere act of glazing 1 prefer good clear oil.
                                                                            losing

colourless matter, they appear in all their vigour.    instead                             If,
of   a   white ground,               a    grey or brown              is   used, the vivacity         will
be more or less                 in proportion to its                      darkness.       These facts
furnish strong                reasons for preferring                      a    white ground, and
may account for the darkness in many of the Venetian pic
tures, from their glazing with transparent colours on dark                                       a
surface,          and,   as before            stated, the loss            of   clearness in the ve
hicle used (no doubt                      a   gum)     ;    but this appears to have been
only an occasional practice.
  The Dutch painters, whose mechanical                                                excellence     was
inferior to none, always used white grounds prepared with
the greatest care.   They spread well-washed chalk mixed
with         size over the surface to be painted on,                                  which   if   nicety
was required                 they pumiced,                    and     repeated         the operation
till   the surface was even                       ;   after    which           they    laid over     it   a
coat         of   the finest flake white.                 The whole picture was then
painted fair, (that                 is,   with    a   body of colour,) except the shades,
which         were kept dear and transparent,                              and received an addi
tional lustre from the ground.                                 That this         was their practice
may be easily                seen    in all their interior                  scenes and the           close
parts of their pictures.
     It      is   much to be wished                       that, instead of brilliancy, per
manency were sought aster    while the Venetian pictures are
                                                      ;
going fast to decay, the works of Van Eyck, Quintin Mat-
fys, and John dc Mabuse, remain fresh and vigorous.
       With         respect         to shadow              being     a    privation of light,        it   is
                                                                                                   readily

readily admitted, and it equally follows, that it is a privatiod
of colour; but this circumstance (hews, as before stated, that
much of the harmony of the picture must depend o.i its not
being disturbed with colour. Where Mr. Sheldrake attempts
to illustrate this doctrine, by supposing a globe exposed in a
painter's room, he seems rather to have confused the matter
by too many divisions.                Artists divide the surface of all bo
dies into   light, middle tint, sliadow,
                                       and (which                                     Mr. Shel
drake has forgot to add to his globe, to round                                  it)   reflection.
There are two things the author of the dissertation                                        appears
to have overlooked,             and      which        eases     the difficulty             of pro
ducing the harmony necessary to constitute                                  a   whole       :    first,
the method           (said to have been at first practised                            by   the    Ve
netians) of breaking the colours,  as to make them all par-
                                                       so
take in some measure of each other, and which was at times
carried    10   a   degree    of insipidity       even        by   Titian   ;     and second
ly,(and which   think the most essential,) the grouping the
                       I
warm colours together     as to form  so  mass, and letting        a
them occupy the greatest portion of the picture.                                      The latter
appears to have been the practice                       of Rubens           and others              of
his school, and which enabled                     him to introduce the whole
scale of colours in the fame picture, from the hottest to the
opposite extreme of cold   this gives
                                    ;  vigour to his colour a
ing beyond all other masters.
  The method of working up                       the picture           in   a   state      of black
and white,           was certainly            never     practised        bv the Flemish
masters.        The    beauty observable               in the colouring of Rubens
(whose demi-tints arc wonderfully clear) resulted from                                           firm
                                                                                           a
ness in the handling,              a      simplicity          and distinctness in the
tints, and      a    particular care to avoid muddling them                               in using!
I do not mean to lay they never glazed, or scumbled to give
richness   ;    but that was done in             a    different        manner to the one
described       in   the Dissertation.            In    some       of his flight pictures
the tones in the flefli may be traced as follows    the light                         :
yellow, next the carnations, then the grey, next the shadow,
glazed to give         it   clearness,        and his reflections generally very

bright   ;   but in his finished         works they are of course more
blended.         Every artist knows, or ought to know,                 that there
are but three primary colours, red, blue, and               yellow; the com
pound colours, which result from combining these, amount
to four, making in all seven.                Red and blue, when mixed,
produce purple          ;   red with      yellow,    orange   ;  blue and yel
low, green       ;   the three united,        a  brown,    black, or grey, as
the warm or cold colours prevail.                  Those constitute all the
colours and tints in nature, mixed with more or                       less  white.
The fewer colours           used   by the artist the better he will colour,
from the practice being rendered simple, and the possibility
of muddling in some measure destroyed: for, it is not the
mixing colours that hurts, but the mixing many, two colours
will always         be clearer than three,          and  so on.     Though the
 above considerations offer a simple                theory   of   colouring, yet
 in practice the artist must have judgment enough to acquire
 at once the precise tint he wants, to insure clearness and bril
 liancy.       The singular fact of white appearing                    grey    on a
 brown ground,            I  sliould suppose to arise from white being
 cold, and from its contrast with the brown.                      That   a  picture
 painted     in brown and white sliould be in perfect harmony is
 not to be wondered            at,  as  it can only be termed an effect of
 light   and shade.           The brown         used by the Venetians           has,
 with   great probability,          been supposed       a   preparation of       as-
 phaltum.
     As    the practice        of glazing     is the last operation      in paint
  ing, and      as   in the doing it the artist         uses    in  the    shadows
 some    transparent         dark colours,       it of course follows,         those
  shadows      must     be kept tenderer to receive the glaze,               which
  may be extended to the detni-tints                if kept  tender in propor
  tion also   :    this will produce        the deceptive       appearance      Mr.
  Sheldrake speaks of in the Venetian pictures,                     and do away
  the weight resulting from mixing,                 as he fays,    "  some dusky
  colour with the local colours and the light."                        The    above

merely enriching a colour by glazing,                               in my opinion              suffi
ciently accounts for Venetian brilliancy.
   What is meant by black and white not being the paint
er's extreme of light and dark,                         I   profess    not to understand                 :
all that       I   know   is,   that the artists have to lament, as well                             as
Mr. Sheldrake, the being obliged                              to represent stiadow with
a    substance,       and that even glazing                    them thin       is   but    a    poor
imitation of the real appearance.                              With      respect to
                                                                                               "    the

painter's art being to represent objects as they appear,
point of colour, to be not as they really are,"  am equally                  I
at   a    loss to understand             the author, having ever been taught
to consider          all colour as comparative                     ;   and therefore, that
black at 50 feet distance was no longer so, and to call                                   it   black
would be as absurd as to call twilight night.
     If
      Ijudge right, (from the author's recapitulation,) there
are three stages in his process first, the darkest tints, then
                                                   ;
the lights,and lastly the colouring.   Now    think      evi            I                 it   is
dent, from  the  oil being instantly absorbed    the ground,                 by
that   would be utterly impossible to blend the lights and
          it
darks together            so   as to       make the picture mellow.                            Then
comes          the glazing for the cplours, which                       is   bad, as experi
ence has sufficiently shewn                      the want          of durability      :    besides,
for such        a   process, oil makes the colours too                       thin     to work          :
this made            the artists         resort    to       the expedient      of using ma-
guilp, which           has the injurious tendency before stated.                      What
made these artists             so   desirous      of   a    clearness in the shades, was
to give them that non-substantial appearance Nature puts
on: in his lights,   true, the artist wants brilliancy, to
                                it   is
acquire which he occasionally glazes or scumbles     but every                    ;
good artist knows, that the less recourse he has to the former
practice, the more permanent his picture will be.
     After all the consideration                 I     have been        able      to give           this
subject,       I    am inclined           to think          that   the Venetian method,
judging from picture  a                   by   Tintoret now before me, was more
like that followed                  by    £>i»   Joshua Reynolds,              as above             de

 tian glazed on colour, Tintoret often on white ; and I think
 it will invariably       be found, that the works           of   the latter are
 more perished than the former.              That    exquisite lightness at
 tendant on a dead colouring, may, in              a great measure,       be re
 stored by scumbling.
     The plan      he has proposed,      and which      seems to have been
 resorted to, to remove          the practical difficulties he met with,
 is merely to paint in varnish ; a method which always gives
 brightness for a short time*           The objections         to its adoption
 may be summed           up in    a few   words  :   first,   the difficulty  of
blending the colours used to produce the effect of light and
shade; and secondly, (which is by far the most material,) the
want of durability         in  the colours,   as    they must all be ac
quired by glazing; not to mention the strong similitude be
tween      it  and Sir Joshua's method,       as above described.
     As   I   never bought Miss Provis's secret,          I  cannot tell how
close the approximation may be between her method and the
one proposed by         Mr. Sheldrake; but if I may judge from
practical experience, they would both be productive of hard
ness   ;   and as some     of the colours in   the pictures painted after
her method carried evident marks of destruction on them,                        I
was      immediately induced to suppose that some calcareous
earth was used in the ground *.               Though        I  much question
 the  utility of Mr. Sheldrake's plan, I think he unquestion
ably deserves the thanks of the public, and of artists in par
ticular, for the time and trouble he has bestowed on it.

                        [Concluded from Page 45.]
                   these inquiries were making, a memorable dis
 pute was carried on       in  some   of the  Atlantic cities, Whether
 the exciting cause of yellow fever         was of domestic origin, or
 imported from foreign places in ships and merchandize ?
 The prevailing opinion at New-York was, that there were
 local causes enough for the production of that distemper in
 the city itself.     With    the intention    of removing the      causes
 of this plague from      the town, the Legislature, then sitting at
 Albany, 160 miles distant, rapidly passed            a  bill prohibitory
 of certain trades and manufactures within             the compact part
 of the city.      The  act forbade, among other things,         the ma-
 Ttufaclure of soap and candles under a heavy penalty, except
 at definite distances from the houses and settlements.                 The
 description of citizens engaged in these branches of business
 presented immediately a memorial to the Legistature for re
 lief on this      occasion,    and   retained    Dr. Mitchill   as    their
 counsel    to manage the business       of procuring some      terms      of
 mitigation at the feat       of Government.         In drawing    up the
 argument in favour of his clients, he became                more firmly
 convinced than before,         that substances composed of carbone
 and hydrogene, such         zssat, grease, and oil, were incapable
 of yielding pestilential air; and that the substances contain-
 ing septan, to wit, the skinny, lean, muscular, and membra
 nous parts of animals, together with the blood and alimentary
fæces, were the substances whence unhealthy and noxious
 exhalations proceeded.         From a general and broad induction
 of  facts   arranged   in the argument employed on that occa
 sion,   it was   rendered    clear, that the substances containing
                                                                  septan,

 septan,   and none others, were        known      to afford      pestilential
 air. The fame rule applied to vegetable productions, of what
 ever kind they might be.          On this   occasion     it was exhibited
  in evidence,    that the persons       who    were     engaged     steadily
 among the ajbcs, soap, and         fat  of  those manufactories were
  protected   as it were     from pestilential       diseases,     and fared
 mightily better than their neighbours.
     A  part of this doctrine      soon   after  received      confirmation
 from Count Berchtold's          and Consul Baldwin's            account of
 the beneficial effects    of oil in keeping off        and relieving the
symptorns    of the plague in Asia, and from the remarkable ex
 emption of the Nantucket whalemen from malignant fevers
 on their long voyages over every part of the ocean.
     From the survey of the facts relative to alkalis and oils,
 there could hardly remain a doubt that they acted upon the
 acid of pestilence, by neutralizing or decompounding it : still,
 if this acid consisted of septon and oxygene chemically united
 during the putrefaction of organized bodies, why did not
 those elementary substances, it was asked, which constitute
 the bases   of azotic   and vital airs respectively,        incorporate in
 the atmosphere,      where they exist in        states    apparently very
 favourable to combination        ?   The   reason appears to be,         that
 after septon and oxygene, in their separate forms, have con
 nected themselves with caloric enough to form distinct gases,
 they arc repelled thereby to distances greater than chemical
 attraction can reach, and therefore remain separate.                    1 his
 idea,   which Dr. Mitchill originally started,            has   since been
 confirmed by Citizen Guyton's             account of the possibility
 of bringing the      bases   of  the two airs into chemical union,
 by compressing     them with       a  force equal      to several atmo
 spheres ; a part   of  the caloric in such cases, according to           Dr.
 Darwin's     idea,   being crowded out after           being compelled
 to quit its hold.     Indeed it seemed evident that the chief
 difference between       common air and pestilential           air consisted
 merely in this; that in the former, the septon with caloric
 formed azotic air, and the oxygene constituted vital air, each
                                 K  3                                distinct

134                       On  Dr. MitcbilVs        Theory
distinct from the other         ;  whereas in the latter      ease  the septon
and oxygene are chemically blended with                    each   other, base
with     base.     The   reason   of their   readiness to unite during the
 putrefactive process now became evident.                   The   bases  of the
two airs rustied into union before they had attracted caloric
 enough to turn them to simple gases, and give them the re
 pellency incidental to that condition.
      The venomous         and    deadly qualities of nitrous acid had
 been ascertained          by Eaglefield Smith in his experiments
  upon small animals inoculated with it.
      A   cafe occurred during         Dr. Mitchill's attendance         as one
  of the physicians of         the   New-York Hospital, where fever
  appeared to have been           brought upon       a patient by the nitric
  acid absorbed from the decomposition of a large quantity of
  red precipitate with which an ulcerated leg had long been
               '
  dressed.
      Several instances had come to his knowledge, of severe dis
  order in the alimentary canal, terminating in dysentery, from
  an accidental       drinking of diluted aquafortis.
       It immediately struck him,- that privies and collections of
   human      ordure had been         long noted for containing           septic
   (nitric) acid.      The effluvia of privies      had   in several instances
   been    known     to excite dangerous sickness.         Many of the arti
   cles   of diet contained septon ; and oxygene, in some form,
   always existed in the alimentary canal.               As the contents of
   the stomach       and intestines    were     inanimate,    it was    exceed
   ingly probable that, in certain            cafes  of indigestion and cof-
   tiveness,     septic acid  might be formed in the cavities           of these
    abdominal viscera; and that irritation and inversion of the
   motions of the stomach, in some forms of yellow fever, as
-
    well   as spasms    of  the colon,      griping pains and tenesmus in
   some     of   the cases   of   dysentery,     proceeded from thk
    SAME EXCITING CAUSE.
        By an induction of facts from the operation of neutral
           in these kinds of distempers, it appeared, that the most
  salts
    efficacious and salutary were those which are capable                 of de-.

composition by septic acid, if it existed in the                     intestines ; and
that really,     besides       their cathartic effect,             they     possessed     a
power, derived         from their alkaline              bases,    to neutralize that
mischievous and tormenting                    liquid.       From this principle
Dr. Mitchill       investigated       a   theory of the modus operandi
of   these numerous and important articles                       of the   Materia
Medica.
     Frequent instances afterwards evinced the justness of this
interpretation    ;    for in the New-         York Hospital,          as    well   as   in
private practice, he found watery solutions of the carbonates
of pot-ash      and soda to be most excellent anti-dysenteric re
medies, and valuable prescriptions in the cholera infantum.
The administration of the carbonate of                       soda in clysters,           to
allay tenesmus,     was suggested to Dr. Mitchill by Dr. Lent,
then       apothecary of the house, and found, on repeated
trials,    to be a valuable remedy.               Dr. Saltonstall         has treated
of the application of this principle to explain yellow fever,
and Dr. Bay to elucidate dysentery, in their several inau
gural dissertations         published in       Columbia College.
     After being      called to the Professorsliip               of Chemistry,      Na
tural History, and Agriculture, in that seminary^ Dr. Mit
chill delivered these doctrines publicly in his annual course
of lectures.          The     dissertations     just mentioned              shew    with
what zeal and success they were discussed and applied by his
hearers.  And a circumstance worthy of notice respecting
both the gentlemen last named,                  is,   that they witnessed            and
lived through the plagues they have described.
     A   general inference from all the phenomena was, that
                            in all their forms herein con
these miasmata or contagions,
templated, were violent stimulants, as Brown had ori
ginally conjectured.
     But   the application       of this doctrine            to    agriculture
was not much           less    interesting than its relation to Medi
cine.      Dr. Mitchill was born in the                 parish of Hempstead, in
Queen's       County.         His father       was    a   landholder, and culti-
                                      K   4                                         vated

136                           On   Dr. MitcbilPs         Theory
vated his own estate, as is common                       in America.      The early
part of his life, to the age of seventeen years,                       was passed in
the country.     In the way he was educated, the implements
of husbandry,            and the method            of   using them, were familiar
to him     :    he knew the management                   of   the plough and     of   the
spade.         After    the death      of his father in        1789,   he took pos
session    of   the family-patrimony,              and lived on it     as a   practical
farmer for several years.                    His   experience     and opportunities
during this series of agricultural employment, had produced,
among other things, a more curious and particular attention
tO   MANURES.
     On reviewing his former observations, the                         subject    pre
sented itself to him under several new aspects.                        The produc
tion oist'ptic acid among the excrements of animals had been
long known         :    the neutralization and fixation of this was, he
thought, one of the principal effects wrought by alkalies and
lime.      Instead of saying, with the generality of modern ob
servers, that lime was serviceable by its septic or putrefying
quality, (an opinion for which there is no plausible founda
tion,) Dr. Mitchill                became      convinced,       its principal    effect
was, to combine with                  septic acid into calcareous        nitre, one
of the     richest      of manures       ;   and reserve this, without volati
lization or evaporation,.             fixed upon the foil,         to stimulate and
feed the plants which grow there.                        Thus   wholesomeness         and
fertility were provided for in the fame operation.                        It    seemed
to him also,           that the deliquescent             property of the septite of
lime enabled it to retain moisture                   a   long time upon the land,
and thereby most agreeably                   secured the crop from the pinch
ing of drought.
     It was-obvious, that if            there was much septic venom (oxy
genated septon) in any field, yard, or region, and no lime or
alkali to neutralize-           it,   epizootic    diseases     among cattle might
proceed from
                        it,   after  the manner of epidemic distempers
among the human                    species. Dews and fogs impregnated
with septic acid,             appeared       the   probable exciting causes of
several mortal disorders              in neat-cattle,         sheep, and horses;       a
                                                                        considerable

                          of Pestilential Fluids.                       137
considerable     quantity of iuch dilute aquafortis being taken
into their bodies        as  they   grazed   during      the  night.     He
thought this was corroborated by the symptoms related                     by
Lancisi to have been observed in the cattle sick of such dis
eases  in Italy.
    And it was      no less     plain that rujl and mildew in wheat
were owing to the fame cause.
    The  unwholesomeness          of certain dews, in certain        places
and times, was evidently,           he believed, to be ascribed to a
 portion of septic acid gas, volatilized during the heat of the
 day, and precipitated with a portion of atmospheric water in
 the cool    of the night.
    With this branch of        the enquiry was connected the whole
 history of nitre, and the pit3, beds, and caverns wherein it
 was produced, whether spontaneously,                or by the hand of
 man.     The interpretation of all the facts relative to which
 amounted to this      ;  that the alkali neutralized the acid        poison-
 of putrefaction.
    On looking around, it could not           escape     Dr. Mitchill, that
 the sweetening and cleansing           effects   of   lime,  alkaline ley,
 and soap,     in  domestic economy,                were now capable of
 an  easy and    complete explanation.         The    sweat, perspiration,
 and excreted      matter of almost       every   sort,    which   rendered
 clothing,     bedding,     furniture,   and    houses     foul, contained
 septon ;    and consequently,, in the heat         of   the human body,
septic acid might be produced in quantity and strength suffi
 cient to excite many morbid affections of the skin, and, if ab
 sorbed, engender the worst forms of fever.                 Lime, ley, and
  soap rendered     the human body, its clothes, bedding, &c.
 pure and wholesome, by their power of attracting all kind of
 pestilential matter, and carrying it clean off.              He   therefore
  became satisfied that the old maxims           of  female management
  were best ; for he never         knew infection        break out where
  there was a    smart woman            for a housekeeper:       the reason
  »as,  stie  kept  the
                          mischief down     by  alkalies.     On the other
                                                                       hand,

hand, wherever men, especially                       those who set up for                      phi
losophers,                took the lead;             as   in prisons, workhouses,
hospitals, and ships ; there were for ever complaints made                                        of
the rife and progress               of malignant            distempers       :   the reason
was, they increased the evil by acid fumigations *.
     Numberless instances had happened                       in New-York, of                   per
sons being poisoned, and many                   of   them to death, or,                in other
words, catching the yellow fever,                         from the septic vapour of
corrupting       beef and Jijh cured with too small a quantity of
salt.       These are mostly lean animal substances.    On their
corruption            they afford   the most deadly effluvia.                         The       fre
quency of stinking provisions of these kinds,                         and        of   the poi
sonous vapours            they emitted, led Dr.              Mitchill     to investigate
a theory        of the muriate of             soda   in    preserving     animal flesh
from putrefaction.                The   result was this       :   when septic acid is
formed in         a   barrel of beef,     the common salt is decomposed;
and while the septic acid combines with the soda, the muri
atic acid is          set loose   to impregnate            and preserve           the meat.
Wken         there is too little muriate             of   soda, the septic acid, be
coming volatile, often sickens,                      and even kills the person»
who are exposed to it.
   This interpretation led naturally                        to an     inquiry into the
use of the bile of animals ; which,                         instead   of being             a   vile,
troublesome, excrementitious,                 and corruptible liquor,                 as   it has
been fastiionable to term               it,   turns out to be            a       grand pre
server       of health, by virtue of the soda which                          it       contains    ;
being always ready to pour itself into the duodenum, and
even regurgitate into the stomach, to neutralize any portion of
septic venom            which may       have been swallowed or engendered
there.          Of all the fluids the animal body contains,                            the gall
is       the least liable to corruption,              or alteration unfriendly to
health.
     •    The   author of the present paper was not perhaps aware of the strong
evidence in favour of the utility of acid fumigations               that has been brought
forward by Dr. Smyth, Mr. Cruickikank, and others.                       Edit.

     There  are many more inductions             of   facts    which unite in
the establishment      of  the general      principle       Dr. Mitchill      has
investigated.    Some of these have been published in America,
and some exist still in manuscript.             The       desire  of writing a
book seems never to .have influenced him.                      Accordingly he
 has generally conducted his discussions               in the form of letter*
 to   his friends and correspondents           :  and even these he has
 never    collected   into    a volume ;       they lie scattered           about
 in magazines       and    dissertations     where they were            first in
 serted.    There is a promise, however, of printing the whole
 in the Medical Repository, where they may in                         succession
 be laid before the learned           world.        In this immense in
 quiry, it is hoped, he will be assisted by                  the candour and

        SIR,
   XxAVING          received    much gratification from a perusal of
   your Magazine, I send you a few particulars respecting a
   voyage which I made to Spitsbergen in the year 1780, ex
   tracted   from a journal      I  kept at the time ; which you may
   lay before your readers,         if you think they can contribute
   either to their information or amusement.

       A voyage       to Greenland,       as it is called,        though in fact
    to the istand of Spitsbergen, for the purpose of

    black whale-fish, is one of the healthiest that can be under

to sail with a good commander, and in a vessel well appointed.
In both     these respects      I   was very fortunate,            which     i3  rather
uncommon         ;  the masters or commanders in the Greenland
trade being generally men               of little or    no education, and con
sequently     void of those liberal sentiments                 necessary to render
the situation of those who accompany them comfortable.                                  If
a regularly educated         surgeon,          from    a desire     of visiting     such
northern regions, goes in a                   vessel  under      such a person as        I
have described,        he is generally sickened                 the first voyage      ;  a
barber is perhaps his successor, and when any illness or acci
dent happens        on board,        if   the patient escapes with his life,
he is often rendered         a cripple.           I  have    seen    some instances
of this kind.
     The unsociable      disposition          of  the master is not, however,
the only circumstance that often deters from a second voyage.
I   have known vessels well stored by the owners                          with     every
necessary and useful article, and even a liberal supply                         of what
some would call luxuries,                   and    yet every comfort withheld
from those on board            :    the master literally           starving himself
 and officers, and not allowing                   a bit of    sire in the cabin,        in
these cold latitudes,         that he might              save a few      coals, some
dozens of hams and             tongues,          a  quantity of cheese, butter,
flour, wine,        porter, &c.          to  fend    borne to bis     oivn family at
the end     of   the voyage       :   a paultry theft,          at the expence          of
the health and frost-bitten limbs of those on board.
     When     the reader is informed that such has been my pas
 sion to visit foreign climes that                  I  have      been   no    less   than
 fifteen voyages,       one   of them round              the world,       he   will not
 be surprised      that  I  should        wish to gratify my curiosity by
 visiting the frozen regions, even though                        I knew something
 of   the inconveniencies before described,                   to which those who
 undertake the voyage are often exposed.                           My business was
 to guard against them as well as possible, by proper inquiries
 respecting    the character and              disposition     of   the   master,      and
 I   succeeded to my wish             in two voyages to these parts                :   the
 first was  in  the Sea Horse in the year 1779,                   which yielded me
                                                                                   much

                  Account of a Voyage lo Spitsbergen.                        141
much satisfaction ; but          I  was more completely gratified by
the second, which is the one             I mean to describe.
    I   engaged      myself   as surgeon      on board the Rising Sun,
William Souter          master,    a well-appointed       stout    sliip of 400
tons burthen,         in the employ of Mr. William Ward.                    The
vessel    carried about 90 men, and had 20 nine-pounders
mounted on the main-deck, with nine whale-boats, some of
them hung in the tackles over the sides, and others stowed
and laflied on the deck.
     We     sailed from    London in the latter        end   of March 1780,
and, as is usual with Greenlandmen,                  called at the town of
Larwick, the capital of            the Shetland     isles,   where we found
a most hospitable reception.               A Mr.   Innes,      the   most opu
lent inhabitant of that country, kept an open table for every
 master of a vessel and his surgeon ; and no language can con
 vey    a   proper idea of the kind and disinterested manner in
 which he received and entertained his guests. We lay there
 fourteen days wind bound.                The country     has a bleak barren
 appearance,        the surface     being generally rocky,            or covered
 with turf, which         is the fuel employed there;            but the bene
 volence and hospitality of the more opulent, and the decency,
 sobriety, and good conduct of all the inhabitants, even those
 of   the lowest      class, more than compensate              for the barren
 ness    of  the soil.
      Provisions of every kind, the finer vegetables and fruit ex
  cepted, are very abundant here, and extremely reasonable.
  The price of       a good fowl was threepence,          of  a dozen of new-
  laid eggs one penny ; and           as   much excellent sisli, cod, had
  dock, halibut, mackerel,          Sec.  could be bought for one shilling,
  as would cost at least ten pounds at Billingsgate, or as used to
  dine our whole ship's company and the cabin.                          Potatoes,
  turnips, &c. are not more common there                    than peaches and      ¦
  apricots in England.           Wheat flour     is also a rare article, but
  the inhabitants in general          prefer bread made         of oatmeal.
      The town of Larwick           consists of about    200 houses,      of one,
   ©r  at most    of two   stories, which form a narrow crooked Jane
                                                                               on

  on the   sea   fide, badly paved with flat stones.         All the   houses
  are built   of quarry    stone   :  those  of the rich are roomy, strong,
  convenient, and well furnished ; those of the poor are small,
  and very smoky, for want              of  a proper arrangement       of  the
  chimneys.
     Though the place lies in             6o3 north latitude,    the winter*
  are not severe;       they are, however, wet and stormy.                The
  harbour is very capacious and safe, and the anchoring*ground
 good.      About twenty or more English Greenlandmen were
  lying here at anchor, and several Dutch herring-busses.
  Having filled our empty water-casks,              and laid  in  a stock   of
 fowls, eggs, geneva,       &c,      we took leave of our kind friends on
 shore,   and, the wind being southerly, hove up our anchor
  and  set sail   for the ice.
     As we      advanced      to  the    northward     the night became
 shorter  till  we came near      North Cape in lat. 710 ic/, when we
 had no night at all.          We     were overtaken in that latitude by
 a most tremendous gale           of wind from the north-east, which
 lasted three days and nights.              Our  ship lay more than      once
 on her beam-ends,            and every one on board thought she
 could never        right again    ;   but providentially    we weathered
 the gale.       A storm in those high latitudes is so intensely
cold, when it blows from the north or north-east, that it is
 impossible     to look   in the wind's      eye,  as the cold is such      a*
literally to tear the skin off the face.
     In about     76° northern latitude we meet           with  ice floating
in small round         cakes,    by the sailors     called pancakes    :  you
fail through this ice in perfectly smooth water; which, from
being of a green colour in the North Sea, blue to the north
ward of Shetland and Ferro,                grows gradually of a darker
colour, and looks now of              a  deep black dye.     We sailed se
veral days through those floating ice-cakes.               When in     a still
higher latitude, an open black-looking water re-appears;
and when you reach about 770 or 780 you pass through
large masses of floating ice 20 or 30 fathom thick, and some
gf them     five or fix time* bigger than your own vessel.            Great
                                                                         care

                 Account os a Voyage         to Spitsbergen.
                                                                            143
care   is taken to avoid         striking against those masses, which
sometimes       are so   close that there remains only a narrow
channel for the (hip to fail through.                 I  have seen this con
tinue for 24 hours or longer.             When this is the cafe, the
commander stands in the main or fore-top, and sometimes
higher, and calls down to the men at the wheel how to steer.
This navigation is         attended     with      great   danger, as the ice
projects under water sometimes              two or three fathoms.
    After navigating through          those floating masses, we saw the
land of Spitsbergen        east  from us.        It is seen at an almost     in
credible distance, sometimes           at  thirty    leagues ; a proof     of its
immense height.          It  generally appears amazingly bright, of
the colour of the full moon ; while the sky above                       it looki
white and cold.
    In   790 and     8o' you are prevented from going further to
the northward        by  a solid    continent        of ice, or a collection
of ice-fields,     as  they are called        ;   some of which are many
miles in extent.        You make the            ship fast there    with an    ice
anchor,      and look out for whales,            having two or three boats
on the watch constantly.
    No    ship   could ever possibly         navigate through the huge
masses     of ice, which        must    necessarily       be  passed  before    it
can reach this high latitude, but for                  a circumstance which
would      on first view be little expected--- The                sea  there    is
 always    as  perfectly smooth       as the     River Thames       : the irre
gularly disposed masses of ice prevent the water from ever
acquiring,      by the impulse of the wind, those regular undu
lations,    if I may   use  the term, which, by long continuance
of   the same impulse, would             otherwise at last raise it in bil
lows.
    As   soon as we got into           smooth water, perhaps forty or
fifty leagues from the land, the severe climate and intense
cold we had experienced            on the      passage    in a more southern
latitude     before   we    made    the    ice,     changed into a much
milder one;        and   when it was fine weather it was quite
warm,     so  that the icicles that hung from the large masses of
                                                                             ice

144               Account csa Voyage               to Spitsbergen.
ice dissolved      and   kept dropping till a return of colder wea
ther.    Among the         fields   of ice, but more          so   in the harbours,
it is considerably warmer than on the                        passage      near North
Cape.
  In the month of June we killed                   seven large whale fish, and
went with them into Magdalena Eav, to cut the blubber up
into    small bits to fill the blubber-butts ; which                       business      is
called making off.  As the killing of the whales has been
very well described by Zorgdragcr and others, I need not
describe it.
  When you approach a harbour on the coast of Spitsber
gen, and, judging by the eye, expect to get in and come to
anchor in three or four hours time, you are perhaps not less
than ten or twelve leagues from it.                   This deception          is owing
to the immense heights              of   the rockv mountains, covered with
snow, and bordered with ice towards the sea-side, which make
very large harbours appear like small basons, and the largest
(hips, when close under them, like                     a   boat on the Thames             -
Magdalena Bay, in 790 north, is capacious enough to hold
the whole British navy; but, on account of the immense
mountains which surround                  it,   appears like      a   very small inlet.
We came to anchor in this bay, where we lay three weeks.
While the people were making off, the masters, surgeons,
Sec.    of   the different vessels then there visited each other, and
diverted      themselves     in the       best    way they were able.              Such

rupt the entertainment.
   The       first thing that strikes       a    curious mind here          is   that   so
lemn silence which             reigns around         ;     sometimes       interrupted
with     a   noise, like thunder heard at            a     distance,    occasioned       bv
 huge fragments of ice and rocks rolling down from the                                  im
 mense steeps into the sea.
  I     attempted     to ascend one         of   these mountains called Roche
 Hill.    I     got up about half way, which took several hours
 hard labour.         At that height       I      found the rocks covered with
 birds eggs of different sizes.
                                                                                  There

   There-are several rivulets and waterfalls of excellent water
supplied   by the melting of the snow.               I  met frequently with
scurvy-grass, wild celery, endive, water- cresses,                 and a few
other plants and flowers           ;   though      the   general  vegetation
which    covers   the rocks consists in various kinds of mosses
and ferns.     There are white bears of an enormous size, white
foxes,  deer,   and elks    ;  and     above     twenty different forts of
water and land birds      ;   such as, wild geese,         wild ducks,    sea-
parrots,    roches, sea-gulls, mallemooks as the sailors call
them, whose quills make the best drawing pens I ever met
with, wild pigeons, the white duck with a beautiful scarlet
head and yellow legs,         and the snow-bird,           whose   note is   aS
pleasing   as that of the bullfinch or nightingale.
   This  season   was the finest ever remembered               in those hi<rh
latitudes, and we had almost constant sine weather.                    As we
had room yet on board, and the                 season   was not too far ad
vanced, in hopes of killing          a siih   or two more, we left Mag-
dalena   Bay and steered       north.      When        we arrived  in 8o° we
found a perfectly clear ocean               free from      ice, but saw no
whales.
    We continued pushing          to the northward with sine southerly
breezes and most beautiful weather, and could, with a good
telescope, discover no ice to the northward,                from the main-
top-mast head, but a solid continent of ice east and west ; so
that we were in a kind of channel of perhaps three or four
leagues wide.      We    kept pushing on, the captain and               I jok
ing together about pasting through the pole.
    Both Captain Souter and myself found ourselves at length
some minutes north of 82 ~, where perhaps no man before
us had ever been, nor since.             The high snowy mountains of
North Bank, or North Foreland,              appeared ver)- luminous, and
bore south on the compass.
    We    had   a strong     inclination to push still further north ;
but the danger of the east and west ice, now to the southward
of   us as well as to the northward,              moving and locking us
 in, in which    cafe we must         have been        beset and inevitably

lost,   created   a prudent fear,      and induced the master to put
about (hip for North Foreland.               The wind misted at the
same time to the northward, and in a couple of days we
 came to anchor on       North Bank, called Smeerenburg's Har
 bour.      We    saw  now plenty of fin-fisti or sinners, white
 whales, and unicorns        ; which is    a sign  that the season is over
 for killing the black whale, which then retires to the north
 ward.      As all these animals arc well known and described,
 I   forbear saying any thing respecting them.
      One of our men having been at the habitation of the Rus
  sians in  North Bank the        year before,   and assuring us that he
  could find the way to their hut, Captain Souter, a man of an
  inquisitive mind, proposed to me to pay
                                                      them a visit.     We
  took ten or twelve men with us, a compass, a few               bottles  of
  wine, bread, cheese,       &c,     and some good trade-knives, with
   a small keg of gunpowder, to make a present of to the Rus
  sians.
      We landed     at the bottom      of  the harbour to the eastward,
   where we found      a large   valley, several miles in breadth, sur
   rounded with immense high mountains, mostly covered with
   snow ; but as the fun had melted a part, the brown and
   black rock appeared, and rivulets of clear water ran down,
   forming little waterfalls.
       The ground     was   turf and clay,     and   not bad to walk on      :
    we had several small rivulets to cross, of two or three feet
    wide, but very shallow ; near them we found scurvy-grass,
    water-cresses,   endive, wild celery, and a few small flowers,
    and saw   a  number of land birds flying up at our approach.
    We   crossed a piece    of ground where the Dutch had formerly
    buried their dead     :  three or four of the coffins were open,
    with human skeletons           lying  in them.      Some inscriptions
    on boards, of which          above   twenty were erected       over   die
    graves, had the years 1630,
                                       1640, &x. affixed to them.        We
    also saw the ruins of some brickwork, which had been a               fur
    nace,   as the Dutch     used to boil their oil here    in the  last cen-
     turv, and fox that reason called it Smeerenburg's Haven, or
                                                                           the

the Harbour of the Fat Borough.                  We   had above six miles
to walk to the northward,            and   were   very much fatigued on
account of the unevennefs of the ground and the heat, when
we discovered the hut of the Russians at a distance.                   They
perceived     our approach, and sent two or three people to meet
and welcome us.
    The common           men made        a   strange   appearance    ;  they
looked very much like some Jews in Rag Fair or Rosemary-
Lane    : they wore long beards, fur caps on their heads, brown
flieep-slcin    jackets with the wool outside,           boots, and long
knives at their      sides  by way of hangers.         When    we arrived
at the hut, we were presented to the caravelsk or commander,
and to the surgeon,          who both received us very politely, and
invited us into the house, where we              sat down to  rest and re
fresh ourselves.        Our    people were    introduced to their people
in   an outer room,          and were     entertained with meal and
 brandy.      It happened fortunately that the surgeon was a Ger
man, a native of Berlin, of the name of Idcrich Pochenthal,
 consequently      I  could converse with him ; and we both acted
as  interpreters between his and our commander.
    Captain Souter began with offering to the Russian com
mander, (who was also dressed in furs, only of a finer sort,
and wore his beard             and   whiskers like the common men,)
the keg     of gunpowder        and  half  a dozen of good table knives
and forks     :  the Russian captain accepted          them with a great
deal  of joy,     and made       us a present in return,      consisting    of
half   a dozen       of white fox skins, two brown           loaves    of  rye
bread,     six smoked      rein-deer tongues, and       two rib-pieces      of
smoked       deer,   for which we kindly thanked him.                  They
turned out to be most excellent eating, and of a finer flavour
than any English smoked tongues, or hung beef.
    We    placed     our wine on the table,         our bread and cheese,
and the Russian          captain ordered       boiled smoked      rein-deer
tongues, new rye bread,             and good     brandy and water to be
brought in.          We all      made   a hearty, sociable     meal;      the
tongues, and the rye bread, which was new and savory, were
                                     La                             a rarity

a rarity to us; the Russian officers reliflied our Cheshire cheese
and {hip's biscuit as a very                        high   treat.     We drank         the   Em
press       of   Russia's         and   King George's health. The Russian
commander was an                      elderly man, of very agreeable manners ;
the surgeon extremely so, and very intelligent.
     The hut           consisted        of two       large rooms, each about 30 feet
square,          but   so   low that       I    touched the ceiling with                my fur
cap.        In    the middle            of the front-room was               a circular erec
tion of brick-work, which                            served as an oven to bake their
bread, and bake or boil their meat, and at the fame time
performed the office                    of a   stove to warm the room.                 The fuel
employed was wood, which drives on                                     ssiore   plentifully in
whole trees stripped of their branches.                                 A   chimney carried
the smoke out of the roof of the hut                            ;   but when they wished
it,   they could,            by   means        of   a   flue, convey the smoke into the
back room for the purpose of smoking and curing their rein
deer flessi and tongues, bears hams,                            &c.      Round three fides
of the front room                 was raised an ekvated place                   of about     three
feet wide, covered with white bear skins, which served for
bedsteads.              The captain's bed-clothes                    were    made      oft white
fox (kins sewed together                   ;        the surgeon's      was the feme          :   the
boatswain, cook, carpenter, and the men, had sheep-skins.
The walls              inside     the room were very smooth and white
washed;           and       the    ceiling was made of stout deal-boards,
plained smooth, and white-washed1.
     The rooms              had   a   sufficient number of small glass windows,
of    about        two feet square,                   to afford      light: the floor was
hard clay, perfectly smooth   the whole hut was nearly 60
                                                    :
feet in length, and 34 wide outside and was constructed of  ;
heavy beams cut square,                         of about twelve inches thick, laid
horizontally one upon the other, joined                                at the four corners
by    a   kind of dove-tailing, caulked with dry moss, and payed
over with tar and pitch,                       so   that not   a    breath of air can pene
trate   :    the roof consisted                of    thin ribs laid across the beam-
walls,       and       three-inch          deal         nailed over them,         so   that you
could walk on the top of the house: the roof was caulked and
                                                                                         tarred,

tarred, and perfectly tight.              This is the manner of building
houses in the country in Russia, particularly about Archangel.
    The   surgeon gave me the following account                of this Ruffian
colony in Smeerenburg's Harbour :
    Some associated merchants at Archangel                 sit out  a crabbla,
or   vessel,  every year,     of about     100 tons, with a commander,
mate, surgeon, boatswain, carpenter,                cook) and about fifteen
hands, well provided with muskets,                 powder and shot, good
large knives,      and    all kinds of utensils         for killing whales,
unicorns, rein-deer, bears, and foxes.
    With     a sufficient stock        of rye-flour,      brandy,    clothing,
snow     (hoes,   deal    boards, carpenters         tools, &c. this veflel
fails every year in the month of May from Archangel,                      goes
round the North Cape               of Norway,        and arrives   in June or
July   at Smeerenburg's Harbour,              where the new colony is left
on shore.       The   vessel flays      two or three weeks in the har
bour to refit, and carries            the  old   colony with their cargo
 (consisting of whales' blubber,           blades or so called whalebone,
white bear skins, white fox skins, eiderdown and feathers,
unicorns' trunks, which is an ivory that never turns yellow,
and smoked rein-deers' tongues,) home to Archangel.                        The
colonists have no wages, but receive thousandth shares for
what they bring home : the captain has fifty shares, the mate
and surgeon thirty each          ;  the carpenter, boatswain, and cook,
ten each ; and each common man or boy has one (hare.                       The
surgeon told me that the captain had above 1000 rubles due
 to him, and he himself about 600, and each common man
 perhaps 50 or 60       :  that when they returned           safe  home, the
 common men would be able to live                 a  whole year upon their
 money,      and   the officers much longer, as the necessaries              of
 life were very cheap        at Archangel ; and for the Company it
 had hitherto answered extremely               well.
     He told    me this was his second trip,            so  well had it an
 swered his expectations.          " During     the so called long    nights,"
 said he,    " it seldom     or never is     so dark that you cannot fee
 before you, nor is it        so  dreadfully cold as it is at Petersburg
                                         L3                              every

every winter.       When      a snow storm happens,            we cannot g»
out of the house; but when it is serene, and no wind, it is
not too cold to go out and walk many miles. With the
moonlight,       the uncommon brilliancy of the stars in these
high latitudes, and the reflection of the northern lights, or
aurora hrealis, we have so much light that we can fee to
read a book or to write.
    "  In winter time       the black whales come into the harbour
and play close within shore, where we               kill now and then one
with harpoons        fired out     of a   swivel.     We kill white bears,
 foxes,   rein-deer,     and birds,     as  many as we can before the
 night-season, which commences in September, when all the
 land animals leave us and walk over the ice into Nova Zem-
 bla and Siberia      :  the land birds leave us in the fame manner.
 Unicorns     we also   kill in the harbour, for the fake       of their ivory
 trunks, which are afterwards sent to             Germany and France."
     The surgeon and 1 had a race on snow shoes, which are a
 kind of skates, of about two feet in length, for skating over
  the snow and ice. As I was in former years a good skater,
  I could    use  them     as  well   as   he did.      We    ran six or seven
  miles with them in an hour without                    fatiguing ourselves:
  they have no irons.
     Before we left our Ruffian host, he informed us, that                 a  few
  weeks before they had,          coming home from          a  mooting party,
  found an English captain and             nine or ten men overhauling
  their property in the hut.             The captain, finding           that   his
  chest had been broke open,            and   that   his rubles were dimi
  nished considerably, reproached           the English commander            with
  the robbery, and        a battle  ensued.       " The English      fired upon
  us,"   said the surgeon,       who acted       all along     as  interpreter,
  " and   killed one of our men on the spot.            We   returned the fire
  and wounded some of his men, and caused them to retreat
  precipitately.      When the English were gone, our captain
  counted his rubles, and found that there were 600 missing."
  He intended      to send a statement        of   the affair to the Ruffian
  government,
                                                                           After

    Aster having staid above twelve hours with the Ruffians,
 highly entertained,      we invited them to come to fee us on
 board and took our leave, returning the fame way by the
compass, and arrived safe on board, aster having been absent
almost eighteen hours.
    We now      prepared for the voyage home ; and, after having
filled our empty casks with good water from the (hore,               and
made a clear (hip, we set sail with a fine north-easterly breeze
in   the middle   of July  1
                             780.   We sailed again through      a great
quantity of floating ice, and, our sliip being            a good sailer,
passed several hill ships bound homewards.
    The  first pleasing change we experienced        was to have some
night,   and to be obliged to light a candle        in   the cabin.    O
what a   luxury ! — When you        have no darkness for a consider
able time (during      May, June,      and July), light     becomes   te
dious at last; and the first time you fee        a candle    burning in
the cabin,      and a dark night,     the pleasure is indescribable.
Before we came into this more southern latitude, I               used to
observe the setting     of the sun, resting, as it were,     on the ho
rizon,   appearing of     a very large size,   surrounded     with most
beautiful and glorious colours of various tints, and then the
rising of it shortly after in full majesty.         Language cannot
convey an idea of the scene.
    We   came     to anchor at    Larwick towards      the end  of July,
and were received in the kindest          manner by     Mr. Innes    and
all our friends in the place.
    After    three  weeks    stay we    took leave of our Shetland
friends, and sailed in company with          a  number of full ships
 for England.       When we came on the coast of Northumber-.
 land and Yorkfljire, the breeze and weather being favour
 able, we were delighted with the smell of the hay from the
 shore, and the fight of the pretty little towns and villages
built on    the sea-side,   and refreshed with excellent fresh cod
and haddock, which the Yorkshire cobles              (a  kind of fishing
boats) bring on board ;          in return for which they prefer
taking a piece of beef or pork to money          :  they bring some-

  with northerly breezes.
      We arrived about          the latter end     of August   safe in Green
  land Dock, after having been out five months.
      Captain Souter kept an excellent table in the cabin, and
  a constant      fire  in    the stove  :    his study was to make every
  person on board comfortable.                 In the fifteen voyages    I have
  been to sea,      I  have only twice had           the good fortune to sail
  with men of        equal worth      ; Mr. Charles      Patterson  of the   Sea,
  Horse, and       Mr. William Alder, now               a Lieutenant     in  the
  British Navy.
  VI. An       Attempt      to   arrange the Crystals of Oxidated Tin
      Ore, according      to   their supposed Structure. By Mr.          Wil
      liam Day,         Leicester Place. Communicated           by the Author,
     X.  HE    crystallisations of oxidated tin ore are described by
  Rome de      Title, in his Cristallography, to be of the octaedral
   form and its modifications            ; the octaedra having isosceles
   triangular    faces,    inclined at an angle of 45° to the base of
   each pyramid;        so that the junction of their bases and
                                                                          apices
   are right angles.         In the following arrangement            the octa-
   edron is considered         as the primitive form, and the modifica
   tions   as being produced         by an accumulation, on its faces of
   laminae    composed      of similar minute moleculæ, experiencing
   different laws of decrement on their fides or angles,                   or on
t
   both. These laws of decrement are marked with the                   signs in
   vented by     Hauy, of which an account has been eiven in the
    Phil. Mag. Vol. II. p. 398. The greater part of these forms
   having been very accurately described by De I'Isle, all that is
   now attempted is an application of Hauy's system to the ar
    rangement of this part of a private cabinet of English mine
    rals ; nor would it have been made public but for the re
    peated solicitations       of several friends..

also the figures marked              la, ib,     and    1 c, are geometrical       :  the
others are drawings from models, and in perspective                             as   they

tempted, nor is it necessary.                  The     prisms are shewn with the
pyramid on one end only ;                not on both,       as in De l'lfle's plates.

 present     the spaces they occupy respectively,                      and    the diffe
  rence of shading, the progress of diminution by a subtrac
 tion of one range of moleculæ on the edges of the faces, ac
 cording to the third law of decrement. The superior angle
 A of this face is 700, the two inferior angles E, E, 550 each.
 The     letters on the three geometrical figures                     mark the fame
  situations     on all of them, and are those employed                        by Hauy
  to indicate the laws          of decrement.

other varieties        arise from difference               in colour       and transpa

   The macles of Dc l'lfle, which Hauy has called hemi
trope,     or half-turned,        may be added               as     a supplementary
class.     Of    the term made, De                l'lfle   gives this explanation:
"   When in any           crystal       whatever one or more re-entering
or internal angles are observed, we may conclude that it is
not a simple crystal, but a group of two or more ; or even
two turned or reversed moieties of the fame crystal."                                       De
l'lfle    wag,   indebted to        a   Mr. Lermina for determining the
direction of the section which produced the hemitrope crys
tals of tin, which he has shewn to be parallel to two opposite
edges     of   the octaedron.           Imagine the primitive octaedron to
be divided into halves by a plane pasting diagonally through
 it,   from the centre B,         sig. 24,     of   one    of   the edges      of   the su
perior pyramid,          to the centre   edge of the inferior
                                              B    of that
pyramid which       diagonally opposite; the plane will pass
                         is
through two opposite angles FE of the base, dividing on each
pyramid two adjoining sices into four scalene triangles, and
leaving two adjoining faces perfect, but reversed on one py
ramid in respect to the other. The plane FBEB1 of this
 section    is   a   rhomb of 60° and 1200,
    The prismatic crystals appear to be                      as     susceptible     of that
 species of accumulation which produces                         the hemitrope as the
 octaedron, and the section             is   always parallel to the one deter
 mined above.            If   the prism      is   short, and terminated              by     two
 pyramids, the section will              pass through the prism into both
 pyramids, and be irregularly octagon;                          but   if   the prism         is
 long enough to permit the section to                      pass   through      it   without
 encroaching on the pyramids,                  it   will rhomb of 70° and

 1100; the fame as            the section of the primitive octaedron, per
 pendicular from the apex, and diagonally across the base.
    I    have some crystals which              are produced           by   a   double     sec
 tion, and both ends turned on the middle part; others which
 appear to be only portions taken off the angles at the                              junc

    "  The primitive form of the crystals of oxydated tin ap
peared to me to be that of a cube performing the function of
a parallelopipedon;        so  that the decrements which produce the
secondary forms have,           in regard to the two opposite faces              of
the cube, which must be considered as the bases, an action
different from that which takes place in regard to the other
four faces that represent the planes of the prism." (p. 576.)

     From      the preceding extracts it appears that           Hauy    has sup
 posed the cube to be the nucleus or primitive                     form of the
 oxidated tin crystals.         I have again carefully examined the
  crystals   in  my   own   collection, and, according to the indi-

cations observed on them, from which                             I    have formed my
arrangement agreeably              to the law laid down                  by Hauy him
self,    (see Phil. Mag. Vol. I. p. 29a.) I see no reason at
present      why I should alter it. The crystals of oxidated tin
are in general so hard and brittle                   thai    I   have not been able
to separate the laminae            ;    and there     is nothing               to guide the
observer but the direction              of the   striæ on the secondary facets.
Now the         faces,   which    are parallel to the faces            of the octaedron
before mentioned, are always very brilliant ; but those which
are on a plane with               the edges are striated parallel to those
edges,       particularly those crystals           which         {hew the interme
diate stages       of the third law.              If the    nucleus were a cube,

crystals,       shewed     their direction             striæ on the new facets,
those striæ would            be    in   a    direction quite contrary to what
are (hewn on these crystals              :    instead of going the length of
the new facets parallel to the edges of the octaedron, they
would cross the facets perpendicularly to their present direc
tion,       and   it   would be impossible             for the crystal               fig.   7   to
take the form of fig. 8.                In my collection               there
                                                                        group   is   a
of    opaque black crystals,            sliewing all .the variations from the
primitive         prismatic crystal fig. 2, to the completion of the
third law of decrement fig.               8.   In all of them the direction of
the striæ       is   very evident.       The Saxon and Bohemian                          ores   of
tin     are most      common in the cabinets of France                     :    the crystals
are larger,          but do not present the varieties                     of forms that
English ores do; being mostly confined to the octaedron and
its hemitrope, and those variations of the fourth law which
 approach the cube.               Had Hauy          seen    a        greater    number of
 the varieties of the English tin ores,              I      think      he would, for the
 primitive form,           have had recourse to the octaedron,                           which,
  by    a   very simple law of decrement, produces the cube and
 its varieties that occur in the tin crystallisations.
      To    these observations          may be added De               rifle's description
 of     the same crystal that           Hauy has      described          (above), which
                                                                                      I     find

  158                    An Attempt       to  arrange the
 I find to   agree so well        with what    I  have observed  in nature,
 that  I am    inclined to suppose Hauy's measures of the angles
 are given from calculation, assuming the cube as the nucleus,
 and not from measurement                 on the crystal.    De Tide's   de
 scription is as follows        :
     " It is a blackish       kind of tin ore, in small solitary crystals
 five or fix lines   in length, and at most three in breadth. In
 the variety in question, one of the extremities of the rectan
 gular tetraedral     prism first presents an octaedral        pyramid, the
 planes of which          forming      with   the prism an angle of 155°
 are irregular pentagons, having one of their angles of 6o°,
two of 1200, one of no°, and the most obtuse of 1300.
These pentagons form with each other angles of 11 o° and
1600. The pyramidal form thence resulting is itself termi
nated by a tetraedral          summit with trapezoidal planes join
ing at right angles, as is observed in the isosceles triangles of
the third variety      r   but this summit becomes octaedral by the
flight truncature of         its edges,     from which result four linear
hexagons that form by their contact at the summit of the
pyramid obtuse angles of no". The planes of the prism,
had it not been broken, would be regular hexagons, and the
whole crystal would then have thirty-six facets."                De 1'IJle't
 Cryjlallographie,       Tom.      III. p. 423.
    Having     said so much respecting           the external form, a few
remarks concerning the chemical analysis of tin ores cannot
be misplaced in a paper like the present.               On this part of the
subject,   I  cannot do better than by quoting from a paper               of
C. Guyton, formerly and better known                   here by the name   of
De Morveau, whose chemical authority always carries great
weight with it.          In his paper entitled, Observations on the
Acid of Tin, and • an Analysis of its Ores, after giving the
analyses of the brown tin ore of Schlackenwald, as pub
lished   by    Mr. Klaproth,           which     he  verified himself, and
found to contain, tin 75, iron 0-5, filex 075, and oxygen
3375 = 1005 he proceeds to give a reason why the tin crys
                                                                        tals

tals are so insoluble              in acids,     and combats the idea                     of Klap-
roth, that it arises from supersaturation                          by oxygen, which is
dissipated by fluxing the ore                  with      vegetable alkali.
    " I    believed       I   had good reason," says he,                    " to     doubt that
the complete oxygenation,                      or     (if   the term be preferred)                  the
supersaturation               by   oxygen, was the true cause of its insolu
bility in      the muriatic acid       could not, at any one
                                           ;   because      I
instant of the operation, perceive either the substance that
should take      it   away, or any of the phenomena that would
have accompanied its disengagement.                                ThatI    might with the
greater facility observe all the circumstances,                           I     operated        with
a   small platina crucible over an Argand's lamp.                                     Fifty-five
centigrammes of brown                      crystals    of tin were        reduced to         a   sine
powder, and mixed with fix times                             as   much pot-ash (purified
 by   alcohol, and dried)            :   the mixture was moistened with                         a   few
drops of water.           I        evaporated       it   first to dryness, and then to
a   commencement of fusion.                           After       the first treatment,              hot
water poured on the mass dissolved more than half the mi
neral, which was then first precipitated from                                   it   by   muriatic
                                                         by
acid, and afterwards redissolved                         it       with    the greatest faci
lity; and        the precipitate            of the metallic oxyde,                   reproduced
 by   adding carbonat of pot-ash, was found,                              as stated        by
                                                                                           Klap-
 roth, completely soluble again                       by    the same acid.            After hav
 ing myself witnessed this fact, my first doubt on the direct
 cause of the insolubility of this ore was rather strengthened
 than removed.     cannot be said that the excess of oxygen
                              It

more soluble in the acid, for it is still found in she fame state
of saturation     :   besides,   it  does not exhibit any signs of the
oxygenated       muriatic acid gas ; and in this cafe it is difficult
to conceive why there should not rather be                 a disengagement
of this    gas at the time      of  digestion   of the acid on the ore,     as
happens with the oxydes of manganese and lead.
     "  To   establish    this point of theory on a decisive experi
ment,      I dissolved six grammes of tin in nitrous acid, which
I evaporated        several times to dryness,       adding each time fresh
acid.      I think it cannot        be doubled that     in this state the tin
had taken all the oxygen it was capable of fixing ; yet the
 mass of white oxyd, washed till the water that came from it
did not in the least alter vegetable colours, was readily dis
 solved in muriatic acid.            What then is      the cause  of the in
 solubility of the ore, which also is nothing but tin and oxy
 gen, containing hardly o-oi of extraneous matter               ?  The  cause
 can only be found in the            state   of aggregation of the latter.
 This    assertion ought not to excite surprise,          for hitherto suffi
 cient account has not been taken of this power.                     If com
 binations are the result of affinity or elective attraction, this
 attraction     itself is nothing but a power which may be ren
 dered ineffectual by the sum of the forces which counteract
 it.    These truths       surely    will not    be denied    by  Mr. Klap-
 roth, who has rendered them               so palpable, by shewing us that
 the ruby, the sapphire,         the adamantine spar, the elements          of
 which were naturally easily soluble, resisted the ordinary
 means of analysis only by the state of the aggregation of
 their integral parts."

jectured what Guyton here advances from experiment.                       His

  that there is no mineralizing            substance in the crystals   of tin,
 because,    in default of sulphur or         arsenic,  we ought at least to
  find the acid principle, by the aid of which the metallic earth
  ©f  tin takes a constant and determinate crystalline             form."

VII.     Experiments respecling          the Effects       of Quicksilver     on
     Vegetable     Life.      By Von Deimann, Paats Van
    Trostwyk            and  Lauwerenburgh*.
E=<XPER.          I. A plant of the         sm:*II    garden bean, which
had grown in the open fields, was placed                  in water   close to a
flask silled    with quicksilver one inch in diameter, and the
water was covered by           a bell twelve inches in height and six
in diameter.
    II. A    plant of curled mint,         the    root of which stood in
water, was placed with quicksilver under a bell eight inches
in height and four and a half in diameter.
    III. The first experiment was repeated,                 with this varia
tion  ;  that the bell, instead of standing over water, was placed
on a disli, and supported by pieces of cork.
    IV. The      fame experiment as the second,              with this diffe
rence ; that pieces        of leaf gold were      suspended    in  the bell.
    V. A    flask   filled with quicksilver      was placed close to some
young plants of the spiræa sulicifolia, which still adhered to
the parent root, and the whole was covered with a bell.
   VI. The       second experiment was repeated, and a little sul
phur was applied to the interior sides             of  the bell.
    VII.   The    second experiment again repeated, with this               dif
ference; that the quicksilver was covered with a little water.
   VIII. A plant of the curled mint was placed in a bason
of water with a little quicksilver, in such              a  manner that the
roots were in contact with the metal.
    IX. The      roots of   a bean   plant, which had shot out through
holes made in the pot in which               it   had    been   reared,    were
placed in    a  flat dish filled with quicksilver.
    X. Some       beans were     planted    in earth mixed with quick
silver.
    XI. A      plant of the curled mint was placed in a bason
with water,        and    red oxyd     of mercury        prepared    with the

nitrous acid which had been washed                                first    with       an alcaline
solution and then with pure Water, the roots being immersed
fri   the oxyd.
      XII.       The    same as the second, with this variation                             ;     that
instead      of quicksilver the-oxyd                was used.
      XIII.      Beans were planted in               a   mixture           of   earth      and the
red oxyd         of quicksilver.
      XIV.       The same planted in               earth mixed             with the oxyd of
kad.
      XV. Of        three plants        of   the curled mint, one was placed,
in the fame manner                as   in the       nth experiment, in                     a     phial
which contained water and the oxyd of manganese;                                         the second
in another, containing                 water and the oxyd of copper                          ;    and
the third in one containing water and the oxyd                                      of   lead.
      The    leaves and stems in the experiments                           i,   2, 3, 4, and 5,
were on the third day covered with black spots; and on the*
fourth,       fifth,    and at        most    the sixth, had become entirely
black.                   in the 5th experiment could not
                 The young        tree
hold out the whole summer, though    stood connected with     it
the parent plant.  The plants died    completely that, the    ft)
leaves frequently dropped                 off, and the stem stink down the
very moment the bell was removed.     The plants in the 6th
experiment remained without any change, which fliews that
sulphur prevents the bad c/ects of the quicksilver.  In the
7   th experiment         the    effect       of    the quicksilver was destroyed,
on account          of the water         by   which      it   was covered.
 •    The experiments            8>   9, and 10, prove that the quicksilver,
when mixed with earth or water, or when                               it   stands in contact
with the roots of plants,               is   in no manner prejudicial to them.
:
      The    Jith      experiment,        which        we     repeated             several times,
stiewed       us that the oxyd               of quicksilver,,             placed         in contact
with, the- roots. of         a    plant,       is   destructive           to it.      This       oxyd",
however, did not produce the                       s.-.me effect          when     it   was placed
as    the metallic quicksilver, near                  l:>   the    plant;        as   was proved
fcy the      1   2th experiment,          in which            the plant did not expe-

    In the    15th experiment the plants were               not in the least
affected    by the different oxyds         ;  which~proves that plants,
like animals,      seem   capable of being accustomed              to things
pernicious to them, provided they begin at infancy.                      The
bean's planted      in earth     mixed with the oxyd of quicksilver
grew up, but       so weak and       stunted    that they could scarcely
be known.         Those, however, which          had been planted at the
same time as the former in a mixture               of  earth and the oxyd
of  lead,   shot up as usual, and exceeded them in strength               and
weight more than four times.
   In   these researches we were           at great    pains to make some
comparative .experiments, and we found that the plants in
those where no quicksilver was employed,                  lived  a consider
able time in a state        of  perfect vegetation.         These results we
give merely      as facts,    without     attempting at present       to ex
plain them.        A  considerable       quantity of quicksilver placed
in   a very   confined atmosphere          may be equally pernicious to
animal existence,        as   we think ourselves authorised to infer
from several experiments, the course of which the late                 season
of  the year obliged us to suspend, and from which it appears
that, in one point of view, things hurtful to animals are hurt
ful also to plants.

  1   HE     very considerable      difference in regard to the quan
tity of effect in the before-mentioned                experiments already
shews,     that   if the electric       stream    excited by contact        is
strongest towards      a  certain metal, when that metal is placed
between     a  certain fluid on the one side, and another fluid on
the other,      there  are other fluids       which produce        a greater
effect  with another kind of         metal ;   so that it will    be neces
sary to discover by experiment the particular arrangement                   of
                                  M    3                         conductors

conductors suited to each metal, in which the fluids or ccn*
ductors of the second class must be disposed according to
their activity.       I have     paid great attention to this circum
stance, and have formed several tables,               which I   seal! publilb-
as soon as    I   have brought them to perfection.
     I shall here, however, only observe, that             in order   to class,
in   some manner, the innumerable different                moili conductors
 of this kind, I distinguish them into             aqueous,   soiritnus, mu
cous, and gelatinous, saccharine, saponaceous,                   saline, acid,
 alcaline,    and sulphurous         (livers of sulphur) liquids ; that         I
make subdivisions         in    the acids down to the best known
 simple    mineral     acids, (as I find in this respect great diffe
 rence between the nitrous and the muriatic acids,) compre
hending the principal vegetable acids and the acid of galls ;
 and do the fame in regard to the saline fluids, according as
 they are solutions of neutral salts, earthy salts, and particu
 larly metallic salts.
     When it      can be determined         in what order all     these kinds
 of fluids follow each other, in regard to the power in ques
  tion, for the metal A, and another for the metal B, &c, we
  shall then be in a condition to determine what place must be
  assigned   to a great     number of other heterogeneous fluids,
  whether mineral, vegetable, or animal, which belong to se
  veral   of the    above    classes.     In general,     the  order for the
  greater   part of the metals hitherto observed              is as follow*      >
  ist,  pure water ; 2d, water mixed with clay or chalk, (which
  shews a pretty different effect when the before-mentioned ex
  periment is made with two glasses,            a   bow of tin or zinc, and
  a properly prepared frog,         which     has a sufficient  degree    of vi
   tality); 3d, a solution of sugar; 4th, alcohol; 5th, milk ;
   6th, mucilaginous fluids; 7th, animal gelatinous fluids;
   8th, wine    ;   9th, vinegar, and other vegetable juices and
   acids;   10th, saliva;      nth, mucus of         the nose;   12th, blood;
   13th, brains;      14th, solution of salt      ;   15th, soap suds   ; 16th,
   chalk water; 17th, concentrated             mineral acids; 18th, strong
   Alcaline leys ; 19th, alcaline fluids; 20th, livers of fulphui.
                                                                          With

With       spine metals there                 is,   however,     a   considerable        deviation
from this order, in regard to livers of sulphur, alcaline fluids,
and the nitrous and saline acids.
     As    to the metals,           which in their position                      between      these
different fluids are more or                        less   proper for the electric effect
in    question,      I      have    found in general                   that tin exceeds all
others, and that silver                  is   the worst     ;    except when one             of the
fluids betwixt which                    the silver         is   'placed     is   water, or any
other aqueous conductor, and the other liver of sulphur    in                                 :
this cafe silver far exceeds zinc, and even tin.    Iron also
produces         a   much greater effect than any other metal, when
it  in contact, on the one side, with mere water or an aque
     is
ous conductor, and on the other with the nitrous acid, were
it   even      only    a    drop.        The excitement                   occasioned      in both
cafes     is   wonderful      ;    since            exceeds,
                                              already re
                                              it                  as I      have
marked, that produced, according to the usual method,                                               by
means       of   a   double metallic bow, even of different metals, as
zinc      and silver, applied to conductors                          of   the second class         of
the fame kind.               It    is   sufficiently strong and powerful to pro
duce convulsive             movement in             a   half-prepared frog, the bowels
of which          have not been taken out, when one                           of   the two moist
conductors           is
                     a      concentrated             alcaline solution, and the metal
placed         between       them        is    zinc,       or rather tin.              With other
metals and other fluids you can seldom produce convulsions
in   a    frog,   if   it   be not perfectly prepared,                       or at least em-
bowelled.
     The    reader      will readily            perceive,       that when          a   bow   of one
and the fame metal touches                          with both its ends the fame kind
of   saline water, the same acid, the same alcaline fluid, &c. an
electric stream will not take place,                            as happens         also when       it
touches on each fide merely water                           :   in   that cafe two opposite
actions are opposed to each other, and keep each other in
equilibrium.            That       these contrary powers, however, may be
in perfect equilibrium, necessary that the fluids applied to
                                        it    is
both ends of the homogeneous metalline bow be exactly of
the fame kind and              of       the fame strength.                 For thisreason the
                                                M    3                                        most

most     careful         attention and a certain dexterity are required
in   order to ensure success to the experiment,                             which   I   have
often performed            to the great astonishment               of    the spectators,
and which any one may repeat                       as   was done            by my friend
Humboldt.           That philosopher has already published some of
the most       striking and decisive of these experiments in his se
cond letter ; and            I   shall here give a more particular account
of them.
     Having         placed   a completely or only half-prepared frog as
usual in two glasses             of water,      take a very clean bow            of     silver
 (it   will   be best when        it   has been washed with watersrom the
glasses), and immerse both ends                   of   it   at once, or the one after
the other, in the glasses, no agitation of the frog will be oc
casioned.  Repeat the experiment, after you have daubed over
one      end    of   the Low with the white                 of    an egg,     liquid glue,
saliva,       mucus, blood,            a   solution of tartar, or any other fluid
or conducting substance sufficiently different from pure water.
First, immerse the pure end, or that moistened merely with
water, in the water of one of the                   glasses   ;    and afterwards the
other end,           daubed over with the above substances, in the
water of the other glass you will then infallibly produce
                                       ;                                                     a
convulsive movement in the frog, and several times
                                                                                    it in
                                                       suc
 cession, you draw out the bow and again immerse
               if                                    until
 nothing more of the above substances left adhering to the    is
 metal, or until the metal, with its ends in both the glasses,
 touches only pure, or nearly pure, water. Daub both the
 above substances uniformly                   over both ends           of   the bow,        and
 immerse        them at the same time in both the glasses                        of water,
 and no convulsions will arise.                    They will           often be produced
 in    newly prepared and highly irritable frogs, when the saline
 fluid, or,         in
            general, the substance with which the two ends
 of the bow are daubed over,      not perfectly the fame, or
                                                  is
 when the substance               at   the one      end      is   more diluted than at
 the othor, &c. Wash and clean carefully the one end of the
 bow, daub over the other more or less, and convulsions will
 be again produced               as soon as the circle            is   made complete         by
                                                                                            the

                            Vclta on Animal "Ehtlrlctij.                                                   167
/the double immersion of the bow.                                  Clean both ends com
pletely, and no agitation will arise,                             as   in the first experiment..
     For comparative experiments of this kind                                     I    would recom
mend viscous fluids or substances rather than saline,                                                because
the latter are too soon dissolved in the water.                                       It   ostimes hap
pens that the convulsions                     of   the frog,            when it is completely
prepared      and highly irritable,                    take place,            though both ends
of    the metallic            bow are daubed over with the fame kind of
saline fluid.           The        cause     of this    is,      that when one end                    is   im-
nierstd     in   the      water after            the other,             (and
                                                                                 it    may be easily
seen that    it
             is         impossible           to do     so   in   a     moment with sufficient
accuracy,) the one end of the bow loses                                 a   portion of its saline
substance sooner than the other, or at least the adhering part
is   more diluted             by   the water,          so   that the fluid with which
both ends have been daubed over                               is   no longer the fame.
     For    these experiments                I   weald also recommend silver, as
a    metal wheh          is   less      liable than others                 to be attacked                  and
changed          by   saline and other liquids.                        Tin,    lead, copper, and
in   particular iron, are more susceptible of lasting variations;
so   that bows of these metals, and of iron above all, retain for
a    long time the power of producing convulsions in                                             a     newly
prepared and highly                     irritable frog, even when both the ends
of   the bow are immersed                      in two            glasses    of   water,          although
the places         of   the metal, attacked                      by    any of    the saline fluids,
have been carefully washed and cleaned.                                       A       superficial       alte
ration in the metal                     is sufficient to produce this change, as
may be easily seen.                     These variations often shew themselves
to the eye         by   a   yellow blackish spot, &c. which                                it   is   difficult
to remove.            I   do not here speak                  of lasting variations, that
proceed to       a      greater depth, which                      can be produced in the
end    of   the metallic bow,                    and particularly              in iron, when its
hardness      is   changed          ;   a    process        by   which such            a    bow can be
rendered      capable of producing not only convulsions in frogs,
but also     a particular sensation on the tongue, and light before
the eyes,        if     both its ends, made perfectly clean, are only
brought into contact; with                         pure water.                These, and many

other experiments of the like kind, form the chief subject of
my first letter to the Abbe Vassali, Professor of Natural PhU
losophy at Turin, written in the beginning of the year 1794,
and afterwards published with the other in Brugnatelli's
Journal.
    If silver      be less exposed to be attacked by saline and other
fluids      (except       by liver of sulphur, which instantaneously
renders it black) ;              if it   be less susceptible          of   considerable        and
lasting variations, and has therefore this advantage over other
metals, that it is liable to fewer irregularities ; tin, on ac
count of its greater activity, that                     is,   the strength     of the     effects
which       it   produces        by   being brought into contact with almost
all moist conductors,                    as
                                          I      have    already       observed,         is   to be
preferred to silver, and in               a    certain degree to all other metals.
The experiment               I   have already described                with    a    tin bason
silled with an alcaline fluid, and held                         in   the hands moistened
with water,             by   which        an     acid sensation        is    excited      on the
tongue when brought into contact with the above fluid,                                           is
a proof of  for   would be vain to expect
                  it;          it             like effect                      a
from     a   bason      of    lead,      iron,    or copper, and much more                       so
from wie of            silver.      With the latter             it    would be obtained
only when          contained liquid liver of sulphur;
                    it                                                           apd     in    that
case    the acid taste would be pretty strong.
    The electric fluid excited also with the greatest strength
                                    is
and activity, when the metal   tin, between water and saline
                                                 is                                      a
fluid   :    but        will
                  be excited wuh still greater energy to pro
                   it
duce an acid sensation on the tongue when the tin    between                        is
water and an insipid mucilaginous fluid     or when the expe      ;
riment   made with
             is       tin bason filled with
                                    a          solution of gum,        a
liquid glue, white of an egg, &c. The other metals, in like
circumstances, produce some effect, but much weaker: silver
produces the weakest, except with liver of sulphur, as                                   I    have
already observed.
    A    like experiment,                which    I    made      three      years    ago,      and
exhibited to various persons,                         not with        two different fluids
and one metal, a;                in   that above described,                bu! contrariwise,
                                                                                              with

                           Volt a on Animal Electricity.                                      269
with two metals of               a different kind and a fluid,                      is already-
known.        I   took     a bason      of tin     of zinc is better), placed
                                                    (one
it on   a silver stand, and         filled it with water. When any of the
persons in company applied the tip                         of his tongue           to the wa
ter, he found it perfectly tasteless as long as he did not touch
the silver stand      ;    but   as soon as he           laid hold of the stand, and
grasped it        in his hands well               moistened,        he experienced             on
the tongue        a very    perceptible and pretty strong acid taste. This
experiment will succeed, though the effect is proportionably
weaker, with a chain of several persons who hold each other's
hands, after they have been moistened with water, while the
first applies the tip of his tongue to the water in the bason,
and the last lays hold with his hands                         of   the silver stand.
   If   these experiments,              in   regard to the taste excited on the
tongue by the action of two different metals, are striking, the
others, in regard to the taste excited, modified and changed
by one metal between two different fluids, are no                                  less so,   and
they are also newer.               They           are still interesting on this ac
count,       that they discover to us the cause of that                             taste often-
perceived      in water and other liquids,                      which is more or               less
considerable        or various when drunk                       from         of metal,
                                                                         vessels
and particularly of tin.                 When           the     outer extremity of the
vessel is    applied to the under lip, rendered moist by the saliva,
and the tongue is extended                        so as to      be in contact with the
water, beer, wine, &c. in the                or when the tongue is
                                                   vessel,
bent    as   is done in drinking, is there not then a complete cir
cle, and is not the metal between two more or                                 less    different
liquids, that        is,   between      the saliva         of   the under      lip    and the
liquor in the cup or               vessel     ?   A     stronger        or weaker electrie
stream must thereby be occasioned                             according      as     the fluids
are different —       a     stream      which will not fail in its way to
affect the sensible organs               of    the tongue          in   the said circle.
   Besides the two methods already considered,                                of producing
an electric current,             that    is,      by   means     of one or more moist
conductors,         or conductors of the second class,                             placed     be-
fween two different metals or conductors of the first class                                      ;

or" contrariwise               by means           of   a conductor             of the       first class
placed between                two of the second class, also different                             ;   there
is still a third method of exciting the electric fluid, though in
a   degree so much weaker that it is scarcely capable                                       of   causing
convulsions in            a    perfectly prepared                  frog, in which                there   is
still    a strong     degree of vitality.  This new method consists in
forming the           circle of three different conductors, all of the
second class, without the intervention                               of   one        of    the    first or
a metal one.              Some think they find in this method a strong
objection against my principle.
  Fig. 20. represents this third method compared with the
other two*.              In    the experiments                of   Professor         Valli,      respect
ing which        so     much noise has been made without any reason,

dinous part of the Mufculus gajlrocneniius ; tn the rump or
the muscles of the back, or the ischiatic nerves, to which the
said tendinous parts are applied                        ;    and a the blood, or the vis
cous saponaceous                 or saline fluid,              applied to the point of
contact.
    I    have   fully    described this new method, where no metal                                       it
used,        in my third and fourth                 letter to Professor Vassali, writ
ten     in   the autumn and winter                     of   the year      1
                                                                              795.     I   have there
ihewn, that these new facts, far from altering my ideas and
principles, serve rather to establish them ; and that thev ren
der more general the principle that the conductors, by hete
rogeneous contact, that is of two different from each other,
become exciters of electricity, and confirm the beautiful law
arising from             it,   that to produce an electric stream the cir
cle must necessarily              be formed             of three different conductors.
Yow now         fee     in what the whole                   secret, the whole magic con
sists;       and that     not merely on metals, as might
                          it    depends
have been believed, but on all the different conductors. A«
Ions      as we adhere           to these principles,                 it      will   be easv to ex

      TAL.*
\^>RYSTALS of Venus                      were for a   long time manufactured
in Holland, but             at present    they are manufactured at                 Mont-
pellier,      with a degree          of    pr-rfection     which         renders    them
preferable to           those      of any other country.                  The      process
most generally employed consists                    in dissolving         verdigrise    in
vinegar, and evaporating the                   solution to        a   pellicle to obtain
the crystals.           The vinegar          used is nothing            else   than sour
 vinaffh (spoilt wine) distilled.
                                  In every manufactory there
 is therefore an alembic, in which this weak kind of vinegar
 is continually         distilled.
      This distilled vinegar          is put into a kettle, where it is boil
 ed on       the verdigrise.         After saturation        the solution is left to
 clarify, and then poured into another kettle of copper, where
 it   is evaporated         to a pellicle.     Sticks are then immersed into
 it,   and     by   means of some pack-thread                 are tied         to wooden
 bars    which       rest   on the edge of the kettle.                 These sticks are
 about     a   foot long, and are split cross-wife nearly two inches
 at the end,     that they open into four branches, kept at
                      so
 about the distance of an inch from each other  small pegs.               by
 The     crystals adhere to these sticks,             and cover them entirely,
 forming        themselves         into groups or clusters,              which present
 en all      sides perfect        rhombs of    a   very lively dark blue colour,

174                        Method of manusaciuring
Each      cluster weighs from five to six pounds.                      These crystals,
when broken, exhibit on their fracture                         a   brilliant agreeable
green, inclining a little to blue.
  Three pounds of moist                  verdigrise      are necessary to make a
pound of crystals. The                   indissolved      residuum      is rejected        as
useless.        Analysis,      however, having proved                  to me that            a
great deal   of copper in a metallic state, or weakly oxydated,
still exists in       disposed boards in the form of
                      it,  I                               stage                a
around the manufactory of C. Durand, and, forming strata
of about two inches in thickness with these remains,                                    soon
saw them covered with an efflorescence of verdigrise.                           I I      took
care to moisten them from time to time with vinegar, to dis
solve     the verdigrise        as soon as          a   sufficiently strong efflo
rescence was formed, and they were again disposed                               in      strata
to proceed as before,              in order that       I     might    derive as much
advantage from the residuum                  as   I    should find convenient.
   There        are some manufactories                  of the     crystals   of Venus
where the verdigrise   preparedis                  by
                                    means of vinegar distilled
according  to the  method  followed  at Grenoble, which                                     is
well understood.             All    the operations tend to the fame end,
which      is   the solution of the copper in the acetous acid                      ;    and
the purity of the materials renders                     it   certain that there will
be no residuum              or loss.      But however           simple    may be the
process     for manufacturing              crystallised        verdigrise,     the      high
price at which                 sold makes              to be much wished that
                       it
                       is                         it                                        it
could be still rendered             more    so.
                                              I        made some experiments for
that purpose      ;   but at present      I       shall confine myself to           a   short
view of my results.             We      must set out from the principle, that
the acetous acid does not attack copper in the state of me                          a
tal, and that    cannot effect
                      it         solution of a  but when re          it
duced to an oxyd.              The question then will              be to discover the
means of oxydating             it   in an economical manner.
   1st, I       exposed the plates        of copper          to the gazeous     emana
tions of the oxygenated                muriatic acid in large glass receivers,
connected together in the manner of adopters, to which                                     I
fitted retort from which the acid was disengaged.

  2d,       I   took a large earthen jar of Provence,                             well glazed,
capable of containing two hundred (French) pints of water,
buried it one half in a stratum of very warm dung in full
decomposition, and having put some manganese in the bot
tom of          it,
            and adapted to      straight glass tube which
                                                 it   a
reached from the mouth to the bottom,                                I    filled the jar with
plates     of copper slightly rolled, in order that they might not
touch each other but in some points.                               I     then made to pass
into the bottom of the jar,                     by   means       of the tube, the         neces
sary quantity           of   the muriatic             acid, and immediately closed
the upper aperture                 with     a    luted covering.              Two    days after
these plates were entirely crusted over                           with    a   greenish     oxyd,
which       detached         itself in dust and in scales                :I      separated    of   it
two pounds ten ounces.               This oxyd,        lively than that of
                                                                  less

thod may then be               employed, with some advantage, to form
the acetat of copper          cannot supply the place
                                 ;   but    it                                            of the
acetous verdigrise either in painting or dyeing.
     3d,   I    formed sulphat of copper                    by   pouring, upon plates of
copper brought to              a   red heat       in   a   crucible, about          a    third     in
weight of pounded sulphur.                        This sulphure, exceedingly fri
able, pulverised and exposed to                       a    pretty violent heat for four
or five hours, left           a    grey powder, easily attacked                     by   the ace
tous acid.             Iliat which        I    digested at        a   heat above      a    gentle
temperature, gave,                   by   evaporation,           a   considerable        quantity
of   very blue and beautiful crystals                       of   acetat      of copper,      and    a
stratum         of    true sulphat      of copper of          a   pale blue and without
crystals.
     4th,   I        saturated     distilled acetous          acid with oxygenated
muriatic acid gas.                 This acid,          digested cold on the copper,
dissolved  in part
                ,it           ;   but     it   formed     a   beautiful micaceous scaly
white, which had no relation with the acetat.                                       Copper ex
posed to the vapour                of this      acetous acid, saturated with oxy

liant small crystals               of   a   bright-blue           colour, some of which
are transparent              and     white.          These crystals            presented      long
                                                                                             iquai*

characters of the acetat of copper.
     5th, The          acetous acid,          distilled several times on the oxyd
of   manganese,             attacks copper and dissolves                   it,   but too weakly
and      in   too small quantity for me to recommend this method.
     6th, The acetite of lead poured upon                             a   solution of the sul-
phat of copper immediately produces       decomposition from       a
•which there results sulphat of lead, which precipitates itself
in   a   little time        ;   and acetat        of copper, which remains in                      so
lution. By decanting the latter, and evaporating                                    it   to   a   pel
licle in copper kettle, you will obtain beautiful
              a                                                                      crystals       or*
Venus.            If
               you wash well the sulphat of lead, and prepare
it   to be employed in painting, as white lead, this last process
may become very advantageous.'

struck by a resisting fluid, must of necessity pass through                                                   a
triangular space, of which the spread of the extremity of the
vane forms the base, in the time that the wind pastes through
the depth of the vane                     :    therefore, friclion and gravity being
out of the question, a fly of one vane will pass round as quick
as a          fly   with any greater number.
     Some years              back    I        made   a     number of experiments upon,
spiral flies moving in water, to prove what number                                               of turns
the spiral would actually make in pasting through                                               a   certain

the perfect spiral will perform.                                Wind      is   a   fluid in some re
spects similar to water, particularly when applied to the pre
sent purpose           ;     therefore, vanes which are to be turned                                     by   its
power, ought                to be   spirals, for,          if    not, they         will   ever perform
less.
     For the          purpose       of elucidating, in the                most clear and simple
manner, the               truth of        the principle asserted,              I      caused     a     vane,
or sly, to be made. This vane                              is   represented         by    fig. 1,      pi.   IV.
The           vane moves            round upon the pillar                  AB, which                is   fixed
upright in            a   stand.       The part of the pillar                        above the fly            is
Square        ;     this carries the brass arm                   CG, which may                  be moved
up and down the pillar,                           parallel to itself,          without revolving.
     • This construction              might be otherwise             expressed,      thus   :   A   spiral ge
nerated         by   the circular motion of          a   radius,     and of    a   line moving at right
angles, to the plane of the circular motion.

 *re intended to represent the wind, moving parallel, lo strike
 the vanes.       To  prove the truth       of  the principle,     lift the arm
up (as in fig. 1,) till the points of the wires are as high as
the upper edge of the vanes, and bring the upper edge of
either vane immediately under the points; then, by gently
pressing the arm down$ (as shewn by fig. a,)                   it will be ob
served that the vane is turned by             all the points pressing upon
it at   the same time, till they pass beyond its lower edge.
Now,    were the vanes any other than spirals, this could not be
the cafe   ;  for, bring the wires to the plane vane              AH     (fig. 3),
 (which    may be set to any angle), and by pressing the arm down
as before, it     will be observed that, as the vane turns rounds
the points, beginning from the extremity, are quitted by the
vane, which        at length is acted upon by the point                 next the
centre only     :  therefore     it may be concluded, that the wind
would not continue to act uniformly on any fly or vane which
is not constructed on the principles of              a  spiral.
   The    spiral vane    I, fig.   1, ends,    as do     the  rest, where the
angle of weather (or the angle which the vane makes with
the plane of its circular motion) arrives at 35°, as this ad
mits of the extremity of the vane being struck by the wind
with   an    angle    of 540;      which      angle, it is demonstrated,
will produce       the greatest       lateral  pressure.      The shortening
of the   vanes    of windmills       is an object     of material moment         j
yet  I  do not mean to         assert    that the angle of 35 degrees is
the best concluding point, since, if more power be wanted,
the length of the vanes must be extended.                       The wood, of
which I formed my model, is preserved at the back of the
vanes, (fee the dotted lines fig. 1 .) merely to give a better idea
of their weather as they recede from the centre. Though
the number of spiral vanes shewn are six, yet I do not fay
that six are superior to any other number ; it being presumed
that more vanes on this principle might be placed with ad
vantage, provided the whole area            of the circle    be not too    much
crowded, which would prevent the free escape of the wind.
                                                                              The

  of  a vane being given       ; to determine the angles         of weather    at
  different distances from the centre.
     Let AB, fig. 4,      be the length     of  the vane ; BC its breadth;
  and   BCD      the angle  of weather at the extremity of the vane,
 equal to 20 degrees.          With the length of the vane AB, and
 breadth      BC, construct the isosceles triangle ABC : from the
 point B draw BD perpendicular to CB, then BD is the proper
 depth of the vane.
    Divide the line        AB     into any number of parts (five, for
 instance); at those divisions draw the lines iE, 2F, 3G, and
 4H, parallel to the line BC ; also, from the points of divi
 sion 1, 2, 3, and 4, draw the lines               il,   2K, 3L,     and   4M,
 perpendicular       to  iE, 2F, 3G, etc. all of              them equal in
 length to BD. Join El, FK, GL, and HM :                     then the angles
 1EI, 2FK, 3GL,          and   4HM,      are the angles        of weather     at
 those divisions     of the vane ; and      if the  triangles be conceived
 to stand       perpendicular      with   the   plane     of the paper,     the
 angles    I, K, L, M,      and    D, becoming the vertical angles,
 the hypothenuse of these triangles will give a perfect idea of
 the weathering of the vane as it recedes from the centre.
    On    the supposition      that such     a  vane     were   infinitely ex
tended,      let us consider    which part of it      is most applicable to
produce power with safety.             1 he part of the vane next the
centre, till it lessens the angle of weather to 80 or 70 degrees,
sustains     but little lateral pressure ; and when the weather
arrives at less than 20 or 10 degrees, it will sustain no more
than at the centre, while, in the former case, the pressure
tending to break the vanes is very considerable.                If we consult
a figure, constructed        to  shew    the  lateral   and  direct pressure
that would arise from fluids striking surfaces with different
degrees     of obliquity,    I think    it may be concluded, that the
part   of  the vane between the iveather of 80 and 20 degrees,
will   produce the grealeji effect     with    the leajl danger.

  jsiMONGST            the numerous      and   varied   attainments  of
  human genius,       the  results  obtained in the practice of the
  art of fusion are not the least to stamp the industry of man
  with that full approbation to which the most ardent perse
  verance has entitled him.          Destitute of the knowledge of
  principle, and labouring under the most violent prejudices,
  the artist has in all ages marked, at lengthened intervals, the
  coincidence of cause with effect         : upon precedent alone he
  has ventured to enlarge       his operations, and stake his fame
  and fortune.       To this chiefly may     be attributed his partial
  success ; and by this alone can we account for the existence
  of manufactures,       at an earlv period    of civilisation, in this
  and in other countries.        Although we cannot withhold our
  applause from such unremitting industry, yet the deep-rooted
  prejudices which this implicit reverence for custom has fos
  tered are much to be regretted.         In periods  remote from our
   time, allowance will be readily granted for persevering in a
  mode of practice in which others had been comparatively
  successful ; now, however, when investigation is abroad, the
  foundation of these principles ought to be tried by experi
  ment, as the only standard whereby we are enabled to ascer
   tain truth or detect error.      At this impartial tribunal, errors
  may be detected which corrode the vitals of our manufacto
  ries ; and truths which have hitherto slept, mingied in the
   rubbish of unenlightened tradition, be brought to full view.
      In  our manufactories,      the just combination      of art with
   science   is what we can seldom boast ; in authors the fame
   happy union of theory and practice is also markedly defi
   cient ; and we have constantly to regret, that the want of
   liberality in the individuals of the one class, and opportunity
   in that of the other, prevent us from feeling the happy ef
   fects  of this so  much desired union.

    The    process   of depriving    ores   of their metal by        fusion  in
the assay-furnace, and that part particularly relating to iron,
Which I mean to make the principal subject of this paper,
lead me more immediately to make these observations.                     With
the manufacturer, in general, the               uses  and propriety      of the
assay-furnace       are seldom admitted, or, at best, are restricted to
such narrow limits as to be only capable                of ascertaining the
quantity of iron contained in ore              of iron-stone.       The che
mist, on the other hand, intent only upon effecting his ope
 ration, and of giving accuracy to the result, confines his ob
servations     to a certain chain      of science,     and seldom or never
 considers manufactures as the ultimate arid happy end towards
which his labours should be directed.
     With whatever        deference    and     respect    we look up to the
 names     of men     celebrated for their indefatigable zeal and in
dustry in the cause        of science, and with whatever          satisfaction
 we rest upon the result         of their labours       as to truth  ;  yet, in.
 general, the practical mart feels dissatisfied with the manner
 in which      those subjects are treated which come more imme
 diately under his own observation.
     It is  I fear with some truth that this charge is brought
 against     that part of the arts relative to the assaying of iron
 ores.     We     never find,  in  the works      of those w hose attention
 has been       directed   to this subject,      that the least connected
 idea ever exists betwixt the assay and the blast-furnace,                    or
 that the agents        used for reduction      in the laboratory can in
 general be applied to works in the large way.                A   total silence
 prevails amongst authors          of this   class, as to the various qua
 lities of crude iron which certain ores and certain combina
 tions of fluxes produce        :  all ores, however various, are re
 duced to the fame complex treatment, and the operation it
 self measured by minutes, as           if the   fusibility of all the widely
 differently-combined         ores was the fame.
     The    celebrated    Bergman even, has a degree of complexity
 in his receipts for the assaying of iron ores, that seems un-

llo                 On the Assaying of Iron Ores
worthy of the simple          elements     of  science.    The following
one in particular seems to possess an air of incongruity even
in the proportions, only equalled by the oddity of the assem
blage of mixtures brought forward :
     "  ioo Grains of      the roasted ore,     two parts of the black
 "   flux, (equal parts of borax and nitre,) one part of tartar,
 "   one of sal-ammoniac, one of sandever, half of (again)
 "   borax, half of glass, one-fourth of clean foot, one-fourth
 "   of charcoal; the whole to be covered with common salt."
 This motley     association    of  earths,   alkalies, and salts, is re
 commended       as the best    flux for  all iron     ores.   The author
 however shews, that the advantages which it possesses are not
 complete, from the great caution prescribed in the mode of
 conveying the necessary degree of heat ; and the perfection
 of the operation     is rendered altogether doubtful by the conse
 quences which the oversight          of a.few    minutes may occasion.
     It cannot be well reconciled to our ideas of advancement
 in any art, that    we have not yet discovered a method             of ope
 ration more perfect than that wherein              a few  minutes lost or
 gained (which error will more likely take place from the in
 equality of heat, than the reckoning of time,) make a varia
 tion from truth equal to i-5th or i-6th of the whole.                  The
 manufacturer would be in a lamentable predicament were
  he thus circumstanced, and obliged, by some means or other,
  to take   the crude     iron from the blast-furnace immediately
  upon being separated from the ores,            lest a considerable    por
  tion of it should totally disappear.         If the degree   of heat pro
  duced from a smith's forge was at all times the fame, though
  supplied   with fuel of various natures, and under different
  changes    of temperature, then it is         most probable that, by
  reckoning Bergman's          time to    a  minute,     a button   of iron,
  accurate   in its results, might be obtained from some ores by
  the flux he has directed to be used. But I cannot conceive
   that this should be an universal         consequence     : far less can   I
   comprehend, after a just separation has been efltcted, that
                                                                          five

five minutes          will   destroy   i-ioth of      the produce      of metal,
while the incumbent fluid protects the surface of the metallic
button from the action of the atmosphere.
    It    is not,     however, my province to enter into               a  minute
examination of the products obtained from the                        use  of such
vitreous fluxes, which are always productive of the most oxy
genated        state  of  crude iron ; and the accuracy           of  whose re
sults, under a state          of  such   high oxygenation, are always to
be suspected.          I  have frequently proved that,          in  using them,
the affinity os the metal was             so great to    oxygen, that    a  slight
derangement of the crucible,                which     had   thrown the vitrid
fluid from any point of the surface, was immediately attended
by    a  rapid deflagration, and            a considerable      portion of the
iron     oxydated.
    I   (hall chiefly confine myself to a communication of those
facts, which         I have    repeatedly confirmed, with a view            of ex
tending my results and observations                to a more extensive scale.
I  have constantly considered              the assay-furnace       as capable    of
affording conclusions applicable to the operations of the
fmelting-furnace,            and   that change or innovation should al
ways have the concurring                testimony     of truth   to back them,
though, on a small scale, before they be risqued on one more
momentous or extensive.                  Influenced       by such motives,        I
early rejected,         as  totally inapplicable to the scale of manu
facture, the numerous tribe of salts, alkalies, and earths:
these,       in the application,       arc subject to no rule, nor guided
by any immediate object of general utility,                    but are   as  arbi
 trary     as   their authors are numerous.               On the contrary,        I
 have directed        my endeavours          to the    use  of such agents       as
effect separation         upon the large scale, and have been fortu
nate to find that the same solvents,                when properly applied,
are productive          of   the most perfect and finistied results.            By
the simple application            of lime or chalk, in various propor
tions,      as a calcareous      earth, and common bottle glass, in the
place      of  silex, to constitute fusibility,     I  have been able to pro
duce       in the assay-furnace          all the various Qualities of crude

J 8»                  On the Assaying        of Iron    Ores
iron,  as to strength and fusibility.              In no   cafe has the result
of any   assay been       considered     perfect,     unless the vitrid mass
found upon the surface of the metallic button exhibited a
degree   of   transparency       and purity      of colour little inferior to
flint glass, or slightly darkened          by a faint fliade of azure.          In
such vitrifications, purity         of colour    is the surest    proof   of the
non-existence of iron in the            state   of  a fused  oxyd    : the same
degree   of pellucidity      renders   it easy to delect the smallest glo
bule  of metal which by chance may have been suspended
during fusion. In all experiments where a just association
of mixtures has been present to produce this peculiar scoria,
the quality of the iron will be found richly carbonated, and
the button possessing        a smooth, silvery, greasy-feel         surface.   On
the other hand, experience            has repeatedly       shewn, that when
the scoria obtained in assaying approached not to the co
lour  and purity      of  fine glass, there remained a portion              of the
iron  still unrevived, in the state          of   a fused   oxyde, conveying
colour    and     opacity to the mass         ;   that at certain degrees of
colour, certain degrees of opacity existed, and proportionate
quantities of the metal remained diffused in the scoria.
When      the colour      of this    was    green,     the quantity     of metal
united was small       ;   but   as the   green     deepened,      and   became
associated with light browns, the quantity                  of unrevived iron
was greater, and became much increased as the scoria as
sumed darker browns, or became totally black : in such in
stances    I have found it contain, upon being re-assayed,                  12 per
cent.    The     assaying    of iron  ores is susceptible       of another     ex
treme, by which experiment is equally clogged, and wherein
it is very difficult      to obtain an accurate          result.    In this   cafe
no perfect button of metal is found, but the portion of iron
which the ore contained is in a vast variety of various sized
globules of the richest crude iron, interspersed in, or covering
the surface      of  a semi-vitrified       opaque      mass    of  scoria,   of  a
greyilh-blue,        mottled,     or whitish       colour.      The    causes    of
which,       and    their   strict analogy to similar results             in the

                                  and Iron- Stones              by    Tujlon.                          183'
      In        a former paper             I   mentioned,             that   if    iron-stones were
 smelted without the addition of any other substance, the pro
 duct in iron would be proportioned to the quantity of lime
 contained in the respective classes.                                  We       stiall fee from the
 following          experiments how fur this is confirmed by means
of the          assay-furnace,             and furnish to ourselves one important
lesson,          How far          the various mixtures                 of    ores affect the ope
ration of smelting?
      1   ft,    Into   a   crucible, with           a   well- fitted cover,         I    introduced
875        grains of        a   pulverised      siliceous iron-stone in its raw state,
and applied             such degree            of    heat       as    is   usually given in such
operations.               In twelve minutes              I      found that the iron-stone
was        in     perfect       fusion, much agitated,                       and    emitting large
bubbles of ignited gas of                        a      fiery colour.             In forty minutes
the crucible was withdrawn                          ;    the surface         of    the vitrid       fluid
still continued to boil, and emit bubbles, though in                                      less   quan
tity. In this             state I     introduced         a   small rod through the scoria,
and discovered               the surface of             a   button of metal.                  The mo
ment        it   came into contact with atmospheric air,                                a     beautiful
combustion              took place;              the        metal rose in           a   spiral      form
to supply           the     rapid inflammation,                       and    continued till          the
          in
scoria (still               fusion)    closed over the surface                     of   the    button.
When cold,              I    found         a   perfect       formed         button of extremely'
oxygenated              crude iron,            which weighed
                                         219 grains;                                            a   pro
duce equal to 25.1 per rent, from the raw iron-stone.                                               The
scoria obtained was                   of   a   shining black colour, firm and pon
derous,          and weighed 402 grains                     ;    so   that the loss in volatile
matter was 254 grains, equal to 29 per cent.
 Although this iron-stone was siliceous, yet                                  I     am convinced
the loss of volatile matter would have been greater,                                          had not
nearly one-half           of the whole contents of iron remained in
the       scoria,    united with oxygen, at the rate of 35 per cent.
I   found the produce of the metallic button thus obtained
white       as    silver,       and   presenting            imperfect radii; the surface
was considerably oxydated,                          especially        where the combustion
had taken effect,

184                    On the Assaying          of Iron    Ores
    ad,   I subjected     to a similar treatment 875 grains                of  an ar
gillaceous iron-stone, which contained a usual proportion of
lime ; the fusion       of this powder was more difficult than that of
the former, though the phenomena exhibited by both during
reduction were alike.            The crucible was withdrawn from the
furnace in forty minutes after introduction, and the surface
of the button exposed to combustion as before. The de
flagration differed         little in point        of   appearance       from      that
 effected    with the siliceous          iron-stone      :  the button of crude
 iron   was found oxygenated, and weighed 249 grains; a pro
 duce in iron from the raw stone = 28.5 per cent. : the
 vitrid mass was found to weigh 354 grains; the loss of vo
 latile mixtures was therefore 272 grains, or 31 per cent.
 The fracture of the regulus now obtained was still white,
 though not allied to any degree of crystallisation, and its
 surface smoother and less oxydated.                    The    glass produced          in
 this experiment was of a deep brown sinning colour, in many
 places porous, and enriched with fine tints of colouring.
     3d, The fame experiment was repeated upon 875 grain?
  of a fine calcareous iron-stone. The fusion of this required a
  violent heat of seventeen minutes,                  during which time the
  disengagement        of  a gaseous substance             was most evident ;           in
  other respects it exhibited the fame features, when in fusion,
  as the two former        :   the degree and length of heat conveyed
  was nearly the fame          ;  and the result obtained was a button
  pf carbo-oxygenated            crude     iron* weighing          261     grains; a
                                                                             produce
     *  Although in this experiment         a true carbonation   is effected by means
  of the presence   of lime alone, yet experience has never confirmed this in
  the large way ; nor (hewn,       after a just proportion of materials was in the
  furnace,  that additional lime alone conferred any additional          degree of car
  bonation.    The   widely different manner in which the heat is excited, and
  the substances  which   are operated upon exposed to its action,
                                                                           may account
  for this want of coincidence of effect.            It  is the fame     principle    that
  C.Clouct    has lately ingeniously    applied to the fabrication of cast steel from
  bar iron.    To  the decomposition       of the carbonic acid alone,       I  attribute
  the advantages derived from the use of lime in the manufacturing              of crude
                                                                                     iron.

                         and Iron- Stones       by    Fusion.                    185
produce in iron equal to 30 per cent- from the raw iron-stone ;
fused earths, now reduced to an opaque brown glass streaked
with white, 294 grains             :  loss  in volatile mixtures 320 grains,
or 36.5 per cent.
     •The metallic         button      produced       in this operation       had    a
smooth        crystallised    surface;      and, when in fusion, combined
less    readily with oxygen              offered    by the contact of atmo
 spheric air, than did the former two.                    The fracture     was  light
grey, with a regular distinct grain                 ;   the mass of fused earths
 were disposed after           the manner        of   a  crystall'sation, in radii,
 shooting from the circumference of a minute circle ta the
 extremity of one larger.
      From      these experiments it is obvious that reguli                 of crude
 iron may be obtained from the different                    classes  of iron-stones,
 of    a respectable        produce, without            any addition whatever;
 and     that the tendency which these have to part with their
  iron   is in the exact         ratio of the quantity of lime present.
  The following          statement      exhibits the difference          betwixt the
  real and partial assay          of the foregoing iron-stones.
      The      siliceous    iron-stone,      properly assayed, yielded 34.5
  per cent., but by fusion perse only                  25 ; leaving in the latter
  method 9.5 mixed with the scoria. Argillaceous stone, pro
   perly assayed, gave 35.6, by fusion per se 28.5 ; leaving
   7.1 mixed        with the     scoria.     Calcareous iron-stone, properly
   assayed, yielded 33.7,             by fusion per se 30 ; which left 3.7
   mixed with the scoria-
       One reason may be advanced why the iron produced from
   the calcareous stone was             so  much more in proportion than
   the other two           classes :   both the siliceous and argillaceous
   buttons,        when deprived        of their      scoria,   decomposed     atmo
    spheric air so rapidly as to suffer a little,                  in point of     real
    metal, from the combination of oxygen.                        It  was otherwise,
    however, when the surface               of the    calcareous     button was ex
    posed   :   the affinity    of the oxygen            to the   metal being       less
   iron.    I  have for the last     three   years made use of this truth with the
              advantage in the assaying     of ores   and other experiments.
   freatest                                                                       than

l86                       On the Assaying                of Iron Ora
than to the carbon united with                           it,   carbonic acid was form
ed.       A    review of these experiments leads to another con
clusion,       that, without           the presence               of carbon, either in
chemical union in the ore, or attracted from the ignited gas
by the particles of metal, crude iron will not separate from
the ore or stone        ;    and that, in proportion as the metal                         is   ex
posed to inhale this principle,                     its produce      is   increased and its
quality improved.
     It   will further      appear obvious, from the various natures                             of
scoriae      which the different iron-stones                     afford    when fused           fer
se, that there exists         a   want         of mixture in              most    of them to
form, when fused,            a   fluid        so   sufficiently divided that no por
tion of iron may be retained, either in                          a   metallic state, or         in
that of an oxyde.                This deficiency of mixture                     is   greatest   in
the siliceous iron-stones,               less      in the argillaceous, and least of
all in the calcareous.            The principle, therefore,    proceeded     I
upon was, to ascertain            what proportion of additional mixture,
and of what nature, was necessary to give the proper equi
librium        to form   a   transparent scoria.                  When      silex predomi
nated,       it   was found that          a        major proportion          of calcareous
earth, in the solvent or flux, supplied the natural deficiency                                   ;
and that the whole contents in iron were justly revived,                                       and
fully saturated with carbon               :        when at any time          it   was wished
lo     revive the metal, contained                  in   such ores, possessing strength
with carbonation,           I    found that this could be easily effected,
in all proportions,            by
                       the addition of calcareous earth with
a mixture of pure clay. In short, in every experiment   have                           I
made         with   ores, the various natures                  of lime-stones, or chalk,
with certain proportions of bottle glass, have been found
capable of reviving the iron contained in all the ores which
have come under my knowledge, and of conferring upon
their respective          products every degree of strength and fusi
bility *.         In   order to form an accurate judgment of the ten

dcncy which individual ores have to afford                          their metal car
bonated, possessing strength,                  or otherwise, a flux of               a me
dium proportion of calcareous                     earth and glass is determined
upon      ;   such as, with an iron-stone              of that genus, would af
ford super-carbonated crude iron.                       Let the button of iron so
obtained be the standard                   whereby to judge of succeeding
results ; and let all the ores belonging to the fame mine,                                  or
used at the same work,                  be compared with it             :  these    will    be
found, according to their mixtures,                       possessing      different de
grees     of carbonation          ;   some   of them white in             the    fracture,
and others again as richly carbonated                        as the standard           regu-
lus ; their degrees of strength                 also approaching            or receding
from the standard             as   they approximate or vary from the na
ture and proportion              of   its original mixture.
     To complete           such an undertaking with accuracy, requires
 a minute knowledge                of   the operations       of    the assay-furnace,
 and the degree of heat from time to time excited                           :   the quan
tity of ore in such a chain of experiments mould be at all
times the fame, and the requisite                      heat conveyed           and com
 pleted at similar stages              of fusion     and    of   separation.           Strict
strength to the metal, yet          I  have not ventured a conjecture         how     far and
in what manner the mechanical              structure   of the meul is altered when
additional      strength is thus obtained.         It  will be a   difficult matter     to de
cide,   whether        it is derived from the natural       infusibility of the clay,        by
preventing separation for a longer time,             and new modifying         the structure
of the particles of metal; or whether the acquired strength is entirely owing
to the moleculæ of the metal becoming more flattened and tenacious by a
varied stage of crystallisation.          Most probably it is owing to both causes,
and that the former is productive            of the latter j the one the cause, and the
other the effect accounted for.
     We    find, that from siliceous iron-stone, which is fused with the greatest
facility, iron     is obtained uncommonly         white and brittle ; and again,          from
 pure calcareous iron-stones,           which  are  still more difficult to reduce than
the other     two   classes, we find an opposite extreme      of brittltncss,    arising from
 au extra combination        of carbon, which destroys        the continuity      of die par
 ticles to each other.        Clay still holds the medium        ;  and its addition alone
 restores    a just  equilibrium, not of strength only, but of fusibility.
                                                                                  accuracy

  l8i                     Hints for    the Formation    of
 accuracy of result,          as to  the quantity of metal, will not al
 ways be obtained ; but a very comprehensive knowledge will
 be formed of the nature of the earthy mixtures, and the
 strength     and fusibility    of   the metal.    Once in the    possession
 of these, it will be no difficult matter to superadd a portion
 of earths requisite for perfect reduction. In two simple ex
 periments, therefore, not only the real quantity of metal con
 tained in the ore is obtained, but its presumptive strength
 and fusibility developed         in  a great measure prior to its appli
 cation to the purposes of the blast-furnace.
     In   order to facilitate this operation, and to compare the
 various degrees of heat in which different experiments are
 effected,    I  constructed     a pyrometer upon the principle        of the
 expansion of metal by heat             ; a representation   of which,     and
 a description of its use, will form an article for the next
 Number of the Philosophical Magazine.

round; whether there are found in their neighbourhood
other vestiges of organised bodies *.
   4. Their nature.         Whether they      are lying in their natural
position, of reversed, and turned upside down, so as to afford
reason to conclude that they died on the spots which they
now occupy       ;  or whether they have been transported           thither
by some violent and irregular movement                :   whether, for ex
ample, the (hells have the fame attitude as in the bosom of
the   sea,   the univalves on their mouth,           and the bivalves on
the valve that is least convex.

     8. To compare exactly the bones, (hells, and foffil plants

 certain the truth of the assertion of Michaelis, that the fossil
 bones     of   quadrupeds     (such    as   the elephant,     rhinoceros,
 oxen, and stags,)         have not an     exact resemblance       to those

  whether there are any indications of their having formerly
  existed,     and of their having been             conveyed    to those coun

  the contrary,        these remains seem to have been               transported
  thither by currents, tides, pr any other great movement                       of

XIII.      On the Cure       of  Persons    bitten by Snakes       in India*,
                     By  John Williams,                Esq..
  A HE        following statement       of  facts   relative to the cure of
persons      bitten by snakes,       selected from      a number      of  cases
which      have    come within my own knowledge,                    require no
prefatory introduction,         as it points out the        means   of obtain
ing the greatest self-gratification the human mind is capable
of experiencing, That of the preservation of the life of a fel
low-creature,        and snatching him from the            jaws of death, by
a method which every person is capable of availing himself
of. Eau de Luce, I learn from many communications which
I   have received from different parts           of the country, answers
 as well     as the pure caustic        alkali  spirit ; and though, from
 its having some essential oils in its composition, it may not
 be so powerful,       yet, as it must be given with water, it only
 requires to increase       the   dose   in proportion ; and, so long as
 it retains its milky white colour, it is sufficiently efficacious.
     From the effect of a ligature applied between the part bit
 ten and the heart, it is evident that the poison diffuses itself
  over the body by the returning                venous blood ; destroying
  the irritability, and rendering the system paralytic.                    It is
  therefore     probable that the volatile caustic alkali, m resisting
  the  disease    of the poison, does not act so much as a specific
  in destroying its quality,        as  by counteracting the effect on
  the system, by stimulating the fibres, and preserving that ir
  ritability which it tends to destroy.
      Case I. In       the month      of August 1780,        a servant  of mine
  was bitten in the heel,          as he supposed,       by a shake    ; and in
   a few minutes was         in  great agony, with convulsions about
   the throat and jaws, and continual grinding of the teeth.
   Having a wish to try the effects of volatile alkali in such
   cases,  I  gave   him about forty drops of Eau de Luce in water,
   and applied some of it to the part bitten.                The dose was rc-
                          * From th«
                                       Asiatic  Researches,
                                                                          peated

igi                    On the Cure of Persons bitten
peated every eight or ten minutes,            till  a small phialful     wif
expended     :  it  was near    two hours before it could be said he
was out    of danger.       A numbness       and pricking sensation was
perceived     extending itself up to the knee, where a ligature
was applied      so   tight  as to stop   the returning venous blood,
which seemingly checked the progress of the deleterious poi
son.     The foot and leg, up to where the ligature was made,
were stiff and painful for several days,           and, which appeared
very singular, were covered         with   a brariny scale.
    The   above was the first cafe      in which     I  tried the effects of
the volatile alkali,      and, apprehending that the essential oils
in   the composition        of Eau    de  Luce, though        made    of the
strong caustic volatile spirit, would considerably diminish its
powers,     I  was     induced,   the next opportunity that offered,
to try the effects of pure volatile caustic alkali spirit, and ac
cordingly prepared some from quicklime                 and the  sal  ammo
niac of this country.
    II.  In July 1782,        a woman      of  the Brahmen       cast, who
lived-  in my neighbourhood          at  Chunar, was bitten by a Co
bra de Capello between           the   thumb and fore-finger of her
right    hand.        Prayers and superstitious         incantations    were
practised   by the Brahmens about her, till she became speech
less and convulsed,        with locked jaws, and       a profuse discharge
of saliva running from her mouth.                  On being informed of
the accident,       I  immediately sent     a servant with a bottle of
the volatile caustic alkali spirit,       of which       he poured about a
tea-spoonful, mixed with water, down her throat, and applied
some    of it   to the part bitten.       The    dose was repeated     a few
minutes after, when she was evidently better,                 and in about
half   an hour was perfectly recovered.
    This accident       happened    in  a small hut,       where  I  saw the
snake,    which       was a middle-sized Cobra de Capello.               The
Brahmens       would      not allow it to be killed.          In the   above
 cafe,  no other means whatever were used for the recovery of
 the patient than are here recited.
    III, A     woman-servant       in the family of         a gentleman at
                                                                    Benares,

Benares, was bitten in the foot by a Cobra de Capello.                   The
gentleman immediately applied to me for some                   of  the vola
tile caustic    alkali, which       I fortunately had by me.           I gave
her about sixty drops in water, and also applied some of it to
the part bitten.        In about seven or eight minutes after, she
was perfectly recovered.           In  the above     case   I was not wit
ness to the deleterious       effect  of    the poison     on the patient    j
but saw the snake after it was killed.
    IV. In July      1784 the wife of a servant of mine was bitten
by   a. Cobra de Capello on the outside of the little toe of her
right foot.      In   a few minutes she became convulsed,              parti
cularly about the jaws and throat, with a continued gnash
ing of the teeth.         She at first complained of a numbness
extending from the wound upwards                   ; but no ligature was
applied to the limb.         About    sixty drops    of the volatile caustic
spirit were given to her in water, by forcing open her mouth,
which was strongly convulsed : in about seven minutes the
dose was      repeated,    when the convulsions left her; and in
three    more    she became     sensible,     and spoke to those who at
tended her.        A  few drops of the spirit had also been applied
to the wound.         The    snake    was killed and brought          to me,
which     proved to be a Cobra de Capello.
    V. As it    is generally believed that the venom            of  snakes  is
more malignant during hot dry weather than at any other
season, the following case, which occurred in the month of
July    1788,   when the weather was extremely hot, no rain
excepting     a  slight sliower having fallen for many months,
may not be unworthy of notice             : —
    A   servant belonging to an officer at Juanpoor,             was bitten
h,y a snake     on the    leg,   about two inches above the outer
ancle.      As  the accident happened           in the evening,     he could
not   fee  what species of snake it was.             He immediately tied
a ligature above the part bitten          ;   but was in a few minutes
in   such   exquisite   torture from pain, which extended up his
body and to his head, that he soon became dizzy and sense
less.     On being informed of          the accident,     I sent my servant
    Vol. IV.                             O                               with

with   a phial of the volatile caustic alkali, who found him",
when he arrived, quite torpid, with the saliva running out of
his mouth,      and     his jaws   so fast     locked    as   to render   it ne
cessary to use an instrument to open                 them and administer
the medicine.       About forty drops of the volatile caustic spirit
were given to him in water, and applied to the wound ; and
the same dose repeated a few minutes after.                       In about half
an hour he was perfectly recovered.                 On examining the part
bitten,    I  could discover the        marks of three fangs ; two on
one fide, and one on the other            ;  and, from the distance they
were    asunder,     I   should judge it a large snake.              More than
ten minutes did not appear to have elapsed from the time of
his being bitten till the medicine was administered.                         The
 wounds healed        immediately,        and he was        able   to attend    to
 his duty the next day.         Though        the species     of snake was not
 ascertained,    yet   I judge, from        the flow      of   saliva  from the
 mouth,     convulsive     spasms   of  the jaws and throat,           as well  as
 from the marks of three             fangs, that it must have been a
 Cobra de Capello ; and though I have met with five and
 fix fangs of different sizes in snakes of that species, I never
 observed the marks         of  more     than two having been applied
 in biting in any other cafe which                 came      within my know
 ledge.
    VI. In     September 1786 a servant belonging to Captain
 S       , who was then at Benares, was bitten in the leg by
 a large   Cobra de Capello.           He      saw the      snake    coming to
 wards him, with his neck spread out in a verv tremendous
 manner,      and   endeavoured        to avoid him ; but, before he
  could get   out  of   his  way, the snake seized him by the le?,
  and  secured    his   hold   for some time, as if he had not been
  able to extricate        his teeth.       Application       was immediately
  made    to his master for a remedy, who sent to consult me ;
  but, before   I  arrived, had given him            a quantity     of sweet oil,
  which    he drank.       So soon   as   I  saw  him,     I directed   the usual
  dose  of volatile    caustic alkali to be given, which fortunately
  brought away the oil from his stomach, or it is probable
                                                                              that

                                  by Snakes in           India.                            v
                                                                                                19
                                                                                                     j
that the stimulating effect of the volatile spirit would have
been so much blunted by                   it,   as to have         become inefficacious:
a    second dose was immediately administered, and some time
after,     a   third.      The man            recovered          in the course of          a    few
hours.           As oil    is   frequently administered                 as   a   remedy    in the
bite of snakes,           I     think    it   necessary          to caution against             the
use   of    it   with     the volatile alkali,          as    it   blunts the stimulating
quality of the spirit, and renders                      it   useless.
     Of    the numerous species               of   snakes which         I     have met     with,
not above           six   were    provided with poisonous                     fangs   5   though
I    have examined many which                       have         been      considered      by   the
natives        as   dangerous, without                 being able to discover                  any
thing noxious in them.
   The following   an instance of the deleterious effect of the
                            is
bite of snake, called by the natives Krait,
            a                                   species of the               a
Boa, which have frequently met with in this part of the
                    I
country     :   —
     VII.      On   the 16th September 1788     man was brought    a
to me who           had been bitten                by
                                         snake, with the marks of
                                                       a
two fangs on two of his toes                  ;    he was said to have been bit
ten above an hour before                      saw him
                                      he was perfectly sensi

ble, but complained of great pain in the parts bitten, with
an unusual                 immediately gave him thirty drops

of the volatile caustic alkali spirit in water, and applied some
of   it   to the wounds.            In   a    sew minutes               he became easier,
and       in about half an hour was carried away                               by   his friends,
with perfe6t confidence in his recovery, without having taken
a second dose of the medicine, which indeed did not appear
to have been necessary             :    but whether from the effect of the
bite of the snake,              or the motion of the dooly on which he
was carried,        I     know not; but he became                          sick at the sto
mach,  threw up the medicine, and died in about quarter                               a
of an hour after. The man said that the snake came up to
him while           he was        sitting on the ground                ;     and that he put
him away with his hand once, but that he turned about and

reason to doubt that Nature never                                      produces any thing new
on the one hand, without decomposing                                         something old on the
other.           The        process           of boiling          saltpetre,    explained       by   the
remarks           of naturalists,                   has (hewn that earth,                freed from
all salts        by    lixiviation,             as soon as        it   is   heaped up against new
walls exposed                 to the open air,               becomes again impregnated
with different new salts                            :    but these, however, have been
formed            by       the    experiments of Lavoisier, Thouvenel,                               and
myself, through the effects                              of various artificial kinds of air.
The       greater           part of salts are produced                        in the   fame manner
in     organised            bodies   ;        and thus plants produce vitriojated tar

 of gases combined with            each    other produce new kinds,                 as
 may be      seen   in plants, which convert foul air into oxy
 genated.      Ought not the other substances found in orga-
 pised bodies to be ascribed to the like works                 of Nature      ?
    Becher and Henkel first shewed that all vegetables contain
 iron  and gold, and since their time this fact has been placed
 beyond any doubt.            Many chemists, particularly Lauragais,
 Rouelle, Darcet,         Sage, Berthollet, &c. obtained both these
 metals   from plants by reducing them to aslies *.                      Are    these
 substances contained          in  those things which furnisli nourish
 ment to plants, or are they produced                   by vegetation      ?    This
 question    can be applied also to the earth contained in plants.
 Puck-weed and all plants of this kind grow in the purest
 water, and we daily          fee   bulbous plants shooting up in it.
    Van Helmont          relates,    that he planted         a shoot     of woad,
 weighing fifty pounds, in a hundred pounds of earth. He
 watered it with distilled water, and in five years it weighed
 169 pounds 3 ounces:
                                  the earth had lost        of  its weight only
 two ounces.         Bonnet       and    Duhamel         reared    plants in the
 purest  water, and they grew as well as in the best soil.                          It
 may be asked, then,          if particles    susceptible    of being     attracted
 by the magnet could have been found in the aslies of these
 plants, as well as in those of plants that grew in fields or
 gardens   ?
    The author        repeated      many of these experiments.                    He
 calcined    a part  of various       seeds,    and    extracted     the ferrugi
 nous particles from them by means of                    a magnet;       the other
part he suffered to shoot,           and to grow up in distilled water,

Their  ashes gave a much greater quantity            of metallic particle)
than the feeds, and produced           also much more earth.
   As Nature produces, in plants,            salts, oil,  and (lime,    may
she not, in like manner,          produce earth,     iron,   and gold   in a
metallic form      ?   and, in this process,      may (he not employ
water, light, and different kinds of gases, which it appears
contribute most to the formation of salts and oils ? In this
manner metals          would be brought very near to saline sub
stances, which several chemists          have already suspected.
  XV.    Observations      on  Native Iron found in Strawberries*.
I  T  appears from the preceding article to be a circumstance
well known to naturalists, that in the              ashes  of plants there
are a great      many particles susceptible os being attracted by
the magnet, and which consequently               must be     of  the nature
of iron  ;   but that this metal has been found in plants under
jts original     metallic form,       is a fact known      only to    a few.
Grains of gold, however, according            to the assertion    of Becher,
have at times been sound in grapes,            and threads     of gold have
been discovered in the roots of corn j tin and lead in the in
terior parts of plants ; quicksilver in wood,             Sec. :  but it has
never perhaps been thought possible that iron should be found
amidst the corroding juices of a plant, because no metal is
so easily decomposed        as  iron,   merely by the moisture of the
atmosphere,      acids, and the like.
   A  certain anonymous friend of natural history dined with
several guests      in  the month      of June 1781,     at the    house   of
his sister, situated on the road to Peterstiof,              not far from
Petersburgh     :   after dinner some strawberries         were placed on
the table, in     a plate,   as   part of the   dessert  along with other
kinds of fruit.         The anonymous       person ate    of  the strawber
ries, as   did all the other guests, without perceiving any thing

remarkable        ;    but one of the company at last called his atten
tion to some hard black grains which he found in the ber
ries he had eaten,              and he soon observed                that grains of the
like kind were contained in those which he was eating him
self.      He did not imagine that                     these grains were iron,            but
he                  them up in a bit of paper and carried
        however wrapped
them home with him, in order that he might examine them
with     more attention.                He accordingly          tried them by a mag
net, and having observed that they were attracted by                                  it,   he
entertained           no doubt that they were                   real    native    iron.     It
deserves to be remarked,                  that the person to whom the ano
nymous naturalist was indebted for this discovery, and whose
veracity free from the least suspicion, asserted that he had
             is
often before found like particles of iron in the strawberries
which he ate on the fame farm.                         These particles were          of va      •
rious forms and sizes, but more or                          less flatted.      Their black
colour was ver)- similar to that of ore found in dirty iron
mines, only that    was much paler.
                               it
      On   closer examination,                by   means       of   a   magnifying glass,
these bodies appeared to be fragments broken off from larger
pieces     of iron,       so   that, with      a   little    assistance     from the ima
gination,      traces      of
                      regular fracture might be perceived on
                                    a
them.   But even, whether we suppose that they were con
veyed into the fruit as bodies before in   state of existence,   a
or were gradually formed in the interior part of them, the
explanation of the phenomenon will still be attended with
difficulty. Their flatted form seems to oppose the idea of
their having been produced in the fruit; but on the other
hand, that of their being conveyed into the. fruit with the
juices through            the stem, appears to be attended with much
greater difficulty.              The     most singular circumstance                 is,   that
 somany of these fruit in that district ssiould have been fur
nished with these small bodies, and that they should have
been found exactly                  in the   centre.

yet worthy of attention.                     In the neighbourhood of the town
of Baturin in           the Ukraine,             there       are a number            of   pleasant
little hills intersected by various ravines formed by the wa
ters.        In   these ravines there are found in different places
white globular           masses    of       calcareous        stone, which on the out
side bear         marks as        if   they had been rubbed against black
stones   ;    these marks do not go deeper than the surface,                                    and
appear to be the work                  of    some mineral            pigment.             The   size
of    these masses approaches                     near to that of a walnut                  :   it is
however difficult to break them                          ;   and the nearer you get to
the nucleus, which is distinguished                            from the external cover
ing by        a green yellowish colour,                      the   finer and         harder the
grain is found.    The middle of this stone consists of several
cells separated from each otbej by partitions, some of which
are exceedingly           thin.        These stone masses may be considered
either       as   excrescences          or petrefactions, and may be classed
among the carpolites or alcyonites;                            but this is of little con
sequence.
     What, however,            deserves attention                  is,   that,   in   one speci
men which was broken, there were found in two of the cells
two small grains which were immediately known to be iron
 bytheir being attracted                    by
                            magnet. The smaller fell from

session,  has the exact shape of the cavity in which
                                                           lay,                            it

XxFTER           attending    a  family labouring under putrid fever,
I   was seized myself with the same fever, but it was pre
vented forming by an emetic and calomel cathartic.                             It
assailed next my wife,           who being advanced           in pregnancy,
the fame remedies could not be applied, and the fever ac
tually formed itself.           The    symptoms     became      so   alarming,
that mustard cataplasms             were applied to the feet ; and there
arising, towards the close of the disease, violent siartings                   of
the tendons, and a cold clammy sweat, with                  a  fluttering and
sunk pulse,       I was induced to make trial of the oxygen air
nearly in     a  pure state, and Mrs. Thornton was immediately
revived by this remedy, and, after a fever                which     lasted one
and twenty days, recovered.               A  servant in the house,         and a
nurse, were next seized ; and             I  had   the    maid taken out of
bed, and made her inhale thirty quarts                of vital air, mixed
with twice that quantity of atmospheric                  ;  which being re
peated     for   a  few days,       she was completely restored.             The
 nurse had      an  ¦emetic,      and   went home.         My two children
 were afterwards seized with the same fever; and being de
 clared by the gentleman who attended them past all hopes,
 I  ordered a carriage to be procured,            and    took them imme
 diately to the top of Highgate             Hill, where they       were com
 posed    to sleep by the keen country air, and came                       home
 greatly revived      ;  which excursion being repeated daily, they
 both recovered,        to the surprise   of every  one.     Seeing the good
 effects   of air,   and   of factitious oxygen air,          I  adopted both

     My daughter                      of February 1798, with
                               was taken, the 27th
«hills, followed by shiverings, considerable loss of strength,
and depression of spirits. She continued suffering much from
chills for about four or                  five hours,           after which        she    com
plained of heat and flushing in her face, not attended with
much thirst, and was                  a    little delirious           that   night.        The
next day the symptoms                     increased,           and   the debility was so
great        that    I   was obliged,          after     the    first passages     had been
thoroughly cleansed,                to have       recourse       to wine      and        bottled
porter, together with cordial antiseptic medicines; which
plan was pursued, under your direction, during the progress
of the       disease;    the close of which, the poor child
                           towards
was so shockingly debilitated, that we expected every minute
would be her last, which induced you to direct vital air *,
by which, and the constant use of strong vinegar, thoroughly
sprayed with a hearth-brush all over the room and curtains
of the bed,              revived    her astonishingly            :   but the manner in
which         stie   constantly revived,               after   inhaling      the vital         air,
must be chiefly attributed to                    it,   as the    vinegar had been used
in    the way before mentioned almost from the very beginning
of    the disease, and was,           I        believe, not only of great                use    to
the patient, but prevented                     the fever spreading           in   my family.
No poor human being,                 I    believe,        ever had     a   narrower escape
from death           ;   andI    shall always foci myself under the highest
obligations possible to you for your attention and extraordi
nary skill in restoring my dear child, with God's assistance,
to,                                            Dear Sir,
                               Your much obliged and faithful Servant,
                                                                       JOHN CORPE.
         Sixteen quarts of vital air,          mixed     with the fame quantity of armo-
   *

    P. S.     I    had almost forgot to observe,                     that the door and
windows           of my      dear child's         room were kept almost                       con
stantly open, and, being exactly opposite to each other, na
turally created           a free   circulation of fresti air.

    Miss Corpe,            set: eighteen          when     I   saw her, was convulsed                j
and the nurse said,               " that, if      it was her child, nothing more
"   fliould be given;" even her mother requested,                                     " if    there
" really were            no hopes, that     might not be disturbed by

" medicine."               What increased the alarm was: a tradesman
a few doors off had lately died of this fame fever under this
eminent physician, leaving behind him a widow and six
children.              The   cafe, indeed,        seemed deplorable;                but despair
should never be allowed while there is life ; and it autho
rised the exhibition               of   the vital air, which undoubtedly con
tributed much to the recovery of this amiable young lady.
 XVII.            On the Glazing            of Earthen         Vessels       without   Lead*.
JTxS          it is well known that the common glazing                                   by lead
 employed for earthen ware is of a pernicious nature and pre
judicial to the health, H. Niefeman, a potter at Leipsic, has
proposed the following                  :   —Take       nitre, pot-ash, and common
 salt,   of   each      half    a pound, with double that quantity                           of pul
 verised glass,           and    mix them well together                  ;    then take a well
 baked flat earthen dish, cover                    it pretty thick with well                    beat
 clay, strew over the clay                   as   much sand as will adhere                     to   it,
 and suffer        it   to dry.     Put the above ingredients, well mixed,
 into this dish, and introduce                     it    into the furnace in order that
 they may be all fused together.                          The      dish, however, must be
 placed       within another, in order that the ingredients may not
 be lost      in cafe the dish should happen to crack but        be             :        if    it
 well covered with clay carefully bestrewed with sand,                                          little
 danger           is   to be apprehended.                 When the ingredients have

 been fused,        they are to be pounded         very fine in the usual
 manner, and may be employed                as  the common glazing of
 lead.    The colour of this glazing inclines a little to grey,
 but by the addition of the common calcareous spar it ac
quires a yellow colour           :  manganese   gives it a brown colour ;
and the addition of copper ashes a green colour.                     To avoid,
however, every thing that has the appearance of being per
 nicious, this mixture of copper ashes should be employed
only for       vessels    which    are to be used   in washing.           If this
glazing is required for any particular purpose to be difficult
 of fusion, a little less litharge may be added to it ; but the
quantity in all cafes must be           so small as to leave no room for
apprehending the least bad consequences.                    This     substitute
 for the common glazing is strongly recommended by Pro
fessor  Leonhardi.

                                 and Bourbon *.
T.HE           Isle of France was discovered in the fifteenth cen
tury by the Portuguese, who called it the Isle                      of Acerno,
The Dutch took possession of it in the year 1598,                    and gave
jt  the name       of  the  Mauritius, in honour of their Stadtholder
Prince Maurice.             It was not, however, till the year 1640
that they formed a settlement               there, at   a   harbour      in the
south-east,      which     they abandoned     in 1712, either on account
of   the little progress      it made,  or on account of their establislii-
ment at the Cape of Good Hope.                     In   17 15    the French
landed at the harbour in the north-west                  fide,   and    named
the island       ljle  de France,      Soon after,   in  1731,      the   inha
bitants of the Isle of Bourbon,             at present     called    I/le  de  la
Reunion, which            is situated at the distance     of about ninety
miles to the west of the Isle of France, formed                a   new settle
ment under the direction of Durongay.                During      fifteen years
this colony was in a very languishing                 condition.         It was.

rendered       productive by La Bourdonnaie in 1735;                   and  in
1764 the island was given up to the French government by
the East India Company.               After that period it was placed
under the direction of a governor, and an intendant,                    or or-
donnateur.
     It lies  in  ao°   io' of south   latitude and 530 24' of east Ion*
gitude from the meridian of Paris.                According to La Caillfi
 it is 90,668 toises in circumference, 31,890 broad from east
 to west,       and contains 433,680 square acres,              each   of  100
 perches, and the perch of ao feet.                  It  has two harbours ;
 one in the south-east,            or the Great Haven,         and the other
 in the north-west, called the Small Haven                ;  also Port  Louis,
 and, since the Revolution,           Port de la Montagne.          The   most
 northern harbour is the principal             port in     the  island.    The
  north-west       part of it is perfectly flat, but the south-east is
  covered     with mountains ; they are from 300 to 350 toises in
  height    :  the highest, at the mouth of the river Noire, is 424.
  The     most    remarkable mountain          is called Pieterboth ;      it  is  ,
  420 toises in height, and its summit ends in an obelisk, on
  which there is a large cubical mass of rock that no man has
  yet been able to ascend.
      The island is watered by more than sixty streams, some of
  which, in the droughty season, become totally dry, espe
  cially   since    the forests have been cut down.              The interior
  abounds with lakes, and rain prevails during the greater part
   of the year, the clouds being attracted by the mountains and
   forests.     The    soil  is covered    with   large or small stones ;       il
   withstands the plough, and must be cultivated with the hoe,
   yet it is very proper for various productions; Though of less
   depth and less fertility than that of the Island of Reunion,
   it is however, in general, more susceptible of cultivation.
      The Island of Reunion (Bourbon) was discovered                        also
   by the Portuguese,           who called it Mascarenhas,           after the
   commander of the sleet; and this name was afterwards cor
    rupted into Mafcaraigne.             In the     year    1642 Pronis,      the
    commandant at Madagascar, took               possession   of the island for
                                                                              the

the French government. Seven years after, this was repeated
by the new commandant Deflaccourt,                                who gave the island
the   name of Bourbon.                    He introduced into it               domestic         ani
mals, which multiplied considerably; and, on account of its
fertility,      several     Frenchmen            formed in it settlements.                         1st
the year 1665 two ships of De la Haie's squadron arrived
here, and left Renaud, an officer d'adminijlration, together
with twenty labourers. The French who in 167 1 escaped
the massacre at Fort Dauphin, in Madagascar, fled to this
island ; and various sea-faring persons settled in and em                          it,
ployed themselves in agriculture.
   It     is   situated    about ninety miles from the Isle of France,
to the windward.                 One day only             is   sufficient for going from
the Isle of France to the Isle of Bourbon,                                   but   a     month     is
often necessary to return.                     It   is   about forly miles in length
and thirty in breadth. The                      sliores are exceedingly steep, and
piroguas only can approach                      them without danger of being
overset.        The    soil     is   sandier than that           of   the Isle     of France       :
at some distance from the sliore                    it   is   mixed with those smooth
stones     (galots) which              cover        the bottom         of    the sea.         The
ground, however, in those parts which can be cultivated,                                           is
excellent. The mountains are exceedingly high     the three                      :
inaccessible       peaks,        called       the Sala/ses,          are said to be 1600
toises.        There       is   here    a      very      awful volcano,            the district
around which              is    entirely burnt up          ;    and also     a     great many
gulleys, the declivities                of which          are   so
                                                                     steep   that they can
not be cultivated.               The chief port in the                   island        is   that   of
St. Denis,        where        a   drawbridge, secured bv iron chains, has
been constructed  for the purpose of enabling boats to land.
This bridge extends more than eighty feet into the sea, and
at the end       of   it   is   a    ladder    of     ropes     by    which      people       who
wisli to go on sliore must ascend   in all other parts of the

   About fifteen miles                  to the windward                from St. Denis              is
St. Paul, where the sea                is   calmer, and the anchoring eround
more secure       :    mariners,            however, prefer St. Denis.  This

leagues from St. Denis.
     The Iky    is serene, the atmosphere      pure, and the water       sa
lubrious.       Land   tortoises,   which  were here formerly so abun
dant, are found now only in the western part ; in the other
parts they have been exterminated by ships which have
touched at the island. The wild goats and wild hogs have
retired to the summits of the mountains            :  the rabbits, quails,
 partridges and pintadoes          brought to the island   have none      of
 them increased, except the last.          Le Gentil mentions     as  found
 here a bird called I'oiseau bleu,        a very  delicate kind of bats     j

 and lemon trees        in  great abundance.

 the year 1779, to the Duke de la Foes,          uncle of the present
 queen, who is also president of it.         The different branches

                       maJj by Mr. Herholdt,
                                              we announced a discovery
 said to have been                                     an eminent accou
 cheur at Copenhagen,          that the apparent       death  of new-born
 children arose from the trachea being filled               with   a   liquid,
 and that they might often be restored by merely giving them
 a position favourable to its efflux.         We then     expressed  a  doubt
 as to the correctness of the observations; because             it appeared
 impossible,      from Dr. Goodwyn's            experiments,     that water
  could in any cafe enter into the trachea; and because, in
 those experiments in which it had been forced into the tra
 chea, it had always been absorbed,               if the animal was suf
 fered to live.      Candour, however, now calls upon us to hate,
 that we find the following article in the Journal de Physique
 for Floreal, art.    VII.
     " An    important discovery is announced in the Medico-
 chirurgical Journal, published by Professor Tode of Copen
 hagen *. Herholdt has found, on opening the bodies of still
 born animals, that the cavity of the tympanum                    was silled
 with   the    liquor of   the amnios and         with phlegm (viscous
 water).      This fluid    after birth issues      by the auditory con
 duit, and is replaced by atmospheric               air.    This   discovery
 induced him to suppose that the liquor of the amnios is in
 troduced    also into the canal      of respiration    before the child is
 born.     Experiments made at the veterinary school have con-
jirmed    this hypothesis.     Nature,      in general, discharges this
 liquor,   but sometimes        it is necessary for that purpose to
 employ the assistance of art.           A  child cannot breathe         easily

ning    off' of  the water.      The author     has had the good fortune
this year to restore to life twelve children out of thirteen who
were     in the like situation.          Professors Ahildgaafd       and   Wi-

                          KATURAL HISTORY.
     The following incident          has lately attracted   much notice at
 Paris   :— --Citoven    Felix two years       ago brought       two lions, a
 male and female, to the national menagerie.                 About the      be
 ginning of June Felix fell ill, and could no longer attend the
 lions j another was forced to do his duty. The lion, fad and
 solitary, remained from that moment constantly seated at the
 end of his cage, and refused to receive any thing from the
 stranger.       H:s   nrefence even was hatctul to him, and he me
 naced him by belowling.            The company of      the female seemed
  also to displease him ; he paid           no attention     to her.       The
 uneasiness     of   the animal afforded a belief that        he was reallv
 ill,  but no one dared to approach           him.    At length Felix got
 well, and meaning to surprise the lion, h« crawled softly to
 the cage, and (hewed only his face against the bars; the lion
 in   a  moment made        a  bound, leaped against the bars, patted
 him with his paws, licked his hands and face, and trembled
 with    pleasure.      The femak       ran to him also; the       lion drove
 her back, seemed angry,             and tearful   that  she should snatch
  any favours from Felix         ; a  quarrel seemed about to take place
 between them,           but Felix entered       the cage to pacify them.
  He    caressed    them by turns.        Felix is now      seen   frequently
  in  the midst      of this formidable couple,       whose power he has-
  fettered   :  he   holds a kind of conversation      with them.          Doe?
 he wish that they should             separate and   retire   each     to their
  cages, he has only to speak a word            ; does he wish that they
  ihould lie down- to shew strangers their paws armed with
                                                                        terrible

recompence,             obtain the favour of licking bis hand. — These

together.
                  FULMINATING OXYD OT MERCURY.
     It   is well known that                 C. Bayen, Brugnatelli,                   and others,
some time ago discovered that nitrats in general, those of
the metals not excepted, detonate with combustible sub
stances,          especially     with        sulphur.        That        some preparations
of     gold       and   of    silver     possess      the     property of fulminating
without           the   addition of any                  inflammable substance, has
also      been        known for some time.                       We      have now to an
nounce, that    method of preparing an oxyd of mercury,
                        a
different from any described by Bayen or others, that may be
fired       like gunpowder, and detonates                         loudly with a gentle
stroke      of    a   hammer, has just been discovered by                 Mr. Edward
Howard.               We      have      not yet received             a   correct account             of
the process for preparing                     it,
                                        but, from the wonderful expan
sive      force    it   exerts on being lired, we have not  doubt that              a
it   will    prove      a   very useful discovery.               A   few grains          of   it   tried
in   a    gunpowder proof, instead of merely raising the flap to
some point            within     the range          of   the attached        scale, fairly stiot
it   off;     and       the piece        detached,          on being examined, was
found to have received                       such     a   blow from the newly-gene
rated       gas as to be absolutely                      dented    by    it,   as   if   it   had re
ceived the impression                   of   a   punch      by   means       of   a   heavy ham
mer     :   the cavity was exactly the diameter                          of    the bore        of the
proof,        and, what          is     extremely singular, of an equal depth
all over.             A charge

        EFFECT OF HYDROGEN GAS ON THE VOTCE.
  The Journal Britannique,                         published         at Geneva by Prevot^
contains          the     following        article       :   — " Maunoir    was one day
amusing himself with Paul at Geneva, in breathing pure
hydrogen air. He inspired it with ease; and did not per
ceive that it had any sensible effect on him, either in enter
ing his lungs, or passing out. But after he had taken in a
very large dose, he was desirous                             of   speaking,      and was asto
nishingly surprised at the sound of his voice, which was be
come soft,         fh   rill,   and even squeaking,               so as to alarm       him.          Paul
made the fame experiment en himself,                                  and      the same effect
was produced.                   I   do not know
                                 whether any thing similar.
kas occurred in breathing any of the other gases."
CHEAP             METHOD              OP   PREVENTING THE DISAGREE
                            ABLE SMELL OF PRIVIES.
   In    some houses,                privies, when badly placed and                          ill   taken,
care of, diffuse an odour as inconvenient as unhealthful                                           ;   but
the means of remedying this evil                               is   exceedingly easy.                  Isa
certain quantity of milk of lime                               (water in which lime has
been dissolved,                 and whitened             by    the sine particles of that
substance)         be mixed with              a    ley   of    aslies, or soapy water that
has been even used for washing, be thrown into the fink                                            of the
privy,       it   will    destroy       the   offensive           smell.       By these means^
for the value of            a       few pence, any collection                  of filth whatever
may be neutralised.                     By    the same process conveniencies for
sick persons may be kept                      in their apartments.                     Nothing           is
necessary but to have                  a   tub covered with                a   board        as   a   feat;
five or six pounds   of quicklime,    small quantity of aslies,
                                                              a
and     two buckets of water thrown into thu tub, will prevent
any disagreeable odour.                       It    may readily be conceived                           that
the same process                    may be employed                  in    regard      to   a    night

excellent manure for land.
                      LENGTH OF THE METRE.
    From     the  Journal      de Physique   we learn,     that the report
which has been made of the length of the metre at Paris by
the learned, men employed in determining the length of a

                        TRANSIT OF MERCURY.
    " I   waited with impatience for the             passage   of Mercury
over    the   sun's    disk   in his descending      node.    It  had never
been completely observed in that position, and there will not
be another for thirty-three years.             I had the pleasure     of ob
serving     Mercury       enter   the  sun's  dilk, like    a small   round
black spot, on the iSth of Florcal (May 7th) in the morn
ing, at the verv moment pointed out in my new tables.                    The
principles on which           they  are founded     I  have   explained    in
the first memoir          read at the first meeting      of  the first class
of   the  Institute immediately after its establishment.               This
is the more satisfactory,         as, in the calculations for the transit
of  the 4th    May    1780, there were forty minutes variation from
the best tables      of Mercury.                             Lalande,"

    Kasteleyn      has lately publistied      the   following    method of

Shavings of copper are put into a close vessel, and besprink
led   with    a solution     of  the muriat   of ammonia.        The metal
first unites with the muriatic          acid, and is dissolved,      and    is
jn its turn precipitated by the disengaged ammonia, to
which it now joins itself. The precipitate is then washed

ammonia are sufficient           for two parts of copper,            and the re

                         GREN'S EUDIOMETER.
     Professor Gren,       in  a  work of his lately published *, pro»
poses the following           method of constructing an eudiometer
 by means of phosphorus             ;  which, though         slow   in  its opera
tion, will give a very accurate             result.      Take    a small     cvlin-
 dric glass tube, sealed at the one end, and divided from that
 end by means        of   a scale    into sufficiently small equal parts           ;
 fill it with distilled water, plunge           it into   a bason    of   the fame

 and note the       state   of  the atmosphere         at the     time,    as indi
 cated by the barometer and thermometer.                      Through       a cork,
 smaller in diameter than the tube, stick a few needles,                        and
 place on the upper end          of them    a  bit of pure clear phosphorus:
 fasten a thread to the bottom             of    the cork.       Introduce      this
  cork into the lower end of the tube,                  with the phosphorus
  uppermost,      in which it will rife to the surface of the water ; so
  that the phosphorus         on the needles       will  come in contact with

 remain. The phosphorus will undergo allow andgradualcom-
bultion   :   by means of the thread the cork from time to time
may be drawn under the water to wash off the acid produced
 by the combustion, and, adhering to the phosphorus, to hasten
the. process.      When    all the oxygen gas is consumed,       and the
remaining phosphorus is no longer observed to sliine in the
dark, the cork must be drawn out ; and the observer must
note, at    a  corresponding height of die barometer and degree
of heat   with that of the atmosphere when the process com
menced, the quantity of azot remaining,                 and  how much

METHOD          OF  PROVING WHETHER COTTON BE ADUL
              TERATED       with woot,          or vice versa.
    You may        easily ascertain  whether cotton is mixed with
 wool,   by subjecting it to the action of the oxygenated mu
 riatic acid, which will render it white, at the same time that
 jt makes     the wool yellow.       Professor    Erugman,   of Lcyden,
 has by the fame means           been   able   to  determine with cer

 and what part the nerves ; and to discover the latter even at

               OXYGENATION          OF SNOW AND         RAIN.
     In our last      volume,    page    233,     we gave a paper by
 M. Hassenfratz       on the oxygenation of snow and rain, and
 their effects on vegetation. In that paper M. Hassenfratz
 divides the action of snow into parts.               1st, As preserving
 plants from the great cold of the atmosphere ; ad, as caus
 ing a greater number of seeds to expand by means of the

tie Prato                 has,   however*          lately    asserted      *, in      opposition to
M.        Hassenfratz, that snow is not oxygenated                              :    ist, because fish
which lived                very well        in common water, did not live in                       recent
snow water, but died in                       a   short time:          2d, because snowwater
exposed to the action                       of light did not           suffer oxygen gas to be
disengaged.                    He   ascribes therefore            the sudden death             of    fish,
and the non-production                            of oxygen by light,                to the want         of
that substance in snow water.                               M. Hassenfratz             has observed,
in       answer to these objections,                        that animals may die either
through the want or by an excess of oxygen,                                     as    well    as   by the
want or an excess                    of nourishment,              and that          a mean     propor
tion of both are necessary for the preservation                                          of life     and
health          :    that all oxygenated                substances do not disengage their
oxygen on being exposed to the light; and that when it is dis
engaged, they suffer only the excess to escape — another portion
remains which cannot be taken from them by that agent.                                               Dr.
Carradori,"                 fays    M. Hassenfratz,           "   does not deny the results
of the experiments                      I   have announced ; he only thinks they
are not conclusive, because fish do not                                   live in recent snow
water."                   He   therefore     promises,       as soon as             he can procure
snow water, to repeat                        Dr. Carradori's experiments;                      to vary
them, and make new ones, in order to prove in the most
positive manner the existence                         of oxygen in snow,                 and to de
termine the causes of the                          phenomena which seem                      to belong

  We are informed by ProfessorBeckmann, that the Chamber

which took place at Whitelaw,      the parish of Ednam,
                                                      in
Berwickshire,       on the            3d   instant,   is   copied       from the Kelso
Mail :—
     "   The weather through     the day had been calm, with soft
showers.      At   seven o'clock in the evening there was observed
by many people,          a   little to the south-welt of            Mr. Tod's         house
at   Whitelaw,     a   dense light-coloured                cloud   of   a   very uncom
mon appearance.              It   resembled         an inverted         cone,     reaching
from the ground to           a    considerable        height in     the atmosphere.
Its motion towards           the house was flow and majestic;                     a   person
of no     great agility,         on seeing approach, could easily have
                                               it
escaped from it.       It    began at length to whirl round with great
rapidity, accompanied                 by
                          loud rattling noise.
                                       a                                    The   effect    of
its amazing power was first exhibited upon                          a    large    stack     of
straw in the barn-yard, which                 it   raised in one mass to          a   consi
derable height      in
                 the air.  A beam of timber, lying flat on
the ground, was hurled from its place several feet; and will                          it
be thought almost to exceed credibility when                        it

together in mounds,                as     if by   a   flood.     The farm           offices were
materially injured ; some of them, indeed,                                 were almost          en
tirely stript      of their      tiles.      Human        strength was mere weak
ness when opposed                 to this war           of     the elements.               A   stout
young fellow, who had witnessed the scene in the barn-yard,
from an apprehension that the house must necessarily be tum
bled down, ran out for safety.                         The     resistless     enemy,           how-
ever,   lifted him over a wall five feet high, and carried him
forwards 30 or 40 yards ! Several of the servants were forcibly
driven about, some in one direction and some in another,
according to the eddy.                    The     horses and cattle upon the farm
exhibited the liveliest symptoms of alarm and agitation. The
dwrellinsc-house at Whitelaw, in which the familv resided at
the time, stiook with such violence                            as     to threaten its own
destruction and theirs.                    Providentially,           however, amidst alt
the devastation,             no person was materially hurt                      ;    and, what
Tenders       this the more remarkable                         is?   that the tiles which
were torn from the surrounding offices fell from an immense
height,       in   vast numbers,            among the people exposed to the
storm.        Before the cloud reached the farm-house                               it    had for
tunately divided, and the two parts                            taking different direc

east,   owing,         it   is   supposed,        to the violent concussion                 of the
clouds, there was such               a     torrent of rain, and, in some places,

Residence at Athens,       arid had availed    himself of all the ad
vantages which might be derived from visiting the architec
tural remains in that part of the            east.   His collection of
drawings, which were made during his oriental progress, are
Universally known to all the lovers of art and admirers of
clastic antiquity.
    His principal work       is the   New Church      at Southampton,
which    possesses great merit as it is ; and would have been &
very distinguished      monument of his talents, if his original
design   had    been completed;        but he was curbed and con
 trolled in  its progress by his employers, the mayor and            al
dermen of that borough.
    His plans for    Wet docks on the Thames,          which   were  of
 fered to the consideration      of Parliament,    display a very com
 prehensive   knowledge of the various branches of his profes
 sion connected     with such an undertaking.           We  have heard
 that he first suggested the conversion of the Isle of Dogs to
 that use to which there is an appearance that it will now be
 applied.    These plans he sometimes          thought of publisliing,
 with large explanations and technical accounts of every partj
 but we know not how far he had proceeded, or whether he
 had proceeded at all, in fulfilling such an intention.
    He  was once      tantalized with the flattering expectation of
 being employed at Bath in erecting a suite of buildings for
 & new arrangement of the public            baths in that city.      He
 accordingly made designs of great beauty and elegance,              re
 plete with convenience, full of rare contrivance, and dis
 posed in an original style of accommodation.             But this hope
 passed away, as     Mr. Revely's     hopes were very apt to do.     He
 was also the Editor of the posthumous volume of Stuart's
 Antiquities    of Greece,     and was peculiarly qualified,     by his
 local and professional knowledge, for that office.
    He  had been     a  pupil of Sir William Chambers, and, with
 all the subsequent advantages derived from travel and resi
 dence in Italy and Greece,         it might have been supposed that
 he had   a very   fair prospect   of success in his profession.    But
                                         6                       Revely

ttt                                         Death.
Revely had an awkward way of letting loose his real opi*
nions, and had habituated himself to an undisguised delivers
of them. It need not be added, that such qualities were not
calculated to render him popular, and that they influenced
many who were disposed to employ him to seek architects of
more pliant and accommodating dispositions.
     He   entertained              high opinion of the profession of art
                                 a very
architect    ;       but it did not check his industry by any superc-U
lious affectation of importance, for he sought                                 employment,
wherever         a   liberal spirit would permit him to                       seek   it.       This
activity, however, appears from some untoward circumstance
or other to have been continually baffled.                                 He once         made a
journey to Canterbury,                    with   a set       of admirable      designs for a
county infirmary,                in consequence              of    an advertisement            front
the corporation of that city, which invited architects to                                      make"
proposals        for the erection of such an edifice.                             His      designs
were approved               and admired ; but after                     some consideration^
the committee appointed to conduct the business proposed
to purchase the drawings, and trust the execution of them
to a country builder in order to save the expence of an ar
chitect.   Mr. Revely, mortified at this treatment of his pro
fessional character,               rather warmly,             but very innocently ob
served, that to commit a work                    of   such consequence               to    a   com
mon carpenter, when an architect was at hand, would be as
injudicious          as   if    any one, in      a cafe           of   great danger, should
apply to an apothecary when he could consult                                    a    physician.
Now, it      most unfortunately happened                               that the chairman          of
the committee was an apothecary                          ;    and      Mr. Revely     was asto
nished to find himself and his designs                                 very unceremoniously
dismissed,           to make room for a builder who probably was not
qualified to suggest such frivolous distinctions.
     We cannot conclude without giving this accomplished ar
chitect the best praise that can be bestowed.                                He     was a man
of   strict integrity in all his dealings;                         and the little eccentri
cities of his character had no tendency                                 to weaken     the main
supporters           of   it.

    trt Vol.  III.  p. 335, we announced the death of the cele
brated French astronomer              Borda on the aoth of February
last in the 64th year         of his   age.    Since that period we have
been     able  to collect a few more particulars respecting               the
service rendered by him to the sciences, which                 will no doubt
afford satisfaction     to many        of our   readers.    Charles Borda,
formerly Chevalier de Borda,               was a Chef d'Ffcadre in the
Royal Navy       under   the     old  French    government.       He distin-
guislied himself early          as an able    mathematician,       and many
 proofs of his talents in this respect may be found in the nu
merous and excellent papers which he publistied in the Me
moirs of the Academy of Sciences.                  He wrote on different
 objects of hydraulics        ;  on the resistance    of fluids ; on water-
 wheels and pumps         ;     on the throwing        of bombs ; on the
method of determining               curved   lines ;  on the properties     of
 maxima and minima          ;   on the best method of choosing by lot.
 In the year 1771 and 1772 he undertook a voyage, by com
 mand of the king, with Verdun de la Crenne and Pingre,
 in  the Flora frigate,      in which he had the rank of Lieutenant
 de Vaifsau, to various parts         of Europe, Africa,      and   America,
 for the improvement of geography and navigation,                      and  in
 Order to try various nautical             instruments and time-pieces.
 These three navigators afterwards published, in concert, the
 result  of their  observations,      in two volumes quarto, under the
 title of Voyage    fait far       Ordre du Roi      en 1 77 1 et 1772,   &c.
 in which Borda's share was not the least considerable.                    An
 account of the result of this expedition may be found                 also in
 the Memoirs of the Academy of Paris for the year 1773.
 The public are indebted to him likewise for the best chart
 of the Canary Islands, which served as a pattern for the va
  luable chart of these islands published in Spain in 1788.
     In the year 1787 he published his valuable Description                  et
   Usage du Circle de Reflexion,           in which     he revived    the re
  flecting circle proposed by Tobias Meyer in 1756.                   He was
  the founder of the first school for Nautical Architecture in
  France, and drew up           a plan of the mode of education to be
                                                                    employed

 emploved in it.             He introduced alib an uniformitv in               ship

 which is (bunded on true mathematical principles,                           is un
 doubtedly superior to that employed by other maritime na
 tions   :  it is the    most convenient and advantageous                for quick
 filling,     as lias b**en      acknowledged even bv some            of the     best
 officers in the British Navy.                He brought into use Meyer's
old method of measuring terrestrial angles, which had been
 totally neglected ; employed it in astronomical observations,
 and invented a circle on             a  new construction with moveable
 telescopes,       which was         used  in  the new measurement-              He
 was the inventor            of the new instruments »ith which                  that
 measurement           was made, and of which                some account        has
 been given in the first Yolume, p. 269,               of this Magazine. He
had the greatest share in the late                   reform of weights and
 measures introduced             in France; and caused to be printed, at
 his own expence,             tables of signs according to the decimal
system.         In  the year 1792 he determined, with an accuracy
never before attained, the length                 of   a pendulum        swinging
seconds, at Paris.             In  the year 1797      he stood      on the lilt of
 candidates       for the directorship.
    The following           anecdote    is related    of him when         a young
man    : — Having          presented    himself before Camus,           who    exa
mined the students in the Artillery School,                       as a candidate
for admittance into the Royal Artillery, he was rejected on
the score of incapacity.              It was not long, however, before
he was a colleague in the Academy of Sciences with his
former examiner, who had entertained                      such a false opinion
respecting       him.       Borda,     however, either through           a love   of
truth,     or respect for his quondam judge,                  who was now hi*
fellow-member, always contradicted this anecdote,- and called
it  an idle rumour.

f.   Observations    on tbe Property      ascribed to    Oil, of calming       the
             Waves oftbe Sea.          By I. F.     W.    Otto *.
 A,lN      idea was entertairied,       in the    earliest ages,    that there
 Were means        capable     of calming       the waves      of  the restless
 ocean, and of      rendering its surface tranquil and even.               Aris
 totle says, that every body thrown into the sea when agi
 tated, such as anchors, 8cc. tends to lessen the waves; be
 cause a kind    of   eddy is thereby created, which exerts itself              in
 a direction    contrary to their movement,                and consequently
 weakens them.          Plutarch    f  and    Pliny  \  ascribe    this power
 to oil ;  as they   assert   that it  possesses a   property by which it
 restrains the restless movement            of water, renders its        surface
even,     and thereby causes the        rays of the fun, which           are re
fracted through        the waves     in different directions,         to pass to
the bottom free and uninterrupted.                What    the ancients have
said on this subject         is exceedingly vague and obscure.                  It

                   Olservatitms      on the  Property of Oil
does not appear clearly From their information,                      whether the
divers,    to whose testimony they refer,               made      their observa
tions at the surface of the water, or at any depth. Besides,
we are not able to ascertain whether they looked through
the oil    as   through     a window,      or as through a magnifying
glass  : for   if a drop of limpid     oil be let fall upon water, it will
form a very simple kind of microscope,                  ,and magnify objects
placed     at a convenient depth            below the water.              Plutarch
seems to believe,         that the oil spouted from the mouth of the
diver formed, in ascending, a kind of canal, which facili
tated the passage       of the light through the water *.
    Of this property of oil, apparently so wonderful, many
testimonies were afterwards produced ; and it was even con
secrated by superstition        for this purpose.            Thus    we are told,
among the miracles of St. Cuthbert,                     that he gave      a priest,
for  a sea voyage,       some consecrated       oil, by which he was en
abled to allay the fury         of  the waves during a dreadful             storm.
Erasmus was acquainted with this property                    f ;  and at present
it is not unknown          among seamen, particularly in Hollands
    Not many        years ago,     but before      the celebrated        Franklin
communicated to the public his observations                      on this subject,
ihe following         article appeared       in the Annual Register: —
 "   At  the late fire in Thames-street it was observed that the
oil, which,        to prevent the farther spreading             of  the sire,   had
been thrown         into the river, visibly calmed the violent agi
tation of the water. This property of oil," fays another
paragraph,
                  " appears    to have been long known.                  It  is or
dered,    by an old marine law,              that when goods,             during a
storm, must be thrown overboard,                  if any part of       the lading
consists   of oil, it  shall be the first article thrown into the sea."
In    modern times we have             a  number of experiments which
seem to leave no doubt respecting              this circumstance.            I (hall

here give an account         of the most striking       of them, without
any fear   of being thought       too circumstantial, as experiments
of this kind    should all be decisive.
    The inhabitants of       the Bermudas employ oil          in their fish
eries, in order to render the water of the            sea clear and trans
parent;     and the Portuguese           sailors, when they find the
waves    too   violent on their entering the Tagus, pour a few
flasks of oil into the water, by which means it is rendered
calm, and their entrance becomes easy. The divers in the
Mediterranean, when they labour under water, and when
the fun-beams         are prevented      from penetrating to them by
small   waves,     are accustomed      to spurt a little oil from their
mouths.       One Gilfred Lawson, who resided several years at
Gibraltar, relates, that the seamen of that place were accus
tomed *o pour a little oil into the sea,        in order that they might
thereby be enabled to distinguish the oysters at the bottom ;
and that the fame practice was followed on the whole Spa
nish coast. The same thing is done on the coast of Provence,
and also by the inhabitants         of  the Hebrides.      The Ragusans,
with    the like view,       are accustomed       to sprinkle oil over the
water with     a brush ; and they give to the         drops, under which
the water becomes transparent, the name of windows.                     Tys
Tiremann,       a  Dutch mariner,        made    an experiment      of this
kind during a storm, after he had lost his rudder and some
of his fails, and, with six half ankers of oil, calmed the fury
of  the waves.       A   lieutenant of the name of May observed
in   1735,   during    a storm,    that the   sea was    calm and smooth
 around two ssiips laden with casks of oil, some of which were
 leaky; and an experienced seaman, named Bewerwyk, re
 commends, for securing boats which might be sent to the
 assistance  of   ships in distress,    to throw into the sea, oil and
other fat substances, and even beer.             In  a  description of the
shipwreck of a vessel called the Anna Cornelia, this property
of oil is also celebrated; and some experiments made at
 Portsmouth, in the time of         a  storm, were attended with the
 best success.      In   the year 1736        Detouches de la Frenaye
                                     Qa                                  saw

028                Observations        on the  Property of Oil
saw an old sailor, by this method, save a ship                   which    was o«
the point of foundering.                 One Day was indebted for his
own safety, and that of his {hip, to half                a  ton of oil.      Lin
næus* learned from Gronovius, that the Dutch captains who
frequented       Greenland,          and  who were reproached          with con
cealing this property of oil, always carried some casks of it
with them when they went to the whale-fishery. The fisher
men of the Texel carry oil with them for the like purpose.
There is an instance of a herring-buss being                  saved   by pouring
out oil    ;  while another, at the distance of two or three hun
 dred    fathoms,       went to the bottom.              Not only oil, under
which       is to be understood           fat  oil, such as olive oil, oil of
 rape-feed, and linseed oil, may be employed for this pur
 pose ;    but    also    fat    animal    fluids,   such    as  train-oil, &c.
 Ethereal oils do not             possess   the fame property       :  a ship, for
 example, laden with oil of turpentine, which should employ
 it with the like view, would certainly fail in its end. This
 oil, however, diffuses itself very speedily over the surface of
 the water     ;  but the covering it forms is             so thin that it is fe*
 parated by the smallest external              force.
     At Yarmouth the             sailors are unanimously        of opinion, that
 sat substances       thrown        into the    sea  prevent the agitation of
 the waves.          Pennants mentions an observation                  made re
  specting     seals by the fishermen            in Scotland.       When      these
  animals eat any fat fish, the              sea   in their neighbourhood is
  uncommonly          still  ;  a circumstance       which induces them to
  search for them         in   such places.       Sir John Pringle learned in
  Scotland, that the sisliermcn could discover at                a great distance
  places     much frequented by herrings,               as  the  sea, by the oily-
  fatness which these fish emit,               has no apparent        movement.
  It  is observed at Rhode Island, that the water                 in the harbour
  of Newport        is always calm and still as long as the Greenland
   (hips remain there at anchor.                The   cause   of this is  ascribed

to the sea-nettle,      a kind of vegetable sea-worms from oily
substances,   which are thrown together in the hold                  of the
ships,  and   the oil that oozes through between              the  staves of
the casks, which,       of  course, is pumped out with the bilge
water. Seamen have also observed, that the motion of a ship,
the bottom of which has been newly payed, occasions much
less agitation in the water than that of another which has
not been daubed        o,ver   with tar for     a long time.       Such in
stances,  of which    several more equally decisive might be pro
duced, are sufficient to authorise this         use  of oil, in opposition
to those who pretend        that it can be employed only in ponds
and other pieces     of water of small circumference, whe.re, by
diffusing itself over a mass of water not mush swelled, up, it
can easily produce a tranquil surface.
    These facts seem to have been unknown to Dr. Franklin
 until he had an opportunity          of making similar        observations
 himself.    On his      passage    from England       to America some
 person told him that he had thrown into a lake a vessel con
 taining oil in which flies had been drowned; that the flies,
 which were apparently dead, began in an instant to move,
 and went round with          a  circular motion on the surface of
the water.      Dr. Franklin       ascribed    this movement to         a re
pulsive power maintained by the            oil, which gradually        issued
 from the spongy bodies        of  the flies.    In the year 1757, being
 at sea in the middle      of  a fleet consisting    of ninety    ships des
 tined for Louisburg,       he  obsired that      the movement        of the
 water was in one part of the fleet calm and uniform, while
 the wjater between the other fliips was thrown into great agi
 tation by the wind.         As he could not at that time discover
 the cause of this phenomenon, he asked the captain of one
 of the   ships,  who replied, that the cook had, no doubt,
 thrown out the greasy water, which must have rendered the
 sides of the (hip oily.
    Franklin now       paid   more particular attention to this cir
 cumstance;      aud as he found that a drop          of oil  diffused itself

speedily over a large space                   of water,       so   that it formed           a   thm
covering to         it,
              which reflected prismatic colours, he resolved
to make some farther experiments   and though they did not
                                                        ;
all succeed according to his wish, he declared                                  himself con
vinced of the truth of the phenomenon.
   One of these experiments must here mention; for, though
                                              I
it does not appear ver)' favourable to his ideas respecting the
efficacy of oil           in
                 calming the waves,      at any rate shews that
                                                              it
oil has     a   great influence on the motion                       of water.        He     disco
vered that oil excites on the water                         a   kind of waves,              under
circumstances when neither water alone                                  nor oil could pro
duce the like.                 lie   suspended      a   glass      half   filled with water,
and     having made             it   to swing backwards and forwards, after
the manner of             a    pendulum,          the water remained                 at perfect
rest.     The     cafe was           the fame when the glass was                      half      filled
with oil    ;    but      as soon as he had poured                   oil upon the water,
and continued the swinging of the glass, the surface of the
vibrating        oil remained            smooth      and        even,      while the water'
below     it    was thrown into             a   regular agitation like that of the
billows of       '.he sea,
     Franklin       considers         this phenomenon,                which     I    have con
firmed      by   experiments, to have in                 it   something singular, and
difficult       to be explained.               The cause of               it,
                                                                   however, may
perhaps lie         in    the difference         of the specific gravities of these
two fluids,          by    which they          are susceptible of the impulse to
movement in different degrees;                          and     by   the effort which the
oil makes, on account of                      its lightness, to occupy the upper
place on the surface, the water                     is   violently agitated.
     Whpn       a   drop of oil        is   poured upon water in                a   state   of rest,
as for example             in   a    bason,    a   sine vapour immediately arises
and covers the surface of the water.                            It   emits coloured ravs,
and disperses small bits of paper thrown upon the spreading
drops. When the space on which the drop falls       small,                           is             it
does not spread itself; but seems, as  were, to be attracted  it
towards its centre.                   When      a   bit of paper,           twisted together
                                                                                                    in

                            to calm the          Waves        of the    Sea.                       231
in    a    conical form,          and soaked in               oil,    is thrown into water,
the fluid which issues                 from it causes it to turn round with a
rotary motion on its centre.
      In    an experiment which                   Franklin           made on a small lake,
the surface of which was raised into large waves by the wind,
the oil spread itself with great velocity, but rt did not mo
derate the waves.                The       reason       of this was, that he poured-
•ut the oil at the leeward                       fide    of the lake. He therefore
went to the windward side, where the waves originated ; and
there a small quantity                of oil produced, in                  the space     of several
square rods,           a calm,        which gradually extended farther until
it   reached the other end                  of   the lake       ;    and this whole part            of
it,    for the e-xteitf of half an acre, soon became                                 as smooth      as
ice.
     Of the various explanations given of this phenomenon,
the following          appears to be the most natural,  not altoge               if
ther satisfactory           :—The air and water have an affinity for
each       other, and they unite                   in   a     mechanical and chemical
manner when they come in contact.                                     It   is   well known that
air always exists in water;                      that the latter can be freed from
it   under the receiver               of    an    air-pump;             and that, when the
water       is again exposed to the air,                      it     absorbs     a   like quantity
of it.        When mass of air presses, therefore,
                        a                                                         on the surface
of   a    body of water,         it   combines itself in part; with                          it,   and
forces      it   along with it.            Now,      if     oil be poured upon water,
the particles of the former attract each other with too great
force to admit of their uniting with the water or the air.
By tho covering which                   the oil forms on the surface                         of the
water, the latter           is   prevented from coming into contact with
the air     ;    and the wind          is   conveyed           over     its surface,        without
being able to force its way into                        it,   and to raise        it   into waves.
     The      spreading      of oil in water            is     ascribed         by   Dr. Franklin
to   a    repulsive     power which               they both exercise against each
other; but        it   is   very evident that this explanation                         is   far from
being satisfactory.               Even      if    such        a     power actually existed,
and      if   the particles        of      the    oil   exercised          a    repulsive     power

against the water, and an attractive                    power among themselves,
they would be prevented from spreading, in an uniform man
ner, over the surface of the water : they would rather form,
insulated globules ; and,               as    they      touch the water, would
equally recede,           and proceed towards the bank or any other
solid body.           Oil, therefore,        as   it is lighter than water, must
float on its surface when poured upon                        it,   and, according to
the laws of hydrostatics, endeavour                       to extend itself        in   a
                                                                                       la
teral direction       ;   and on account           of   the strong adhesion            of its
particles, must           form an extraordinary fine and continued
stratum on the surface             of the water.             This diffusion, how
ever, supposes that the surface                    of    the water       is   horizontal   :
it   therefore    seems to follow,           that the whole power               of the    oi}
consists     in preventing the formation of new waves in the
places      on which     has been poured
                           it            but that cannot be
                                                         ;                it
in   a    condition       to disperse those            which      have    been     already
formed.          The billowy agitation of water                    supposes that some
part of     its surface hag been previously raised.                      Bodies which
float upon       it   oppose this rising          by   their gravity, consequently
the billowy movement, and in part destroy it.
     It   appears therefore, to some philosophers,                       that this celer
brated property           of oil   does not consist          so   much in its fluidity
and toughness,            as in its being          a    lighter body than water.
From this        it   would follow, that all bodies lighter than water,
and at the fame time more distended,                       such as drops or masses
formed       by   oil,                             in higher
                         must produce the fame effect, but                        a
degree.    Achard recommends   for this purpose close leathern
vessels, through which the water cannot penetrate     or, what                j
would be still better, tin-plate boxes of from six to eight feet
content in the           base and    two feet in height,              which       must     be
filled with air, but rendered impenetrable to water. Ships,
he thinks, without much increasing their lading, might                                    al
ways carry with them some dozens of these vessels or boxes,
to be thrown overboard, fastened to the ship with ropes, in
cafe the agitation of the water should threaten danger. Achard
made experiments, on                a   small scale, with tin-plate boxes                  of

the influence of calcareous earth, upon                            the putrid effluvia in,
tb.e city of Lilbon, which        think,         is,
                                                   I               a   proof of the most
interesting nature.
     'f The city of Lisbon                  is   situated   on the northern bank of
the river Tagus, about eighteen miles from its mouth                                     :     it   is
about six miles in iength, and its breadth      some part*              is   in
two, in some three miles,                        although in other parts very nar
row.          In. the most inhabited part of the city there am seven
hilis or mountains, which, of course, occasion declivities and
lower situations.                 This city        may be divided            into the new
and old city             ;    because there      is
                                                 a      spot which was overthrown.
by    the horrible earthquake                     of   the year 1755, and               was re
built:        I     call, therefore, this part the new city.                      The        streets,
in this quarter are very regular, the buildings neat, and the
pavements   for foot passengers very commodious; but the
situation           is   almost all very low.
     "   The oki city, or           the part which did not suffer                  so   much        in
the earthquake, and preserves its ancient buildings,                                    is   in the
Gothic taste, with narrow and crooked streets,                               in   the most of
which there are no pavements                           for soot paflengers; the houses
are      so   high,          that, in some of the narrowest               streets,      the fun1
                                                                                         cannot

                      in the ConJlruBion    of Cities.                      233
cannot be      seen  but two or three hours every day, viz. from
eleven     before    noon to one after noon.              In the new city
there are gutters or sewers below the earth to conduct the
water and impurities from the houses and streets to the river j
but in the old city there are none of these.
     " As    the houses are, in general, five or more stories high,
and the streets narrow, it is        easy to conceive       the thickness      of
population, and, of course, the vast quantity of impurity that
comes into the streeU every day, which, with the water and
other liquids poured          in likewise,    keep always there a vast
quantity of dirt.        A  great sum    of money        is appropriated,       I
know,      and some panis taken,         to preserve the cleanliness           of
 the city    : but without entering into the discussion how this
 money is employed         or disposed of, which          is but very      little
 interesting to our present         inquiry,    it  is true that very often
 I   have been obliged to make a great             turn to go      a short   dis
 tance,    because it was       impossible   to cross the street through
 the dirt; and very often         I  have seen       dogs,    cats, and other
 dead animals, lie in the streets.
      " There    is in every house (chiefly in the new city) a privy,
 with    a canal   which goes up to the highest story; because, as
  the several stories are inhabited by different families, they
  want such     a  convenience in every one        :   but this canal emits
  always     a very bad smell,    by the accumulation of impurities
  within    its walls,   which, from     the form        of its construction,
  cannot be washed         but with water let in by a small orifice
  or hole.     There is also, in many houses,          a place    in the inside
  of   the street-door for making water,              which contributes its
  portion of      bad smell ;    and   the houses       are   in general      not
  very clean.
      "  Besides all these sources     of putrid exhalations,         there are
   a great many wharves, and much naked shore, which, being
   uncovered by the ebb-tide,         present    to the sun a surface co
   vered with dirt and sea-weeds         undergoing putrid fermenta
   tion.     The mouths of     the sewers   I  have mentioned above go
   to the wharves, and are likewise bare at low water. The fluid
                                   ?                                     which

1^6              Utility of employing            Calcareous       SuhflaneeS;
which         comes    from these sewers contains                   so    many infecting
'platters,      that its strong, putrid smell can icircely be endured.
     " After      this short description           of   the police         of Lisbon, in
regard to its cleanliness,         every body would draw the inference,
that endemical diseases must reign, not only in the summer^
but in the winter time, seeing that the accumulation of the
dirt in the       streets is incomparably greater                  in the winter             than.
in summer.             The connection             there is between malignant
distempers        and dirtiness        is very well known, and expressly
marked by Tissot {Avis au Peuple fur la Sanfi, chap. ii.
§ 7). Happily, Sir, the contrary is the fact : Lisbon is one
9s the most healthy situations I knpw, and its inhabitants do
not suffer but the comnwn               diseases        to which the human body
is subjected.            Many people go from England and other
countries to          Lisbon, in certain diseases, to enjoy the benefit
pf   a salubrious place,,         and very often to spend                        the summer
agreeably        in    a good and wholesome climate.
     'f-     What then can      be the cause         of this apparently                 physical:
contradiction           between        the impurity and corruption                       in the
 streets, and the salubrity             of   the air    ?    I   confess,        Sir,    I   can
not find any explanation of this phenomenon                                 if I   reject the
the theory of the influence of calcareoua earth upon septic
fluids, and I can. well comprehend the reason if I admit it.
     The buildings in Lisbon
      *.'.                                       are all    of stone, and,
                                                                      general,     in
 of marble of several qualities,                 and chiefly the marmor rafilis
 of Linnæus   and this stone
                  ;                          is    procured in            the,    neighbour
 hood of the city.  All the                   houses        are white-washed inside
 and outside       ;    and the handsomest               new-fashioned houses are
 plastered       with    a   plaster    they call escariola,              a   compound          of
 gypsum and other matters, and painted over that composi
 tion in water-colours.                As number of new buildings are
                                             a
 condnually erecting,             there are, in all the streets, a great
 many stone-cutters             hewing        the stones,          and their fragments,
 are scattered through the streets.                      In the time of the earth
 quakes, as the houses fall down,                       the attrition         of   the stones,
 *ne against the other, breaks, them                       in   pieces,    reducing many
                                                                                                   to

                          in the ConJlruSlion     of Cities.                 Strt
to   a powde>.           The    pavements     for the foot passengers are of
large marbles          ;  afid,   in   many parts, the foil is calcareous
too: in other             parts,    as  the streets are paved with small
round stones or pebbles, the accumulation of the calcareous
powder makes a stratum above, the surface                   >6f  the streets and
 public places.           When      the wind blows hard, there is so        graft
 a quantity       of calcareous powder flying about that it is in
 commodious to the eyes, and sometimes is so fine that it
 comes into the houses even when the windows and fashes
 are fliut up.
     "Now,         to what can        I impute the healthiness      of that city
 but the quality of its calcareous earth             ? which neutralizes the
putrid      exhalations,         or septic acid, which impregnates the
atmosphere, and thus prevents its bad attd fatal effects, pre
 serving that city, which               otherwise would be the fountain        of
 pestilence,      and the anti-chamber of death.
    *' As no other cause can be
                                             discovered of the "healthiness of
 Lisbon, amongst its continual putrid infection, recourse may
 be had to the climate,               and  to the temperature      of the atmo
 sphere   :    but   I   believe it can be sufficiently proved,          that the'
 cause is the influence             of the calcareous   earth, and not of the
 climate     ;   because,      if this  salubrity was owing to the climate
 all the neighbourhood of Lisbon, which enjoys the fame cli
 mate, would enjoy the fame healthiness : but this is not the
 tafe.     On     the opposite bank         of the Tagus,     over against Lifr
 bon,    there are three or four villages, called Almada,
                                                                           Capa-
 rica, and Cassilhas,            situated on small     hills,   and surrounded1
 by beautiful farms:               the buildings there are in general of
 siliceous stones,           the soil is sandy and in some parts
                                                                          clayey,
 and the        streets    in these villages infinitely cleaner than irt
 Lisbon     ;    but intermittent and remittent fevers prevail in
 these villages and their neighbourhoods almost
                                                                     every sum
 mer, while in the mean time Lisbon is perfectly free. Nfeaf
 the other part of the river, in the neighbourhood of Lisbon,
 on the shore of the ocean, there are other small
                                                                     villages, at
  Cintra and Collares, from whose neighbourhoods the stone
                                                                                as

 $3$>             Communication     from Dr.     Mit chill.
  of the Lisbon buildings         comes,     and the soil is in a greafc
 part calcareous.        These places are pointed out        as the feat    of
 health,   and, indeed, are the most beautiful and pleasant
 summer retreats you can imagine.
    "  After this    statement,   can any body attribute the salubrity
 of Lisbon    to its climate merely      ?   Certainly    not  :   because   I
 observe,   that where there is calcareous earth there is no in
 fection,   notwithstanding       the continual     existence      of putrid
 exhalations   ;   and where there      is not calcareous        earth, and
 the soil is sandy, gravelly, and clayey, there are fevers, al
 though the climate is the fame ; the distance of these places
 being only the breadth of the river, about three miles.
    " To  these unanswerable facts         I must add, that      I have ob
served, two or three times, in Lisbon,              dead animals upon
the   ruins of houses,        and of course surrounded         with    calca
reous earth,     in  a state of desiccation;    and, at the fame time,
two or three fathoms distant, another animal dead too, and
lying upon another kind of soil, in a state of complete pu
trefaction.      The reason of their preservation is obvious : the
septic acid    was absorbed by the calcareous          earth     as  soon a*
it was formed by the union of septon with oxygene j like
wise, the oil formed by the union of their hydrogene with
carbone has been imbibed,           the water formed         by the junc
tion with oxygene evaporated,            and   the  remaining parts         of
the animal were left in        a dry state.
    " The effects     of calcareous  earth and alkalis seem to be very
well understood        by the people of Portugal       :   they put chalk
and plaster with the bodies they bury in the churches ; and
they wash with plaster the rooms where there have been any
sick  or contagious disorders.          This precaution         they   never
omit. — I   pray you to accept my best wishes.           -

 M,   -R.    BROWN         arrived    in Egypt on the loth of January
 1792, after a passage       of twenty-six   days.    Some information
 which    he obtained in Alexandria having induced him to at
 tempt exploring the vestiges of the temple of Jupiter Am-
 nion, he procured an interpreter, and made the necessary ar
 rangements for the conveyance of his baggage and provi
 sions,   with some Arabs, who are employed in transporting
 through the desert dates and other articles between Siwa and
 Alexandria.        In this   business he was much assisted by           Mr:
 Baldwin, who readily           entered into his views, and did every
 thing in his power to promote their success.
    On the 24th of February Mr. Brown, accompanied by the
 Arabs, left Alexandria, and travelled the first day only about
 eight miles.        From that period till the 4th of March their
 route lay along the coast, and they were never long out of
 li^ht of the sea.        The soil was generally smooth and sandy,
 and the vegetation was very inconsiderable ; the greater part
  Consisting    of different kinds of glass-wort or halt, which^
  however, afforded       a seasonable relief to the suffering         camel*
  For their    horses they were obliged to carry a constant supply
  of barley     and    chopped      straw.  There are several kinds of
  preserved meat prepared           among the orientals        for long jour-
  nies.     They obviate      the inconveniency      of   salt provision by
  using clarified butter.        The kind    most used is called       mijhli,
  and will keep good for many years.                 It  is brought from
  western Barbary to Kahira (Cairo).
     On Sunday         the 4th,      having travelled    about six hoursj
  they arrived at     a  well where they found        a  copious supply of
  water   ;  and, having        resrest.ed their camels,        they left the
  coast, and proceeded in a south-west          direction.        From Alex

five hours and a half.        As they    had   little hope of finding
any more water between that and Siwa, they were obliged
to use all possible diligence on the route,             so that they ar
rived there on Friday the 9th at eight in the evening.
    Siwa, which answers the description given of the Oazes,
is a small spot surrounded on all fides by desert land.              It was
about half an hour from the time           of their entrance on this
territory, by a path bordered with date-trees, that they ar
rived at the town which gives name to the district.                   They
dismounted, and       seated   themselves,   as is usual    for strangers
in that country, on        a misjed,  or place employed for prayer*
adjoining to the tomb        of  a Marabut, or holy person. In a
short time the chiefs came to congratulate them on their
arrival, after which they conducted them to an apartment,
not indeed very commodious,           but the best they were pro
vided with ; and, after a short interval, a large dish              of rice
and some boiled meat were brought in, the scbechs                  attend*
ing while the company was served, which consisted of Mr.
Brown's interpreter, his conductor, two other Bedouins,
their companions, and himself.
    It being discovered that     Mr. Brown, though in the Turkish
dress, was a Christian,        he experienced    some bad       treatment
from the populace, and was obliged to confine himself to
his apartment for two or three days.             On the fourth, how
ever,   he was allowed to walk          abroad    and to observe what
was remarkable in the place.             Having walked about two
miles he arrived    at what they called the Ruins, or Birbt; and
was surprised at    finding himself near a building of undoubted
antiquity,   and, though small, in every view worthy                of no
tice.    It was  a single   apartment built     of   massy   stone of the
fame kind as those       of which the pyramids         consist,   arid co
vered originally    with    six large and solid      blocks that reach
from one wall to the other.            The length he found thirty-
two feet in the clear, the height about eighteen, the width
fifteen.    A gate,    situated at one extremity,       forms the prin
cipal entrance;      and    two doors also, near that extremity,
                                                                      opsn

                             through          Egjft      and Syria.                                J4.fr
*pen opposite to each other.                        The other           end        is quite ruin
ous; but, judging from circumstances, it may   be imagined
that the building has never been much larger than it now is.
There is no appearance of any other edifice having been at
tached to     it;     and the less so,              as    there are remains               of   sculp
ture on the exterior walls.                     In^   the interior,              there are three
rows of emblematical figures,                         apparently designed to repre
sent a procession        ;    and the space between                     them        is silled with
hieroglyphic characters    properlv                           callci.
                                              The soffit is also
                                                         so
adorned      in the same manner, but one of the stones which
formed      it is fallen within           :    the other five remain entire. The
sculpture     is sufficiently distinguishable;                     and even the colours
in some places remain. Ft was mentioned to Mr. Brown, that
there were many other ruins near; but after walking for some
time where they were described to be, and observing that rough
stones,     apparently detached from the rock, were pointed out
to him as ruins,             he returned fatigued                and dissatisfied.                 The
fchechs had prepared                for them a dinner in                     a   garden, where
they were unmolested by intruders ; and the fun being then
near the meridian, Mr. Brown took the opportunity of ob
serving     its altitude by means                   of   an artificial horizon.                    The
result was not materially different,                          though in the sequel he
repeated      his observation             :    it gave        N. L. 29/           12' and a frac

     Mr. Brown having found                     a   monument            so       evidently Egyp
tian in this remote quarter, entertained                          greater hope            of   meet
ing with something more considerable                               by going farther,                or
of being able to gain some information                             from the natives,                 or
the Arabs, that would               six   exactly the position of the remains,
if   any such there           were, of the far-famed temple of Jupiter
Ammon.          He     therefore          applied to three          of       the fchechs who
had stiewn themselves               most friendly towards him and his at
tendants, and having enquired whether they knew of any
ruins farther to the westward                       or south-west, one of them re
plied that      there        was    a place (Arajchie)                  where there             were
ruins,     but that it was impossible                     to approach              it,   as   it   was

*4*           -An Account os Mr.           Brown's Travels
surrounded    by water, and there were no boats.                Mr. Brown
soon found,from the description, that Arafcbie wasnot theOasis
of Ammon j but, conceiving it something gained to pass far
ther west, he determined to proceed thither.                  For this pur
pose  it was  necessary     to   use  all possible secrecy, as the Siwcse
were bent on opposing his farther progress.                  An   agreement
was therefore     made      with two       persons   of  the poorer class  of
the natives,    for a sew    zechins, that they should conduct him
and his attendants      to   Arascbi;,     and that,   if what  they sought
for was not there, they sliould proceed with them to the first
watering place that they knew of directly to the southward.
The remainder of       the time he stayed at Siwa was employed
in combating the difficulties raised about his departure ; and
it was not till Monday, the 1 2th of March, that he was en
abled to commence his journey west.
   The   Oasis, which contains the town              of Siwa,   is about six
miles long,     and four and a        half or   five wide.    A   large pro
portion of this space is silled with date-trees; but there are
also pomegranates,        figs and olives, apricots and plantains ;
and   the gardens     are remarkably flourishing.              The inhabi
tants cultivate a considerable          quantity    of rice, which, how
ever, is of  a reddish hue, and different from that            of the Delta.
The remainder of      the cultivable land furnisties         wheat enough
for the  consumption of           the  inhabitants.       Water, both    salt
and fresh, abounds      ;   but the springs which furnisli the latter
are most   of them    tepid    ;   and such is the nature       of  the wa
ter, air, and other circumstances, that strangers are often
affected  with    agues and         malignant      fevers.   One of those
springs, which rises near the building before described, is
observed by the natives to be sometimes cold and sometimes
warm.     After the rains the ground in the neighbourhood of
Siwa is covered with salt for many weeks.
   Mr. Brown, having left his temporary residence,                proceeded,
himself and interpreter on horseback, his original conductor
 on foot, and the two men he had hired each on an ass ; but
 he had not gone far before one of the latter told him that it
                                                                       would

                           through    Egjp! and Syria.                         243
  would be necessary to return,              as the people     of the town were
  in pursuit of them,         and     would not permit them to go and
  disinter the treasures of Araschie.               They nevertheless conti
  nued their journey for two days, and at the end of that time
  arrived at the place described to them.                  It was not far from
  the plain of Gegabib.             Mr. Brown here found an island in
  the middle of       a small      lake   of   salt water,     which contained
  mis-shapen rocks in abundance, but nothing that he could
 positively decide to be ruins; nor was it very likely that any
 such should be found there,              the spot being entirely destitute
 of trees  and fresh water.           Mr. Brown, however,            had the cu
 riosity to approach        nearer to these imaginary ruins,              and ac
 cordingly forced his horse into the lake.                     The   horse, from
 fatigue   and    weakness,         or original inability to swim, soon
 found himself entangled, and could not keep his head above
 water.     Mr. Brown          fell with him,        and was unable to de
 tach himself;       and when he at length found                himself on dry
 ground, the circumstances he was under prevented him from
 making any farther observation                on this island and lake.
    After visiting this place, Mr. Brown                   and    his attendants
 continued     their journey south             according to the agreement
 made with the guides, but sound the pursuit equally fruitless.
 At   the end   of   the third day,        having arrived       in lat. 28" 40',
 or nearly   so,    they    became       much     distressed   for water   : they
 remained    a  whole night in          suspense   concerning their destiny,
 when at length        a  supply of that necesiary            refreshment     was
found.     As    thev did not,         however, discover any thing that
bore the least resemblance            to the objecl      of their search, they
were obliged to think of returning, which they did; and,
falling into the straight road from Sivva to Alexandria, ar
rived at the latter on the 2d            of April 1792*.
    Mr. Brown,         after remaining some time at Alexandria,                to
   * Mr. Brown     savs, that an opinion     has been communicated    to him, that
Siwa is the Sirofium of Ptolemy,      and that the building described wa» pro
bably coeval with the temple of Jupiter Ammon, and a dependency on it.
D'Auvillc  supposes    Siwa to be Mareotis.

    recover from the effects of his journey,                             commenced, on the
    1st of May, another to Rashid, where he staid five days;
    and on the 6th of May embarked with a view of proceeding
    to Terane, a town situated on the left of the most western
    mouth of the Nile,                  at    a   very small distance from the river.
    From Terane Mr. Brown                           made         an    excursion         to view the
    lakes which produce natron, and to observe that production
    in its     nascent state.           One of them was very irregular in its
    form,       so   that it was not          easy to say         what might be the quan
    tity of ground covered with water.                                  It    is higher in winter
    than in summer; and, at the period when                                   Mr. Brown           viewed
     it,   he could no where discover                        that the breadth of                  it    ex
     ceeded     a     mile   :    its length might               be nearly four.              Towards
     the end of summer these lakes,                         it   is   said, are almost dry, and
     the space from which the water has retired                                    is   then occupied
     by    a   thick deposition          of   salt.        Not far from             the eastern ex
     tremity        a   spring rises with some force, which much agitates
     the rest of the water.                  Close to the spring the depth was far
     greater         than our traveller's height, in other parts                             it   did not
     generally exceed               three         feet.      The thermometer                  near       the
     spring stood at 76, while                     in   the open air          it   was at 87.           The
     more western lake differs not materially from the eastern, in
     size, form, or productions                    :      the colour         of the water in both
     is    an imperfect red,             and, where the bottom                      is   visible,   it   ap
      pears almost           as   if   covered          with blood.            Salt, to the thick
     ness      of    five or fix inches, lies constantly in the more fliallow
     part.           How thick the            substance          of natron commonly                     is   in
      the lake,          Mr. Brown did not accurately determine                                     ;    but
     those employed to collect                      it,   reported,      that      it   never exceeded
     a     cubit or common pike.                     Having spent two days and part
      of   a   third in      the vicinity           of the lakes, Mr. Brown's attend
      ants grew tired, and he was obliged to return.                                      After   a     short
      interval he embarked for Kahira,                            and        arrived there on the
-     16th,  of May 1792.
           Mr. Brown being determined                            to undertake            a   journey         to
      Abyssinia,          employed the greater part of the summer, which
                                                                                                             to

                          through    "Egypt and Syria.                     245
he spent at Kahira, in learning the Arabic language;                        but
still judging that he should have occasion for an interpreter,
he took care to provide a Greek, who, besides his native lan
guage,      was acquainted         with the Turkish,      Arabic, and Ita
lian   :  he had also       with him     a   Mahommedan        of the lower
class    of  the  Kahitines,        who,     as  belongs to that character,
was prepared          for every office.       Thus provided,      he set out
by water on the 10th of September, and on the 8th day
reached      Assiut.        Having     spent    about fourteen     days   here
waiting      for a boat, he was at length able to hire one of a
moderate size       ;   and leaving Asliut        on the 4th of October,
arrived on the         nth    at  Girgi, formerly the capital of Upper
Egypt.        On   the     17th    he arrived at Dendera,        the ancient
Tentyra,       where he saw the noted temple, the most perfect
specimen      of Egyptian architecture now remaining.                  It is in
the   form of an oblong square, 200 feet by 150, Pococke says
145, and is now almost buried in the sand.                 The   same night,
about twelve, he reached                Ghenne,      the ancient Cœnc or
Cœnopolis;        and on the          23d came      to Aksor,    the ancient
Thebes.       After     passing three days in and around these ruins,
Mr. Brown        proceeded        on   his voyage up the Nile,         and on
the 31st arrived at Afl'uan, the ancient Syenc, where he re
mained three davs, contriving, if possible, to pursue his route
up the river;       but a war having arisen between the Mam-
luks of Upper Egypt and the Cashes of Ibrim, no one was
suffered to pass from Egypt to             Nubia.      The caravans    had all
been stopped for many months,                  and not even   a camel could
be procured.        Our traveller being         therefore constrained, with
deep regret,      to abandon his design            of penetrating   to  Abys
sinia by this route,          gave up all hope for that season, and
began to think of returning.
   Mr, Brown,          therefore,    left Asluan on the 4th of Novem

against the Franks on account               of the following circumstance,
which had taken place there three or four years before.                        An
English     vessel,  commanded,            as is said,  by   a    Captain Mit-
chel, having moored there,              a quarrel arose between the crew
and the natives respecting            a supply   of water, which       is a com
modity difficult to be procured.                From a violent contention
blows ensued, and the captain thought himself justified to
fire upon the town      ;  in consequence of which several persons,
some     fay fourteen,      were      killed,   and   much damage            done.
The    natives were exceedingly exasperated, and swore to sa
crifice the ;:rst Englishman that ihould fall into their hands.
Mr. Brown        found little to reward          him for exposing          himself
to the danger of this excursion, except the fight of some cu
rious rocks, which he thus describes : — The roads we travelled
in going     to Coffir,   as  well     as  in returning,     have     something
in them      very remarkable        :   the rough and lofty rocks of gra
nite and      porphyry,     with which          it is on all sides environed,
have a magnificent           and      terrific appearance       ;  and the road
between them, which             is almost level throughout,              gives the
idea of immense labour in cutting it.                       All   these circum
stances concur in testifying the importance Coffir must once
have had as a port.          In   the route we took in goino-,              at cer
tain distances, on the highest rocks, is observable                  a succession
of    small   structures,    formed with           uncemented stones,           and
which, by the marks of           sire   within them,      stem to have served
 as signals.      These are numerous, but they are too rude to
 enable one to fix any time for their erection.                     They appear
 to me to be pretty ancient. The red granite ts in vast quan
 tities;   and the chain      of rocks,        consisting   of that    substance,
 appears to extend itself in a north and south direction.                    Huge
 rocks of porphyry,        both red and green, are distinguishable ;
 and,   as appears,     more of it in the road we pursued in going
 than in that by which               we returned.         I observed      ruins of
 alabaster in both, but particularly in returning.                     The verde

IV.     Means proposed for saving the Crews of Vessels ship
      wrecked near the Coast. By an anonymous Author *.
 E.   <IGHT or nine          years ago, being much struck by an ac
count which       I read of the shipwreck of twenty-four persons
who perished so near the shore that their cries could be dis
tinctly heard, an idea immediately occurred to me, of endea
vouring to discover some means proper for saving the crews
of shipwrecked vessels, at least under such circumstances,
that is to fay,      at the distance         of forty or fifty fathoms from
the shore; for       I  did   not then imagine that it could be done
at the distance      of two or      three hundred,        as I afterwards dis
covered.      I perceived at first that the only means to save the
crew of a    vessel   in such a state, would be to establish          a rope   of
communication          from the shore to the ship.             After examin
ing    a number      of means, both ancient             and modern,      I fixed
on   a  bomb or cannon-ball              (a bomb     I think preferable), to
which     should be fastened the end           of  the rope, extended after
wards in a     zig-zag     direction before the mortar or cannon, or
suspended on      a ptece      of wood       raised several feet.     But   as  it
was necessary to know            if  the cord      would not break by the

force of the explosion             and     the     velocity of the motion,          I
thought it proper to consult professional men. I wrote to
some officers of the artillery in garrison at La Fere, and they
almost all replied lhat the rope would infallibly break.
   Not    satisfied with this answer,             I happily   conceived    the idea
of making      the experiments on a small scale.                 I caused a piece
of  the barrel     of  a  muslu    t  to be filed into the form         of  a small
mortar of      18   lines in length internally; and having tied a
packthread to a common ball of lead, I made an experiment,
which perfectly         succeeded, as did a great many others                which
1  repeated      afterwards       even      with     the   strongest   charges     of
powder.        I  communic .ted this success to                 these   officers   of
artillery,   who replied, that there was                  a great difference     be
tween a quarter of an ounce of powder and four or five
pounds employed for a bomb                   ;   and, in short,    that the rope
would break.
    Being desirous to ascertain                what truth there might be in
this   assertion,   I   repaired     to a   large iron furnace, where I re
mained ten days,           and where          I  caused a mould to be formed
for  a  four-inch mortar           and     a    bullet os the same calibre:          I
 had them both cast,           and      made       an experiment       with   a rope
three or four lines in diameter and eighteen ounces of pow
der, which succeeded.                I then came to Paris, where, after
 staying eight months,           I   obtained an order from government
 to make my experiments on                     a  grand scale even at La Fere,
 where I had to expect men prejudiced against the success of
 my attempts.           When I went thither they persisted that they
 would not succeed.            I knew, however, what I had to de
 pend upon, as        I  had already made             experiments.       In  short   I
 repeated     them, and         they completely succeeded.                 The   first
 dav, nothing being done                in   a   proper manner,       some    of  the
 experiments failed        ;  buj things being arranged                better next
 morning,       we repeated them seven times without once fail
 ing, viz. four times with a mortar of eight inches, and three
 with   one    of twelve, augmenting                 each   time the charge         of
                                                                                  the

the powder from the weakest to the strongest.                       The specta
tors having judged            that   this  number      was    fully sufficient to
establish the truth         of the discovery,     no more were made.
    I  (hall now proceed to other means, which I have devised
not only for saving the crews of vessels, but also the greater
part    of   the cargoes when exposed to danger near the coast.
    1st,     It must be remembered, that,            in  such circumstances,
the only thing necessary is to get                a cord    of communication
conveyed to the vessel in danger.                    It ought to     be remem
bered also, that         a vessel  is never cast away or perishes on the
coast, but because it is driven thither against the                   will of the
 captain,       and   by the violence of the waves and the wind,
 which       almost   always blows from the            sea  towards the shore,
 without which there would be no danger to be apprehended:
 consequently, in these circumstances, the wind comes always
 from the sea, cither directly or obliquely,, and blows towards
 the ffiore.
     A    common paper kite, therefore, launched from the                   vessel
 and driven by the wind to the shore, would be sufficient                       to
 save a      crew consisting of 1500 seamen,           if such   were the num
 ber of      a stiip of war.      This kite would convey to the shore a
 strong packthread, to the end of which might be affixed a
 cord, to be drawn on board by means of the string of the
 kite   ;   and with this cord a rope, or as many as should be ne
  cessary,      might    be conveyed       to the ship.   — It    may be readily
 conceived that         I  cannot here enter into any detail concern
  ing various circumstances relating               to this subject      which it
  might be necessary to mention.
      2d, A small balloon, of fix or seven feet in diameter, and
  raised     by rarisied     air, would be also an excellent means for
  the like purpose        :  being driven by the wind from the vessel
  to the shore, it would carry thither a string capable                  of draw
  ing     a   cord with which          several ropes might         be afterwards
  conveyed        to the vessel.       Had not      the    discovery   of citizen
  Montgolsicr        produced     any other benefit, it would be entitled
   pn this account to be considered             as of   great importance.

  250            On the different Kinds           of Cadmia, and
      3d,  A   sky- rocket, of a large diameter, would be of equal
 service.      It would also carry, from the vessel to the shore, a
 string capable of drawing            a rope after   it.   C. Ruggieri, whom
 1 have consulted         on this subject, told me, that he made some
  four inches in diameter, which rose to a great height ; and
 that, with       a  string attached       to them, they would go to the
 distance     of four or    five hundred fathoms, which is more than
 would be necessary.             They may be kept in              a state sit     for
 service two years,        if  deposited in a dry place.
      Lastly,   A   fourth plan for saving the crew           of a shipwrecked
 ressel,    is that    of throwing from the              vessel  into the    sea  an
 empty cask       with a cord attached to it.             The wind        and    the
 waves would drive the cask to the shore, and afford the means
 of establishing that rope of communication already men
 tioned.       Each of these methods may be improved, but I
 cannot at present enter into any detail               *.

   JL HE      surest method       of  classing minerals is without           doubt
 to arrange them, not according to their external characters,
 but according to their internal component parts. For, though
 the former in some measure serve for discrimination, and
 are therefore        not altogether useless, they are not so precise
 and certain as to form               a basis for a system of mineralogy,
    »  The   author of the above papers fays, that he announced his discovery
in the Affricbes de Paris on the 19th of January 1 794. However this may
be, we know that one of his methods, that of conveying a rope to the
ihorc,   by attaching it to a bullet or bomb to be afterwards          sired from a
cannon or mortar,      was proposed    a few years ago by a serjeant or officer     of
artillery  at  Woolwich,      named Bell.     Some experiments of the fame kind
made at Portsmouth, we believe, answered expectation.           The  use as a kite or
rocket seems to deserve      attention ; and we do not hesitate    to say,  that the
former    could hardly fail of producing       the desired effect.   At  any rate U
 might be easily tried.      Editor.

fince the attentive naturalist is sufficiently taught, by expe
rience, that in the mineral kingdom substances of the fame
genus, though different in external form, consist often of the
fame    component parts     ;   and   that other bodies       of   the like
kind differ in their component parts,             though perfectly alike
in their external   appearance.         As this     is the  cafe,   we can
find no better guide to conduct us to an invariable classifica
 tion,  arrangement, and definition of mineral               bodies    than
 chemistry;    a knowledge which must be united with that of
 the external characters of minerals.
    To  give an instance    of   the uncertainty which arises when
these are separated,     I  shall   here mention those ores          which
 are known     by the name        of cadmia     ;  for it would seem, by
 the many improper denominations               which    are often founded
 on their external characters,       as  if  we were almost conducted
 back to the dark age of Cadmus, from whom the Europeans
 are said to have   first learnt the art       of fusing ores on a large
 scale,  and from whom,         in all probability, the term cadmia
 had its origin.      In this     respect    chemical     knowledge is a
 better guide than external characters, and the names thence
 deduced, and often very improperly ; it enables us to define
 minerals with more accuracy, and conducts us nearer than
 the latter to the real knowledge of nature in this department,
 without    which all mineralogical          knowledge must be uncer
  tain and imperfect.      As it would       be superfluous    to fay more
  on this subject,  I lhall, for   the present, confine myself to the
  cadmias, and those ores alone which, when decomposed in
  a proper manner, and fully purified, yiejd those metals called
  zinc and cobalt,
                                 0/"Zinc.
     Ores that contain zinc are found in numerous varieties
  and of different forms.       Sometimes they are combined with,
  oxygen and the sulphuric acid            ;  and sometimes       there are
  found   in them,     besides    zinc, various foreign component
  parts, such as   argil and siliceous earth, a little iron, lead,
                                                                        and.

               Oh  lie different    Kinds     of Cadnua, and
 and, at times, also a small        portion os copper. In blende the
 sulphur is combined with imn, and the particles of zinc
  are scattered   through the mixture.              The     so  called furnace
  calamine is obtained by the fusion of some kinds of kad ore
 when the particles of zinc are sublimated by strong heat
 to a cooler place of the furnace called             the zinc    Jlool, where
 they adhere    in the form of       a    grey   or yellowisti stone.        In
 preparing    brass,   and    other operations            of   the  like kind,
 the sublimated      zinc calx is collected under the name                    of
 Vfbite nichl ; but what adheres lower down, and becomes                       a
 hard mass, is called grey lutia        ;   and this substance,        as some
 sulphureous vapour seems to adhere               to   it  the   longer it lies
 exposed near the smelting houses, becomes, by the effects                    of
 the atmosphere,      always more proper for use.                  Besides the
 above,   we have zinc calx,        zinc     spar, tutanego ore, the last
 of which    was first discovered     in China ; but         I am convinced,
 by experiments, that a        like ore, which is natural flowers            of
 zinc, is fouud in Germany in               the  Thomas- stollen       at Blei-
 berg.    We   have also zeolite-formed           calamine, zinc blende,
 glittering blende, black blende, reddish brown, phosphorised,
 greenish-yellow, white, and yellow blende. Such kinds are
 found in England, Siberia, China, Sweden, Silesia, Saxony,
 &c.
    In  examining these substances various chemists have ren
dered    great service to mineralogy, particularly Brand and
 Schwab, counsellors of The mines in Sweden ; and these
were followed by Justi, Pott, Henkel, and, above all,                     Mar-
graaf, who employed great care and accuracy in fusing and
examining them; but Bergmann, to whom science is so
much indebted, has given most                  excellent models for the
decomposition of these ores.           Whether there be native zino
or not, has never yet been fully ascertained ; and we must
still remain in doubt until the account of its being sound in
the island of Naxos,         in   the   Archipelago,         be better    con
firmed.     The zinc     ore    of Goflar,      that sound in Cornwall,
and a little of the Swedish, can be rendered useful and pro-

of tutanego,        is considered    to be purer than the German, and
therefore a small difference is observed in their specific gra
vities.
     The properties of zinc          separated    from its ore, and puri
fied, are, that it scarcely            undergoes    any variation in atmo
spheric air or in water           ; and that, by the addition       of copper,
in different proportions, you obtain            brass, pinchbeck,     prince's
 metal, Manheim gold, &c. All                    acids   deprive  it of its in
 flammable matter, and dissolve it with effervescence.                   With
 the vitriolic       acid it gives a crystalline salt, which is fulphat
of     zinc, or, as it is commonly called, white vitriol.                 That
 ¦white    vitriol which is obtained not in a crystalline form, but
 in white masses like refined            sugar,   contains often a mixture
 of foreign metallic particles,          such as iron, copper,       and  lead;
 tmt it may be purified by adding to a solution of it pure                 zinc,
  hy which the above metals will be precipitated : if the so
  lution be then filtered, and exposed to crystallise, you will
  obtain pure white vitriol.
       By the nitrous acid, zinc is dissolved with a strong effer
  vescence and in great quantity producing crystals : if yotr                       ,
  pour alcohol over these and distil them, you will obtain very
  good edulcorated spirit of nitre.             It dissolves also in the mu
   riatic acid, and emits        a strong offensive    vapour; this clear      so
   lution   saturated cannot be brought to shoot into crystals :                 if
   you reduce it by evaporation            to a gelatinous mass, and place
   it in  a retort over the fire, you obtain,           in the fame manner
   as when you distil zinc with sal-ammoniac                     and corrosive
   sublimate, butter of zinc of           a somewhat      thick consistence.
       It is soluble also in aqua-regia,          and by that acid gives a
    triple neutral salt, in the same manner as sal-ammoniac.                     It
    dissolves likewise in concentrated acetous acid, and {hoots                in
    to crystals   :   the remaining acids, viz.       of sparry fluor,  arsenic,
    borax, sugar,        tartar, sorrel,  citrons, ants, phosphorus, and
    fat, exercise an action over zinc also.             The alcaline    solvents
    do the fame        j and the process succeeds       best  with   a concen
                                                                           trated

 which an effervescence is observed, and by which the zinc
 exhibits traces of an acid : the produce is crystals of a neu
 tral salt.
      Flowers       of zinc, like zinc                itself,    are soluble in an         acid;
 but with this difference, thai no effervescence takes place.
 These flowers are produced during the fusion                               of zinc in an
 open crucible, when the heat is increased to above 370 degrees.
 The metal then inflames with a whitish-green flame of a
dazzling brightness, which seems to diffuse over the faces                                       of
those present a death-like paleness ;                           and the metal, by being
deprived of its inflammable matter, (united to oxygen,) is con
verted into a tender calx, which, by the violence of the in
flammation,            is,
                  on account of its lightness, carried upwards
like wool or           a   cobweb.          Zinc, calcined in this manner,                       is
called the flowers of zinc, and also philosophic                             wool, not to
mention other singular appellations of the alchemists.'                               During
this operation zinc exhibits some phenomena, such as the
smell, the flame, &c. which are similar to those that occur
during the combustion of phosphorus    and therefore people      ;
were led to suppose that the phosphoric acid was contained
in zinc.          By    the above process the weight                  of this calx         is   in
creased       a   tenth part, and,          as some have         remarked, even more,
and at the fame time                it   becomes fixed.         When      exposed on coals
to the blow-pipe,              it   becomes yellow, and on cooling resumes
its whiteness,          which               proof that the flowers of zinc are
                                     is
                                     a
genuine.          It   can be fused into              a   yellowisli-brown      glass, and,
 by   adding the inflammable                     matter, can         be reduced       in   close
vessels.
     In   a   close vessel,       exposed to      a       violent heat,    zinc goes over
in   a    metallic form, and                by   these means         acquires     the pro
perty of creaking, when       breaks like tin.

greater part      of metals, but not with lead, iron, or bismuth;
and it may be amalgamated                    with quicksilver.        This amal
gam     of   zinc   is  very proper      for  strengthening      the power of an
electric machine,             and   Higgins      has given a prescription for
preparing it.          In  the dry way it has the greatest affinity            with
copper,       and produces        with it    a more or less yellow composi
tion, which can be obtained by no other metal.                         In this    re
spect, then,       it  is essentially     different from all other metals,
 and    becomes        itself   a very useful     one,   as  it is used  for brass,
pinchbeck,         prince's metal, bronze, Manheim gold, and in
 fire-works, &c.
     It  is very remarkable,           in regard to zinc, that neither sul
                                      *
phur nor liver of sulphur produces on it any effect; whereas
gold, which sulphur cannot overcome, is dissolved by liver
 of sulphur.
     On this      occasion     I  cannot omit making mention of the
 celebrated      alkahest     of Respur, who          believed, that when he
 alcalised zinc and          rendered it caustic,      and had obtained from
 it  a purple-coloured mass, volatile in the open air, he had
 found out      a   menstruum,          by which he could radically dis
solve all metals.             A   paradoxical position, which was long
 adopted by the gold-making alchemists, but which has never
 been realised.

                 Description of the Pyrometer.
     The principle upon which this instrument is constructed
is   the expansion of metal by heat.             After several experiments
with copper, iron,            and steel,  I  was induced to give the pre
ference     to the latter.          Copper was found to be . too easily
fused,     and the scale by that means less extensive than was
wished.        Malleable       iron, by being heated       in this manner,
frequently acquired permanent additional length, and passed
into the state of semi-steel.              This principle it derived from
the contact of the surrounding charcoal, introduced for the
purpose     of preventing oxydation from taking place upon the
surface     of   the bar.      Highly cemented steel, when exposed in
 this manner to the greatest heat, acquired no sensible increase
 of length     :   a bar    of polished  steel  was therefore    adopted.
      A  corresponds        with  the plate   of iron K in the drawing of
 the furnace,          on which the       pyrometer is supported.         B an
 upright,      on which         is suspended the lever.        CC    the lever,
 ten inches long from the fulcrum                to the   extremity,     which
 acts upon the scale, and one inch on the other end from the
  fame    point to a line drawn through the centre                 of  the ex
 panding bar.             From this it is obvious, that      if  the short end
 of   the lever be elevated         half an inch by the expansion of the
  bar of steel, the         other end will suffer a depression ten times
  as  much, or equal to five inches.              These I  have divided into
  50 degrees, (equal to each other on a tangent of the arch
  that forms the scale DD,) so that the most minute expansion
  in   the bar    will    be visibly indicated.     Should the ratio of ten
  to one be thought too small, the power              of the   lever can easily
  be increased to 13 or 30, and the scale thus greatly enlarged.
  When the pyrometer is at rest, the index points at o°, and
  its other extremity rests lightly upon the (harp point of the
   steel bar.       It  is therefore  requisite to make the lever        nearly
  an exact balance, by forming its short end sufficiently weighty
   to overcome the great length            of  the other.    The    scale being
   carried   the length        of 50   degrees,   allows the bar to expand

two supports for the scale, attached           to the extremity          of the
plate   by means       of bolts.     FF    is a box       of wrought iron
which contains        the bar     of steel  exactly fitted,       with a small
allowance for expanding in the thickness.                   This     box is in
troduced into the lining of the furnace by means of square
notches formed in the bricks about two inches from the
contact of the fire.        The bottom of the box              rests  upon the
tinder-flange of the cylinder,         and its other end rises through
 the   building   and    iron-cover     about two inches.             When at
first introduced into its place, the space which                  may remain
 betwixt the outside of the box and the building is carefully
 filled with sine charcoal dust, to prevent oxydation by the
 chance contact of atmospheric air.                 G   is a polished    bar  of
 steel 3 feet 2 3-41I1 inches long and i-4th of an inch square,
 the sharp extremity of which acts upon that part of the lever
 which, when       at  C,   measures     one inch from the fulcrum.
 MIT,    a small  box or cover,      which    sits   upon the top of the
 iron box by means of pins. This is always kept full of char-*
 coal-dust, to prevent the approach of external air, and the
 transmission    of  heat from     within.
     This instrument may          be used in conjunction             with Mr.
 Wedgewood's        scale.    Any given      substance      may be melted,
 and the degree marked upon the scale              :  let this be compared
with    the degree    of heat    at  which the       fame substance meltu
by Wedgewood's          scale  ;  then let the greatest degree of heat
 of the furnace   be measured by one         of Wedgewood's rolls, and
 compaied with that pointed out by the index, the one dif
 ference divided by the other will give a scale of comparison.
     It will hardly escape the notice of men of science, that
 circumstances may be         so  varied, by the modes            of charging
 the furnace, as to endanger an erroneous               result  :  but, if pro
 per attention be paid, the assayer will soon understand                     the
 trim of his furnace        so   thoroughly    as to be sure         of alwav*

  acid, which arise; their temperature,                their nature, and their
 effects on the lava with          which they come in contact.

earth and stones of which it has been formed.
     27.   A. To   study the origin            of   the crystals found inclosed
in   the lava, as the white garnets or leucites in that                         of Vesu
vius, in     order to ascertain whether these crystals                      have    been
formed in the lava since the time of its fusion, or whether
they pre-existed          in the Hones from which the lava was pro
duced.
   28. The nature and progress of the decomposition of tha
different kinds of lava, cither by volcanic acids or meteors.
     28.   A. Whether            there are any       which        have actually been,
in fusion,     and yet have preserved all the external                      characters
which the       stone had before it was subjected to the action                         of
the subterranean          sires.
   29. The origin                of volcanic        ashes,       pozzolanas,       tarns,
tufas, Sec.
   30. The origin of pumice-stones: whether they are gra
nites or feld-spars,. asbestos, phrenites, deodulites, or potter's,
flay more or       less   ferruginous,         or, lastly, the remains of the
decomposition of pit-coal.
  30. A. Whether, as M.
                               de Fichtcl believes, the action
of the fire of volcanoes may augment the fusibility of feld
spar, and change      in the same manner as quartz, into real
                           it,
zeolite.
  31. Nature of the obsidians or volcanic glass      whether                :
they be really glass, and the results of complete fusion  or a                      ;
whether they are not rather stones of                    a       vitreous   appearance,
and which        have       not been exposed to the action of                      a   heat
 sufficiently strong lo           fuse   them.
                     there exist ancient kinds of lava, which, as
     32. Whether
 (related of those of Ischia, are susceptible of being heated
                                                               by

 or mountain,      the volcanic     origin  of which     may appear
 doubtful.
    34. Situation of its strata.       To ascend to the summit of
 those which are inclined ; to examine whether they have
 not a crater, or vestiges of one.
    35. To observe, above all, whether, in departing from the
 most elevated point, there are found strata diverging in all
parts, and proceeding from that point as a centre.
    36. To study the characters of the stones which have been
exposed to the action of the fire, in order to distinguish them
from other porous stones,         such as glandulous    stones or a-
nivgdaloides.
    37- When these characters are discovered, to examine
whether, in the neighbourhood of the doubtful mountain,
there are found scattered stones which exhibit the fame cha
racters,  and which seem to have proceeded         from that moun
tain,
    38. To observe whether there are found, in the neighbour
hood of the doubtful mountain, auy vestige of the remains of
 heat concealed in the bosom of the earth, as of thermal, or
even acidulous waters.        It is well known that these signs are
equivocal,    but their combination        with others may throw
some weight into the scale.
    38.  A. Whether       there   exist certain proofs   of alternate
deposits of lava or other volcanic productions, and of matters
accumulated or deposited by the lea.
    39.  Among     the  stones   changed    by the fire,   to discover
 those which     may be considered      as having been subjected to
the action   of one stratum    of  coal in deflagration, and which
the celebrated    Werner calls pseudo-volcanic,       and to distin
guish them from those which have been fused in a real volcano.
   40. Basaltes : their forms in columns, in beds, round
masses; their connections, the relation which the basal tea
of  these different forms observe with each other.
   41. The nature of these basaltes: that of their texture,
its the points which they contain, of the pores and empty
                                  S4                                «r

or full cells that may be observed in them ;            of their different
accidents and decomposition.
   41.   A. The      phenomena they exhibit in the fire, either
exposed to,      or  sheltered   from the action os the air.           But
before    any arguments are drawn from these experiments,                it
will  be necessary to resolve the question,          Whether it    be true
that a stone may have been melted by subterranean                fire, and
yet none of its characters exhibit those indications of fusion
which the      fire of our furnaces would       have given to the fame
stone.
   4s. Their connection, if there be any, with lava, fully as
certained    as such : if it be true, for example, as M. Faujas
affirms, that currents       of lava are seen terminated by columns
of basal tes.
    43. The nature of the bases on which the basaltes rests :
whether, as M. Werner fays, any is found resting on wacke
or hornstone,       of an earthy and compact fracture, which it
 self reposes on sand or freestone.
    44. Whether at other times basaltes is seen to repose on
 beds of coal (bouille) which present no indications of com
bustion.
    45. In a word, to examine whether the foil which bears
 them, or the fides of the veins in which they are contained,
 present indications      of the action    of sire, or at least of having
 been exposed to the contact         of  an incandescent     mass ; or, on
 the contrary,      whether there appear indications of deposits         of
 a substance which had been in a state            of aqueous fluidity.
    46. Whether there are in the basaltes vestiges of organised
 marine bodies or others ; and in what state these vestiges are
 found.
    47. Whether there arc observed, as M. Faujas fays, ba
 saltes which seems to have formed a passage for itself from
 top to bottom through         masses   of granite.
    48.    In doubtful    cafes  of this kind it would       be necessary,
 were   it  possible to be at the expence,       to push a gallery under
 a rock of basaltes, to examine whether the columns descend
                                                                     below

found below the foil, to sink             a  vertical well to ascertain the
truth of the systems which suppose them to have been raised
from the interior parts of the earth through the upper strata.

VIII.      Observations     on the different Inducements           to the  Eating
             of Human Flcjb . By           J. de   Loubeiro           *.
T,HE          first inducement which can lead men to this excess
 is extreme hunger       ;  but however pardonable it may be under
 such circumstances,         if  the flesh used be that         of  dead bodies,
it  is highly detestable on account          of the  consequences.         During
 a dreadful famine         in India, which          destroyed      more than a
 hundred thousand          persons,     when the roads and streets were
covered with dead bodies, because people had not sufficient
 strength    to inter them,       I saw several      have     the resolution to
 preserve their lives bv this disgusting food; but some                   of them,
 though not many, found it             so  delicious that when the famine
 was at an end they retained such an irresistible propensity to
 human flesh that they lay in wait for the living in order to
 devour them.         Besides others, there was a mountaineer who
 concealed      himself in a forest near the highway,                   where he
 used to cast a rope, with a noose,             over the heads of the pas
 sengers, whom he afterwards cut to pieces to gratify his un
  natural appetite.        He had killed many persons in this man
  ner, but he was at length caught and executed.                            At the
  fame time, and owing to the fame cause, a woman used to
  go out for the express purpose of carrying away children who
  had strayed from their homes. She stopped up their nose

and mouth              with clay that they might not call out for                         assist
ance,       and by these means                     suffocated       them.     She confessed
the fact on being taken, and some salted human                                       flesh    was
found in her habitation.                           My    servant      having entered            it,
observed      a    girl of four or five years of age who had been
suffocated in the above manner, and who was                      lying wrapped
up, half dead,              in   a   mat.       By employing proper means flic
•was    however restored to life.
     The     reason         of    the second         inducement to anthropophagy
will now           be readily comprehended.                         We      read in different
works, both ancient and modern,                                 that many nations,             in
Various parts of the world, have killed men, not on account
of famine, but of the delicious                        taste    of human       flesh,     which
they not only fed upon but publicly sold.
     The third inducement,                      that people         eat their deceased re
lations      by    way of shewing them honour,                         seems to be as ro
mantic       as   it   is   repugnant to nature           yet there are many au
                                                          ;
thors, from Herodotus,                       the father of history, down to mo
dern times, who                  assert   that this practice has prevailed amorn'
various nations.
    A     fourth incitement to eat human flefli                        is   hatred      and re
venge.        There         is   a   law in Cochinchina,             that all rebels, when
convicted of their crime, stiall be executed,                                and   that      their
flefli iliall be devoured                  by   the king's loyal subjects,              and, in
•particular,        by   those who are nearest his person.                      At the time
I   resided    inthat country several executions of this kind took
place.        The men were beheaded, but the women were stab
bed.        After      the execution the soldiers              who guarded the pa
lace flocked around the bodies,                         and each cutting off, with              a
pocket knife,    small piece, dipped
                        a                 in the juice of an unit
ripe lemon,   and  in  that manner   swallowed   it. But as th«
size   of   the morsel           is   not determined           by   the law, and as most
of   the people have an aversion to such food, manv suffer the
bit of      flesh to drop through                    their singers and swallow only
the lemon.

Mois, a people who inhabit the mountains to the west, and
who often make incursions into their territories, the Co-
ehinese general       marched with          an army towards the moun
tains   ;  but as he was not able to get at the enemy, on ac
count     of their  inaccessible    situation, he ordered two prisoners
he had taken to be put to death, and their                   flesh to be de
voured      by his soldiers.
    In   the year 1777, being on board an English                  ship  of waT
jn Turon harbour, in          order     to return from     Cochin-china       to
Europe,       a party arrived      there who had joined a powerful
rebel named        Nhae.     This     leader   and his party had taken
some     of the king's confidential friends,        and one      in particular
who had formerly done him a great deal                     of injury. The
latter they put to death         ;   and   in order    to gratify their re
venge,      they tore out his liver and ate it.           The Cochin-chi-
nese,     in general, when violently incensed against any one,
are accustomed to express a wish that they may be able to
devour his liver or his flesh.

ence between           Otto von Guerick's balls                 of sulphur, or Hau-
sen's glass globes, which                  were seventy years later, and the
electric machine now in the Teylerian Museum at Haerlem.
The former           were  sufficient to attract the lightest
                               scarcely
bodies, whereas the latter approaches near to nature in its
strength, in its awful and wonderful effects                             ;    and seems to
favour the possibility of the idea,                     that there                are natural
powers capable  of impelling heavy bodies with prodigious
force ; and which, conducted by the hand of man, may,
some centuries hence, banish the use of gunpowder, as the
latter, a few centuries ago, banished bows and arrows.
     Franklin       conveyed     electricity from the atmosphere, loaded
a battery with          it,   and directed its mightv power with the
fame cafe as that weak power excited                       by   an electric machine.
On account of the above-mentioned possibility of exhibiting
the electric power in certain degree and of certain strength,
                                   a                              a
h    was found more and more necessary to have instruments
proper for ascertaining these, and                    by   which         it   might be de
termined with precision when and                           how       a   required effect
could be produced.
     Though        these instruments have              undergone many varia
tions and improvements,                   and   though there                 is   an essential
liiffcrcnce between Stephen Gray's or Du Fay's threads and
the electrometers             of Achard     and Brooks          *,   they are all to be
considered         rather     as   announcers of electricity than                    as accu
rate gauges or measures, as they are all incapable                                of stiewinjj

.ect, though no             less   important in electric experiments, is a
discharging electrometer              ;   for,    as   it   is believed         that the laws
of electricity can           be defined       with mathematical certainty *,
it   must be         of importance     to be able to employ,                    with       the fame
certainty,           the electric power which has been excited ; and
every instrument tending to promote this object, though still
imperfect, must be of some utility, and be not unacceptable
to those fond           of electrical experiments.                   All   the discharging
electrometers           hitherto known,           perform their effect either by
spontaneously            discharging,       as   that of Lane, or                    as    Henley's
general discharger, &c.                and       in this      cafe are affected by the
greater or less conducting                property of the air, which must
necessarily           be changed on each              change of the atmosphere,
and therefore must render the instrument very imperfect and
incorrect        ;    or the effect is produced                by introducing a con
ducting body between two electric atmospheres, and by these
means uniting them. But as this must depend on the greater
or   less      dexterity of the person who performs the experiment
to determine the proper moment for discharging, and as an
other electrometer is at the fame time necessary, this method
•f discharging            is as uncertain as the first.
     I   have endeavoured,           therefore, to construct an instrument
to supply this deficiency;                and     I    hope        it will not be found
unworthy of attention.                 It   is an electrometer which, though
founded on the fame principles                         as    that    of Brooks, that                 is,
on comparing the effect of the repulsive power of electricity
between          two bodies of       a    given size with the known weight
requisite to produce that effect,                      has,        in my opinion,               some
improvements which are wanting in the other                                 ;        for the     state
of   the barometer has no influence upon this electrometer, as
it   has on that           of Brooks      ;   nor does friction,                 which         is   far
from being unimportant,                   here        take    place.        But           as this   in-

  hitherto employed.
     Plate  VI    contains      a representation       of the electrometer,
 and the different parts           of which it consists.       OP is a board
 of dry mahogany, twelve inches in length and four in
 breadth, which serves as a stand for the instrument. In this
 board are fastened two massy glass pillars,               M  and  N, which
  support the two brass capes or rings GG>                with the two forks
 of   tempered     steel  KK     screwed     into them.      The two rings
  GG are well covered with varnish ^
     In the ring G is fastened a brass rod, which terminates in
 a ball E of the fame metal, and an inch in diameter.                      The
 length of the rod and ball together is four inches and a
 half.
     A  very delicate beam,         AB,    the arms    of which    are of un
 equal length, moves on a (harp triangular axis (a knife edge)
 of well    tempered      steel  on the fork     K of   the pillar M.      It is
 seventeen inches in length,            and so constructed     that the short
 arm forms      a third and the long one two-thirds of the whole
 beam.      The    short    arm of brass furnished with the ball             B,
 exactly of the fame size          as the  ball  E,  is divided into    forty-
 five parts equivalent to grains.              The long arm     A  is of glass
 covered with copal varnish, and ends in an ivory ball                A, into
 which    is fitted an ivory hook        R,   destined to support the ivory
scale   H.     Tn order to render the insulation more complete,
this scale is suspended by three hairs.
    A very   delicate beam,        CD,   eleven inches in length, moves
on an axis, like the former, on the pillar             N,   though not here
shewn.       This    beam     is proportioned       in   the fame    manner,
one arm being           a  third     and   the other two-thirds        of   the
whole length.         The long arm of brass is furnished at the
end with a      ball D, and divided into thirty parts correspond
ing to grains.        The short arm of glass terminates in a long
roundish plate       C. covered with copal varnish*                The steel

                Description         of an    improved           EJeSrometer.                1st
forks arc shewn by the sections of the two brass caps                                   FF,     .   as
are also the two knife edges                 LL.         By      these caps the escape
of the electric matter is partly prevented.
   A brass ring Q, capable of being moved along the short
arm of the upper beam AB, shews, by means of marks de
termined by trial and cut out on the beam, the number of
grains which must be placed in the small scale to restore the
equilibrium of the beam at each distance of the ring Q from
the point of suspension.
   On the long arm CD of the lower beam there is also 4
tnoveable ring S, which, like the ring Q, fliews in grains,
by its distance           from the point of suspension,                         the power re
quisite to overcome                the preponderance               of   LD in        regard         lo
LC.
    The power          necessary for this purpose                  will    be found        if the
shell   H,     which weighs exactly fourteen                       grains, be suffered to
sink down            on     the glass plate         C,      and the ring S be pushed
forwards till both the arms of the beam are in equilibrium.
The part of          the beam on which the                      ring S    has moved is di
vided      into fourteen            parts,    so   that     o   marks the place where
the     rinc   S must stand when the beam, in                             its    free slate,         is
in equilibrium              ;    and 14 stands at the place where the                         ring
S again restores                a perfect    equilibrium           when the shell             H       is-
laid on the glass plate C.                   Each of these parts, which                             arc
divided into quarters, indicates                    a   grain.       The lower divisions
of the     scale     will       be sound     with more accuracy                 if   quarters        of
a   grain be put, in succession,                    into the shell          H     (after   it       has
 been laid on the plate               C),    and the ring          S    be moved between
T:ach quarter          of   a    grain until       the perfect          equilibrium        be re
 stored.       This       place on the beam              is     then to be marked, and
 you may continue in this manner until                   the 30th part of                            a
 grain be given.                Both scales, for the fake of distinctness, rre
 divided only          so   low    as quarters     of   a   grain   ;   though the instru
 ment    is    so   delicate, and must absolutely be                      so,   that i-20th          of
a   grain      is   sufficient     to destroy the equilibrium.

forks affixed to them, are               so fitted           into the stand that both
the beams lie parallel to each other as well                                  as to   the rod       GE.
In    this position of the beams                  AB, the balls B                  and   E     are just
in contact.          The    smallest     glass pillar               N    is   of   such a height
that the ball of the beam                    CD           stands at the distance                  of   ex
actly four lines from the ring G, and cannot move without
touching the latter. The small shell H is suspended in such
a manner that there is a distance                         of exactly two lines                between
it   and the shell     C.      In   each      of the         brass rings           GG        is a small
hole, that the instrument may be connected with the two
fides   of   an electric    jar.     I   is a brass wire,                 with a hollow bit
of   ivory a destined to support the beam                               CD, which            is neces
sarily preponderant at             D, in order               to prevent oscillation be
tween the discharges           to be examined by the instrument.
     It may be readily comprehended that, when                                      the beam           AB
has moved,         A   must pass over twice the space that                                   B     does     ;
and that, in the beam               CD,      the cafe is the fame in regard                             to
C    and    D.     If AB     therefore        be connected                with the external
side, and        CD with     the internal side                 of   a   battery, but in such
a manner that the instrument is at a sufficient distance                                               be
yond the electric atmosphere                  ;       and    if   the battery be charged,
the repulsive effect of the electric power will oblige the ball
B    to separate from the ball                    E   ;    the shell          II   must therefore
naturally sink down with double velocity,                                     so   that when the
ball B rises a line, the shell                        H      must        sink two        :    when it
reaches       this depth       it will touch the shell C, and the latter,
by the power excited in                it,   will         be obliged to sink,                by   which
D    must naturally again ascend in                        a   double proportion to the
sinking of       C ;   so   that when        C        has fallen two lines,                    D    must
have ascended          four, and         D that moment                        touches         the ring
 by   which the two sides of the battery are connected with
each other, and discharges                   the battery.
     But,    as the attractive electric power between                                    unlike        at
mospheres,         under like circumstances,                        is   at least as strong as
its repulsive power between like atmospheres,                                  it     would thence
follow that the electric power, instead of repelling the ball                                           B
                                                                                                    from

 from the ball            E would rather          attract         D, and, by            its contact
with G, promote the discharging ; by which the instrument-
would fail of its object, and be subjected to the temperature
of the      atmosphere              like all other electrometers;                      and besides
this, the electric power could no longer be determined by
weight.   To obviate this inconvenience, the instrument, in
all electrical experiments, must be applied in such a manner
that the power with which the ball D is attracted by AB
may exceed in strength the power required to repel the ball
B from       the ball          E.    For this    purpose the ring S must always
be removed           two divisions farther on        CD, towards D, than
the ring Q. is shifted on                 AB towards B.                 If,
                                                           for example, an
electric force were required equal to eight grains, according
to this electrometer, the ring Q must be removed to the place
where     8   stands, and the ring               S    to the place marked 10.                     The
repulsive     power will then naturally repel the balls                                    B   and   E
before    G   is    in   a   condition to attract the ball                   D,   as   a   power of
two grains would be necessary for this purpose,                                      besides that
of the eight already                in action.        The       (hell   H, with         its weight
of fourteen grains, will                 easily overcome             the preponderance                of
LD    over    LC,         as   it   amounts only to ten grains, and there

strength     of    the repulsive        power is pointed out by fourteen
grains.
   If an    electric power of twenty-five grains be required, the
ring S must be removed to 27,                      and the weight of seventeen
grains be put into the shell                  H in        order    to produce a pre
ponderance of four grains in regard to S.                               These seventeen
grains are added to the required power of twenty-five grains,
and the ring Q is pushed to 42, &c.       In this manner the
repulsive     power always          acts          before     the    attractive power
can.
     It may       be readily perceived             that the faults and inconve
niences common to all the electrometers                            hitherto employed,
and which have been alreadv mentioned, cannot take place
here;      because the discharging is performed by immediate
connection between             the positive and negative                   electricity in
the     instrument itself,         without          any     external means           being
employed.
     One of the most essential advantages of this instrument                             is,
the certainty       with which           the fame          result may be expected
when the experiment                is   repeated.           For    the fame degree       of
electric power, whatever be the temperature                               of   the atmo
sphere,     will always      be necessary to commence the separation
of the two balls        B    and   E     from each other, the quantity of
coated glass and the distance                 of   the ring        Q    from the axis   L
beinjr the fame.
     Another no less important advantage of this instrument
 is,  that in an experiment where the fame electric power,
often ifcpeated,       is   necessary to ascertain the result with accu
racy   ;   such, for example, as the charging                       a   battery through
acids, water, &c.        ;    the fame degree              of precaution       is   not ne
cessary as    is   indispensibly        so   in   any other electrometer,            as the
person who puts the machine                       in motion has nothing; to do
but to count how often the electrometer discharges itself; and
the instrr-nent may be inclosed in    glass cafe, or prevented
                                                      a
in     any other manner from external                  contact, or any other cir
cumstances which might render the experiment uncertain.

tracts and expands longitudinally in various ways                                           ;   and these
vibrations are then conducted                            to     a   distance         by   the surround
ing air.           It   is      not necessary that               1   stiould     here        farther ex

pipe     is   susceptible.             Those who are desirous of information
on this subject may consult Daniel Bernoulli's papers in the
Memoirs of the Academy of Paris for 1762; those os Lam
bert, in the Memoirs                      of   the Academy                   of Berlin for         1775      ',

I76            On the Tones produced                  by   an Organ-pipe
depends merely on the length                       of the pipe,     and not on its di
ameter;       so that the     velocity is not changed when the pipe
is indefinitely enlarged,               or, what is the fame thing, when it
is totally removed,          so as to afford free access to                    the air on all
sides.    Sound therefore is diffused through                        a       certain space of
air, in the same time in which a column of air inclosed in a
pipe makes        one vibration           ;    a    proposition which               has been
proved in the before-mentioned                       of Euler, Bernoulli,
                                                      papers
and Lambert,          and also          by Count Giordano Riccati in his
Treatise on Elastic Fibres or Strings, and which is confirmed
by experience.             Hence it follows,               that the number of the
vibrations made by the air in                  a   pipe may be found,               if the real
velocity with which sound is conducted through the air be
divided by the length of the column of air contained in the
pipe.
  The labours undertaken by Newton, Euler, Daniel Ber
noulli, Lambert, Giordano Riccati, and others, to deter
mine, from general mechanical principles, the velocity with
which     sound       is    conducted,             have given           no other results
than those taught by experience.                           By all   these       theoretic re
searches the space through which sound passes in the air, or,
in general, in any           expansible            fluid substance,            was found to
be =     V-    2— ;    where       g    is the space through which a heavy
body falls in     a second,          or in any given time                ;    a the elasticity
of the    expansible        fluid,      which is assumed equal to the pres-
 ure it sustains from the atmosphere                           ;   and b the density           of
the expansible fluid          :   a may be also the height                     of   the baro
meter,    if    the density          of the mercury                be considered          as   1.
Theory gives, therefore, about 900 Parisian feet as the dis
tance to which sound is transmitted through the air in the
course   of    a second ; whereas              this space has been found, by
experience, to be equal to about 1038.     No one has ever yet
assigned  a sufficient reason for this difference. The most
common conjecture                 is,   that   it    must be owing to               a   mixture
of various foreign particles              ;        but this,       by    those acquainted
                                                                                           with

                          in different Kinds         of Gas.                           477
with the nature of atmospheric air and the different kinds                                 of
gases, as ascertained             by chemical experiments, can hardly be
admitted, and is contradicted by this circumstance                                :   that,
according to every observation, the state of the air, whether
moist or dry, cloudy or rainy, does not alter, or at least in a
sensible manner, the velocity with which sound is conducted.
Various other conjectures seem to be equally inconsistent with
nature.     From the present experiments it follows, in my opi
nion, that the velocity of the vibrations of an expansible fluid
substance cannot be determined by the mechanical                                  princi
ples hitherto admitted alone               ;    but that it depends,              besides
these, upon other properties.
   Were     the before-mentioned data sufficient to determine the
vibrations of an expansible fluid, the tone which                           a   pipe can
emit, both in the air and in different kinds                       of    gases, under
like circumstances, would be inversely                     as    the square root           of
the specific gravity         of   the expansible     fluids.       The      result given
by the present experiments               is,   however, different.              As
                                                                                 I    was
not furnished with the apparatus proper for the purpose,                                I
requested, during my residence at Vienna, professor Jacquin
junior, who        has   a   great zeal        for the progress of science,                to
undertake the experiments; and he was                      so   good as to comply
with my wishes.
  The apparatus              consisted   of an tin organ-pipe,
                                                    open                                   in
which      the    length of the vibrating column of air from                           the
aperture        where the inflated air           issues to the end          was about
fix inches, having its upper              end inserted           in   the neck        of   a
bell-glass, that could be closely shut    means of    cock.by                    a
On immersing the bell in water, the pipe was at the fame
time filled with     to guard against all mixture of atmo
                         it,
spheric air.        A    bladder, furnished also with                   a   cock, was
screwed     upon the neck of the bell, after having been com
pressed    as    much    as possible,     and emptied           of air   by     applying
the mouth to it.          The bell and the bladder were then filled
with such a quantity of the air to be examined,                                 that the
water, hi which          the bell was immersed, stood at an equal
                                      T   3                                       height

height both in the infide and outside                       ;    and the pressure sufT
tained by the bell was equal, therefore,                         to the pressure        of the
atmosphere.           The pipe        was blown by compressing                       the blad
der ; but the greatest             caution was necessary to prevent                          the
pipe from emitting, instead of its natural tone, any of its
higher tones, which in an open pipe, as is well known, are
as the natural series            of   the numbers,            that     is,   in arithmetical
progression.          A
               weak and uniform pressure was therefore ne
cessary, but which could be repeated at pleasure   because,                      ;
when the pressure was omitted, the superfluous gas returned
back into the bladder.                 The        temperature,            which certainly
contributes in some degree to vary the tone of wind instru                   a
ment, in regard to all the different kinds of gas, was always
the fame; that             is,   the degree which           is   usual on        a   somewhat
cool morning in spring.                   To    enable        me to judge with more
accuracy of the tone,            I    had tuned two strings to an unison                        of
that tone produced                in common air            :     the experiments          were
made         with the utmost           accuracy,           so   that  I      have    reason     to
think        there was no room left for the smallest deception.
     The bull         and the pipe being sirit lilled with common air,
 the tone was exactly the fame as that                          of   a    pipe blown when
it   is   perfectly free    ;     but much weaker,                   as   must       have been
 expected,       because the vibrations               of    the air inclosed            in the
 bell were propagated,                and      oukl     be communicated                  to the
 surrounding atmosphere only through the sides of the bell
 and through the water. But though the sound, for the fame
 reason,  was somewhat weak      the other experiments, they
                                                in

 ncrees with theory;               according to which the difference must
 amount to almost half                a   tone,    if   thegravity of atmospheric
 air be to that        of oxygen       gas as     i   to 1*103, aiu' l'»c tone                in
 versely as the square root               of   the gravity.
        The   most striking deviation              from theory was exhibited                    by
 azotic gas.          It   might have been expected that the sound of

                        in different Kinds       of Gas.                  279
it would   have been a little higher than that              of common air,
because   it is   somewhat       lighter,    and because its gravity is to
that of atmospheric air         as 0*985 to 1 ;      but it was half a tone
lower.     Three kinds of azotic gas were tried ; one produced
bymeans of liver of sulphur, another by a mixture of iron
and sulphur, and the           third from common air by means of
nitrous gas.
   In all   the three       a taper     was extinguished       in a moment,
and   they all gave the same tone. Should it be here sus
pected that the azotic gas disengaged from atmospheric air
by sulphur and           iron, might have had a mixture of hy
drogen gas,     the   tone   in that cafe must have been raised rather
than lowered by the latter on account of its lightness. We
may therefore consider it as certain, that the vibrations of
azotic gas, let it be prepared in whatever manner it may,
are much flower than the vibrations               of atmospheric air;     and
that the difference         amounts to about half         a  tone.   It is re
markable that azotic gas in particular should exhibit, in re
gard to its vibrations,         such    a variation     from the common
theory, as, according to late experiments, it differs so much
from other kinds of gases in regard to its expansibility at dif
ferent degrees      of  heat.      It would    be well worth the trouble
to repeat these experiments, respecting             the vibrations  of azotic
gas,   at different high        and    low degrees of temperature.          It
ought also to be examined                with more accuracy, whether
Marriot's law, that         at the fame temperature           the density   of
an expansible       fluid increases and decreases in proportion to
its pressure,     may not admit of some exception in regard to
azotic gas   ;   as  this inquiry would, in all probability,           enable
us to explain the variation           of  its vibrations    from the com
mon theory.
   A  very remarkable phenomenon was exhibited by a mix
ture  of azotic       and oxygen gas.           It might    have been sup
posed, that azotic gas, being a lighter substance,                would have
occasioned     a  higher tone than atmospheric air; and oxygen
                                      T  4                                &**

38o             On  the Tones produced       by an Organ-pipe
gas,    as a heavier     substance,    a  lower tone     ; and that a    mix
ture   of   these two would        have given a mean tone between
both.       Experience, however, shews that each of these two
expansible      fluids, as  I have already      said, gives a higher tone
than atmospheric         air;  and that a mixture          of them    gives  a
tone higher than either of these can give alone, and per
fectly similar to the tone of atmospheric air. The quantity
of   oxygen gas mixed with           the azotic gas might,         according
to appearance,        be at first about a fourth      ; afterwards    a third,
or somewhat more;             which    however made         no considerable
variation in the tone.          I  am   of opinion,     therefore,   that the
unknown cause which occasions                a mixture of these two sub
 stances to vibrate quicker than each of them taken singly,
may also occasion sound to be conducted with greater velo
city than it ought, according to common theory, through
atmospheric air, which            has   the fame     component parts as
the above mixture.            This    greater    velocity   seems   to imply
rather    a   chemical than    a  merely mechanical mixture of these
fluids.       But this  is contradicted,      besides other observations,
by one in particular of that acute and diligent philosopher
Professor Remigius Dottier of Vienna, who suffered common
air to stand above a year untouched in               a glass tube    five feet
in   length and one and a         half in diameter, which was well
stopped both at top and bottom, and at the end                  of that time
 the component parts of the air were in some measure sepa
rated from each other according to their specific gravity; so
that    a   lighted taper was extinguislied in the lighter azot
found at the top, while another burnt in the heavy oxygen
gas at the bottom with more strength than in atmospheric air.
     Hydrogen       gas gave a far higher         tone    than atmospheric
air; with that extricated          by iron and the sulphuric acid, the
difference      was   about an octave       ;  with that by zinc and the
muriatic acid, it was nearly an octave and                a whole tone ; by
that from the steam of water conducted through a tube of
ignited iron, it was somewhat above an octave and a small

                                                                        third.

third.     This difference, however,            is not so great as might
have been expected from so light a gas, the gravity                  of which
is to that of common air, when the gas is perfectly pure, as
tro84    to 1.    Had the tones, therefore,           been inversely     as the
square roots     of the gravity,    the tone with hydrogen gas from
iron and the sulphuric acid, allowing                 it to have been only
fix or seven times lighter than atmospheric air, must have
been about an octave and a large third higher ; and by the
lighter hydrogen gas, about an octave and                     a small seventh
higher.      By mixing atmospheric air with hydrogen                   gas, the
tone, as might readily be expected, was lowered                  ;  but it is tn
 be remarked, that as long as these two fluids were                   not uni
formly mixed by silling and compressing                  the bladder, a dis
cordant noise only was heard,               and not a distinct found, as
 the vibrations could not be isochronous, which forms the
only   essential difference      between a distinct sound and such a
discordant noise.         The same thing was observed in regard to
 the before-mentioned mixture of azotic and oxygen gas.
    The    tone   of carbonic      acid    gas from chalk and the sul
 phuric acid was almost a large third lower than the tone of
 atmospheric air ; which agrees pretty well with theory, since
 the gravity of these fluids is       as 1*5 to 1.
    Nitrous     gas from nitrous         acid    and copper was not very
 favourable to sound       ;   and it required     a strong    pressure   of the
 bladder and     a great     deal of caution, because,          instead   of the
 wistied-sor low tone, one of the higher tones                 was produced.
 The    lowest tone, obtained with considerable                difficulty,   was
 about half    a tone   lower than in atmospheric air; which agrees
 also pretty well      with theory,        since   this gas is heavier, and
 the gravities    are as   i"i95   to  1 :   the tone was also almost like
 that in azotic gas, notwithstanding the considerable                    differ
 ence in the gravities of these two fluids.
     As  to the velocity with which the sound               of another    elastic
 body would be conducted through these                  gases,   could a suffi
 cient extent    of  them be procured to make the observation,                  it
 follows,    from what has been said in the beginning of this
                                                                         paper,

     The   present experiments are very different from those                                   of
Priestley and Perolleon sound in different kinds of gases.
The experiments of these two philosophers had relation only
to the intensity        with which            the vibrations        of another           elastic
body (of a bell struck by a hammer) are conducted through
these gases.   Perolle contradicts Priestley's assertion, that
the power of conducting is as the densities ; but to this rule
Priestley himself makes an exception in regard to oxygen
gas, which appears to be a stronger conductor                                 :    azotic gas
was examined by neither of these philosophers.                                     In hydro
gen gas they both found the conducting                             power very weak,
which      is no doubt owing                  to its little density.               In oxygen
gas they found the found somewhat stronger than                                        in com
mon air; in the nitrous gas Perolle found it also somewhat
stronger.         In carbonic          acid    gas Priestley found the found
stronger ;       but Perolle, weaker, duller, and somewhat lower
than in common air:                which last circumstance                   I    consider as
agreeable to truth,            because the vibrations              of   a sounding body
must be more retarded                  the denser        the surrounding fluid                 is,
or according to its greater pressure on that body. For this
reason the vibrations of    body vibrating
                                       a     our atmospheric       in
air must be       a   little flower than they would be in                         a   vacuum    ;
as experience         teaches that the sound              of   a   bell becomes lower
the more               filled with water, or the deeper
                it
                is                                                       it   is      immersed
in that fluid     ;    so   that, when         it   is   struck     at   a    considerable
depth,     it   no longer emits         a   distinct sound, but rather                   a   kind
of   discordant       noise.

   made      by Chladni        and    Jacquin     at   Vienna, with a view to
   determine the           sonorous properties of various gaseous sub
   stances.        By causing a small tin pipe, brought into contact
   with    a  cock in the neck of a bell glass, to be blown by gas
   contained in a bladder applied to the external aperture of the
   cock, these philosophers observed, that the sound was a semi
   tone lower with azotic and oxygen gas than with atmospheric
   air ; a third lower with carbonic acid gas ; and nearly the
   fame with nitrous gas            :  but, with oxygen gas, from nine to
   eleven tones higher than with the air that surrounds us.                       A
   mixture of azote and oxygen, in the fame proportions as in
   atmospheric air, gave the same tone as the latter; but when
   the mixture of these gases was not uniform, the founds were
   totally discordant.            The singularity of       these results  induced
   pie to examine the experiments with attention.
        Priestley     t,  several years ago,       published some observation*
    on the same subject          ;  but he had made        use of a metallic body
    rendered sonorous by percussion,              after he had fixed it in a glase
-
  -*jar,which he filledsuccessively with different kinds of gas. The
    aeriform substances which he employed for his experiments
    appeared to him           to propagate       founds in proportion to their
    density    :  he remarked, that in hydrogen gas the sound seemed
    ]ike that produced in           a  vacuum or air highly rarefied.           Is it
    to be supposed that such a philosopher as Priestley would have

tinguished the falling of            a  third in the carbonic acid and ni

 the prodigious rife occasioned by the hydrogen.
     At   the time Priestley made his experiments                     I was    engaged
 in  some    of the fame kind, the results of which were publistied
in the Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences of Turin for the
years 1786 and 1787.                In my       paper       it may be seen that I
successively rilled a bottle, and inverted it in a pneumato-che-
mical preparation of various aeriform substances; and in
these atmospheres           I  rung   a  small bell, and made a repeating-
watch strike.         As     the sounds reached my ear,                I  paid atten

its intensity, and the vibralion.                   To   assist  my ear    I  made use

    Chladni's experiments, therefore, seem to contradict those/
made by Priestley and myself.           To reconcile them, it will
no doubt be said that Chladni and                 Jacquin employed a

Priestley were made with metallic bodies rendered sonorous.

tones higher, have not power to alter the tones              of a metallic
body in any sensible degree       ?  I shall here offer a few remarki
which     seem to arise from these general observations.
     In a mixture of oxygen     and azote,    in   the fame proportions
as    in the atmospheric air, sound is the fame, according to
Chladni and Jacquin, as in the latter medium ; but they-
add, if the mixture of these two gases is not complete, the
found is quite discordant.         What    ! do oxygen and azote        af
 ford each of them the same sound          ? and does an incomplete
 mixture of them produce          a discordant      sound  ?    It will no
doubt be replied, that azote and oxygen do not give the               same-
 tone as atmospheric       air; but, in theatres, ball-rooms, con
 cert-rooms,      &c. where a great number of spectators are-
 assembled,    and where there is a sufficient quantity            of car
 bonic acid, which        does not combine          with  the air of the
 atmosphere,      has  it  ever been     observed      that wind instru
 ments     were discordant    ?   If  an incomplete       mixture of at
 mospheric air with gas, which lowers the found one third,
 does riot render the sounds discordant, how can we persuade
 ourselves that a mixture       of two   gases, which      cause a falling
 of only half a tone,   should occasion a sound altogether discord
 ant, merely because the portions of the            gases are   completely
  mixed, while the admixture of some other particles is much
  less  complete  ?
      The  above authors inform us also,         that in hydrogen gas
  the found rises nine or eleven tones.          Here there can be no
  medium.       Either the found produced in the hydrogen is
  sharper   by nine tones, and in that cafe the. elevation ought
                                                                        not

 not to be carried to eleven ; or the sound is sharper by eleven*
 tones in the hydrogen than in atmospheric air, and then
 it is wrong to sav that it rises only nine tones.
     This want of correctness and precision in determining the
 tone ; this great latitude allowed to the hydrogen, of being
 able to raise the sound nine or eleven               tones   ;   does it not
 prove an indecision, an uncertainty on the part                of these phi
 losophers, little calculated to procure confidence to their
 experiments       ?
     Let it not, however, be imagined, that I wish to contest
 the reality of their discoveries.          Not having repeated the ex
 periments of these authors,           I can   have    no such intention.
 I  have only endeavoured         to give an account      of    those •doubts-
 which remained on my mind               after  I  had  taken the      subject
 into consideration, and to engage the philosophers to                     re
move the uncertainty by repeating the experiments.
     One of these authors, Chladni, has made an observation
 which seems entirely his own.              He    observed,    that   when a
 plate of glass is agitated by means of a bow,              if   some dust is
 strewed over the glass,        the former     will   appear     to have ar-'
 ranged      itself symmetrically, after the plate ceases to emit
 found.        Under the like circumstances the figures are always
the fame.
     It  is not at all surprising, that an elastic body, when put
 ib motion by the         same means,      should constantly experience
 effects   of the    fame kind.    The light body placed on the sur
 face   of  the glass with which       the experiment       is made, only
 confirms what we were already taught by reason.                      But be-
sore it be concluded that ihese motions                produce      found, or
tend to determine the tone,           philosophers are invited to read
my     Letter    to    De la Methcrie      On ibe Total Vibrations of
 Sonorous B^ies, published in the Journal de Pbrfique for
December 1 785. This letter, the fense of which is altered by
some typographical errors           , contains facts a little too precise

                                           than in any other branch of
                           there exists a necessity    of strictly  separating
 the facts observed from the ideas             which, in order      to explain
 them, may occur to the mind of the observer.                     In the   pre
 sent state     of  the science, every well ascertained         fact increases
 our     still   narrow stock of real knowledge;               when on the
 contrary,       the reasonings we are enabled to make are at best
 but ingenious guesses, which loo often bias and mislead the
 judgement.           I  shall, therefore, endeavour         in this   paper to
  give, first,    a mere      description of the object unmixed with
  any systematical        ideas,   and ssiall   afterwards    offer such con
 jectures on its causes            as seem to me to       be fairly grounded
  on observation.
     Jt  was a common report in Lincolnshire,                that  a  lame ex
  tent  of    islets   of moor      situated along its     coast,   and  visible
  only in the lowest ebbs of the year, was chiefly composed of
  decayed trees.          Theft' islets are marked in Mitchell's chart
  of that     coast by the name         of  cluy huts; and the village         of
  Huttoft,     opposite to which they principally lie, seems to have
  derived its name from them.                In  the month      of September
   1796 I went to Sutton, on the coast of Lincolnsliire,                       in
   the company of the Right Hon. the President of the Royal
   Society, in order to examine their nature and extent.                    The

  2(58                     On a Submarine Forest
 loth of the month, being the           first day after the equinoctial
 full moon, when the lowest            ebbs were to be expected,            we
went in a boat about half past twelve at noon, and soon                set foot
upon one of the largest islands then appearing.                   Its exposed
surface was        about thirty yards long,       and twenty-five wide,
when the tide was at the lowest.              A great  number of smaller
islets    were   visible around us, chiefly to the eastward                and
southward;        and the fishermen, whose authority            in this point
is  very competent, fay, that similar moors are to be found
along the whole coast, from Skcgness to Grimsby, particu
larly off Addelthorpe and Mablelhorpe.                The channels di
viding the islets were, at the time we saw them, wide, and
of various      depths ; the islands      themselves   ranging generally
from     east  to west in their largest dimensions.
    We     visited them again in the ebbs         of the aoth and 21ft;
and though it did not generally ebb             so far  as we expected,
we could        notwithstanding      ascertain   that they consisted al
most entirely       of  roots, trunks, branches and        leaves    of  trees
and shrubs,       intermixed with some leaves of aquatic plants.
The remains of          some   of these trees were      still   standing on
their roots, while the trunks of the great part lay scattered on
the ground in every possible direction.              The barks of        trees
and roots appeared generally as frefli as when they were grow
ing   ;  in that of    the branches particularly,      of which       a great
quantity was found, even the thin silver membranes of the
outer skin were discernible. The timber of all kinds, on the
contrary, was decomposed, and soft in the greatest part of the
trees : in some, however, it was firm, especially in the roots.
The     people   of  the country have       often found among them
very sound pieces of timber, fit to be employed for several
economical purposes.
    The sorts of wood which are still distinguishable, are, birch,
fir, and oak.          Other woods evidently exist in these islets,
of   some    of which     we sound the leaves      in the     soil ; but our
present    knowledge of       the comparative anatomy          of timber is
not   so  far advanced as to afford us the means of pronouncing
                                                                        with

 With    confidence       respecting    their species.      In   general    the
 trunks, branches, and roots of the decayed trees were consi
 derably flattened ; which is a phenomenon observed in the
surtarbrand, or fossil wood of Iceland, and which Scheuchzer
 remarked also in the fossil wood found in the neighbourhood
 of  the lake  of Thun in Switzerland.
     The  soil to which the trees are affixed,           and in  which they
 grew, is   a soft greasy clay ;      but for many inches above its
 surface, the soil is entirely composed          of rotten   leaves scarcely
 distinguishable to the eye, many of which may be separated
 by putting the soil in water, and dexterously and patiently
 using a spatula or blunt knife.             By this method I obtained
 some perfect       leaves    of Ilex aquifolium, which are now in
 the herbarium of the Right Honourable Sir Joseph Banks ;
 and some other leaves,          which, though less        perfect,    seem to
 belong to some species          of willow. In this       stratum     of rotten
 leaves we could also distinguish some roots              of Arundo phrag-
 mites.
     These islets, according to the most            accurate    information,
 extend at least twelve miles in length, and               about    a.  mile in
 breadth, opposite to Sutton shore.            The water without them,
 towards the      sea,   generally deepens suddenly,         so as to    form a
 steep   bank.      The    channels between       the several islets, when,
 the islets are dry, in        the lowest ebbs of the year are from
 four to twelve feet deep        :  their bottoms are clay or sand, and
 their direction is generally from east to west.
     A  well, dug at Sutton by Joslma Searby, sliows that a
 moor of the fame nature is found under ground in that part
 of the country         at   the depth of sixteen        feet, consequently
 very nearly on        the same level      with   that    which     constitutes
 the islets.     The disposition of         the  strata was      found to be
 nearly   as  follows:           Clay, 16 feet — Moor, similar to that\
 of   the islets,   3 to 4 ditto
                                     — Soft moor,      like the fcowerings
  of  a  ditch bottom, mixed with sliells and silt, 20 feet-
 Marly clay,      1 foot —Chalky rock, from          1  to 2 feet — Clay,
                                                                             31
  Tards — Gravel and water ; the water has a chalybeate taste.

         In    order to ascertain the course                  of this   subterraneous           (Ira*
    turn of decayed vegetables,                       Sir Joseph Banks                directed      a
    boring to be made in the fields belonging to the Royal So
    ciety in the parish of Mablethorpe.                          Moor of       a   similar nature
    to that      of Searby's well,         and the islets, was found, very nearly
    on the fame level, about four feet thick,                                and under a soft
    clay.
         The whole         appearance           of    the rotten vegetables,              we ob
    served, perfectly resembles,                    according to the remark of Sir
    Joseph Banks,              the moor which, in Blankeney Fen and in
    other parts of the East Fen in Lincolnshire,                                   is thrown      up
    in   the making         of banks; barks, like                 those      of   the birch-tree,
    being there also abundantly found.                            The moor           extends over
    all the Lincolnshire             fens,     and has been traced                  as far as    Pe
    terborough, more than sixty miles to the south                                     of Sutton.
    On     the north fide, the mooiy islets, according                              to the fisher
    men, extend           as   far   as   Grimiby,        situated on the south side
    the Humber: and it is                  a    remarkable circumstance, that in
    the large tracts           of low land which lie on                   the south banks          of
    that river,       a   little above its mouth, there is a subterraneous
    stratum of decayed trees and shrubs exactly like those we
    observed at Sutton ; particularly at                         Axolmc            isle, a tract   of
    ten miles in length by five in breadth                                ; and       at Harsield
    Chace,         which comprehends one hundred and eighty thou
    sand acres.     Dugdale * had long ago made this observation
    in the first of these places; and De la Prymef in the second.
    The        roots are there, likewise, standing                      in the places where
    they grew         :   the trunks lie prostrate.                   The     woods are     of the
    fame species as at           Sutton.         Roots of aquatic plants                 and reeds
    are likewise mixed with them                       ; and      they are covered              by a
    stratum of some yards                      of     soil,    the    thickness of which,
    though not ascertained                     with    exactness        by the above-men-.
     tioned observers, we may easily conceive to correspond                                      with

  son's observations         *) only visible when the water is low,
  where    a  channel was cut, which has left them uncovered.
     Little doubt can            be entertained        of the moory            islets   of
 Sutton being         a  part of this extensive and subterraneous                   stra
 tum, which, by some inroad of the                         sea,   has there         been
 stripped    of   its covering      of foil.     The identity of the levels;
 that   of  the species     of trees; the     roots of these affixed, in both,
 to the soil where they grew ; and, above                       all, the flattened
 shape    of  the trunks, branches,            and roots found          in   the istets
  (which can only bo accounted                for by the heavy pressure of a
 superinduced         stratum), are sufficient reasons for this opinion.
     Such    a  wide-spread assemblage of vegetable                      ruins, lying
 almost    in  the fame level, and that level generally under the
  common mark of low-water, must naturally strike the ob
 server, and give        birth    to the following questions           :
     1.  What       is the epoch      of this destruction?
     2. By what agency was it effected                 ?
     In  answer to these questions,            I  will   venture     to submit the
 following reflections         :
    The fossil remains of vegetables                  hitherto       dug up in         so
many parts of the globe, are, on                 a close    inspection, found to
 belong to two different            states  of our planet.            The     parts    of
vegetation,       and their impressions,           found in mountains of a
cotaceous,        schistous,      or even sometimes          of a   calcareous       na
ture, are chiefly of plants now existing between                         the tropics,
which could neither have grown in the latitudes                             in which
they are dug up, nor have been carried and deposited there
by any of the acting forces under the present constitution of
nature.        The formation,            indeed,     of the      very mountains
in which they are buried, and the nature and                               disposition
of the materials which compose them, are such                             as we    can
not account for by any actions and re-actions which                              in the
actual    state   of things     take place on the surface             of the earth.

   We    must    necessarily    recur to that period in the              history of
   our planet, when the surface of the ocean was at least so
   much above its present level as to cover even the summits
   of those secondary mountains which                contain the remains of
   tropical plants.      The     changes     which these vegetables have
   suffered in their substance         is almost    total  ;  they     commonly
   retain only the external          configuration      of what       they    were.
   Such is the slate in which             they are found in England by
   Llwyd; in France by Jufiieu ; and in the Netherlands by
   Burtin j not to mention instances in more distant countries.
   Some of the impressions or remains of plants found in foils
   of this    nature,    which       were, by the more             ancient      and
   enlightened      oryctologifts,       supposed     to belong        to    plants
  actually growing in temperate              and cold climates,           seem, on
 accurate investigation, to            have    been    part   of   exotic    vege*
  tables.     In  fact, whether we suppose them                to have grown
  near the spot where         they arc found, or to have been carried
  thither from different parts by the force                  of   an impelling
  flood,   it is equally       difficult    to  conceive      how organized
 beings, which, in order to live, require                such    a  vast    differ
 ence in temperature         and    in seasons, could live on the fame
 spot, or how their remains could (from                  climates      so   widely
 distant)    be brought together         in the fame place by one com
 mon dislocating: cause.           To this ancient order of          fossil  vc<re-
 tables belong whatever           retains    a vegetable     (hape,      found in
 or near coal mines, and (to judge from the places where
 they have       been    sound)      the   greater   part    of  the      agatized
 woods.       But from    the species and present state            of   the trees,
 which    are the subject      of this memoir,        and    from the situa
 tion and nature of the foil in which they are found, it stems
 very clear that they do not belong to the primeval order                        of
 vegetable ruins.
     The  second order      of   fossil vegetables,     comprehends those
.which     are found     in the      strata   of clay or     sand ; materials
 which    are the    result   of flow      depositions    «f  the sea and        of
rivers, agents still at work under the present constitution of
                                                                               our

 our planet. These vegetable remains arc found in such flat
 countries     as may be considered            to be of a new formation.
The     vegetable      organization     still   subsists, at least in part;
 and   their vegetable substance has suffered a change only in
 colour, smell, or confidence ; alterations which are produced
 by the development of their oily and bituminous parts, or
 by their natural progress towards rottenness.                  Such are the
 fossil vegetables      found in Cornwall         by Borlasc    ;  in  Essex by
Derham       ;  in Yorkshire      by De la Pryme and Richardson; and
 in foreign countries          by other naturalists.       These vegetables
are found at different depths, some               of them much below the
present level       of  the sea,    but in clayey or sandy strata (evi
dently belonging to modern formation) ; and have no doubt
been carried from their original place, and deposited there                    by
the force      of great   rivers or currents, as it has been observed
with    respect to the Mississippi *.            In many    instances,     how
ever,    these trees and         shrubs    arc found     standing on their
 roots, and generally         in low or marsliy      places above,      or very
little below, the        level of the sea.
    To this      last description     of   fossil vegetables      the  decayed
trees here described          certainly belong.        They   have not been
transported       by currents or rivers;         but, though standing in
their native foil, we cannot suppose the level in which they
are sound to be the same as that in which they grew.                           It
would be impossible for any of these trees or ssirubs to vege
tate so near the sea, and below the common level of its
water;     the waves         would cover such tracts           of land,      and
hinder any vegetation.             We cannot        conceive     that the sur
face   of  the ocean has ever been lower than                 it now     is ; on
the contrary, we are led, by numberless                 phenomena, to be
lieve that the level        of  the water    in our globe      is now below
what it was in former periods            :  we must therefore conclude,
that the forest here described grew in a level high enough to
permit its vegetation         j  and that     the force (whatever       it was)

2Q4                             0"   a Submarine Forest
which destroyed              it,   lowered        the level        of   the ground where             it
stood.
     There     is   a   force   of subsidence (particularly                   in   soft    ground),
which, being            a   natural consequence os gravity slowly though
perpetually operating, has its action sometimes                                         quickened
and rendered sudden                   by   extraneous           causes,      for instance            by
earthquakes.             The        slow effects         of this        force     of    subsidence
have      been accurately remarked                        in many places: examples
also   of    its sudden action are recorded                        in   almost every history
of   great earthquakes.                The        stiores     of Alexandria, according
to Dolomieu's            observations,             are   a    soot lower than they were,
in the time of the Ptolemies. Donati, in his Natural His
tory of the Adriatic, has remarked, seemingly with great ac
curacy, the effects                of this       subsidence         at Venice      ;    at Pola      in
Istria;      at Liss, Bua,           Zara, and Diclo, on the coast of Dal-
matia.        In England, Borlafe                  has given, in the Philosophical
Transactions*,           a      curious observation                of   a   subsidence,         of at
least sixteen feet, in the ground between Sampson                                         and Tres-
caw islands           in Scilly.           The      soft and low grounds between
the towns of Thornc and Gowle in Yorksliire,                                           a   space     of
many miles, has              so    much subsided in latter times, that some
old men of Thome affirmed,                          " that         whereas      they could be
fore   fee    little of the steeples (of Gowle),                            they now          fee   the
church-yard             walls."        The         instances        of similar         subsidence,
which might be mentioned,                         arc innumerable.
  The force of subsidence,                         suddenly          acting        by     means      of
some earthquake, seems to me the most probable cause to
which     the usual submarine situation                        of the    forest we are speak
ing of       may be ascribed-               It     affords      a   simple, easy explana
tion of      the matter; its probability                  is   supported          by   numberless
instances      of similar          events   ;     and    it   is   not liable to the strong
objections which exist against the hypothesis of the alternate
depression and elevation of the level of the ocean; an opinion
which,       to be credible, requires the support                            of   a   great   num-

     The      stratum            of foil,           sixteen       feet thick,        placed      above the
decayed           trees,         seems to remove the epoch                             of their firiking
and destruction, far beyond the reach of any historical know
ledge.         In      Cæsar's           time, the level of the North Sea appears
to have been the fame as in our days.                                             He mentions        the   se
paration of the Wahal branch of the Rhine, and its junc
tion to the Meuse ; noticing the then existing distance from
that junction to the                         sea,    which agrees,                according to D'An-<
villc's inquiries                 f,    with the actual                    distance.        Some of the
Roman             roads,          constructed,                according to the order of                    Au

ritime town of Belgium,                                  still exist, and reach                 the present
fliorej.           The description which                              Roman authors have left
us, of the coasts, ports, and mouth of rivers on both sides of
the north           sea,         agree in general                 with their present             state ;   ex
cept in the places ravaged by the inroads                                           of this      sea,   more
apt, from its   force, to destroy the surrounding countries
than to increase them,
     An       exact resemblance                       exists between               Maritime Flanders
and the opposite coast of England, both in point of elevation
above the sea, and                      of the internal               structure and arrangement
of     the soils.                On both            sides, strata          of clay,     silt,    and sand,
(often mixed with decayed vegetables), are found near the
surface ; anil, in both, these superior materials cover a very
deep stratum                of blucifh or dark-coloured clay, unmixed with
extraneous             bodies.       On both fides they are the lowermost

2$6         Submarine Forest on         the   East Coast os England*
on their respective       sides   of  the fame narrow sea.          These two,
countries are certainly coeval              ;   and  whatever proves that
Maritime Flanders has been for many ages out of the sea,
must, in my opinion, prove also that the forest we are speak
ing of    was long before        that time destroyed and buried under
a stratum      of foil.   Now it      seems proved      from historical re
cords, carefully collected by several learned members of the
Brussels Academy, that no material change has happened                         to
the lowermost        part of Maritime Flanders during the period
9s the last two thousand years*.
     I am therefore inclined to suppose the original catastrophe
which buried this forest to be of very ancient                     date ; but   I
suspect the inroad of the sea, which
                                                    uncovered,    the decayed
trees    of   the  islands    of   S.utton,    to be comparatively recent.
The     state   of the leaves and        of the timber,    and also the tra
 dition of the neighbouring people, concur to strengthen this,
 suspicion. Leaves, and other delicate parts of plants, though
 they may be long preserved in a subterraneous situation, can
 not remain uninjured when exposed to the action of the
 waves and       of the air.       The    people    of the country believe
 that their parisli-church once stood on the spot where the
 islets now are, and was submerged by the inroads of the sea,
  and that at low water their ancestors could even discover,
 its ruins ; that their present church was built to supply the
 place of that which the waves washed away, and that even
 their present clock belonged to the old church.                       So many
  concomitant       circumstances,       though    weak  testimonies, incline
  me to believe their report;            and to suppose that some         of  the,
  stormy inundations         of    the  North     Sea,  which     in these last
  centuries have washed away soch large tracts of land on its
  shores, took away a soil resting on clay, and, at last uncovered
  the trees which are the subject of this paper.
 the Belgic ridge.    The  petrified fruits of Shcppcy, and other impressions of
 tropical plants on this fide of the water, are well known.

Penmark and               various other countries of Europe, and which
in Lombardy destroyed                    a   great many            of these     useful animals,
induced the Council of Health at Pavia to make an inquiry
into the nature of                it,   and to cause the result to be published
 by   one     of their members,               Professor Brera,             in   a   small but     inn
teresting pamphlet under the title                             of Memoria           full'   attuale
EpiJcmia de Gattif.
  The cats attacked                      by   this    disease         seemed dejected             and
weak, and had an aversion to approach man                           crawled about
                                                                            ;

and could not endure any of the three plants of which they
are commonly                 so   fond, Marum verum, Valerian, and Cat's
mint.             In   the course       of    the disease the weakness and dull
ness increased; they could scared jQsupport themselves on,
their legs; their hair stood erect; they let their tail hang
down, and their head droop                            so   that their neck appeared as
if    prolonged;             their ears were flabby and cold;                            the      eyes
 seemed smaller, and the pupil                         contracted;              the tongue was

 companied with burning heat.                           They at length became like
 mere skeletons,                 were    seized      with violent convulsions, and
 generally died               on the fourth or fifth day                        of   the disease    j
 which, according to the symptoms, was nervous fever, ac                a

298                  On an Epidemical Disease among Cats.
  The method in which this disease was treated was entirely
Brownonian ; that                    is,
                    half an ounce of Cyprus wine, with                                             a
scruple        of   pulverised        valerian root, was given four times                    a   day
to the diseased           animals          :    aloes, and the      juice of garlic,         were
administered            in   some spiritous vehicle, and also fumigations
with vinegar.               The      proposal for destroying            every cat attacked
 by   this                   was, with great propriety, rejected                             but
                                                                                                   it it

was at the fame.time ordered,                            that those which died of
should be buried at sufficient depth in the earth
                                     a             that the                          ;
bodies should             with lime
                          be covered   and that the places      ;
where they were found dead should be washed with vinegar,
ley of wood-ashes, or lime-water.                                It    was    recommended
also to separate,                as much           as   possible,     found animals from
those infected          ;    to give them nourishing food                    ;    to lay before
them, in particular, their three favourite plants                                ;    and to     fu
migate them often with the steam of vinegar.
     That excellent physician                      and naturalist Professor Schacht,
of Hardervvyk, informed me,                             bya   letter dated    in May 1795,
that the cats in his neighbourhood                                  had for some weeks
been attacked               by   a   disease     which bore some resemblance                       to,
a    prurient eruption.                    The violent itching           occasioned          a   de-
fluxion of the eyes, which continually watered,                                      and they at
length became blind                  ;     their teeth at the fame               time dropped
out, and they died soon after with lamentable cries.                                     It      had
been observed             in the preceding months,                      from February to
April, that their            cries         in   the night-time,        on account of their
pairing, had been extraordinarily strong and loud.
     Dr. Darwin,             in   his Zoonomia            *,   mentions another epide-
mia which prevails at times among the cats, and which he
calls Parotidis felina.    announces itself Itviolent fever              by  a
with inflammation, and abundant suppuration     the region                       in
of the salival glands beneath the lower jaw. He compares
it   to   a   disease   lately known called the Mumps (Angina paro-
\ided)> and
                     is  inclined to believe that was first communi

I   N   most drawing-schools,                     and      particularly those at             a   dis
tance from the capital, many difficulties are experienced for
want of good crayons. Those sawed from red chalk, which
are     in   common use, are almost                         always hard, gritty,                 and
often of an unequal consistency                        ;    so   that the touches in the
drawings for which they are used can never have the strength
or correctness necessary to produce the desired effect. The
only    good crayons used                   in France        are manufactured exclu
sively at Paris,           where they are fold very dear                   :   the best fort
have been long known                      by   the name of the paste crayons                      of
Defmarets, who apparently was the inventor.                                 As no author
who has written on the composition of these crayons has
pointed out the proportions of the ingredients necessary to
be used,     I     made many trials               with      every combination                of the
substances                  to me proper for making them.
                   that appeared
I   rejected those products which did not answer the objects
of my         research    ;    and    I     here       subjoin those mixtures that
gave me satisfactory                 results.
  These pencils are composed of the softer kind of reddle,
which     an oxyde of iron mixed with earth of an argilla
             is
ceous nature, and called hematites, or bog-ore.   must be                         It

gum, size, or resin             ;     to which sometimes soap     added, to    is

 soften the composition.          Instead    of  reddle the other red      ox-
 ydes  of iron may      be used, such as colcothar            of vitriol, &c. ;
 and in that cafe they should be chosen soft to the touch, and
of   a lively  colour; for       those used      in commerce         are often
 mixed with too much clay, which gives them a dull yellowish
 cast that ought to be avoided.             I  attempted       to incorporate
these substances with the         whites of eggs      and the albumen        of
blood; but crayons composed in this manner were not good.
    The   best reddle,   in lumps,     should be selected and ground
with pure water on a marble flab, as is done in the prepa
ration of colours for painting ; taking care to moisten it at
much as is necessary to make the grinding stone glide, and
to employ as little water as possible. When it is intended to
prepare a large quantity        of this   substance,      this operation be
comes very difficult and expensive            :   in that    cafe a different
method must be used.             Tbe    reddle     must    be pounded and
fisted through a fine sieve, then diluted with a large quantity
of water in    a trough; where,         after   it   has been     well stirred
round, it should be left a few minutes to settle, in order that
the grosser particles      may precipitate themselves to the bot
tom. The water, which is strongly impregnated with the finer
particles, is then poured off, and suffered to settle for twenty-
four hours.      The clear water on the top is then poured off
again, and a very sine sediment will thus be obtained, which
must be ppunded and washed once more. The sediment of
the first washing must be treated in the like manner, and the
process is repeated until the whole be reduced to the utmost
fineness,
   The gum,      size,   or soap, destined         to give    the crayon the
necessary    degree    of solidity,     must     be dissolved      separately.
These solutions must be carefully mixed with the pounded
reddle, and the watery particles must be evaporated by being
exposed to the sun or to the heat           of  a gentle fire, taking care
to turn the   paste often    till it has acquired       a consistence some
what harder than butter         :  the crayons are. then to be formed
jn  the moulds.
                                                                          The

                          from     the Paste    of Reddle.                  301
      The moulding may             be performed two ways        :  the first is,
  to spread out the paste on a board, in which are cut grooves
  rather broader at the top and round at bottom; and of
  any length,      size, and depth, proportioned to the intended
  size  of  the crayons.          The    second,   which is the better me
  thod, is to force the      paste   through    a pipe or funnel of an ori
  fice equal to the size       of  the crayon.      The   paste thus formed
  may be left to dry (lowly in              a cool place under the fliade,
 in   order to prevent cracks, which too hasty desiccation              might
 produce.       When       the rods are dry, they are to be cut into
 pieces   of  the desired length       :   the edges must    then be taken
 off;   after which they must receive the first cutting,              to givft
 them a blunt point.             The     last operation is to scrape them,
 in order    to take off the hard outward coat formed on the sur
 face while they are drying,             and which would prevent them
 from making any marks.               It   may be necessary to rub a small
 portion of oil into the grooves of the wood, that the paste
 tnav not adhere too closely to the moulds.
     Gum arabic        and    isinglass     are the two substances      to be
 preferred    for mixing      with    the powder.       It will  be sufficient
 to dissolve the gum and soap in cold water; but the isinglass
 must first be cut into small pieces,            then put into hot water,
 and dissolved in balnco marine.                These solutions     should be
 well diluted with water, that they may be made to                         pass
 through    a  hair  sieve   in order to remove any foreign particles.
 As it is difficult to incorporate the paste with the isinglass,
they must both be heated and mixed over a fire with a heat
equal to that     of boiling water. The paste must be well mixed
before it is    moulded, in order that it may be uniformly in
corporated      with the solution, and that there may not remain
any hard lumps.           The     best way would be to beat it         with a
pestle or mallet, and to pound it again for some time before
it is put into the moulds.
     No  soap must be employed             but for those crayons in which
gum is used.       In all   the trials     I have  made with isinglass and
                                                                        soap.

Jo 2        On the Preparation       of Crayons for Drawing,
soap,     not one    of them      succeeded   : and  it must necessarih'
be   so ;  for, the excess of alkali in the soap, operating on
the gelatinous matter, destroys its agglutinating quality. As
 the crayons for which soap has been used are of a browner
 cast,   it would    appear   that this combination         abstracts  the
 oxygen from a part         of   the red oxyde    of iron,    and gives  it
 a brown       tint by making it approach the           state  of martial
 æthiops.       I have remarked, that all the pastes prepared with
 oxyde of iron,      even when pure water alone is used, grow
 brown on the exterior surface           as they dry  :  this takes place
in   a more sensible manner when they are exposed to the
 action    of the  sun ; which seems to arise from the light           ab
 stracting a portion     of oxygen from the oxyde of iron.              At
some future period       I shall enter into a farther inquiry respect
ing   the  chemical    properties of these preparations ; but at pre
 sent  I  shall content myself with pointing           out the processes
which      have    constantly succeeded with me, and in such a
way that they may be put in practice any where with suc
 cess.
    The crayons       composed     in this manner       have even7 good
property that can be desired ; they do not cost one quarter
•the  common price       : but it must be observed, that their com
position requires great nicety in regard to the quantity of the
 materials, because the least variation occasions considerable
 difference in the quality of the paste.           Particular care must
also be taken to guard against the errors that may arise from
ithe waste, which is unavoidable during the course             of the ope
ration.      The   hest means to prevent it      will be, to six by ex
periments the quantity of water and of ingredients which
the pounded reddle and the solutions form before the mix
tures are made. By means of the following tables, which
 exhibit the quantity of ingredients to be used for the different
 kinds of crayons, it will be easy to know what proportion of
 gum, isinglass,      or soap, must be employed for a determined
 quantity of reddle, or red oxyde of iron.

     I. Dry    reddle, or red oxyde     of iron,  1 ounce;    gum arabic,
tlry,     18 grains. — These crayons are very tender, but they
 may be employed for large designs.                 As they   are the kind
 in which       the least gum is used, they have not sufficient con
 sistence for any other purpose.
      II.  Reddle, &c.      1 ounce; gum    21  grains. — Strong crayons,
 a little tender,     but excellent for large drawings.
      III.   Reddle    1  ounce, gum 24 grains, or rather 25I grains.
  —Soft and solid crayons : they are the best that can be em
  ployed for common use.
      IV.    Reddle     1   ounce, gum 27 grains. — Crayons rather
  firm, but not hard ; useful for drawings that require delicacy.
      V. Reddle      1   ounce, gum 30 grains. —Very firm crayons,
  proper for drawings in which every stroke is intended to be
  given.
       VI.   Reddle    1  ounce, gum 33 grains. — Very hard crayons,
   which cannot be used without some force. The largest quan
   tity of gum that can be employed is used in their composi
   tion : with more they would be useless.
       VII.    Reddle    1  ounce, gum 22 grains, white hard soap 30
   grains. —These crayons have a little browner cast than the
   former    ;  they are of a very good consistence, and can be easily
   cut.    All   crayons, however, in the composition of which soap
   is employed, are attended with this fault, that the strokes they
    make have a mining appearance if the touches are repeated
   a little   too strongly.       No other experiment with         soap suc
    ceeded.      These crayons have a perfect resemblance            to those
    made by Desmarets.
        VIII.    Reddle     1  ounce, isinglass 3S grains. — Crayons of
    a brilliant colour, and excellent for use.           If less isinglass is
    employed they become brittle; and           if more, they  are too hard.

  could be easily put together, and which should correct itself
  at each observation         like an astronomical instrument, were
  the reasons which         induced      M. Humbolt           to devise the pre
 sent construction.        Tralles, the learned astronomer                of Berne,
 has judiciously observed,           that all barometers         are liable to be
 broken when the tube is fixed to the scale which belongs to
 it. In Humbolt's barometer the tube is distinct from the
 scale ; and when the tube breaks, its place can be supplied
 by another even on the top             of   a mountain.         The tube, the
 lower part of which is represented by abc (fig.                   i. pi. VII.)    is
 cemented     into an iron one be, two inches long, terminating
 in a nut   c,  which     receives a screw to the depth              of   2\  lines :
 the end of    the screw is square.           When the tube is          silled  with
 mercury,     and screwed        close,    it is put into a tube of copper
 lined with flannel, and covered on the outside with leather.
This   cafe may be carried as a cane ; the head                   d of   the screw
 being kept, as far as possible,             in  a vertical position,         if the
entrance of air be apprehended,                it will    lodge   itself under d.
 In  that case turn the screw and pour a drop                  of mercury upon
it  before it is (but.       The whole         tube     may be examined to
fee that the mercury is not separated by air bubbles ; an ad
vantage wanting         in the English barometers, in which the
tubes are hal    t  concealed.        The mahogany pillar egf (fig. 2 .)
contains the mercury, to            be poured into it after it has been
screwed into its stand         gb    (fig-  3.), supported by three feet
that fold over each other.             The interior part of the column
forms a hollow          parallelopipedon,           the square       aperture     of
which is exactly       equal in size to the square            of the    screw ed.
In pushing     the tube     ilma      (fig. 4.) into this aperture until
ed be above the level of the mercury, you turn the tube to
the right, by laying hold           of it with      one    hand between         Im.

three screws          rrr    until the vertical position of the instrument

meter is placed isl the aperture                     of   the cock s, and you                        will
have a conjldnt level by opening that cock and suffering the
mercury,          which       you must collect in a small vase, to flow
down.       In order that           the ivory cock         $   may not open                 of itself,

position to prevent it.                 When the           observation                    made, you

walking; or you dismount                  the instrument            by   again pushing the
tube    klm (unscrewed at m and                    /)     to the bottom             of     the pillar
/,   where you turn the square ed.                        The Torricellian vacuum
is   by   these means silled,             and you turn the tube to the left,
holding      it      with your hand between               /    and m until                 you ob
serve that ed has caught,                  and    that the aperture of the tube

in   order      to inclose         it   in its cafe.        There        is  a     lose     of   a   few
drops     of mercury which                adhere       to the iron.               One of          these,
instruments, constructed                  two years ago,               has    remained un

    These instruments are now               made      at Berlin,     Weimar,
Dresden, Vienna,         and Paris.       On coming from           a cold to a
very warm        temperature     the screw ed must be loosed before
you approach the fire.          This instrument has            an advantage
bv which       it is distinguished     from all others       :  it is the only
one in which the size of the Torricellian               vacuum depends on
the observer : the height of the mercury remains the fam*
to whatever depth it be plunged in the mercury, provided
you take care each time to adjust the level by the cock.
Muscati has proved, that the barometric height is affected
bv the size of the vacuum on account of the attraction of the
glass in  i,    and because the minimum              of air which the       va
cuum contains is more or             less  dilated.       In Humbolt's      ba
rometer, the fame Torricellian            vacuum exists on the tops of
the mountains as       in  the valleys.
    The different    pieces   of which this instrument             consists are
contained in one cvlinder,            which      mav be carried on the
shoulder    like a fuzee.      Several     tubes may be contained also
in    a walking-stick.        Having for two years measured the
 height of different mountains with Humbolt's barometer,
 and   others    constructed    on the old principles,             no sensible
 differences    were observed,     though this operation, for various
 reasons explained by Treniblay,             is still very far from perfec
 tion.

  OOME        new facts, lately discovered,           seem to fliew that the
 immediate cause which excites the electric fluid, and puts it
  in motion, whether it be an attractive or a repulsive power, i>
 to be ascribed much rather to the mutual contact                   of two dif
  ferent metals,     than to their contact with n oist conductors.
  But, though it cannot        be denied that        in  the latter cafe there
 exist* an action, it is proved that it exerts itself in a far more

 •onsiderable      degree when the two metals mutually touch each
 other.      There arises by the mutual contact, for example, of
  silver and tin, an action or power by               which    the former com
 municates the electric fluid, and the latter receives it                   ; or the
 silver suffers     it  to escape, and the tin attracts          it.    This pro
 duces,      when the         circle   is   rendered     complete by moist
 conductors,        a stream,     or continual circulation of the fluid.
 When the circle is complete, there is an accumulation in the
 tin at the expence of the silver ; which indeed is very small,
 and far under the point necessary to enable it to announce
 itself by the most delicate              electrometer.       I  have     however
 been able, by the assistance           of my      condenser,    constructed      on
 a new    plan, and still better by Nicholson's            Doubler, to render
it very perceptible        :   I (hall here communicate the result ob
 tained by my experiments, which                 I  made some time ago          with
 great satisfaction.
      Exper. I. The          three   plates    of   the doubler are       of   brass.
 I   took two strong wires, one             of  silver and    the other       of tin,
 and    brought       the former into contact with the moveable
plate, and the other          with one of      the fixed plates;       while they
 both rested on the table, or, what is better, on moist                       paste
board, or any other moist conductor,                  so as to be    in commu
nication      by the intervention of one or more conductors                        of
the second class.          I  suffered    the apparatus       to remain some
hours in this state, then removed the two wires, and put the
machine in motion.               After ao, 30, or 40 revolutions, (or
more when the atmosphere                   was not dry, or the insulation
imperfect,)       I   brought one of my straw electrometers into
contact with the moveahle plate, and observed indications of
positive electricity (        r E) which      arose to 4, 6, 10 degrees, and
more.       1 fI   suffered it to touch the fixed           plates,     I  had the
corresponding indications of the opposite kind of electricity
 (-E).
     The  silver, therefore,      poured     the elastic fluid into the brass
plate when       it  had been some time in contact with                   it;   and
the tin attracted it from the other plate, which                      .vas also   oi

following experiment, which                           is a real experimentum            cruets.
     II. I    reversed the          experiment,               so   that the silver was in
contact with one of the fixed plates,                                 and the      tin with the
moveable one.                The electricity which                    I   obtained from the
latter, after the apparatus had remained a sufficient time in
that position, was negative                        (— E); while that of the fixed
plate was positive                ( +   E).
     III. I applied         only the tin wire to the moveable plate, and
insulated          the    two fixed ones,                or brought them into com
munication           with         the    table     or any other moist conductor*
with which           the tin wire was in contact.                         This    simple contact
of    the tin with the brass,                 of which             the moveable plate con
sists,      is sufficient to excite              in it    a very small degree            of    nega
tive electricity ; only a longer time is required.
     Those acquainted with the action of electric atmospheres,
and the construction                     of   the doubler,               will   need no farther
explanation to enable them to comprehend the mode                                              of ac
tion of this very ingenious instrument;                                   how the electricity,-
once        obtained from the moveable plate, must occasion an
opposite       kind in the fixed plates,                           and vice versa ; how the
opposite kinds of electricity are increased by each revolution
of    the machine,           &c.         In the         present experiment, therefore,
when the moveable plate is — E, the fixed plate must be -f                                         E.
      III.   This        is the reverse          of    the former.              The   piece    of tin
 was applied             to one    of   the fixed plates, and the moveable one
 was insulated from all metallic contact.                                  The    result was now-
 reversed      ;   that     is,   the fixed plates were electrified negatively,
 and the moveable one had positive electricity.
      All    these experiments succeed much better, and                               in a    stiorter
 time,       if,   during the mutual contact                        of    the different metals,
 the moveable plate he opposite to either                                 of   the other two that
 are fixed     ;    but still belter when                 a   piece      of thick     paper,     such
 as   a   card, not moist, and                   of   a      thickness equal to the inter
 mediate space,             is    placed      between          the       two plates that stand
 opposite to each other.                      It   is   of    advantage         to leave the card
                                                                                                some

some time     in  its place, and not to remove it                till  the moment
when the metals in contact are removed                        and     the    machine
put in motion.           To render the insulation complete, and
make the contact of the metals immediate, without the least
moisture, which would be highly prejudicial, it will be pro
per to place     the apparatus       in the fun.          Half     an     hour, and
often less, will then be sufficient to obtain the required
electricity, &c. ; whereas, in other cafes, several hours are
necessary before       the desired result can be obtained.                       A  re
presentation of this experiment               is exhibited by fig. 21, 22,
23 and 24,      (Plate    I.)   LLL      (fig. 21 and 22)             are the three-
brass plates     of   the doubler;        A   the piece        of  silver which       is
in contact with          one    of  these plates;           Elbe       piece of tin
applied to the other plate, which is opposite to the former •
ma the moist conductor, or chain of moist conductors
which form         a  communication           with      the     pieces      of metal.
When      the silver, as in fig. 21, is in contact with                     the ante
 rior moveable      plate,    it gives up to it        a   little of the electric
 fluid, and the latter accumulates             as    much of it as possible •
 consequently the electricity          of  the plate becomes              positive,   as
 the sign + of the plate shews            :   whereas        the tin attracts       the
 electric fluid from the corresponding fixed plate,                          which by
 these means has negative           electricity,     as the sign
                                                                        (
                                                                          —    ) of the
 plate indicates ; and it even communicates this electricity to
 the other fixed plate, which therefore has the sign                       (
                                                                             — also.
                                                                                 )
     In fig. 22, every thing is reversed           :   the moveable plate is
 negatively electrified (—         E), while       the two fixed plates be
 come, positive     (+ E).
     Lastly, in the 23d and 24th figure, it is seen, that the tin
 abstracts the electric fluid from the brass plate with which
 it is in contact.       This    plate   is therefore         negatively electri
 fied, or has   — E;       aud by the action          of  its atmosphere occa

terwards with each revolution of the machine                                 ;    the action of
which, according             to the theory          of electric         atmospheres,          pro
duces this effect to the degree                        mentioned, and justifies the
appellation of doubler of electricity, which has been given to
this instrument,
     I   now come to the experiments, which mow that we are to
seek for the cause which calls forth the action                                  of the electric
fluid ; which excites               it,   of whatever kind            it     be  ;     determines
its transition, &c. much rather in the mutual contact of the
metals, than in the contact of the moist                                   conductors with
these metals.  Though, according to every circumstance,
we must admit some action of this kind in the latter contact,
itcannot be denied that the former    certainly the most ef  is
fectual.          At    present   I    shall only mention the two following
experiments, which                I    contrived        in   such   a   manner that they
may serve to explain               a   question of this kind.
     V.  left the two fixed plates of brass without making any
         I
alteration took off the third mcveable plate, and supplied its
                  ;
place        by   one of tin    ;   and arranged             the     machine in such                a
manner that the latter stood opposite                               to one        of    the   other
two plates.            I   then applied to this tin plate                    a    bit of brass,
and to the opposite                fixed plate      of   brass      a   piece     of tin.         Af
ter      a   convenient time, (for example an hour, when the wea
ther was perfectly dry,)          took away the two pieces of me
                                       I
tal, or only that of brass, and made the moveable plate of
tin, which was in contact with the piece of brass, to revolve
about thirty times.                It     then gave me very perceptible marks,                          .
pf    positive electricity,
     VI.     I    reversed the former experiment, and made the piece
of brass touch            the brass plate, and the piece                   of tin      the plate   of
the fame metal.            I,   however, obtained nothing, or almost no
thing        ;   even when the apparatus                   was      left   a      much longer
time         in   that situation, and when the machine                                 had    madt
twice or three times as many revolutions.
  These two experiments arc represented                                 by   sig. 25 and 26         :
where        L    is   the piece     of    brass   3   E     that of tin; and a               a   tne
                                                                                              moist

moist conductors which connect the two different pieces of
metal.
     In   the arrangement             of fig.   26, the fame contact              of differ
ent metals, viz. brass on the one side, and tin on the other,
with the fame kind of moist conductor, takes place,                                 as   well
as   in the preceding experiment ,of fig. 25.                           The addition of
the electric fluid in the one, and the abstraction                           of it in     the
other, ought therefore equally to take place, though in an in
verted order, when the action on the fluid calls forth the
moving power, by this contact of the two metals                                  L, E, with
the moist conductor between them                         ;     and yet this is not the
cafe, as no signs            of electricity     are obtained even after a long
time, and when the machine has been caused to make twice
or three        times       as   many revolutions.                 The condition     essen
tially necesfery to obtain electricity that the different me is,
tals must be in contact with each other, which      the cafe in             is
fig. 25, but not in sig. 26.
   When the machine has been repeatedly                                    turned, some
thing may be obtained. This                      arises either from some small
remains of old electricity, which could not                             be destroyed       or
dissipated in the time duringw hich the arrangement                               of fig. 26
was continued;               or even from fresh electricity, which                        the
movcable plate may have obtained from the atmosphere or
vapours during the pretty considerable time of the machine
being
          in
          a         state   of revolution   ;   or some accidental difference,
fither between the two tin or the two brass pieces, may be
the cause of some action on the cleft ric fluid, or of some de
rangement           in   regard to the equilibrium.                   In   the last place,
the contact  of the moist conductor with the tin on the one
side, or with the brass on the other, may have      different                 a
action, which, in my opinion,  must be very small, but  yet                                is
not entirely without effect.
     As   it   is   now proved        that, according to the arrangement
of   the sixth experiment,   nothing, or almost nothing,     ob                     is
tained     by   40, 60, and even 80 revolutions of the doubler,
while     a    great deal  obtained
                                 is    that of the fifth with 20

metals of a different kind with moist conductors, without
the mutual contact of these metals themselves,                      (which is
wanting in the sixth experiment,                 where brass    is in contact
with      brass,    and tin     with tin,) produces nothing or almost
 nothing      5  and that, on the contrary,           the mutual contact     of
 the two metals of             a different kind,       which   takes place   in
 the fifth experiment, produces the whole,                     or almost    the
 whole, effect,

      belonging      to  the Vaccine Disease.          By George Pear-,

    JL  HE      collection of testimonies        which    I published, in No-r
 vember last, in my Inquiry concerning the Hislory os the Cow-<
 pox 3 and the Circular Letter, which I issued in March,
 stating the progress of the Vaccine Inoculation, and contain
  ing thread impregnated with matter, have procured me much
  information.         In particular, through        the recommendation       of
  the Surgcoiirgeneral,           Thomas     Keatc, 1-sq. the new practice
  has been introduced into the             army; of which        a valuable re
  port has been already communicated.                     I have been also so
   fortunate as to. obtain permission          to  practise the new inocula
   tion   in certain situations where great numbers would have
   been inoculated for the small-pox.                  The cases from these
   sources, and a pretty 'large stock from private practice, form
   a valuable bo.iy        of  evidence,    by means of which the profes
             public will      be enabled    to eitinjate
   sional                                                   (I do not sav pre
    cisely)   the value of the new prailicc ; and also answer many
    of the queries, and supply some of the deficient parts of the
    history of the vacciqe disease, which were stated in the                 J«-
    quiry above mentioned.              But such arc mv occupations at
    present, and in all likelihood such they will be for a confu
    ilcrable timcj that      I cannot    at this time arrange, for the use     of

               Exptrinunls reflecting           the Vaccine Disease.                 3T3
the public,          the valuable materials transmitted to me.                          It
will, however,           perhaps     be not without           utility    at this time
first to state a few general             results from the vaccine inocula
tion ; and secondly,             to relate some trials, from              which     I ap
prehend conclusions can warrantably be drawn to promote
 the investigation now going forward.
     Not much more than six months have elapsed since the
 opportunity was afforded, by the breaking out of the vaccine
 disease in two principal
                                    milch farms          near  London, of obtain
 ing matter for propagating the fame disease among human
 creatures. The new inoculation was immediately introduced
 in London,           and    soon   afterwards in the neighbourhood,                     as
  well     as   in many provincial            situations.        It is with        sincere
  satisfaction that we can now reckon, at the fewest, 3000 per
  sons who have passed through the cow-pox by inoculation.
  But in this number I include                  the very large         proportion fur-
  nilhed by him who,              so   beneficially to the public,              and ho
  nourably to himself,           possesses     the office of physician to the
  Small-pox Hospital. From                 the above experience              we receive,
  as   I  expected,      important information,
       1.   Of   the above number it appears that one patient died                         j
   (Woodville's Reports, p. 151.)                     and    to avoid controversy,
  let us allow that the death was occasioned                       solely by the ino
   culation.         Now, according          to the justest        calculation      I  have
   been     able to mike, as in             the inoculated small-pox                one   in
   yoo *     dies from the disease, it is evident,               in   the present      state
                                                                                           of
      *   I am   fully aware that   so great a proportion       as one in 300    will not  be
   allowed by many practitioners.          And    to persons who have been         told, and
   bulieve, that inneu lation for the small-pox          " scarcely ever docs any harm"
   — that certain practitioners have inoculated many thousands without losing
   a patient— that others have told their         friends   " they never lind 3 fatal ino
   culated     cafe in their whole   lives" — 1 fay    to such persons, no advantage, on
   the score of saving life,      will  be allowed      from the cow-pox.       But   1 have
   conversed with many candid and. experienced                practitioners,   and they are
   veil    satisfied that  I am warranted in the above statement of deaths in the
   Inoculated
                  variola.    I beg  leave to fay farther,       that  I believe more per-
                                                                                 c       sou*

    314           Progress     of the   Vaccine Inoculation,          and
   of  the practice, that the proportion                of  fatal cases    in the     in«v»
   culated small-pox, to the inoculated cow-pox,                       is as 10 to 1.
      2.    The constitutional affection, or              fever,   which occurs in
   the cow-pox          about the 9th day after inoculation, 19 much
  more considerable in many cases than was apprehended from
  the first account by Dr. Jenner, although in                       a great     propor
  tion of      cafes it is extremely slight, and               in many cannot be
  observed at all.          But   I must correct my statement in March
  last,   in which I       said,
                                   " Although the extreme cases of the
 severe kind, which ordinarily occur in the same number of
  cases in the inoculated small-pox, did not occur in the new
  practice, and although many of the patients were even more
  slightly disordered constitutionally, yet the whole amount of
  the constitutional illness seemed to be as great as in the fame
 number of patients in the inoculated small-pox."                           Since that
 report, or at least for the last four months,                  as far as   I   have ob
 served and been able to learn from others, the whole amount
  of   the constitutional         illness was not one half of the whole
  amount in an equal number of patients inoculated for the
  small-pox.         Now, whether the           greater mildness        of  the disease
 depended on the different state                of  the human constitution               in
  the summer from that of winter,                    as  seems to me most pro
 bable      ;  or that it depended          on the difference in the              state  of
 the vaccine matter, must be determined by future experience
 in   the fame seasons.
     3. The       most remarkable difference               in the practice of the
 last winter, and present summer, has                    been with regard to the
eruptions which            so   often occurred, especially in the Small
 pox Hospital j which eruptions, in many instances,                           could not
sons    in proportion     have died of the inoculated          small- pox within a few
years, than died in the fame time 20 years ago.              And this   may be account
ed for from the unwarrantable          assertions  of many inoculators,       from whom
a great part      of the public have imbibed        the opinion,    that the inoculated
sttiali-pox     W3i not attended with any danger;           hence the practice is often
trusted in the hands of persons         not sufficiently   acquainted with the treat»
vent     sit fur different slates of the human constitution.
                                                                                        fae

            Experiments rejjecling the Vaccine Disease.                   31^
  be distinguished    from those of the small-pox, and which were
  wholly   unexpected     from the original description by Dr.           Jen-
  ner.    No explanation hitherto given              consists  with the ob
  servations  relative to these eruptive cases          :  but the facts are
  as  Dr. Woodville       states   (Med. Mag.), that they have oc
  curred much     less  frequently this summer than in the spring
  and winter preceding.         In my private practice, not a           single
  case  with eruptions resembling           the   small-pox has occurred
  these last four months, and but a small proportion                with any
  eruptions of other kinds.           From my correspondents          I   have
  not had a single cafe of eruptions like the variolous since that
  of Dr. Redfearne's of Lynn ; not one of this fort in Mr. Kel
  son's, of Seven Oaks, report of about 100 patients ; not one
  in Dr. Mitchell's, of Chatham,              of about 50 patients ; not
  one in the report of near 100 patients from Dr. Harrison of
  Horncastle, communicated to the Rt. Hon. Sir Joseph,
  Banks   ;  and, in sliort, not one cafe with these eruptions ap
  pears in the accounts from my other correspondents.
      4. The arms have manifested, in many instances,                a  much
  more extensively      spreading     red areola around the inoculated
  part than is usual in the small-pox              ;  which    redness some
  times extended over the greater part of the whole arm. This
  appearance    is very alarming to both the patient and the               in
  experienced practitioner       5  but no danger seems to be attend
  ant on such a    state  of  the parts,     for it disappears    in  at most
  two or three days, by no means gives pain in proportion to
  its appearance,     and,    in  the   cafes   I   have   seen, affects   the
  constitution very little.        I  woult! rather call this spreading
   redness of the skin erythema than erysipelas.                As to phage-
  denic ulcers, as they have been called, ensuing from the
   inoculated part, many sore arms            have    been    produced ; but
  nine out of ten were occasioned,          or at least much aggravated,
  by the tightness of the clothes        ; by  allowing the linen to slick
  to the fore: by scratching the pustule; and sometimes by emol
  lient poultices.     The   experience    we have had, then, since        Ja-
'
  jmary last, in London and' « the country, does not agree ex
                                                                         actly

  arms  :  he thinks    some new applications       of a  caustic nature
 necessary', in many cases, to prevent secondary symptoms from
 the fores; but in Dr. Woodville's Report, p. 155, my cor
 respondents, and my own practice, there has not been found
 any want of applications for such        a purpose.
    5. Concerning the important point of the certainty of
 the action of the cow-pox on the human constitution in
 producing unsusceptibility of taking subsequently the small
 pox ; I can only at present say, that I have inoculated many
scores with small-pox matter after the vaccine disease, and
 never with the effect      of exciting the small-pox.       But I   have
 had accounts sent to me, not        of people taking the small-pox
 after the inoculated cow-pox,        but of these taking     the small
pox after the cow-pox         in the  casual   way.    I  have, indeed,
 been desired to see even some        of my own patients who,            I
was acquainted, had taken the small-pox after the cow-pox ;
 but these cases turned out to be either those in which the
cow-pox had not in reality preceded,             or they were    cases  of
merely local affection from the inoculated small-pox.               With
respect    to the facts  of other practitioners, I    sliall at a future
time make some remarks on them, to render their accounts
consistent     with   those  of Dr. Jenner, Dr. Woodville, and
mine.       In the mean time I will not allow that any per
son's evidence      is on this point much to be depended upon,
unless    he really know     what are characters of the cow-pox
pustule, and what are those         of the variolous and     some other
common eruptions.
    From the preceding general results,         without entering into
s  more particular account,        I think   we may safely conclude,
that the cow-pox inoculation is attended with advantages suf
ficient to force its way speedily into general practice, and that
of course it will  supersede and ultimately extinguish the small
pox: but this conclusion is only drawn provisionally,          w. that
no new facts shall arise adverse to the experience now         possessed .
   With     regard to the second object     of this  paper,    Dr. Jen-
                                           8                         ner.

             Experiments resfccling the Vaccine Disease.                                    317
tier, very usefully to human society, and very honourably to
himself, first published some facts, which I thought it my
duty, in common with other members of the profession,                                         to
investigate,     and have laid before the public.                             Among        these
fails the 4th and 5th were asserted by me in these terms :
   IV. A person having been afftcled -with the specific fever
and local       disease      produced        by the    cow-pox poison, is liable to
be   again affecled, as before,                by   (be fame poison ; and yet such
person is not susceptible             of the small-pox.
     V. A    person is susceptible             of     the cow-pox who has antece
dently   been    affcQed with            the   small-pox.
   Neither of       these facts being supported by any analogy, a
great part of       the public seemed inclined to disbelieve                             them ;
and not only inclined to disbelieve                        these facts,       but the credit
of   the others was             for obvious reasons thereby weakened.
It   may be seen in my Inquiry,                       that   I   thought the assertions
 stood in need      of confirmation,                which        I   was not only unable
 to procure, but contravening evidence was obtained.                                      Some
of my     correspondents              not only         asserted      that men were not
affected more than once, but that the                                fame    cows had not
 been known to be affected more than once.                                      It   was    also
positively     asserted      by some, that
                                                       "   a person         is not liable to
the infection       of    the cow-pox after going through the small
pox, (p. 40, Inquiry :) and I saw persons pitted with the
small -pox who had been much exposed to the cow-pox
 without taking           it,   {Ibid.   p.    50.)        Notwithstanding           my con
 fidence in     Dr. Jenner's           evidence,       I     could not help pointing
 out, in the following words, what                    I    apprehended         was   a    source
 of error in both         cases   :— " The                  for this fact (viz*
                                                      evidence
 IV.),   to my apprehension,                  only proves satisfactorily that the
 local affection of the cow- pox may occur in the fame person
 more than once      but whether the peculiar fever also occurs
                         ;
 more than once in the fame person from the cow-pox poison
 does not appear certain, and must be determined    future                           by
observations       made          with    a     particular view to this point."
 Farther:    I   was       so   dissatisfied that      I     wrote to        Dr. Jenner       to
                                                                                         answer

 occurring more than once in the fame person, it was certain
 that the specific fever was present more than once > The
 Doctor very obligingly answered my letter,               and says,   (fee
 Dr. Jenner's Lettar, p. 99. of my Inquiry?)             "  You may     be
 assured that a person may be repeatedly         affected    both locally
 and generally by the cow-pox           ; two instances      of which     I
 have adduced,      and  have    many more in my recollection."
 But   he very candidly adds :
                                   " Nevertheless,     on this import
ant point    I  have some reason to suspect, that my discrimina
 tions have not been, till lately, sufficiently nice."
    With respect to Fact V. I said in my Inquiry, p. 49 : '« It
seems sufficiently authenticated that people may have the
 cow-pox     after  they have had the small-pox ; but it will         ce->
 quire more nice attention to satisfy the q-iery, Whether, in
 such cases, the cow-pox affects the whole constitution, or is
 only a local affection?"        Subsequently to this observation        I
 find Dr. Jenner himself, from a theoretical consideration,
 offers as a
               "  conjecture what experiment must finally deter
 mine that they who have had the small-pox are not after
 wards susceptible of the primary action of the cow-pox virus."

 (Farther Observations,
    I fliall now relate the trials I have instituted, and the ob
                      made, to obtain determinations with respect

 to these important questions of facts.
 Trials   to determine  whether or not Persons are susceptible of

    undergone the Small-pox.
    The four first-named gentlemen being            engaged     with me
 in prosecuting physical inquiries, were desirous         to experience,
 in their own persons, the effects of the vaccine          poison.
     I. Mr.   Dangersield was inoculated in one arm by means
 of  a puncture with a lancet stained with fresh but dried mat
 ter, rendered fluid by steam just before       it was  inserted.    The
 other arm was inoculated with thread impregnated with vac
                                                                      fine

arms in three days          time, that with the thread appeared in
flamed, showing       a red elevated small spot; the     other arm, which
had been punctured, barely shewed a red mark.                The punctures
had smarted for about twenty-four hours, but no other effects
were produced.          These red spots disappeared in         a  few days.
    In   three   weeks     further the inoculation        was again insti
tuted, but with fluid lymph applied, immediately from the
pustule of a patient present, to punctures in each arm. More
smarting and more inflammation were produced by this in
oculation than by the former.              A   small quantity     of  pus was
produced      in the little red spots from the punctures in about fix
 or seven days, but no disorder arose in the whole constitution.
    Mr. Dangerfield was next inoculated in one arm with
 variolous matter.         In   the evening    of  the day   of inoculation
 inflammation appeared,            which    increased to a greater degree
 and extent than from the vaccine inoculations.                       A   small
 phlegmonic        tumor in the        part inoculated with variolous
 matter continued          for a fortnight,       during which         time   it
 suppurated,      and    the pus from       it did    not heal in    less  than
 three weeks further.           There was no constitutional affection ;
 but there was pain in the arm-pit in about five days                     from
 the inoculation.
     2.  Mr. Pollock       was inoculated in each arm with a lancet
  armed     with fluid matter immediately             on taking     it from    a
  patient.    A  little smarting was felt for a day or two, and the
  parts inoculated were red for several days j but no pustules
  arose, nor constitutional affection.
     3.   Mr. Perkins was inoculated by puncturing                    one   arm
  with    a lancet stained        with  recent    vaccine   matter,     and the
  other was inoculated with variolous matter.                A   red spot was
 seen on each of the parts inoculated the day following ; and
  an itching sensation,       especially   from the vaccine matter, was
  experienced     for  a day    or two.     The    parts remained elevated
  am}   inflamed    a little for    a few   days    further,   and    then gor
                                                                            weir

 £iO           Progress     of the   Vaccine Inoculation,  and
 well without suppurating, or being attended by any generat
 disorder.
     4. Mr. Armitage, whose constitution was fat and mus
 cular, was inoculated in each arm, with a lancet stained with
 limpid vaccine matter, immediately on taking it from a pa
 tient present; A small red spot was observed the day follow
ing, and      a little burning sensation       was complained    of; the
 led spots grew larger and larger for four or five days, and at
length produced a small unequal hard tumor, in which a
little pus was generated         ;   but the parts soon got well with
 out any attending disorder of the whole constitution.
     In  a fortnight aster this, each arm was inoculated with
 Variolous matter.         More inflammation than from the vac
 cine inoculation        arose    in  a few   days,  with small  tumors,
which suppurated:            the parts inoculated remained sore for
more than       a  fortnight,    but no feveristi symptoms ever ap
peared.
    5. G. P. a boy 12 years of age> who had gone through
the small-pox ten years before, was inoculated in one arm
with    recent vaccine matter,        which had   been dried on a lancet,
and was moistened just before it was inserted.             ' The day fol
lowing not      so  much     as a red spot   of the part inoculated was
seen,     nor had there been any uneasy sensation.               He was
therefore     inoculated a second time, but with fluid lymph
immediately from          a  patient.
    The day     after   the second inoculation an itching sensation
of    the punctured part was complained of,             which continued
for two or three days.           The    part punctured had    a small red
elevated     spot upon      it  the day after the inoculation,     which
grew gradually         larger for four or five days,      and  became    a
little phlegmonic tumor, but without                any red surrounding
arcola.      In  a few days     the little swelling subsided, but a red
and rather sore spot remained for a week longer.             No disorder
of  the whole constitution was perceived.
    6.   Dr. Woodville inoculated          me in one arm with vaccine
                                                                  lymph.

a little all the remainder of the day of the inoculation, and
also the day following.                  In twenty-four hours           a red spot     on
the inoculated part was seen exactly like that which is often
seen in the same time when either the vaccine or varioloua
infection has taken effect, and which                      increased      for another
day j but after this the redness vanished, and no fore was left*

        once accidentally punctured the back
a   lancet which had fluid vaccine matter upon it. The con
sequence was, a circumscribed, very small, red, hard tumor :
this remained for a fortnight,                      then suppurated,        and after-
Wards      burst.     The     part soon healed,           but left a very small
superficial    cicatrix.
    As belonging        to this head,          I   mention, that    I   have seen se«
Veral instances        of   nurses       having small, red, conical tumors
ftn their lips and cheeks,                and sometimes
                                           hands; evidently
from the application of cow-pox matter of the children under
their care during the vaccine inoculation. These little tumors
sometimes remained for several Weeks, and a particle of pus
Was formed          in them   :   they never were attended by any fever
symptoms, nor by any surrounding erylhcmatous arcola. — I
here speak ot" nurses who had long before passed through the

    I   have no hesitation           to refer       the following       eases   to this
head     of utisufceptibility of taking             the cow-pox to having pre
viously gone through the small-pox.
    A   servant     of Thomas King, Lsq. about                 18   years       of   age,
Was brought up during                his infancy under circumstances                   in
which he could get no testimony to his having had, or not
having had, the small-pox. Not having undergone this dis
ease    to his own knowledge, it was                     thought adviseable.,          in,
order to resist the small-pox,with which hi? fellow-servant
was seized, to inoculate him for the cow-pox. This did op                   I

  elevated, as     if the infection had taken effect.
       6th   Day, Tuesday          28.     Inflammation         had    almost       en
  tirely gone off:        inoculated     a second     time in both arms with
  matter from       a different     patient.
       3c/ Day of second Inoculation, Thursday 30.                       Punctured

       6ih Day,      Sunday April a.             Inflammation           had      disap
  peared.       Inoculated a third time with limpid                   fluid matter
  from     a  patient present, and with which matter                I  had excited
  the vaccine      disease    in several persons.
       Jfh Day of third Inoculation, Friday April 7. The parts
  inoculated had inflamed and felt painful for two or three*
  days, but were now well.
                                      — Inoculated him        a fourth time with
  small-pox matter in both arms.                A   little inflammation arose,
. but nothing more.
       This young man frequently               visited    his fellow-servant in
  the small-pox, and shook hands with him, at the Small-pox
   Hospital,     while under my care for the cow-pox inoculation.
   In this     cafe,   either the sniall-pox had already affected the
   constitution, or some other disposition                existed,     rendering it
   equally unsusceptible          of the small-pox and cow-pox.
       From Dr. Mitchell of Chatham, whose report is now be
   fore me, I learn, that there were several instances of soldiers
  to whom the cow-pox could not be communicated                           ;    and al
   though they had no recollection themselves of hp.ving had
   the small-pox, it was most probable they had passed through
   it.    If I had seen any case of genuine cow-pox pustule and
   specific fever in a constitution which               had previously suffered
   the small-pox,       I  should have related        it; but I ought         to men
   tion that such a        case has    fallen under the observation              of Dr.
   Woodville,        [Reports,      p. 52 and 143.)         I  shall never object
   to the testimony         of  so experienced     a   physician without more
   than usual consideration; but             I  cannot avoid here observing,
   that the evidence in his cafe, of the patient having had the
   small-pox when a child, is merely that of the patient                          ;  and

 T  submit     to  Dr. Woodville, whether or not that                   evidence
 is admiflible to build upon, now that we have the above un
 equivocal contravening cases of the fact asserted. But I trust
 the Doctor will be less tenacious of this instance, as he him
 self tells us that he failed to excite the vaccine disease by
 inoculating several patients who were recovering from the
 natural small-pox. {Reports, p. 144.)
     Whatever impression the above instances may have made
 oh my own mind,          I do  think they will produce conviction in
 the mind of every practitioner, that it is a law                 of the  human
animal     œconomy     to be   rendered     unsusceptible os the cow-pox
fever   and specific puslule by undergoing the small-pox.                 Hence
 I find that my expectation of the hands of physic being
 strengthened     by the    possession    of   a sure means      of exciting an
innocent fever is not realised,               [Inquiry,     p. 81;)   but   I feel
 some consolation from the            prospect       of  the new inoculation
 being more speedily introduced by the                  removal of one ob
 stacle,  viz. the fears of many persons,                   who have already
 passed  through the small-pox,              that they would be liable to
 the cow-pox,       if the diffusion       of    the infection    of it  became
 extensive    by the vaccine inoculation.                 Another    advantage
suggested    in   my Inquiry, p. 92, is now,            I think,   greatly con
firmed;    namely, au advantage for those who are not certain,
whether or not they have bad the small-pox, but possess so
great a dread of this disease as not to be able to submit to
inoculation for it. I congratulate such persons on the dis
covery of      a test   to which     I   apprehend        the more timorous
minds will submit        :   for if the    specific    pustule   and  fever    do
 not take place from the inoculation                of  the cow-pox poison,
they may be assured, that either they have already                        passed
through the small-pox,            or that their constitutions are not
susceptible    of it.
    It now   seems to me, that the following facts are established
on the ground of experience            : —
    I. A   constitution     which has undergone              the small-pox,     it
Unsusceptible     of again undergoing           this disease.

hut        which has undergone                             the   small -pox, is          unsusceptible       of
undergoing               tbe cow-pox.
      Now, isthc variolous                      poison destroys the susceptibility                     of the
constitution to the future agency of this poison, in the                                              respect,
of    its producing the small-pox                                ;   and    if   the cow-po^ poison
destroys           the     susceptibility of                 the constitution             to the future
agency        of        the variolous poison,                         in the respect of its pro--

bility of         the constitution, with respect to the future agency                                        of,
the variolous poison,                  is      produced equally                  by   the agency       of thq
variolous, poison,                  and        by   the. vaccine            poison.       But    if   the var
riolous poison produces unsusceptibility os the constitution tq
the future agency of the vaccine poison, and the vaccine poi
son produces               unsusceptibility to the future agency of the va
riolous poison,                it   seems also demonstrable,                          that the   following

 proposition 1, on the ground                         of        the   2d and 3d proposition,
that unsusccptibility of the constitution to the agency of the
variolous poison is produced by the variolous disease, if this
 were not already proved                     by abundant experience.                      At   a   fu
ture time, however,                    I   shall relate the observations             and expe
 riments to confirm this a priori conclusion;                                     1st,    because
these proofs          will    increase         the validity           of the    3d proposition ;
and adly, because              I       do not mean lo offer this demonstration
as    infallible, like mathematical.
     From      the preceding reasoning                     it may be imagined, that                     I
consider the cow-pox and small-pox as only varieties                                       of the
fame species          of   disease ; and            that therefore the name variola-
•uaccina       is appropriate, although                    I    endeavoured       to sliow that
it   was unjust, and               tended       to mislead,             by giving erroneous
notions, {Inquiry, p. 108). But it must here enter into our
contemplation, that the same state of an animal or other suo-
siance, in a certain respect, may be produced  by very differ
ent things ; and the phenomena attending their agency may
be very different from one another. It is so in the instances
under consideration                ;   and further, in order to establish resem
bling thing3 to be varieties                    of    the fame st erics, we Ought to
be able        to trace them to one common                                origin, or to show
that they all agree in what should be reckoned 'essential pro
perties.        Now hitherto it                has not appeared                that the cow
pox has arisen             from the small-pox,                     or the small-pox from
the cow-pox.               If it       be said, that in some             of   the eruptive         in
stances    of the cow-pox,                 the pustules could not be distinguish
ed from         the    small-pox,             it stiould be considered that it has
not       yet shown, that in any case the small-pox Has
       been
changed into the cow-pox j —that the cow is susceptible by
inoculation of the human matter of the cow-pox, but iiol of
the small-pox;             and that the pustules resembling the small
pox, which occur in the cow-pox,                               affot-d matter    which,     I be
lieve, produces            in some          cases    (if   not, perhaps, in          so   great'    a
proportion      as    originally)           the cow-pox            in   its usual mild way,

viz.    a pustule        in the inoculated part only, and a flight fever.
Hence   I humbly am of opinion, but submit the question to
the decision of scholars, that the use of the denomination va
riola vaccina is a transgression                       of   the law in philology, and
repugnant to sound logic.
   Extended         as    this paper         is,     much beyond the limits pro
posed,   cannot confine to myself the gratification from the
         I
reports of the new inoculation.   shall only mention, how
                                                       I
ever,    one     or two of them.                     The senlation           excited   on the
Continent,          by    the vaccine practice, has been                        much     more
considerable        than in our own island,                  as
                                                              I     learned first from      Dr.
Marcet, and since by                a   letter from         Dr. Peschier.           At Vienna
Dr. Ferro inoculated                  of his own children with vaccine
                                    two.
matter which        I      transmitted   and next, Dr. De Carro ino
                                                 :
culated two    of his own children. An accurate journal of
these last cases was kept   Dr. De Carro, which he has had
                                            by
the complaisance to communicate to me. The above pa
tients had the            disease     in the usual mild way, and were sub
sequently       inoculated for the small-pox,                           but without     esseSt.
Dr. Frank,          it    is   expected,           will   adopt        the vaccine inocula
tion;     as   it   appears         will     be generally done                at Vienna.    I
 often fend matter on                   a   thread,         which      is   to be kept for    a
longtime, in         a    bottle rilled with quite dry hydrogen or nitro,-
 gen gas.      I    fliall soon have reports from Portugal, and other
 parts   of    the Continent.
      In Scotland         the new inoculation has not been less success
 ful.     Dr. Anderson, of Leith, informs me he has inoculated
 above    80 persons — that Dr. Duncan and others have begun
 the practice at Edinburgh                   ;       and that     it   has been introduced
 in Dundee, Paifley,                and Dalkeith.
   If    the vaccine inoculation                     proceed with equal mildness              as
it    has done the last four months,                        doubtless the variolous          in
 cision, must       in no      remote period be superseded.                      And   if  such
 an event should take place, posterity will behold with amaze

be the neglect of inoculation for the small-pox, till it was in
troduced into England from Constantinople; although it had
been practised, time immemorial, in the Barozzo moun

I  N   the public sitting  of  the Mineralogical     Society of Jena,
held on the 26th of May at the Ducal Palace, Mr. Bodo,
from Hungary, read a paper to prove that organisation can
not be denied       to any natural body, and that the division
iuto organised and unorganised         is consequently   inadmissible.
M. Stark, the secretary,      read a paper sent in by    M. Mihalik,
of Dopschau in Hungary, on the following            question  : Whe
ther mineralogy could exist        as a science  without the help of
chemistry?     — Dr. Bonzel      proposed,    that various minerals
 now arranged under one general name, should in future, on
-account of their peculiar marks of difference,           be separated
in   the   system,   and  be distinguished     by particular names.
Thus, for example, that the red zeolite, from Fassa in the
Tyrol, mould be called Fafliiltc, to distinguish it from the
 real Icelandic zeolite; and that the schorl, from Oisans in
 Dauphine, sliould be called Oisanite, to distinguish it from,
that of Thum in Saxony.

                           NATURAL HISTORY.
      The following       instance      of  the sagacity    of   the elephant,
   which is taken from         a late   French Journal, may         serve as an
   additional confirmation of what has been                  so often repeated
   by various authors both ancient and modern                 : —
      "A      sentinel belonging to the menagerie           at Paris, anxious
   to discharge     his duty, was extremely careful, every time he
   mounted guard         near   the elephants,       to desire the spectators
  not to give them any thing to eat. This conduct was not
  much calculated to procure him any friendsliip from the ele
  phants.       The   female,    in particular,     beheld him with a very
  unfavourable eye,        and had several times endeavoured             to cor
  rect    his  unwelcome interference           by besprinkling       his head
  with water from her trunk.                One day, when        a great   num
  ber of people were collected to view these animals, the op
  portunity seemed convenient for receiving, unperceived, a
  small bit    of  bread ; but the rigorous sentinel             was on duty.
  The    female,    however,      placed    herself   before    him, watched
  all his gestures,     and, the moment he opened his mouth to
  give his usual admonition to the company, discharged                    in his
  face a large stream      of water.       A   general   laugh ensued      ; but
  the sentinel having calmly wiped his face,                stood a little to
  one side, and continued            as  vigilant as before.       Soon after
                                                                              he

nition   to the spectators not to give the elephants                any thing;
but no sooner had he done              so than the female         laid hold of
his musket,        twirled it round in her trunk, trod it under her
feet,   and did not restore         it until  she had    twisted    it into the
form of a screw."

                                  Good Hope.
     Notwithstanding          the great number      of  travellers    who have
 attempted       to penetrate     into the interior part of Africa by the
way ofthe Cape of Good Hope, the districts left unexplored
 are immense        when compared to those which                 have been vi
 sited.    One of the greatest obstacles to travelling in these
 wild and parched regions, is the want of proper beasts of
 burthen    ;   for it is well known that cattle cannot long endure
 thirst, and that numbers of them employed on that service
 by travellers       have died       by the way, and thereby rendered
 their attempts to proceed farther useless. This fact must be
 well known to those who have read Vaillant's Travels. Pro-
 feflbr Heeren of Gottingen               proposes therefore,       in order to
  remove    this difficulty,       the introduction      of  the camel at the
  Cape of Good Hope.
                                   "  There can be no doubt," fays he,
  "  that this animal would thrive there, as the climate is ex
  actly the fame      as   that ofthe countries where it is now found.
  \t would no doubt          succeed as well in the         latitude of 350 S,
  as the  lat. of 350     N.    in Syria.    The exploring of the interior
  parts  of Africa        is not the only advantage which might               be
  derived     from the       introduction     of  the   camel     at the Cape,:
  of what utility would such            a beast os  burden be to the plan
  ters, many of whom live              at a  great distance from the Cape
   town, and can at present send their productions thither in
   no other manner than in waggons drawn by four oxen                            !
   The principal point, however, would              be the opening a com
   mercial intercourse with the interior part of the country.                   It
   cannot be doubted that the southern               extremity of Africa is
                                                                           more

 more productive than the northern,             and   why might not the
 Cape be the centre       of a trade   which in future may become
 very extensive     ? But without the      assistance     of  the camel it
 could never be attempted.          The    present period is the more
 favourable for putting this proposal in execution,            as  the Cape
 is now in   the possession  of Great Britain      ; and even    if it mould
 be -given up at the next peace, the British government would
 by this service to the colony raise          a   monument        worthy of
 its dignity  :   the expence    of transporting      a few camels      from
 Mogador would be very trifling." — We agree in opinion with
 Professor   Heeren,    and think his proposal well worth atten
 tion.
                      ANIMAL ELECTIUCITT.
    Dr. Chladni, well known by his              discoveries    in regard to
found,     has lately announced the following              observation     on
 animal electricity, which we here give in his own words :
    " It might be conjectured, when electricity manifests itself
 in animals, that it would be equally diffused throughout the
 whole body on account of the conducting power of the in
terior parts    ; yet we are  taught by experience,        that the oppo
site kinds   of electricity   take   place   in the torpedo       as  well as
 in cats, though in a less degree ; and perhaps the case is the
fame     in other animals.       Some years ago I remarked that a
cat which      had been    rendered    electric by stroking with the
dry hand, especially      when    lying near the sire on dry days in
winter, exhibited opposite kinds of electricity; and that the
principal feat of the one was in the head, and of the other
in the back, about two inches from the tail. This pheno
menon appeared above all when the animal was upon a chair
stuffed with hair, and covered with a woollen cloth, bv which
it  was completely insulated.         When       the head,     and in par
ticular the tip of the nose, or os one of the ears, was touched
by the finger, there appeared        a small   electric spark; the       case
was the fame when the extremity of the back was touched ;
and    in this manner sparks could be drawn alternately from
the anterior and posterior parts of the body in the fame man
                                                                          ner

Jief   as sparks can be drawn                      alternately from an insulated
charged jar.             I   afterwards observed             the same thing            in      an
other cat     ;     but, as at that time           I   paid little attention to this
part of philosophy,                and      supposed that the exigence                 of the
opposite      kinds of electricity in animals might                             have      been
known,        I    made no farther experiments, and                     could not de
termine which of these electricities was negative and which
positive.         I leave    it,   therefore, to others to examine this phe
nomenon with more accuracy."
                                      METEOROLOGY.
  A     very singular work was published last year at                             Liegnitz
in Silesia, entitled Aphorisms                  respecting the Influence              JVar
                                                                                      of
on     the Atmosphere,              Weather and Fertility               of      the   Earth.
Among         the     author's observations                 are the following         :     If   a
cubic foot of gnn-powder, when    explodes, exercises force,
                                                       it                             a
equal to twenty-nine millions of pounds,       these means        it   by
produces      a     great     change in the elasticity of the air; the
whole mass of the atmosphere,                      within    a   large circumference,
is violently torn, and billows of air are produced, which roll
themselves upwards and agitate the vapours contained in
them.      cannot therefore be denied that the discharging of
            It
sire-arms and cannon during battles and sieges, and even at
great reviews, must have an influence on the atmosphere,                                       and
on the      state   of   the clouds and weather.                 He    quotes instances
in the time of the                  seven    years war,      of clouds       and vapours
being dispersed              by   the explosions       of   the cannon      ;   and asserts
that, during his travels through the Tyrol, he saw on several
occasions, to use his own expression, the clouds
                                                 " shod dead."
He     observed       in     the neighbourhood              of Liegnitz, while the
regiment of Wartenilebcn                     were going through their exercise,
that the clouds were broken bv the explosions,                              and that the*
murmuring           of   the wind,           and the agitation         of   the leaves           of
the trees,        and the small feathers suspended from any body,
were sometimes stronger, sometimes                          weaker,    according          as   the

rose and fell at each explosion ; and water          in a vessel,   at the
distance    of five hundred paces, was violently agitated.         There
have been instances      of  the noise  of heavy cannonades, in the
last and present war, being heard at the distance of more'
than forty miles. Nay, the thunder of cannon penetrates
even into the interior parts      of the earth,     and to the bottom
of the    seai so  that whales and herrings have been frightened
away to the distance        of two hundred miles.          The    authors
from these principles, endeavours to account for certain singu
larities which prevailed in the weather in some parts of Ger
many in the year 1797 ; and to shew that the quantity of
gun-powder sired in the time of war may have a sensible effect
on the fertility of gardens and fields.        In  the seven years war
above a    million of pounds of powder       were fired off in Europe;
 and   it may with certainty     De affirmed that no less a quantity
 has been consumed        in the present war against the French.
                  NEW BASIS FOR BLACK PAINT.
    A most     excellent basis for black paint has been discovered
 in the Lead-mines of Nant Gwider, in the Vale of Conwav,
 by Mr. Goodwin of Llanroost, proprietor of several mines, of
 which a description and analysis will be given in some fu
 ture number       of the Philosophical Magazine,        together     with
 that of    several other substances he has discovered         in North
 Wales,     and which     it is presumed      will  be  of  considerable
 Utility.
                  SUGAR FROM THE BEET-ROOT.
    Professor    Gottling, of Jena,    has announced a small work,
 which     he intends to publifli     soon,    on the preparation of
 sugar from the beet-root.         The   Professor   in his   prospectus
 observes, that the various kinds       of beet with which he made
 experiments, must be treated in a quite different manner from
 the sugar-cane, or the method employed by Margraaf, in or
  der to obtain from them good sugar.          In  regard to the quan
 tity^ sugar      which they produce,      he found very little varia
                                                                     tion.

tion.       Some have said that 100 pounds of roots are sufficient
for eight pounds of sugar j but Professor Gottling could ob
tain from 100 pounds of roots no more than two pounds and
a   half.      As   the Professor has promised               to give a full account
of   the process in his pamphlet, it            will     no doubt be interesting
to those who wish to make experiments on this subject.
                        SIZE MADE OF POTATOES.
     One of the beneficial             uses    of   potatoes,        not perhaps ge
nerally known,            is,   that the starch     of them,         quite fresh, and
washed only once, may be employed                          to make size,       which,
mixed with chalk, and diluted in                    a   little water, forms    a   very
beautiful and good white for ceilings.     This size has no
sme'l   while animal size, which putrefies
         ;                                    readily, always   so
exhales    very disagreeable
              a              odour.  That  of  potatoes, as                          it
is   very little subject to putrefaction, appears from experience
to be more durable              in tenacity   and whiteness       ;   and for white
washing should be preferred to animal size, the decomposi
tion of which            is     always accompanied with unhealthful exr
halations.

Mr.      Benjamin Thomas Pouncy, engraver; an artist of the
first eminence in his profession.                       He    was the    brother-in-
law and most distinguished               of   the disciples      of Woollett, with
whose         vigour and richness of style he has                with peculiar       fe

      with, a master's hand and poet's fire," has secured to himself
      the praise of originality, by blending both with his own view
      of Nature.     To enumerate     his engravings, and comment         on.
      them in the detail, would be more than the present disposal
      of the writer's time will permit ; yet the mention of a few
      of their leading traits is at least   due to the merits and        the
     memory of so excellent an artist.         Freedom, boldness,       and
     an happy imitation of the wild forms          of inartificial Nature
     are among their distinguishing features.         The drawing of his
     frees in particular  5 his discrimination      of their   several cha-
-   rasters  5  his thorough knowledge of their various modes of
    growth,     combined with a mode of expression arising spon
    taneously    out of his subject,     have perhaps      never  been ex
    celled.     Among     the   rude   and   artless   landscapes    of the
    South-sea islands, or the wild and luxuriant forms of lake
    and forest scenery, his etching-tool and his fancy would revel
    delighted, and communicate to every cultivated eye a corre
    sponding pleasure.      With   such   claims to superior      art, men
   of discernment will lament that it was the lot of Pouncy to
   he obliged to trammel his talents, and employ a considerable
   portion of his time in engraving fac-Jimtles from the pages
   of Doomsday-book ; in tracing the Spanish lines before Gi
   braltar;    and on other subjects      that required      merely care,
   and the exercise    of a certain regular mathematical ability he
   did not naturally possess.      On the whole, it may be said of
   his works, which are chiefly after Farinpion, Hearne, Smith,
   and Wilson, that they will continue to be admired wherever
  legitimate art and true tafle are not obscured by the false
  glitter so much the fashion of the day ; and that, in private
  life, the hospitality of his manners, the compass of his know
  ledge, the liberality of his sentiments,         and the goodness of
 his heart,     will long   be remembered        with    regret  by those
 who had the happiness of being intimately known to him.

 I. On   the  gradual     Changes      in Temperature       and Soil which
    take place in different Climates,            with  an Enquiry into the
    Cause   of those Changes.          By    the  Abbe  Mann       **
 V.AR       10  US      authors, both ancient and modern,                   have
written on the subject of this Dissertation, but merely in a
cursory manner       ;  one only,     Dr. Hugh Williamson, an Ame
rican physician,        has made it an object          of particular atten
tion  ;  but what he has        said relates only to North America,
and is comprehended in a very short                 paper   published    in the
Philosophical Transactions of Philadelphia for 1777.                      It has
long appeared        to  me    interesting enough         to   require  farther
and more accurate examination               ;  but before    I  enter into any
 research respecting       the causes      of   those changes     of tempera
ture and foil, observed         in different countries during            a  long
series  of  ages,   it seems to be necessary first to prove,            by au
thentic testimony, that these changes                 have     actually taken
place.     This Dissertation divides itself naturally into two
parts.     In  the first  I  shall collect all the information          of an-

 33 8          On the Changes          of Temperature and Soil
 cient authors       I  have been able        to find on the state        of  the
 temperature       and foil in their time in          Gaul, Germany, Pan-
 nonia,    Thrace,        Moesia,     Dacia,    and    the European part of
 Scythia.      As      most    of   these writers,      however, when they
 speak   of  the     climate of those countries, express themselves
 more or    less   in   an almost unintelligible         manner, and nearly
 in the  fame words, it would be superfluous                 to quote,    at  full
 length, all the         passages    I have collected on the subject.            I
 shall therefore content myself with giving,                  in regular ordef,
 the substance of all the circumstances they have communi
 cated to us     in   regard to the climate        of   the above countries ;
 and in the second part          I  shall briefly enquire into the physical
 causes which,         in  the course     of  several centuries, may have
 gradually contributed to produce these changes.
    I.  Proofs     of the    Change    of  Temperature      and Soil in    the
                              Climates    of Europe.
    We    are told by Herodotus,             more than once, that in the
European part of Scythia, on the Pal us Mcotis, the winter
 continued eight months every year with almost insupport
able severity      ;    and   that the countries farther towards the
north were on that account uninhabitable                       :   he adds, that
the other four months, called the summer, were also exceed
ingly cold.        Now this country lies between                   the 44th and
50th degree       of north latitude, and we know                 at present that
nothing     of    the like kind        has taken      place    there for a long
time.     Cæsar,      Virgil, Diodorus Siculus, Ovid, Strabo, Pom-
ponius Mela, Seneca,               Petronius,    Pliny    the naturalist,    Sta-
tius, Herodian,          and   Justin, all speak in the same manner ot
the insupportable cold of the winter in different parts lying
in the fame latitude of from 44 to 50 degrees between Gaul
and the Euxine Sea.              They quote        so  many and       so evident
effects  of this winter cold, that it             is not possible to ascribe
their descriptions to the manner of life they were accustomed
to in the warmer districts of Italy, Greece, or Asia.
   The descriptions which they unanimously give, would                         at
                                                                         present

present        suit those countries which lie between 56 degrees                               of
latitude and the polar circle ; and in some respects they
seem to exceed the cold                 of   the winter         in Sweden          and    Nor
way.          In order        to see realised     at    present         the descriptions
which     the ancients have given                of the climate of             the middle
part of Europe in their time, it would be necessary to visit
Lapland, Siberia, and those regions of America lying to the
north of Hudson's Bay,                  where the       state     of the climate          is the
fame     as    that 2000 years ago on the banks of the Rhine                                  and
the Danube,             the Palus Meotis,         the Dnieper, and the                   Don.
  The         first effect,    uniformly mentioned by the ancients,                            of
the extraordinary cold of the winter in that whole part of
Europe between the 44th and 50th degree of latitude                                            is,
that all the seas, lakes and rivers                      contained in those dis
tricts were continually frozen in winter,                              so   that armies of
barbarians,          Scythians         and Sarmatians,             in order that they
might plunder the more southern countries,                              passed     with their
horses, waggons and baggage over the ice, which they be
strewed with straw to prevent their sliding. This    ex                                  is
pressly asserted          by   Herodotus,        Virgil, Ovid,              and Strabo,        of
the European part of Scythia,                    Dacia, and Thrace,                 all coun
tries which lay in            a   northern and western direction from the
Palus Meotis            and the Euxine Sea.                  The       fame    thing      is   as
serted        by   Diodorus        Siculus,      Seneca,          Pliny      the    younger,
Florus, Herodian,                 Ammianus M?~cellinus,                     Fernandes the
Goth,     and      Xiphilinus       the abridger'of          Dio       Cassius,     in regard
to the rivers           and    lakes    of Pannonia,
                                    Germany,         Gaul.                         and
They mark the times when these armies passed the ice, and
the wars which             they then carried on          ;        so   that no doubt can
be entertained           in regard to testimony              so   unanimous and au
thentic.           Herodotus fays, that the Scythians in this manner
over-ran,          during winter,         all the neighbouring                countries as
far as India        ;    and we are told         by   Strabo, that Neoptolemus,
the general         of Mithridates,           beat     the   barbarians in winter
with an army of cavalry, at place which in summer had
                                             a
been the scene of naval battle.

ascribed to Plutarch,                   it is said, the Thjermodon,                 a Scythian
river, froze even in summer                         ;   a circumstance which                 never
happens       at present               in regard to the rivers of Siberia, Lap
land, and Greenland.                      Ovid tells us, that he himself                   passed
over the Pontus Euxinus                      on the ice.          People, adds he,             will
scarcely believe me                :
                                             Sed euro sint praemia salsi
                       Nulla, ratam testij debet haberc fidem.
   Plutarch says, that the pressure of this enormous mass of
ice against the sides of ships frozen into                             it,   crushed    them to
pieces  ; and he mentions the instance                                  of    a   Roman        ship
which       had    experienced               that fate       in   the Danube.             Strabo
and Virgil         speak       of      brass vessels         bursting by the expansive
force of the ice         ;   and we are assured                by   Virgil     and Ovid, thai
the people in Thrace and on the Danube cut the wine with
axes,   and       distributed           it   in   solid portions.             They     add, like
wise, that men's hair and beards were often covered                                     with      ice.
             Stiriaque       impexis indurent horrida barbis.                        Virgil.
             Sa?pe sonant      moti glacie pendents capilli,
                  Et   nitet inducto Candida barba gelu.                          OviD.
  If    we compare             this description with the present                          state    of
France, Germany, Hungary, Romania, Transylvania,                                           Wal-
lachia, Moldavia, Bulgaria, Lesser Tartary, Podolia, and the
Ukraine,      it   will      be found          that the present temperature                        of
these countries              has       no resemblance             to     what     it   was     two
thousand years ago             :       the effects produced              there every winter
scarcely take place now once in                          a   century,         and when they
occur they are considered                    as extraordinary phenomena.
   From ice   fliall proceed to snow. Herodotus, Pompo-
                  I
nius Mela, and Pliny the elder, speak of the European part
of Scythia        as   if    its atmosphere             was continually filled with
snow and fogs, which prevented the view of the nearest ob
jects, and obscured the light of the day. We are told by
 Herodotus, that this immense load of snow, when     fell,                                it
made the air appear as                   if   silled    with   feathers      j    and that, for
                                                                                               this

              wbicb tale place in different Climates.                     341
this reason,    the   country was called Pterophoros.               Diodorus
Siculus speaks of Cclto-Scythia          as covered      with   snow in the
winter time; and the same thing is               asserted    by Floras and
Petronius.      Virgil,   speaking    of Thrace     and the countries on
both fides of the Danube, fays, that           a  continual winter pre
vailed in them      ;  and   that the snow        lay upon       the, ground
sometimes     to the depth     of seven ejls.
             Sic jaret ageeribus niveis informis, et alto
             Terra gelu late, septemque assurgit in ulnas,
             Semper hyems, semper spirantes fiigora cauri.
   The picture which Ovid gives of              the snow at        Tomi (in
the lat. of 44^) is no less horrid, as         he tells us that it con
tinued two years without being melted by the fun or rain                   :
           Nix jacet et jactam nee  sol pluviæve   resolvunt;
           Et solet in multis bima  manere locis.
   In  regard    to other meteorological phenomena in the                Eu
ropean    part of Scythia       and Celto-Scythia          in the time of
Herodotus      and    the following     century,      this historian fays,
that it seldom rained in the winter, because at that period it
seldom ceased to snow ; and that, on the other hand, when
the weather in summer was dry and fair in Greece and Lesser
Asia, it never     ceased  to rain in the country       of  the   Celto-Scy-
thians: that during this       season the heavens were         always over
cast  with clouds, and that thunder, even in summer, was very
uncommon ; that when it happened                  in winter, it was con
sidered as a wonder,       and that,    in  those seasons when it took
place, earthquakes        were observed also.          This    last circum
stance   is indeed     worthy of attention, as it serves to confirm
my conjectures respecting the theory of the earth.
   Diodorus Siculus, Tacitus, and Ovid, when they speak of
Gaul, Germany, and Thrace, take notice of the prodigious
force of the wind which prevailed in these countries in their
time and during the preceding centuries.               These winds raised
even stones and men from the earth ; carried away the roofs
of  houses.}   tore up trees by the roots, and overturned turrets
                                   Z3                                    and

 342                  On       the Changes        of    Temperature        and Soil
 and houses.                   Such effects of the wind are indeed                        observed1
 at present, particularly in the countries on the                               Northern Sea
 arid the Bay             of Biscay, but          seldom in those          parts of the Con
 tinent spoken of by the ancients.
   Varro, Diodorus Siculus, Ovid, Pomponnis Mela, Seneca,
 Petronius, Pliny the elder, Tacitus, Appian, Dio Caffius,
 and Herodian,   all agree in saying that the severity of the
 climate and weather which in their time prevailed in Gaul,
 Germany,                Pannonia,            Thrace,       Mcefia,     and       Dacia,      would
 hardly admit either vines, olives, or any kind of fruit-trees ;
 and that, in cultivating them, it was necessary to cover them
 with dung or with earth                           to preserve them throughout the
 winter.           however, adds, that these countries pro
                  Tacitus,
 duced, in abundance, various kinds of grain, where the peo
 ple gave themselves the trouble to improve and manure their
 fields by means of marl or chalk, which destroyed the cold
 and the moisture.                      This circumstance            is expressly remarked
 by Varro    Agros Jlercorarent Candida fojjitia creta.
                  :                                     He af
 terwards adds, that in these countries there was neither rock
 salt nor sea salt : the preparation of the latter required a
 stronger heat than existed                        in     those climates      *.     The inha
 bitants supplied the want of salt by saline aslies from certain
 kinds of wood burnt for that purpose, and which were
 drenched         with          salt    water.     Pliny     and Tacitus          give the fame
 account.
      It   is observed                 hy Herodotus,         Strabo,       and Tacitus,        that
 the oxen in the European                         part      of Scythia      and     the country
 of    the Celto-Scythians                    had no horns,
                                        or horns exceedingly
 small;  which they ascribed to the severity of the cold and
 the climate.   Herodotus confirms this idea in a negative
   v   This,     indeed, proves nothing in regard to the climate ; but it ihews
the want of knowledge                   and   indrstry.     The passage    in Varro      Dt
                                                                                       Re Rus-

that they boiled               their    salt, as was done in former times in some parts of
Europe ; that            is,   poured the saline liquor over glowing pieces                of wood,

                which tale place in different Climates.                       343
manner by the testimony of Homer, who fays in the Odyssey,
that in Lybia the lambs had horns from their birth, owing
to the gre3t heat.          Strabo, as       a proof of the great cold which
prevailed in the country now called                      the Ukraine, observes
that it produced no            asses ;    animals,       fays he, which cannot
endure     the cold     :  and he adds,          that the horses there were
extremely small. But nothing, indeed, is more astonishing
than the testimony of Pausanias, who fays expressly, that in
Thrace      there    were      in his time        bears and wild swine       of  a
white colour.          Such animals at present are found only in
the remotest parts of the north,                    on the other side of the
polar circle.        We     are told by       Virgil, Ovid, and Pomponius
Mela, that        the   inhabitants of the European part of Scythia
and Thrace lived, during the whole winter,                        under the earth
(as the Laplanders            do at present)         ;   that they burnt large
logs of wood          to keep       themselves        warm; that they never
went abroad without being wrapped up in skins; and that
they left no part of the body uncovered but the mouth and
eyes.     Pomponius          Mela      fays,    Specus aut suffoffa habitant,
Mum hraccati         corpus,     et   nift qua vident eliam ora vejliti.
   I  think it of importance to point out here the boundaries
of  those countries towards 'the north,                     which    the ancients
considered      as desolate      and uninhabitable             on account of the
great intensity of the cold.               Herodotus fays, that beyond the
Melanchlini,        a  Sarmatian people,            so   called from their black
hair,   there     were     only lakes,         morasses,      and  uninhabitable
districts   as far as was       then known         ; and we learn       from Ovid
that on the other         side  of   the Cimmerian          Bosphorus, the    Ta-
nais,   and     the Scythian           morasses,       a  cold prevailed    which
rendered     the country uninhabitable.
             Bosphorus ct Tanais superant Scythiæque paludes ;
            TJlturius nihil est, nisi non habitabile frigus.
   Tuis   is expressly confirmed by geographers                   and historians.
Strabo repeats, several times, that all the lands towards the
north    of   the tribes who lived on the banks                     of the Tanais
                                         Z 4                                  and

344             0«   the Changes      of    Temperature      and Soil
and the Borysthenes were uninhabitable                      on account    of the
severity   of    the cold which prevailedin them. But all that
has been traced        out of the banks, and even the origin of
this river, does not lie beyond the 55th degree of latitude j
consequently is on the fame parallel with the northern part
of England and Germany, the middle of Lithuania, and the
middle of Russia. Between these two rivers Strabo places
also the Rhoxolani,           who in general          are considered       as the
ancestors    of    the Ruffians ; and he adds, that all the districts
farther north were uninhabitable                   on account of the cold.
In another        place he fays,      that all the northern part          of Bri
tain was very thinly peopled                    on account of the cold, and
that he believed all the countries lying beyond it to be un
inhabited.  Now no part of Great Britain extends beyond
the 60th degree of north latitude ; consequently that parallel
includes all Norway, almost the whole of Sweden, and the
half of Russia. These countries, therefore, in the time of Stra
bo, that    is,
             about the period of Augustus, were considered as
uninhabited. The ancients, in general, speak of all the lands
which  lay beyond the 55th degree of north latitude as filled
with lakes, morasses, ice, snow, and fogs, almost like those
countries to the north of Hudson's Bay.
   These,       in   my opinion,       are sufficient and        unquestionable
proofs of the excessive severity which prevailed 2000 years
ago in the climate of those countries of Europe lying between
 the latitude of 440 and 50° north latitude, and fully establish
 the difference between the state of their temperature in those
 periods and what        it   is        The more northern lands,
                                   at present.
 which     the    ancients, on account of their unsupportable cold,
 considered       as uninhabitable          ;    Iceland,    Norway, Lapland,
 and    the northern part of Russia and Siberia,                   are habitable,
 and inhabited at present,             as   is   well known,     though exceed
 ingly cold.         The ancients       also speak      of   effects produced      by
 the cold    of winter in Italy, Greece,              Lesser Asia,      &c. which
 at present are certainly unknown.                     The foil of       the latter
 countries, as well as that of the ancient Assyria, ChaWea,
                                                                         Palestine^

                urbicb take place in different          Climates.               345
Palestine, the Roman part of Africa, and Spain, is at present
remarkably stony, and burnt up with heat.                        We, however,
know,       that Spain in particular,          about 1800 years ago, was
exceedingly rich and fruitful, and abounded with all forts of
provisions, which arc no longer to be found in it *.                         It  ap
pears      to me unnecessary          to produce more            proofs,    as   the
change of the foil and fertility in all the countries bordering
on the Mediterranean Sea,                 and which        formed the richest
and most beautiful part           of  the Roman empire, is admitted                at
a certain fact by all those who have                 spoken     of their former
 and present state.
     It  is therefore     beyond    a  doubt, that the foil and tempera
 ture of all the lands from Spain to India, and from the
 ridge of Mount Atlas to Lapland                  and    the   remote     parts    of
 the north, have in the course of ages, since the period of the
 oldest historical monuments still extant to the present time,
  been     gradually subjected to a complete change, from the
 utmost degree of moisture and cold, to a great degree of dry
  ness and warmth.           An   effect so continued and uniform must
  have some cause, which is equally so itself.
      Dr. Williamson         asserts,   that the climate of America is
  becoming continually milder; and he confirms it by a num
  ber of facts. This effect is directly contrary to the hypo
  thesis of a celebrated naturalist respecting the theory of the
  earth and the planets, who             asserts,  that they have been con
  tinually losing warmth            since they were first        in  a state  of  fu
   sion,    and are becoming always colder ; so that they                     will  at
  length be incapable of keeping alive any animal or vege
   table productions. All historical and physical monuments,
   however, prove the contrary.
      * The    districts in the neighbourhood     of Toledo    are destitute  of trees,
   on which account the heat in summer is unsupportable,           and wood in win
   ter exceedingly    dear.  When Martial wrote      the  following lines, the coun
   try  must certainly   havo been in a very different state :
                         Æstas screnus aureo franges Tagp
                         Obseurus umbris arborum.
       t  This  was the opinion of Busson.      Edit.
                                                                                     It

  54^          Oh, the Changes    of Temperature and Soil, &c.
     It is not merely       in modern times,         and since the improve
 ment of natural philosophy, that this change of temperature
 and foil has been remarked. A great number of places, well
 known and described            by   the-   ancients, in Palestine, Syria,
 Lesser Asia, Greece,        Italy, Spain,      and Barbary, exhibit proofs
 of the changes which have taken place in the foil and                  tempe
 rature in the course of timei Every one knows their                     present
 dry and barren state, which seems to be past remedy.                     It is so
 contrary to that in which            they were formerly,          according to
 aU   the descriptions of them left us by Greek and Roman
 authors, that it is impossible for us to ascribe this difference
 merely to the inclination of the ancients for exaggeration * :
 the clear and precise facts, which various celebrated authors
 have mentioned respecting             them, will not allow of        so absurd
 a supposition.        Ovid says      that, in his time, Lower Mœsia,
 to which, he was banished, produced neither vines nor                     fruit-
 trees^
                   Nam prociU.  a Gctico Iittore ritis,
                   Nam procul   a Geticis    Snibus arbor abest.
     Strabo, who was a few years later than Ovid, speaking of
 vine plants in the Thracian Bosphorus, fays, that in winter
 U was necessary to bury them under the earth in order to
 preserve them.          Not long     after,   it was observed by Pompo-
 uius Mela and Pliny the elder, in speaking of Thrace,                       that
 there were scarcely any fruit-trees in that coun'.ry, and that
 in winter it      was necestary to. cover them with             dung.     Mela
 adds, that the vines often grew there,                  but that the grapes
never ripened       f.     Columella       is the first author who speaks
 of vines in Gaul       ;  and be fays that the Sabines and the              Ro
 mans in the preceding century had procured, amidst the de
vastation      of war, more abundant            crops   than had been pro
 cured in his time during a state             of   perfect  peace.     But no

tiling in this        respect is more striking           than what is observed
by Columella in regard to the changes of climate.
                                                                             " I find,"
fays he,
               "   that it is the opinion          of many      respectable      authors
that the quality and            state  of   the atmosphere become changed
in the course of           a  long series of ages : for Saserna, in that
work which he has left on agriculture, infers that the state
of the       atmosphere      is changed, because certain districts,                which
formerly were incapable of producing vines or olives on ac
count of the continual severity of the winter, now yield abun
dant vintages and plenty of oil by the climate having be
come milder and warmer*."                          But it is now time that I
should        proceed     to an inquiry into the causes that produce
these changes, the effects              of which      I  flatter myself       I  shall be
 able to proVe.

and all the other experiments of this kind, the point where
the bridge stands is also        a   vibration node.
      II.   Divide the string   AB into      a  number os equal parts at
pleasure, for example five         ;   cut off, by removing the bridge

to the tone       of  the whole string as 6      : 2  or 3 : 1 .
      IV. If    you place upon the string, without cutting off any
 part     of it by     the bridge, different bits        of   paper  in points
taken at pleasure,          and rub with the bow            so as to make the
 whole string found, all the bits of paper will be thrown from
it.      This experiment will give the fame result when you cut
 off in the middle the part of the siring which actually sounds ;
 for example, you may vary the second experiment thus                      : —

     V. Divide            the   string AB by the points C, D, E, F, into
•five equal       parts ; cut off, by means     of two moveable bridges,
the part         DE;      place   upon C and F, and other points of the
                                   string AB, small bits of paper : nib the
   C D E F        D0W                      against          ED     ;   all the bits of paper
  — —
A. . . — .— .^-.B will                    be thrown                off except           those    in   C
                                    and   F,    and you            will   hear the tone cor
responding to             DE, which       is to the tone               of    the    whole string
as     5:   1.
     From these few experiments, the following laws respecting
vibration nodes may be deduced                          :   —
     1.     The part of the string apparently                       at rest is not perfectly
 To,   but only its vibration nodes.
     a. The original              vibrating        part of the string, which                          is
brought into immediate vibration                            by   rubbing with the violin
bow, has no vibration nodes      and therefore no string on the
                                               ;
violin, violoncello, harp, or harpsichord, can have any. All
the vibration             nodes     on these instruments                      lie behind           the
bridge.
     3.     For vibration                      of the string
                                  nodes to be possible,                a    part
must be apparently at rest  consequently, the number which
                                          ;
expresses the height of the tone emitted, as compared with
the tone of the whole string                    -      1, must be greater than one,
and must therefore be expressed                         by   an improper fraction.
     4.     In order       to determine the                 number of the vibration
nodes       of   a   string for the tone           —   ,    where,         as before      shewn,      a
must        be greater than          b,   we       need only reduce the fraction
—r-, which expresses the proportional height of the tone, to
its lowest terms            J—,    and subtract the smaller number                          q    from
the greater          p:   the difference       p   —   q    will    be the number               of tho
vibration nodes.                This law follows                 very naturally from the
.preceding        experiments.
     When the height of the                   tone to be produced                  is   to the tone
                                                                                                      of

rubbed with the bow in order to produce that tone, that is,
the string is divided into a parts,                          and b parts must be cut                      off
and rubbed with the bow;                            therefore a — b are parts                        of the
string, or                       of   the   whole     string apparently at rest, the
extreme points of which are capable of producing vibration
Bodes ;         and when                     is brought         to its lowest expression,
U gives a            —   b   vibration         nodes.        If —         be not in its lowest
terms, let its lowest                      terms be     -±— ;       so    that    —             =        -?-,

and when   is the greatest common divisor of a and b, a
                     e

Now,           if it     should       be required to apply this law to                         — , the

may have the fame difference as                       \       and     j.,   the fame number
of vibration             nodes may exist where the                        tones are different!,
and therefore             each tone has not its own peculiar number                                           of
vibration nodes.
     6. Vibration nodes are only possible where the tones                                             have,
a    certain ratio to the fundamental tone.
     It   must       not, however, be expected,                          that the experiment
can be made, for example, with            string 26 inches irt length,

 i»   1 HE historical part: the          greatness,     extents  and  thro*
 nology of their ravages in different countries.
     2. Does   it  appear that some countries           are more exposed
 to them than others       ;  are there    some    absolutely exempted;
 and how far is this connected          with the local situation of      the
 country   ?
     3. To observe the extent, duration, and direction of the
 vibrations experienced by the earth when it shakes.
     4. Are    there     any meteorological        phenomena that an
 nounce or accompany earthquakes ; such as extraordinary
  heat, calms, storms, movements of the barometer, electri
  city, vapours dispersed throughout the atmosphere,                paleness
  Or peculiar colour of the fun and stars ?
     5. Other phenomena ; such as subterranean noise, extra
  ordinary movement of the sea, the water of springs increased
  or dried up, any particular smell, symptoms of terror among
  domestic animals.
     6. Are there any indications           that some earthquakes        may
  have been the effects       of electricity,   and that such convulsions
  might be    prevented      by conductors     ?
      7. Are  there not some also which immediately depend on
                                                               subterranean

of water converted into steam ?
   9. To ascertain             the simultaneous or at least astonishirtg
rapidity of the effects of earthquakes                      at very great distances.
   10.     Are     there any instances            that, during the moment of
an earthquake, some pretty considerable                             tract of land, or a
mountain, has been raised to                    a great     height above its former
level, and has afterwards              remained in a                state   of elevation?
   11.'    Are     there dry fogs, such as that                 of    1783, which may
be considered        as   vapours, that have              issued      from the earth by
the action of stiocks or concussions.

Observations         to be made on         Mines      of Metal, Coal, and Suit.
  •1.The historical part: the epoch of the discovery of a
mine ; of its being first worked ; the expence and net pro
duce at different periods.                 If    there     ever was,          or still      is,   a
grant of     it,   and on what conditions.
   1.     A. In     regard      to the physical           part,      care must be taken
to examine whether the ore be in veins or strata                               ;    that    is    to
fay, whether        it   intersects    the       strata   of   the mountain,               or be
parallel to them.
  3.      In mines which          consist    of veins, the dimensions, thick
ness, and length           of the     veins are to be examined                 ;        their in
clination     in    regard       to the horizon,               and     their direction in
regard     to the cardinal points.                  The miner* call this direc
tion the hours.
  3.     The metal        itthe mineralising substance, and
                               contains;
the kind of mineral which thence results.
  4. The matrix,               or non-metallic            fossil,     found mixed with
the ore.
  5. The nature of the                soil at the bottom,            or that part of
the mountain on which                 the vein rests       ;    nature of the cover
ing, or part of the mountain immediately above it.
                                                                                   '¦    Nature

   6. Nature of the covering of the veins, or those parts                   of
the vein next to the substance of the mountain.
    7. Nature     of  the druses, or crystallised geodes contained          in
the vein.
   7. A. The form, dimensions, and nature of the mountain
which contains the vein.
    8. Situation      of the vein in     regard    to the strata      of the
mountain      ; under what angle it intersects them.
   9. Its situation in regard to the exterior part of the moun
tain ; whether it be parallel to the external inclination of
the mountain,        or whether that inclination be in a contrary
direction.
    10.  The    progress    of the vein    :  whether it be subject to
change its direction          or situation, and according           to what
laws   ; if there are any indications that precede these changes ;
any corners, vacuities, or fissures, which interrupt the course
of   the vein ; and how it is found            after   having been lost       :
situation and distance of the place where it is richest.
    11. Lateral veins or ramifications          of the principal vein;
 veins by which it is accompanied, or which run parallel to it.
    12. To verify Werner's theory in regard to veins, the
fundamental principles          of which   are as follows      : —
    A. That     the spaces occupied by veins have been origi
nally empty crevices or fissures.
    B. That these fissures have been afterwards filled from the
bottom upwards, at          a  time when the        sea  still covered     the
mountains;       and by the precipitation or crystallisation of the
substances which were before dissolved in the waters               of the sea.
    C. That of two        veins   crossing each other,        the most mo
 dern is that which intersects the other.
    D. That of two veins, one of which              stops and diverts the
 course   of the other,    the most modern is the latter.
    E. That, in    the fame vein, the parts nearest to the sides             of
 the surrounding substance,         thesalbande for instance, are the
 most ancient;       those in the middle the most modern ; and
 the intermediate ones of a mean antiquity.

            '                  Hints for        the   Formation of

     F. Also that, in                the same vein,             the lowest       parts are the
most ancient.
     G. That in              some veins there are found rolled pebbles ;                             in
others      the        remains of organised                bodies,     shells,        and wood ;
and in others,            of coal,       stones, and sea-salt.
     H. That           one may assign the relative age                     of    the formation
of different minerals ; for example, that tin mines may be
said to be of the most ancient formation ; then those of ura-
nite, bismuth, &c.
     The       part of the following questions will furnish
                greater
confirmations of this theory, or objections against accord                             it,
ing to the solution given of them                          :
     13.    Is   it    true    that there         are mountains,                or portions of
mountains,              so    pierced     with cotemporary                  veins      that they
could not have supported                     themselves,           had not the substance
with which they                are silled       been created at the same time as
the mountain itself?                 I    have        used the       expression        cotempo
rary, because,            if    we can suppose that the                     fissures filled          by
these veins were formed                    in    succession,         the objection           which
this fact would present to the theory of Werner would be
by these means resolved.
     13.    A.   I     must here repeat the 10th question         of Chap. II.
How can           it   be conceived         that all the metals and substances
found in         a   vein fliould have been dissolved                           by   the water       of

     15. Are there found, in the neighbourhood of veins, strata
of    the fame mineral contained in these veins, and which
seem to have been deposited at the same time when the de
posits     of    the sea silled the fissures occupied                      by   these veins      ?

    tains  ?    And, if this circumstance            be true, does       it  arise from
   the relative        age  of    these minerals,, ajid mountains,              or from
   the substance of the mountains favouring the precipitation
   of one kind of mineral more than that of another?
       17.    Is it true,    as   M.  de Trebra fays, that the richest veins,
   and the richest points            of any vein, are found in the vertical
  line which corresponds with the lowest part of the reservoirs
  of the rain water, and never in the peaks and most elevated
   ridges ? And, if this be well ascertained, would it not prove
  that the veins           had     an  origin posterior to the grand revolu
  tions which have           given to the surface of our globe its present
  form, and that the metals have been deposited in them by
  the meteoric waters             ?
       18.    Is it    true  also that the richest           mines are sound in
  mountains, the declivities of which are not                     steep
                                                                          *  ?
       19.    Are     there instances     of veins, entirely      exhausted,      being
  again silled up with ore?
      20.     Does the production            of  metals depend         on the influ
  ence of the fun and climate ? Are they more frequently found
  near the eastern or southern, than the western or northern
  faces    of mountains         ?
      21. Can we generalise              the observation made             in Siberia,
 Transylvania,           at Mount       Rose,   and in other places, tha* in
 gold mines the veins                are richer      near the surface       of moun
 tains than at          a greater    depth.
      31.    A. Is it generally true,, that the veins                 are richer at
 their points of intersection than in any other place                       ?
      22.    Is the inclination         of veins    seen   more frequently con

      23. Does it sometimes              happen that the rock which forms
 the    sides       (neben-gefleln)      of   the Jtvn. is      as rich     and   even
 richer in metal than the vein itself ; and would it thence
     * As the Saxon authors
                                    generally fay;   because   the fact is true among
them and       in some other countries,     while  the cafe  is not so elsewhere,   and
particularly      in the Pyrenees.     C.

through these sides      ?
   24. Is it true that, in mountains of granite, the grain of
the granite is finer and the stone more tender in the neigh
bourhood of a vein       ?
   25. Are     there observed       in any mine proofs that           subterra
nean fires have contributed to its formation by subliming the
metallic substances, or by melting them               ?    In   a word,      are
there seen there any traces           of the action of    fire ?
    26.  In  the greater part        of mines    do we not,     on the con
trary, observe proofs of the action of water in the situation                  of
minerals and of their matrices; in their druses (groups of crys
tals), and in the state, form and nature of their crystallisation 1
    27. Does there prevail, at the bottom of mines, a heat su
perior to the mean temperature of the earth ? And if such
a heat     exists  in any mine,            may it not be explained by
that produced by the lamps ; by the miners themselves ;
by some accumulations of pyrites, or some local reservoirs
of water, without having            recourse to a general cause or cen
tral fire  ?
    28.  Is it certain that, in general, veins          decrease in thick
ness  in proportion     as they proceed         to a greater      depth, and
terminate in such      a manner         that the fissures which contain
them are closed at the bottom             ?   Were this     fact established,
would it destroy the possibility of sublimations arising from
                                         *

    29. In mines which proceed by strata, to observe their
nature, extent, thickness, inclination, and depth ; their in
terruption by the veins that intersect them ; their alternate
swellings and constrictions, as well as the augmentation and
diminution of their richness,               and  the signs which precede
these changes.

more in thickness '. or have not metalliferous      banks   or fissures  between
two different kinds of  stone been taken for veins ?     C.

other metallic mines than those of copper, iron, lead, cala-

the surface of the mountain,                                      and become richer the deeper
they proceed.
  31. A. Whether mines, where the metal is found in
lumps or in a mass (Jlockwerke) , ought to be classed among
those           in   veins or those               in     strata *       ?
       3a.       In       coal mines to observe the nature                                of the          coal ; more

mixed with argil or pyrites.
  33. To examine, in the coal, the traces of their Origin;
whether they have been formed of wood, turf, or marine
plants          \.

marine or terrestrial animals.
  35. The progress of the strata : whether it be true that
they often begin by descending in order to become hori
zontal,              and afterwards to re-ascend;                                     and that they are

    36. Whether there are several strata, one above the others
with banks or other fossils interposed.           The quality and re
lation of these strata.
    37. The nature and thickness of the strata of the earth
or stones under which the coal mine is found; the im
pressions   and other vestiges of organised            bodies   found  in
these strata.
    37. A. How can        those who ascribe the origin        of coal to
forests buried   in the earth, explain the very thin strata of
that fossil contained between banks of calcareous stones, and
which    are repeated      at different heights in the fame moun
tain?    Does not this observation stiew that there are coal
which    have originated also from fuci,         algæ,    and other ma
rine plants   ?
    37. B. Ought we to suppose that all coals have been in a
state of solution ? What is the agent which dissolved them,
and which may be called the mineraliser?
    38. Though mines of rock salt are commonly found in
strata, yet M. Fichtel affirms, that there are found in Tran
sylvania enormous        masses   of pure salt, compact, and without
any appearance      of foreign    bodies.    These he considers as     of
very ancient formation,         and   distinguishes them from those
which    are in strata     between beds of argil and free-stone
mixed with       shells.    These important        facts   deserve to be
thoroughly examined.
    39. To   ascertain    the   truth of an assertion made by the
same geologist,      that these masses of fait are surrounded          by
ancient volcanoes      ;  and to determine whether we ought             to
believe with him, that this salt has been crystallised             by the
heat of those volcanoes which evaporated the water that held
them in solution.
    40. To examine, in the last place,            whether any of these
masses   of salt appear to have been        raised up by subterranean
fires to a height greater      than that at which they were at the
time of their formation.
                                                                  41. To

B<)Y      the side    of the Ganges, about three miles above the
fortress   of  Allahabad, near the small pagoda of a gosseir
sfakirj, I saw, on the 21st of November 1777, four trees
called kulberich ; the trunk of one of which appeared of so
uncommon a size, that            I  sent for a string to measure its di
mensions, and found the circumference of it to be thirty
feet ten inches.         Its height      is that   of a pretty large beech,
the rind or bark even,             annulated and         pulpy   ;   and all the
limbs smooth         and    very   large, but rather scant of foliage ;
those very small branches which bore leaves being in clus
ters, so that the tree, at some distance, seemed not unlike a
stem of the thick species of coralline.                   The leaves are the
size   of  oak leaves,      but not sinuated,         and of   a   light though
not bright green ; the fruit is of the fame colour, in sliape
almost conical like a pine, nine inches long, eleven inches
and a half round the most swelling part, and with a soft
velvet rind.        Not being in blossom at that season, I had no
opportunity to observe the flower.                 The fakir told       me     that
 there    were   only those four within 700 miles of the place ;
the feeds of them, which are shaped like a kidney bean, and
 as large as a caravan/a, having been sent for by one of the

luckily met with       a gentleman named            Kerr,   celebrated   for
bis skill in botanical researches, who told me that the above-
mentioned     tree was     of the species       classed in the   Linnæan
system under the     name of Adanfonia,          a  description of which
is to be found in the sixth edition of his Genera Plantarum,

 V. Account of     a  Banian    Tree   in     the   Province   of Bahar.
                     By Colonel    Ironside          *.
XN EAR       Manjee,     a small   town at the confluence of the
Devab (or Gogra) and the Ganges, about twenty miles west
of the city of Patna, there is a remarkably large tree, called
a bur or banian tree,     which    has the quality       of extending     its
branches, in a horizontal direction, to a considerable distance
from its stem ; and of then dropping leafless fibres, or scions,
to the ground,      which there catch hold of the earth, take
root, embody, grow thick, and serve either to support                   the
protracted branches, or, by a farther vegetation, to compose
a second trunk.         From these branches other arms again
spring out, fall down, enter the ground, grow up again, and
constitute a third stem, and      so on.       From the opposite pretty
high bank of the Ganges, and at the distance of near eight
miles,   we perceived     this tree of a pyramidical shape, with
an easy spreading     slope from its summit to the extremity               of
its lower branches, and mistook it at first for a small hill                 :
we had no quadrant to measure its height; but the middle
or principal stem is considerably higher, I think, than the
highest elm, or other tree,     I  ever saw      in England.      The fol-

                      use                        ore.         Brand,
mines in Sweden, first proved that cobalt was                                      a   semi-metal,
and that it        possessed     peculiar properties different from those
of other metals.                 He   defended           his opinion against various
objections that' were                 made to it         ;       but it is still believed           by
some, that it is a mixture                  of copper, iron,                and arsenic       :   and
this seems the more probable,                       as a fixed blue colour, fit for
being employed in the arts and manufactures, is prepared
with    advantage           at   Vienna from iron                     and      arsenic.        This,
however, does not place the circumstance beyond all doubt,
for it still remains to be examined whether the arsenic and
iron employed for that purpose                               be free from cobalt ; and,
until that        be ascertained,           the    fact must be involved in un
certainty     ;   for both, or at least one of them, may be mixed
with cobalt,
    Lehmann          was  of opinion, that the colouring matter of
cobalt consisted        of a fin#alcaline earth combined with some
particles of copper and iron                 ;     and he made                 experiments on
this subject, by which he obtained blue glass.       But from
the description he gives of his experiments it does not appear
sufficiently proved that ingredients free from cobalt were used
for the mixture.
    The      reason    why some may have been                                inclined        not to
ascribe the principle             which colours smalt to                       a   metallic sub
stance may have been, that they employed for their experi
ments, a cobalt ore free from                           arsenic,        and did not apply             a
sufficiently strong heat,              without which the regulus of cobalt
is difficult to be fused, and not so easily separated                                  :   the prin
ciple which gives the blue colour to glass                               is,   however, to be
                                                                                            ascribed,

ascribed     certainly to the metal of cobalt, as has been placed
beyond all doubt, and clearly proved by the experiments of
M. Meyer,         to be found in Sellers' Collections.
   Some, on the other hand, have endeavoured                      to banish co
balt from the number of metals                 ;  but no one will certainly
any longer doubt of its being a peculiar metal, since it is well
established,       that simple substances are properly considered               to
be specifically different when they exhibit various properties
which other         bodies do not possess,         and that every substance
is considered        as simple  when it cannot be separated into dif
ferent principles, and be again formed from them. Now this
is confirmed in regard to cobalt; and it is found that it not
only possesses properties different from those of all other rrle-
tals, but is itself        a  metal of    a  totally peculiar kind.         Even
though      there be an analogy between               iron,   nickel,    arsenic,
and cobalt ; and though,            according       to the    supposed     hypo
thesis, the regulus        of cobalt  is only a variety     of iron,    and that
it  is difficult,      if not impossible, to separate it from cobalt;
yet the latter still remains a metal of a peculiar kind.
   The     first aud      principal   researches      for discovering cobalt
mines were made in the Saxon mountains,                         and these pro
cured to that country an opportunity                 of carrying on       a con
siderable     trade     with this production.            Good cobalt ore, fit
for colouring, is found at present,              though not in such abun
dance, in Hesse, Wurtemberg,                 the   Harz, Bohemia,        Prussia,
Silesia, and Sweden.                                                         ,
    As  far as     I  know, pure native cobalt has never               yet been
found   ;   what is commonly pretended                to be such,      is mine
ralised by arsenic.          It  is found in an oxygenated            state, and
always combined            with iron,     and also mineralised         with car
bonic     acid   ;    in vitrious cobalt ore,        by the sulphuric and
the arsenical acids        ; and to this belongs the so called flowers
of cobalt, found in           tender reddish crystals       :  it  is also found
mineralised by arsenic, with            a  little iron, in dull grey cobalt
ore   j by sulphur        and arsenic,     with iron, in white          arsenical
                                                                           cobalt

364                  On the different Kinds               of Cadmia, and
cobalt ore ; and by a little sulphur, with abundance of iron
without any arsenic,                 in sulphurated cobalt ore.
     When        such ore        is treated in the fire, the arsenic                 evaporates,
and the metallic and earthy particles remain behind,                                       which,
in order        to be prepared            for commerce, must                  be mixed          with
pounded quartz or sand, afterwards moistened, and then
packed up in casks under the name of faflor or zaffera.    If
very fusible glass be melted with a little cobalt ore, and if
the mass be finely pulverised,                        it produces smalt, which, by
washing, may be fitted for an                          article of commerce of diffe
rent qualities and sorted. This smalt, however, contains in
general an impure regulus of cobalt, which often consists of
a mixture of cobalt, iron, arsenic, and nickel, and is called
cobalt speife.             If you    wish to obtain            a   pure regulus of cobalt,
vou must choose for that purpose                          a   cobalt ore as free           as   pos
sible from foreign metallic substances.                    You must then                        roast
it carefully according               to    the proportions of sulphur and                       arse
nic which you find in      and reduce     it,                      it   by   adding carbona
ceous matter to take up the oxygen, and                                 a   good alcaline flux
at   a   strong fusing heat.                If the
                                               cobalt ore employed contains
bismuth, and              is   free from nickel, the regulus of bismuth will
be found at the bottom                     of the      reduced      cobalt in       a    separated
state.         This      regulus    is    not pure, and sufficiently free from
iron   ;    but     it   may be brought to purity, though with trouble
and     a   considerable           lossof the regulus of cobalt. To effect
this,    it    must be         calcined with borax, on    test, in the fame
                                                                        a
manner         as   copper, until         it    is   no longer attracted            by   the mag
net.        Some, however, are of opinion,                              that iron     is   not the
only metal attracted                 by    the loadstone,           and      that   it   exercises
an attractive power over the finest blue colouring regulus of
cobalt     ;    but there are well-grounded objections against this
idea,      for that effect takes place only when the latter                                 is   not
sufficiently freed from iron;                         and according           to the experi
ments of Bergmann,                   a    composition of one part                   of iron      and
three parts         of cobalt       is    attracted      by   the magnet;            but   if    the
                                                                                     proportion

              particularly       those  of Zinc and Cobalt.              36*5
proportion of the iron be considerably less, that effect is not
produced.
    The   specific     gravity of a regulus of cobalt, purified as
much as possible by the above method, is 7-7oo*; its colour
is a pale greyish blue, but it becomes somewhat darker when
exposed to the atmosphere : it is finely granulated on the
fracture, and requires a strong degree of heat to be fused,
especially when no arsenic is present ; and therefore it hap
pens    that it is   so difficult    to extract the      regulus by fusion
from cobalt ore which contains no arsenic.                  It is not, how
ever, volatile, like the greater part           of  the semi-metals;     and
does not inflame and evaporate,              but when calcined becomes
a blackish oxyde.
    When cobalt       is pure,   it dissolves  in acids  with  a red colour ;
when it does not dissolve, it is            a sign  that it is prevented by
some foreign mixture          : if the   solution be green, it commonly
implies the presence of nickel.                                               <
    With the vitriolic acid cobalt affords brownish red crys
tals ; the nitrous acid dissolves it also of a red colour : by the-
muriatic    acid regulus of cobalt is dissolved with difficulty,-
but its calx easily dissolves.           This solution is red when cold,
 but when exposed to a heat             of 80 degrees becomes green ; it
shoots into red crystals        inclining to blue : if these crystals are
 dissolved in water, and a little of the muriatic acid be added, it
 produces that kind of sympathetic ink which becomes green
 when heated,        and   invisible when cold.           The   acetous  acid
 dissolves the calx      of cobalt    also  of a red  colour.   If such solu
 tions are precipitated by volatile lixivious salts (ammonia),
 and the quantity necessary for saturation be added, it is re-
 dissolved  of  a dark red colour.
     In the wet way the oxalic acid, and in the dry way iron,
 have the greatest affinity with cobalt.              It combines with all
 metals except silver,        lead,    and bismuth.       Regulus of cobalt
 unites only weakly with sulphur,                 but is fully dissolved by
 sulphat of pot-ash.

  J. HE account          of this singular cafe was transmitted to M.
Odhelius,     together with some of the larvae, by M. Flank,
surgeon   of Carlstadt, who, during the              course   of forty   years
practice, never saw any of the like kind             discharged     from the
human body.           The patient, who     was seventeen years         of age,
and who for three years had been quite regular,                  became    in
disposed in the year 1786, and complained                of  a  violent pain
and griping in her stomach, with a head-ache and confusion
in   the morning,       a  burning in the throat, and great lassitude.
These symptoms were lessened after repeated eructation ; but
the disorder still increased.         Mineral water with jalep pow
der was prescribed,         and the larvæ began gradually to be dis
charged   ;  but     as  the patient did not find much relief, and as
slie nauseated jalep powder,          aloe pills,   with jalep re/in, and
mercurius dulcis,          were administered in its stead,         and about
a quart   of mineral water         each time   ;   by which means these
troublesome guests were gradually               so  completely expelled,
that the patient, in the course of          a few   weeks, was perfectly
cured.     The    larvæ      were transmitted to the Cabinet of Cu
riosities belonging        to the   Academy      of Sciences.        Professor
"Wilke found, on examining them, that they were of the
species   described        by Reaumur      under the name of Vers a

fly, called the         Pendulous Fly, Mufca pcndula L. ; because
the larvæ arc suspended, as it were, by a long thread, which
is their organ of respiration.          These larvæ, which the Pro

to six lines in length, with a tail of about the fame extent;

     X HE      fluids and solids of organised beings, and their ani
  mal machines, are constructed in such a manner that a cer
  tain degree of motion puts them in                   a good state,     while an
  augmentation or diminution              of it   deranges and destroys that
  state.     The fluids, which by their nature are easily moved,
  as   well as the fibres, which are highly susceptible of irrita
  tion, are readily affected by changes                of   the surrounding at
  mosphere,       and suffer from their impressions,                whether the
  air varies in its weight or qualities, or is changed in regard
  to its elasticity.        We find, among          those who are sound and
   in   perfect   health, vivacity,        good spirits,       and great agility,
  when the air is pure and elastic;                 on the other hand, when
   the air becomes light and damp, and is deprived of its elas-
,  ticity,   it throws the body into            a state   of languor    and debi
   lity.    Valetudinarians,         whose constitutions are delicate, or
   who are advanced in life, are much                   sooner    sensible  of the
   impressions      occasioned      by changes of      the weather than those
    who are strong and robust.             In general the senses of men,
   who in their way of life deviate from the- simplicity of na
   ture, are coarse, dull, and void of energy.                   Those also who
    are distracted     by    a thousand   other objects, scarcely feel the
    impressions     of   the   air;  and   if they    speak    of them   to sill up
    a vacuum in their miserable            and frivolous conversation, they
    do it without      thinking of their      causes or effects, and without

3$8                 Ox     the Signs exhibited by         Animals
ever paying attention to them.                  But animals which retain
their natural instinct, which               have their organs better consti
tuted       and their fenses in a more perfect state, and which
besides are  not changed by vicious and depraved habits,
perceive sooner, and are more susceptible of the impressions
produced in them by variations of the atmosphere,                                    and
sooner exhibit signs of them.
  Until the new              discovery      of animal electricity little             at
tention was paid to these signs,                 which      were    consequently
ascribed      to a certain natural prescience.               But   as the electric
matter issuing from the earth diffuses                   itself through the at
mosphere, it must penetrate                  and agitate the frail machines
in question ; and          as   it carries with it   vapours and exhalations
of various kinds,          these must       produce, on machines            so   deli
cate, different sensations,            which make them move in                   a   dif
ferent manner ; and, according        the received impression is
                                               as
agreeable or troublesome, they exhibit signs of joy or sadness;
fend forth cries, or are silent ; move, or remain at rest; as is
observed       in all kinds        of animals, without excepting man,
when the weather is about to change.
  In    the last place, internal and animal                  electricity,    which
in all probability is the           agent   of life and the grand       source        of
organic motion,            must be as much subject to modifications
as the external electricity, from which it acquires new force
and activity by the vapours and humidity of the atmosphere,
which absorbing the electric matter in abundance, or serving
it as a conductor, draws it off from the animal machine.
Hence arises that languor and debility which are experi
enced   during wet weather and when the south winds pre
vail ; and for the fame reason the moisture which has pene
trated the organs,              at least those that are weak or have suf
fered  any hurt or injury, or been exposed to some new agi
tation, produces uneasiness and occasions pain.   It is diffi
cult to explain clearly and with precision how all this takes
place   ;    that   is,   how the electricity       is   excited, and       by   what
mechanism exhalations and vapours affect animals, and pro
                                                                                 duce

duce     changes     in their bodies, since       we are not acquainted
with the curious organisation of the             most delicate    parts  of
these machines j but we can observe and                perceive  the pro
gress and general consequences          of  these phenomena, as well
as   of those by which they       are produced.        The following are
the common and familiar signs           exhibited by animals, which
indicate changes        of the weather,      and   which    are not taken
so   much from the agricultural poet, who first collected them,
as from common observation            :
     i.  When      the bats remain longer than usual          abroad from
their holes, fly about in greater numbers and to a greater
distance than common, it announces that the following day
will    be warm and serene ; but         if they enter the houses, and
 fend forth loud and repeated cries,          it indicates bad weather.
     a.  If the   owl is heard     to scream      during bad weather, it
 announces that it will become fine.
     3. The croaking of crows in the morning indicates fine
  weather.
     4. When the raven croaks three or four times, extending
  his wings and (baking the leaves, it is £ sign of serene wea
  ther.
     5. It is an indication of rain and stormy weather when
  ducks and geese fly backwards and forwards; when they
  plunge frequently into the water, or begin to fend forth cries
  and to fly about.
      6.  If the  bees do not remove to a great distance from their
   hives, it announces rain ;      if they  return to their hives beforfe
   the usual time, it may be concluded that it will soon fall.
      7.  If pigeons    return slowly to the pigeon- house, it indi
   cates that the succeeding      days  will   be rainy.
      8.  It  is a sign  of rain or wind when        the sparrows   chirp a
   great deal, and make a noise to each other to assemble.
      9. When fowls and chickens roll in the sand more than
   usual,  it announces rain : the cafe is the fame when the cocks
   crow in the evening, or at uncommon hours.

         10.           Peacocks, which cry during the night,                                    have a pre
    sentation               of rain.
         11.           It   is believed to be a sign                  of       bad weather when                the
    swallows                fly   in   such     a   manner         as to brush        the    surface     of    the
    water, and to touch                       it    frequently with their wings and                      breast.
    l         a.       The weather            about to become cloudy, and to change

    for the worse,                     when the flies sting, and become more trou
    blesome than usual.
         13.           When           the gnats collect:            themselves          before the       setting
    of    the sun,                and form          a   sort      of vortex in the           shape     of  a   co
    lumn,              it   announces fine weather.
         14.           When sea-fowl and other aquatic birds                                    retire to      the
    sea-shore or marshes,                         it    indicates     a   change        of weather         and   a
    sudden storm.
         15.           If   the cranes             fly exceedingly high,                  in    silence,     and
    ranged in order,                      it      is
                                                  a        sign    of approaching              fine weather      ;
    but       if       they     fly    in disorder, or immediately return                         with     cries,
it       announces wind.
         16.           When           the dolphins           sport    and make frequent                    leaps,
    the    being tranquil and calm,
              sea                    denotes that the wind          it                                       will
    blow from that quarter from which they proceed.
         17.           If the     frogs croak more than usual;                          if  the toads       issue
    from their holes                         in     the evening           in   great numbers;            if    the
    earth-worms come forth from the earth, and scorpions                                                       ap

      Other Signs which announce Changes               of the Weather.
    1. If   the flame      of  a lamp crackles or flares,        it indicates
rainy weather.
    2. The    cafe is the fame when the soot detaches itself from
the chimney and falls down.
    3.  It is a sign    of rain,  also, when the soot collected around
pots or kettles       takes   sire   in  the form    of   small   points like
grains of millet; because this phenomenon denotes that the
air is cold   and moist.
    4. If  the coals seem hotter than usual,              or if the flame is
more agitated, though the weather be calm at the time, it
indicates wind.
    5. When the flame burns steady,                and proceeds        straight
upwards, it is a sign of fine weather.
    6. If the    sound    of bells    is heard at a great distance,        it is
a sign   of wind, or of      a change     of weather.
    7. The hollow sound of forests ; the murmuring noise of
the waves of the sea ; their foaming, and green and black
colour, announce a sterm.
    8. Good or bad smells,             seeming as   if it  were condensed,
are a sign    of  a change of weather ; either because exhalations
arise and     are dispersed      in more abundance, which            is a sign
of  an increase     of electricity;     or because the air does not         dif«-
pell or raise these exhalations, which indicates that the con
stitution of the atmosphere is motionless,              light, and void of
elasticity.
    9. When the spiders webs and the leaves of the trees are
agitated without any sensible wind, it is a sign of wind, and
perhaps of rain       ;  because it denotes     that strong      and pene
trating exhalations arise from the earth.
    10. These signs are less equivocal when the dry leaves and
chaff are agitated in a vortex, and raised into the air.

     1 1.    A frequent      change       of wind, accompanied with                       an agi
tation of the clouds, denotes                a sudden storm.
     I a. A want         or too great a quantity of dew being a mark
of    a strong         evaporation, announces rain                    :       the cafe is the
fame        with thick, white hoar-frost, which is only                                dew con
gealed.
  13. If salt, marble, and glass become moist some days
before rain ; if articles of wood, doors, and chests of drawers
swell ;       if the   corns on the feet and the scars of old wounds
become painful; all these signs indicate that aqueous                                            va
pours are exhaled from the earth, and are no doubt directed
by the electric matter, which                     diffuses         itself then in greater
abundance and penetrates                     every body.              Hence it happens
that stones become moist, that wood swells,                                     and salt be
comes deliquescent                by the moisture.                 When the          stones after
.being moist become dry, it is a                      sign'   of fine weather.
     14.     On   the other hand, when the weather inclines to rain,
the water is seen to diminish                    in   vases    and fountains, because
the humidity           is then carried away by the evaporation                              of the
electric matter.
     15.      It is certainly        a surprising phenomenon                         to see the
earth, after very long and very abundant rains, to be some
times almost dry, the roads quite free from dirt,                                         and    the
hands to become arid and parched.                                  This   is a sign that the
 ram has not altogether ceased, and denotes                               a   continual efflux
of electric matter, which being                        renewed        carries with             it,   in
 the form of vapours, all the moisture that falls on the earth.
      16. There        is   sometimes,      however,           a   great deal        of dirt    even
 after      a   very moderate rain,              which         in that        case   is a   sign     of
 fine weather, because              it   indicates that evaporation has ceased.
 Dry        stones and        moist      earth        announce fine weather; dry
 earth and moist stones announce rain.
     1   7.   The winds which begin                   to blow       in the day-time, are
 much stronger, and endure longer, than those which begin to
 blow only in the night.

  the night-time, is not, in general, of long duration ; and,
  for the most part, wind is more uncommon in the night
 than in the day-time.           Fine weather in the night, with scat
 tered clouds, does not last.
     19.   A Venetian      proverb fays, that a sudden storm from the
 north does not last three davs.
     »o. The hoar-frost, which is first occasioned                 by the     east
 wind,     indicates that the cold will continue             a  long time, as
 was the cafe       in 1770.
     21.   If it  thunders in the month of December, moderate
 and fine weather may be expected.
     22.   If it thunders     at intervals  in   the spring time, before
 the trees have acquired leaves, cold weather is still to be ex
 pected.
     23. If the wind docs not change, the weather will remain
 the fame.
    Such almost are the signs of the variations of the atmo
 sphere ; but      I will not     be answerable       for the certainty of
 them all.        Plutarch, in his Problems,        where it is asked why
 a horse who has escaped from a              wolf    becomes       fleeter,   re
 plies, that because,         by a single action, but executed               with
great force and vigour, he has acquired a disposition to run
ning and a habit of speed ; or perhaps, because he is natu
rally swift and agile       :  but he adds, perhaps        neither     of   these
is true.      This observation,      I  am afraid, will apply to some
of  the  vulgar prognostics of        the present day.         For example,
we are told, that it is a sign        of fertility in any year when a
fly is engendered        in an acorn of that year ; and that it is the
sign   of   a pestilential year,     if there   issues    from it     a spider.
Should the reason be asked, it might             "be  replied, that neither
of  these is true.       I might venture to fay          as  much      of  those
popular tales in regard to certain critical days of the month j
yet we must still have some respect for popular proverbs,
which     are often founded on observation           and reason.        Thus it
is said, that    if it rains on   the 3d of May, the        day   of the Holy

 15th of June, St. Vitus's day, &c.                 ; in  the first cafe the nutt
 will  be spoiled       ;  in   the   second,    the figs ; and     in   the third,
 the grapes.        All this may           be true to a certain degree,          that
is to fay, when it rains for              a certain number of days about
these periods ; because,             if rain  falls at the time when fruit-
trees are    in blofibm, it         carries off the fecundating farina, and
by   these means renders them barren.
    In   regard to the general qualities              of the  seasons, and their
influence,       attention may be paid to the following signs                     : —
If the    earth and air abound             with   insects,   worms, frogs, lo
custs,    &c.  ;   if   the walnut-tree has more leaves                than, fruit   5
if   there    are     large     quantities of      beans,    fruit, and fish ;      if
the spring and summer are too damp ; if hoar-frost, fogs,
and dew come on at times when they are not generally seen,
the year will be barren               :  the opposite      signs announce fer
tility  and abundance.             Animals      seem also to foresee and pro
gnosticate       fertility or barrenness : it is said that when the
birds flock together, quit the woods and islands, and retire
to the fields,         villages and towns, it is a sign that the year
will   be barren.
    A   great quantity         of snow in winter        promises    a  fertile vear,
but abundant rains give reason to apprehend that it will be
barren.       A winter, during which a great deal of snow and
rain falls, announces a very warm summer.                          It is generally
believed that thunder and storms in winter prognosticate
abundance, because they fertilise the earth. When the spring
is rainy, it produces an abundant crop                    of hay   and    of  useless
herbs, but at the fame time a scarcity and dearth of grain.
If it is warm, there will be plenty of fruit, but they will be
almost all spoilt.          If it  is cold and dry, there       will   be few   fruit
or grapes,        and      silk-worms       will not thrive.         If  it is only
dry, there will be few fruit, but they will be                    good.       In the
last place,    if it    is cold, the fruit   will    be late in coming to ma
turity.
    If the   spring and summer are both damp, or even both
dry, a scarcity and dearth              of provision*    is to be apprehended.

 If the   summer is dry, there will be little corn            :  diseases    will
 also prevail ;     but they will be more numerous              if it is warm.
 If it is  moderately cold, the corn will be late;              but there    will
 be a great deal      of it ; and   the season     will  occasion      few dis
 eases.
    A   fine autumn announces a winter               during which winds
 will prevail : if it    is damp and rainy, it spoils the grapes,             in
jures the sown fields,         and   threatens    a scarcity.      If it  be too
 cold, or too warm, it produces many maladies.                    A long   seve
 rity of the    seasons, either by winds, drought, dampness, heat
 or cold, becomes          exceedingly destructive to plants and ani
 mals. In general, there is a compensation for rain or drought
 between one season and another. A damp spring or summer
 is commonly followed by             a  fine autumn.        If the    winter is
 rainy, the spring will be dry ; and if the former is dry, the
 latter will be damp. When the autumn is fine, the spring
 will  be rainy.       That this alternation is in          general      verified
 may be     seen   in  a Journal carried on for forty        years, and for
 merly edited by        M.   de Poleni.

sons procure their livelihood            by catching vipers.       They are
employed by chemists, apothecaries, &c.
   I  remember, some years before leaving England,                   to have
read,   in   the Philosophical       Transactions of the Royal Society
in London,       a curious      circumstance relative to one of these
viper-catchere.
   A   member of the society had received, casually, informa
tion that a man engaged in this business was frequently
bitten, and that he cured himself by sweet olive oil. After
considerable inquiry, the viper-catcher was found, and the
questions asked, whether he did cure himself by the oil                 r  and
whether he was willing to gratify a number of gentlemen                      of
the fact   ?   The man answered affirmatively to both questions.
Accordingly,      a most numerous meeting             of the Royal Society
was convened, composed               of  a  considerable number of the
nobility, &c. The viper-catcher attended, accompanied by
his wife, with a large viper; and laying his arm naked to the
shoulder, suffered the irritated reptile to strike, which it did
very forcibly.       His wife permitted         the poison to operate       till
her husband's head,           face,   and tongue were greatly swelled,
his arm and face           also very black,      and his fenses much        af
fected,   when he applied the oil, by pouring a small quantity-
down his throat, and bathing the part bitten.                The man gra
dually and soon recovered.
   This circumstance being strongly                  impressed    upon my
mind,     and knowing        that the poison of an English viper is
considered in that country the most subtile in nature, deter
mined me to       try- its  antidotal power in the bite of the rattle
snake, the first opportunity which should offer, on my retire
ment from Charlestown               to the back country,         now called
Pendleton County.            I was   also particularly impelled to make
the trial, from a consideration of the newness                 and wildm      fs
of the country,      and the number         of my family,      beside which
there were hardly         a  dozen more in the country.            This was
in the year 1786.                                            •

                                          £                             fame     j

                                                                                 '
                 in  the Case  of the Bite of Serpents.                   377
came to my camp, and most urgently begged to know if I
could assist a man who had just been bitten by a very large
 rattle-snake.      Although      I   lamented the misfortune,          I  re
joiced at the opportunity it offered to ascertain fully the pro
 perty of olive oil as an antidote to this deadly poison ; ac
 cordingly   I   put  a phial of oil in my pocket, and mounted
 the messenger's horse.
     When      I  arrived at the          unfortunate man's       cabin,    he
 struck me     as the   most frightful        object    I had   ever beheld.
  His   head and face were prodigiously swelled,            the latter black;
  his tongue proportionably enlarged, and out of his mouth ;
  his eyes   as   if shooting from their         sockets ; his fenses gone,
  and every appearance          of immediate suffocation.            He had
  been struck on the side       of the foot, about the middle, in the
  hollow.
      Immediately,      but with great difficulty,          I  got down two
  table-spoons full of oil.        Its effect was almost instantaneous,
  and astonishingly powerful           in counteracting the poison,           as
  appeared     by the    strong     though quick convulsions that fol
  lowed.     In about thirty minutes it             operated strongly, both
   emetically and cathartically         ;  after which the swelling of the
   head, face, 8cc. gradually abated, and the tongue began to
   assume its place.      In about two hours            he was so far reco
   vered as to be able to articulate,           and   from that time reco
   vered fast.    The oil, inwardly taken,           and applied to the foot
   and leg, both exceedingly swelled,              did not exceed seven or
   eight spoons full.
       The number of      cafes,    of    a like nature,    in  the course     of
   twelve years,      has been considerable         ; in all which, olive oil
   has proved itself to be peculiarly adapted             and fully adequate
   to the worst    of cases, if timely applied. It is a remedy which
    every person may command (may have at hand when others
    cannot be procured), and ought not to be without; indeed,
    many cautious people here carry a small phial of oil con
    stantly about them.        It  has also been used        with   equal   suc-
    cese  when horses, cattle, and dogs have been bitten.                  Thus
                                                                                is

  is  the mind relieved from terror in those whose              occupation
   subjects them to the bite      of the snakes, from a well-grounded
   confidence in the certain efficacy          of the  oil,  and to which
   every one may have instant recurrence.
      The  cafe,  I am   informed, has occurred, where the oil         suc
  ceeded when given to a woman bitten by a mad dog, under
  strong symptoms of hydrophobia              ;  but at present   I am not
  sufficiently in possession of particulars to warrant its            com
  munication.
      I can hardly excuse myself of criminal          neglect  in having  so
  long omitted to make thus public this sovereign antidote to
  the worst of animal poisons.          The knowledge of the efficacy
  of the olive oil is abundantly         diffused   in this county,     and
  partially in some of the adjoining counties.
      The insertion of the foregoing particulars in your City and
  Carolina Gazettes, must make its invaluable properties gene*

    IT has    been a general        remark, that deaf people speak in a
very low tone of voice, while they themselves conceive that
they speak very loud.             It is supposed that the deaf person,
not being so easily affected by sound, answers in what he be-.
Jieves to be the proper and corresponding pitch.
     I came down last night from London to Gosport in the
 stage-coach     :  one   of  the passengers, a woman, was extremely-
deaf.      A  few weeks before,           I  had travelled     in  a  similar ve
 hicle with an unentertaining companion of the fame kind.
My attention        has    been     thereby turned to the subject ; and
 I  am led to make the following remarks                 : —
     For that   deafness arising from impaired excitability                of the
organ of hearing, properly              so  called,   I know     of no   remedy :
 I  confine what       I  have     to fey to that species         of it which   is
 occasioned     by   a diseased state       of tympanum, or         the external
 meatus.
     In either of     these last cases sounds communicated by the
 external ear appear to be of a lower pitch than in reality they
 are ; while, if the Eustachian tube continues permeable, those
 communicated through the mouth appear higher and louder
 than usual.        Even where the ear and all its parts and pas
 sages   are in health, sounds communicated through the mouth
 are more perfect than those             which     pass through the external
 meatus.       This,     perhaps,     is occasioned        partly by the con
 cavity of the         mouthj       and     partly   by the      solidity  of the
  teeth.     In    persons     whose       tympanum,        or whose external
  meatus is diseased,        it  is probable that the ear, from habit,
  becomes      more sensible         to    the vibrations       of found com
  municated through the Eustachian tube, than, without such
  a circumstance, it otherwise would be.
      Sound being more easily communicated through the me
  dium of solid than of rare bodies, I apprehend that a long
  wire held in the mouth would be much more serviceable
  to such a deaf person, than the largest trumpet applied to the
  external ear.
      it possesses also    the advantage of being extremely portable,
                                                                              and

  XI. On the Assaying of Ores by Fusion. By Mr. David
      Mushet of the Clyde Iron- f Forks. Communicated by the
      Author.
  M,LY       Paper in the Number for            July concluded with a
  table  of the proportions requisite to obtain,           from all the va
  rious iron-stones, an accurate        assay ;  the perfection of which
 is always indicated by        the  superior transparency          of the flux,
  and the super-carbonation        of the metallic button.            By   scru
  pulously following      these and similar proportions as the exi
 gencies of the ore may point out, crude iron will always be
 obtained of the finest quality, carbonated beyond whatever
 is produced     in  the large way    of manufacture, and its surface
 covered    with    a  beautiful carburet of iron, either in small
 shining specula,       or in the  state   of  a thin     membrane.          By
 a slight gradation      of change in      the proportions       of  the com
 ponent parts of the flux, the metal of the fame iron-stone
 may be made to        pass  through all the inferior states.
     Since,   then, all iron-stones in the         assay-  furnace may be
made to give out their iron at pleasure, of all the various
qualities, it is surely erroneous to assert, that such and such
iron-stones contain such and such qualities of iron                ; that,  this
one affords      metal of the finest quality, while that, on the
contrary, yields iron fit only for forge-pigs or ballast; yet this
is the universal language in the manufactory.                     In this, as
in many instances,         we -accommodate        the language to our
ideas, rather than our ideas to truth.              The    suffrage    of pre
vailing   custom has imperceptibly associated with our ideas
many absurdities        which   we   are afterwards ashamed to ac
knowledge, and which darken the gleam                 of truth, or render
                                                                              it

    it apparently ridiculous, merely                  because      it is  at variance      with
   cur prejudices. Where science                      guides not the manufacturer,
   or is scorned by him, his train of reasoning, though far from
   being just, is short; it is fitted to the narrow culture of his
   mind, and consonant                  to a barbarous nomenclature                     of   re
   ceived usage*.
       In   order to elucidate still farther how much the quality of
   the iron is dependent upon the proportions of the mixtures,
   in combination with, or given to the ores, let a determinate
   quantity, fay an ounce, of the oxyde                          of pure malleable iron
.  be   taken;   —   this we are physically certain contains no mixture

      •  I cannot resist noticing one instance, prevalent at iron-works, of that
  blind reverence to the opinion of our predecessors, whose sources of know.
  ledge must necessarily have been few and contracted.                       When super-car
   bonated crude iron is run from the furnace, it is frequently                   covered with
  a scurf,   which when cold         is found to be a coating         of plumbago (carburet
  of iron) remarkably brilliant           ;  sometimes in small specks,           and at other
  times in large flakes : this substance            is universally     denominated sulphur,
  and, as the most expressive         adjective for that quality, we fay that the iron
  is sulphury.     There     are   not,     perhaps,   two substances      so opposite in  their
  degrees of inflammability,           or   so  widely different in their properties, as
  sulphur and plumbago ; the existence of the latter almost wholly supposes
  a total absence of the former : yet, such is the want of investigation, or the
  slightest momentary reflection,            that an indolent belief        is passed as to the
  presence   of a substance     diametrically      opposite to that which is expressed.
  Sulphur has hitherto been the philosopher's              stone   of the iron manufactory ;
  to its presence   is attributed the production         of bad iron — when the metal is
  in its  most valuable state, it is also sulphury ;        — it    prevents cast iron     from
  becoming malleable;        and   if sulf bur were altogether absent, hard or white
  cast iron could not be produced.              If  cast  iron is found coloured,       it is by
  the sulphur ; is it crystallised and coloured,             then it has sulphur to excess;
  should it have lost its strength, or have become               loose in the fracture    by an
  excess   of shrinkage in large castings, still it           is by the agency     of sulphur:
  in (hort, in every process in the manufacturing                of iron, sulphur      explains
  the whole phenomena ! it is execrated in one process, and anxiously looked
  £»r in another.

 than     is   necessary        to effect        this,         a    small mass of malleable
 iron will           be found occupying                   the bottom of the crucible.
 The produce in either                   cafe    will      be sliort         of   the real quantity
 of metal contained in        the oxyde.  When oxygenated crude
 iron    is   obtained, the ore  from which     produced, to use        it   is
 the common phraseology,                    is       said to contain bad iron.                     That
 this has no relation to truth, will be                              seen         by   taking another
 portion of the same oxyde                 ;     let      it   be mixed either with chalk
 or lime, and          a   little bottle-glass, to constitute fusibility,                            and
exposed to    similar degree of heat with the former
                     a                                 the                                       ;

bonated         crude iron.         Here then                  is   a   complete alteration            in
the quality of the metal, though obtained from the fame ore                                           j
for we cannot consider iron combined with oxygen, to which
earthy bases are given, in any other light than that of an
ore. Again, let     portion of mixture, exactly similar to the
                            a
last,    have added            to   it   double or triple its weight of bottle
glass,        and    subject    the whole to an equal heat with the for
mer experiments, nearly                    a    complete revival of all the metal
will    be found to have taken place                       ;       its quality, however,             will
be highly oxygenated                and brittle.                Such experiments clearly
demonstrate,           that the various qualities                       of crude iron          are en
tirely owing to the mixtures                         in   the ore, and their treatment)
and that iron, considered                       as   a    simple metallic substance,                   is
the fame in point of quality in all ores.
   If    iron was originally formed in                      metallic state, its pro-

of iron   ores   ; that part of the water — by far                        the greatest —
which remained undecomposed, would serve                                as a medium, or
vehicle of suspension, and conveyance to                                the oxydej       this
again, in its turn, would be deposited either at the fountain-
head, or at a greater or lesser distance from      according to         it,
the affinities exerted upon                  by
                                   other substances with which
                                       it
it   might come in contact.              Corresponding                  with this   suppo
sition, we commonly find those ores which are formed in
vertical masses or knobs, approached                           by   a   great number       of
small veins       occupying the smallest fissure or crevice in the
rock.     Time,        and       the re-action       of additional water and
acids, would      a    second time carry            off   a   portion of the ore in
chemical      union; this, by            the      exertion of new affinities,
would become precipitated, and mixed with the suspended
earths, to form regular strata of iron-stone. To such pri                            a
mary and secondary agency of formation may be attributed
the general superior richness                of   ores found            in irregular     ver
tical masses,         to that      of iron-stones.             The      fame cause       will
also explain why more determinate qualities                              of iron    are ob
tained    from primitive ores, than from those of                             a   secondary
formation.            In    the    former,    the    mixtures            are commonly
fewer, and the quality of the malleable iron more decided                                  ;
in the latter, the quality of the metal less certain, and more
                                                          is
various, from the mixtures being more numerous.                                      Hence
we may also trace the reason of the superior qualities and
marks     possessed        by some of the foreign fabrics over each
other, where the fame fuel has been used, and the same course
of manufacture followed.
     Having      so   far considered        crude iron,         in   regard to its fusi
bility,   and the facility          with which       it    becomes changed into
various degrees of carbonation or oxygenation,                                constituting
avariety of qualities most pointedly distinguished in com
merce, and in which the metallurgist discovers widely dif
ferent properties           and characteristic formg;                I   shall next pro
ceed to mention            in what manner            strength           may be given to
any quality of crude iron which may probably be obtained

  384               On the Assaying os Ores         ly Fusion.
  by the fusion of an ore, and from what source this property
  is derived.
      Upon    a former occasion        I have mentioned that iron,          ob
  tained from argillaceous ores,           possessed a degree     of strength
  beyond that obtained from the other genera.                     This truth
  daily presents itself to our observation in the large scale                 of
  manufacture      ;   and however erroneous            the reasoning of the
  manufacturer        as to the cause,     yet so    evident are the conse
  quences     produced, that we must immediately attribute them
  to some source beyond the casualties of operation in the
  smelting furnace.          In  the explanation      of this fact,   as on the
  degrees    of oxygenation       and carbonation        in general, the ma
  nufacturer has recourse           to   the  existent     nature of the iron
  in   the ore, and denominates the metal contained               in   such and
  such    an ore to be        "  strong,    coarse,    ill-melting iron ;" or
  **                                         no body." That iron-stones
      weak, tender iron, possessing
   and ores yield,       in the operation of smelting, different quali
   ties  of crude iron,     as to  strength, is an undeniable fact ; and
   that the fame variety attaches             to iron when       converted    to
   malleability    is a truth daily evinced        in our forges    :  yet these
   facts by no means entitle us to conclude, without farther in
   vestigation, that these varieties of strength are the hereditary
   property of the pristine formation of the metal. This in
   ference accords with a hasty view of the matter, and a bare
   comprehension of effects, without tracing to its source the
   modifying      principle     of the whole.          The theory which        I
   have adopted,        and   which     in  every   step    I have found sup
   ported by numerous experiments, upon different scales, and
    by a long course of practical observation, explains to me,
    with much more         ease and    harmony,      the whole phenomena
    of quality in    ores and iron-stones.
       To illustrate that part of my theory relative to strength,
    let the preceding experiment, wherein carbonated crude iron
    was produced from the oxyde of pure iron, be repeated with
    the addition of a little pure clay.           If  the clay added be half
    the weight of the lime jdfo used,              the iron will be found,
                                                                           when

 when subjected          to the gauge,         much superior in strength ;
and   if the   experiment be accurately performed, the metal will
be but a little reduced         in point of carbonation.          The follow
ing proportions will give accuracy to the result                 : — Oxyde of
iron, 4     parts — Lime, 2 — Clay,           1 — Glass,
                                                           3=  10 parts.     By
mixing clay with the flux in all experiments, the strength of
the crude iron is improved.                This point may be urged so far
as to    form, by an extra-addition of clay, a flux of difficult
 fusion ; in which         the iron becomes          suspended   in globules,
which       are partially      malleabilised apart        from   each   other.
 Crude iron, obtained with a superior mixture of clay, in all
its stages of quality, possesses a greater degree of strength than
iron from       calcareous      iron-stones.        Iron from argillaceous
iron-stone is reckoned            strongest when carbo-oxygenated j
that extracted         from calcareous iron-stone is reckoned to
 possess    most   strength     when oxygenated, mottled.             I would
far exceed the limits of the present communication,                     were   I
to enter fully into this curious subject, and particularise the
different results obtained by the fusion of ores with different
earths in various proportions            :   all my experiments     have   fully
proved to me, that originally the quality                 of the iron, simply
considered,     was the fame;          that,   as it underwent change by
decomposition         and    new combination,           it became united to
foreign substances,         possessing   widely different properties     ;  and
which mixture, by a general fusion, imparts to the metal va
rious properties, seldom homogeneous, but frequently other
wise   :  in  short,   that the numberless          mixtures with which it
is combined are not neutral in fusion, but convey an altera
tion to the quality of the reduced iron.                   I hope to resume
this subject when my experiments will be more extended by
the examination of a vast variety of iron-stones, and shall
then point out the consequent effects of their application to
the manufacture of cast and malleable iron.
   The     assaying   of primary      ores comes next under considera
tion.      These,   I have already said, possess a much greater di
versity    of external character, as well as internal variety, than

those      of iron-stone.      When       assayed     with a vitreous flux,
either of salts, alkalies, or silex, the results are rendered very
uncertain and erroneous            : when pot-ash, tartar, &c. are used,
the crucible is often destroyed,             and    the compound entirely
lost  :   when bottle glass and a mixture of these are used, the
scoria formed is so very black and ponderous as to give the
most       presumable       indication     of    the secretion      of metallic
 oxyde      :  this is afterwards     verified by fusing the mass with             a
 mixture of dried chalk and charcoal,                 a  globule   of metal will
 be obtained, which evinces the richness                   of the scoria ; this,
 having lost its colouring principle (the metal), becomes clear
 and transparent.         The    results from these ores by fusion assord
 various products, and lead to different conclusions                     :  I fhaH
 mention several of them.
     The Cumberland           iron ore, when introduced into                a  cru
 cible without any additional mixture, fuses easilv, and forms
 an opaque scoria,          internally of     a  black colour,      but towards
 the surface        covered   with    fine   sliades    of brown    :   this arises
 from a partial oxygenation of the semi-revived                     metal     while
 cooling,        and is often     injured by       a   fresli  combination        of
 oxvgen.          If  the crucible remains found,              and    the melted
 mass is kept         in a state   of  extreme     division for an hour, a
 considerable        quantity of metal will           be found precipitated,
 but     so   highly oxygenated       as to (hiver to pieces       if  exposed to
 air before it is entirely cooled.            If, when     the crucible is taken
 from the furnace, it be slightly inclined to one fide, and the
  vitrified fluid entirely removed from the surface of the metal,
  a violent deflagration          will immediately          ensue,    the   ejected
  globules will be thrown three feet upwards from the mouth
  of the crucible : if the quantity of metal does not exceed
  500 grains, it will totally disappear, except a rough dark-
  blue oxyde in the bottom of the crucible, not above 1 -4th
  of    the original weight.         The     metal    thus oxydated will be
  found in small spherules            of a blackish colour, and spongy
  around the spot occupied by the crucible.
      This curious        appearance      is  in fact    a combustion       of  irom

would be found malleable                  ;      the scoria light and porous.                        In
one of my experiments upon the hæmatites                                      variety,        I    ob

       An oxygenating flux was however                              used,    and nearly the
whole contents             in iron previously revived. In experiments
without the             addition of flux, the transmutation from cast
                                         a
to malleable iron             is   shortened,         but the produce              is       not more
than 5-8ths of              the intrinsic contents             of    the ore.            Even this
process may be considerably shortened                           by   removing the cover
ing of vitrified earths floating upon the surface of the metal:
thus the small portion of the carbonaceous principle consti
tuting fusibility            is    almost        instantly carried off by the com
bination of oxygen;                     the metal         loses its fluidity,                becomes
thick and clotted, and more speedily                           passes       into the malle-
     •   This    might be adduced as         a   proof that crude iron contains more parts
congenial to malleability          than   is   generally ?dmirted,       or than        is   manifested
in     the operation     of converting    it   into malleable iron at the forge              :   the left
there has already been mentioned                 to amount     to from 30 to           jo   per cent, of
real metal       ;   in this assiy, however, the produce in malleable iron was only
if,\     lei's than when accurately assayed,          and rich carbonated crude iron wat,
obtained    ;    in   which, too, the carbon constituted        a    part of the weight.

 able state.           In this   process the quantity                 of malleable iron ob
 tained is still less than               in    the two former          :   the surface of the
 metal being exposed by the removal of the scoria, oxydation
 takes immediate effect ; and whilst malleability is pervading
 the under surface of the metallic button, the upper one be
comes reduced to a blackish blue oxyde.                                    In this operation
 a striking proof is afforded                   of     the great affinity which oxygen
 has, in high temperatures,                          to caloric.       Were        the surface        of
 such highly oxygenated                     crude       iron exposed, while fluid, to
 atmospheric air, at an ordinary medium,                                     for    i-6th of the
time, its whole metallic properties would be completely de
stroyed      :       in the present instance nearly one-half of the metal
is preserved,            although its surface is exposed to the action of
a violent current             of gas, ignited to the highest pitch of white
ness*.           In    the   proper afl'ay of this ore I have found all the
                                                                                         varieties
   *   I   have frequently observer],           in experiments with pretty deep crucibles,
where the most violent heats were excited, and where the fluid metal had
assumed     a whitish-blue       colour somewhat inclining to azure, that the quan
tity of oxyde formed was imperceptible, and never visible while the heat
was continued of equal intensity ; when this agent became less urgent, the
surface of the metal became oxydated as usual.                        When    a regulus      of crude
iron thus exposed         was wished to be obtained free from oxydation,                      a    little
dry charcoal was introduced               into the      crucible so as to cover the regulus ;
this prevented the action of the air from taking effect while cooling, and
preserved the button smooth.                  During such exposures, when no oxyde was
produced,        I   have noted a loss of metallic parts equal to 5.7, or 10 per cent.
when the space of time did not exceed                   one   hour.     Among several conjec
tures respecting the cause of this deficiency in weight, and real abstraction of
metal, the two following have with me most weight.                          1st,   Either the metal
deflagrates in small panicles, which are thrown out of the crucible in spar
kles, made invisible by the transcendent brightness of the surrounding                             heat:
Or, zd, that in consequence of the fluid metal being exposed to such a great
degree of heat, in contact with oxygenous gas, part of it becomes acidified,
and forms the ferric acid.             The truth of       this last supposition will not easily
be ascertained, since it       will     be difficult    to construct an apparatus capable             «f
receiving or containing          it,   mould    it   prove to betan elastic fluid:      it   is,   how
ever, consonant to the cjoctrines of the new theory,                       and the possibility        of
the existence        of the ferric acid    is   by   no means excluded.        The    dissipation     of

varieties     susceptible       of various      degrees      of carbonation          :  for
the most part        I  have used chalk and               charcoal for the reduc
tion of the ore into carbonated                    crude iron.        In the      hæma
tites variety, for 1 lb. averdupoisc I have commonly added
6 oz. dried chalk and
                                   3-4ths oz. of charcoal ; and for the
fplinty blue ore also a similar mixture.                       From both of these
I have    obtained the richest sort of crude iron.                     In  the manu
factory these varieties            are always reckoned               to produce the
 hardest and most infusible qualities                  of   crude iron     :   when the
earbon or oxygen will not nearly explain this phenomenon, as they exist in
much less proportion ; and while the iron remains in a crude state, the lat
ter accumulates in proportion         as the former becomes expelled.            Besides, a
greater product iu malleable iron is obtained by following the precautions
formerly    mentioned, than e.en of cast-iron when thus exposed.                   Now,   as
malleable iron is free from all mixture,            or at least is malleable     in propor
tion as it ts unalloyed,    it is obvious that the deficient weight            is not made
up of either oxygen or carbon.             In the exposure     of  one particular    button
of crude iron, which          lost  9$ set cent,     the surface was agitated in         an
uncommon       and most     beautiful       manner : a rapid      motion    from    the ex
tremity of the circumference          to the centre    of the fluid   mass    took place;
the   motion     seemed     entirely     rotatory,    and   peculiar    to one common
axis.    The   metal itself was of a blueifh green colour,             and emitted from
its surface an azure-coloured        gas, which preserved a distinct form and co
lour from the common flame.             This   appearance first led me to suppose the
presence of the ferric acid, by which means the loss of weight, when no
oxyde was visible, would be easily accounted for.                   To try, so far, the
justice of this conjecture, I exposed tin, lead, and zinc, in different alloys'
of  these metals, to white' heats, and found them dissipate            in a much shorter
time, and with a greater discharge of gas from               their respective surfaces.
The    fame  effect was more speedily produced              by introducing       the pieces
upon the surface     of hot melted crude-iron.           Zinc, in this experiment, in-
lames instantaneously;        explodes with considerable violence, and with the
disengagement of       a blueilh   flame.     Its known inflammable property may
add little strength to this hypothesis ; but the dissipation of lead and tin,
without any residue, would          also lead to a supposition      of the plombic and
stannic acids being formed by a complete saturation of oxygen.                   The btter,
being found formed by nature in a crystalline form, does not entirely con
tradict this idea ; for a difference in the dose of oxygen,              and of tempera
ture, must alter the result.

   The kidney       ore   will admit of     a  diminution     of chalk, and
a small    addition of glass       ;  i Ib.   averdupoise    of this variety
will   be accurately assayed        with the    addition of 5 oz. chalk,
1  oz. of glass, and 3-4ths oz. of charcoal.               The fame pro
portion of mixtures           will   also  accurately reduce the small
pieces   of this   ore,    commonly of a soft, greasy consistency,
mixed with small fragments of the hæmatites                      and kidney,
and will give out the iron which they contain super-carbo
nated.      A  mixture of this soft ore with kidney is preferred
to   the   richer    varieties    at the     iron manufactories.             The
Lancashire      ore chiefly consists       of this compound,           and the
poorer in iron has always a decided                preference    given it at
the blast furnace.
    The   stratified    iron ore of the island         of Islay    is  of   most
difficult fusion when treated without any addition.                     It  fuses
into   a blackish green ponderous           mass,   and, even exposed to
the highest     heats, lets fall but a small share         of its iron.      The
quality thus obtained is in the highest               degree    oxygenated       ;
its fracture is partially crystallised          in lines which converge
towards the upper surface of the button, similar in crystal
lisation to the fracture of zinc.             A   regulus thus obtained,
when     divested     of its    scoria,   and   properly exposed to the
action of the ignited gas, soon loses its fluidity, and pastes
into the state of strong malleable iron.               If this operation is
performed upon a large quantity, without agitating or turn
ing the    mass, the upper surface          of malleable iron will early
acquire the cold short quality,             and will be subject, at the
same time, to an uncommon waste by the rapid oxydation
of   its parts.     In    assaying this ore for the production           of  car
bonated crude iron, the results are obtained with considerable
difficulty; seldom perfect till the second or third experiment.
This is chiefly owing to the great variety of quality in the
stratum,     two pieces seldom being alike either in appearance
or in reality.       The inferior     masses yield from 44 to 48 per
                                                                           cent  j

to 61 per cent.           To obtain carbonated crude iron from the
richest varieties       of this ore, add to 1 averdupoise lb. of it
7 ounces       of dried chalk, 3 of bottle-glass, and 1 of charcpal.
This mixture will produce               soft crude iron,         possessing   great
strength, and an uncommonly large crystallised grain.                          The
poorer qualities require an additional quantity                     of  calcareous
earth, to restore the equilibrium lost by the substitution of
silex   in place     of iron.       This   ore had a trial in the large way
at Clyde       Iron Works, but was found              to yield bad iron        with
the usual proportion of fuel.
    Opposite       in its quality and results is the beautiful ore of
the island        of Elba.        This, when        presented      to a requisite
proportion of carbonaceous                matter, to take up its oxygen,
not only clears itself of this hurtful mixture, but also takes
up a considerable            portion of carbon, which, in fusion, be
comes united to the metal, and constitutes                      it perfectly car
bonated.          In experiments with this           ore,   I found that when
a ounces       of it  were treated with 2 \ oz.           chalk,     \ oz. bottle-
glass,    and    i oz.     charcoal, the mixture was with difficulty
reduced to a white glass ; which at no time had been suffi
ciently divided to allow             a general     gravitation to the many
globules of beautiful carbonated iron thus separated.                             In
fusion, therefore,            per se, the metal precipitated becomes
greyish, and, in many instances,                  affords similar results to a
pure     calcareous iron-stone           ;  with this principal difference,
that it abounds with nearly                  a double quantity of metal,
whose tendency           to become carbonated          is no-ways inferior to
anv iron-stone of that class.                A  smooth carbonated           regains
will    be obtained        from this ore,      by using the following pro
portions     :   Ore in       a raw state,    2 ounces;       chalk,    2 ounces ;

resulting from this fusion will be of                    a   light-blue     colour,

The     great distance         of Elba from this country            precludes    the

vered in the vicinity     of  any   iron-work       at 22s. per ton.    The
products obtained from it in the             assay   furnace, indicate, in
an   uncommon        degree,    how very valuable the quality             of
crude iron would be       in the    scale   of manufacture, by its       ap
plication.
   The Norwegian,          Danish,       and Swedish       ores,   found in
strata, resemble,     in many points, the Scotch ore of the island
of Iflay ; in     assaying   them     a  similar treatment is necessary.
Some of them are more fusible, and afford singular qualities
of crude iron.         When     fused    with oxygenating fluxes, the
metal produced       is uncommonly hard and brittle ; exhibiting
a fracture studded      with brilliant mirrors, diverging the light
in  small radii   : even when fluxes are used, capable               of con
veying carbonation, the metal exhibits this bright granulated
fracture in a great degree.          One of the ores from the mine
of Houban, upon being              exposed     a considerable     time after
 separation,   afforded a mass       of pretty good steel. The pro
 portions necessary to     assay  these, with accuracy, so intimately
 depend upon their richness, and the relative                proportions    of
 mixture with which the iron is combined,                    that the fame
 recipe can seldom be apphed to more than one variety.                    As
 iron-stones are more defined, and their treatment prescribed
 by more certain rule,       a knowledge        of them will    soon lead to
 a just comprehension        of the primary        ores ; a second experi
 ment,    therefore, with any           of them, will      be sufficient    to
 point out the necessary proportions for obtaining in the next
 assay  carbonated crude iron.            In one collection of Norwe

quantity of carbon necessary to carbonate No.                       ij   No. 5

and as I have proved that this effect will be chiefly produced
with    the use     of   a calcareous earth,       it will  at once be con
ceived how far this substance is to be used as the instrument
of alteration.
     In the     recipes adduced     in this  and the preceding paper,            I
 have always noted charcoal as a constituent                of each mixture.
 Since    I   discovered   that the contact of calcareous earths con

                      Earth,   the Moon,      and Venus *.
  OCHROETER,               the learned astronomer        of Lilienthal, who
  has several excellent telescopes by Herschel,               published some
  time ago a work on the height of the lunar mountains,                          as
  compared with those         of the earth      ; and lately he has pub
  lished a new work on the height            of the mountains of Venus.
  Faujas, who not long ago              undertook a journey into Ger
 many,        of the utmost importance           to the   sciences,     brought
  back with him these two works of Schroeter.                   We     there fee

  his observations.           It   is by the projection           of the    shadows
  formed     by these mountains when they begin to appear                          on
  their horizon        in regard to us, or when they                  are about to
 disappear     below the horizon.              He    distinguishes      the   moun
 tains into different orders.
     The   plate in Sehroeter's work consisted only                 of outline, and
 he expressed the diameter of the three globes merely by straight
 lines.    The annexed delineation (See Plate VI 1 1.) was drawn
 by Alexander Faujas, the son, who to military talents unites                        a
 strong attachment to the sciences.               He   has rendered the height
 of the mountains          more just, and, from his drawing, the respec
 tive magnitude           of  the three globes can be better estimated.
 It  is here   seen      that   the moon, which is about forty-nine
 times smaller than the earth, has mountains                            more than
 4000 toises       in height *        ;  while    that of Chimboraco,             one
 of   the Andes        in South America,            the   highest     mountain      of
 our globe, is little more than 3000.                      Venus, which is less
 than the earth by a ninth, has mountains 23,000 toises
 in height.        It must here be remarked, that the highest
 mountains      on    these three globes appear all to be volcanic.

purpose.         I  shall, therefore,     only observe, that trials of gun
powder on a large scale are always the best ; but as sucb
experiments require certain kinds of apparatus and conve
niences which are not always at command, a small powder-
proof, in the form of             a  pistol, the blast of which drives          a
small     toothed      or turned wheel that rubs against a spring,
and is moved through a greater or smaller space according
to the strength         of   the powder, has been long ago adopted
and brought into common use.                    This machine, however,         ib
very defective        in regard to the results which it gives, and can
be  of no utility when an absolute or approximate indication is
required of the relative strength of a given weight of powder
intended for fire-arms,               which    are   loaded    with quantities
determined in this manner:                   these proof- instruments have
indeed an arbitrary graduation,                and their friction varies ac
cording to the strength of the spring and                     the cleanness    of
the mechanism.
    To obviate        these inconveniences,          I   made   several experi
ments, which led me to a more valuable and accurate prin
ciple  ;   and, with some variations,              I   at length fitted a small
brass cannon to the spring                of  a common weighing          instru
ment.        By this application            I  was    enabled     to weigh   the
effort   of the blast, and consequently obtained a comparative
method of ascertaining its action.                   This instrument is at
tended      likewise with this valuable advantage,                  that it acts
without friction.             Its graduation is accurately determined,
because       it   expresses    the weight which         served for that pur
 pose ;    and      it may likewise be applied for weighing                 such
bodies as come           within     the limits  of  its scale.
    A    perspective        view of this instrument             is  represented,

  cannon, upon which         it  presses    with   a force equal to four
  kilogrammes.       This cap    is strongly fastened       to one      of the
  spring radii by a nut at the opposite end           of its tail.    G is a
 piece  of   strong brass wire,     fixed to a projection,       which, by
  means    of   a small screw,    is riveted into one         of the radii.

  gentle friction on the wire, when the branches of the spring
  are pressed together by the explosion of the powder.                    This
 index remains at the place to which it has been pushed, and
 shews exactly how far the springs             have been     made      to ap
 proach.      When    the instrument is to be used,           the two ex
 tremities of    the spring are to be pressed together, to separate
 the cap from the mouth of the cannon, into which powder
 is poured, till it is exactly full, by means of a card or a piece
 of   paper.     The   stopper   is then suffered to approach the
 muzzle     gently,   so as to close    it exactly, without        leaving a
 single grain    of powder   between       them.     The circular        piece
 of cloth or leather, which        supplies the place      of  an index,     is
 to be brought into contact with that branch of the spring
 to which the tail of the stopper is fixed ; and priming being
put into the small pan of the cannon, it is discharged, the
instrument being held suspended by a string or ribbon. The
effects  of   the explosion   are, that, as the powder occupies a
greater space by its inflammation,           it drives back the stopper,
 and the latter carries with it that branch of the spring in
which its tail is fastened. This branch cannot move, in
regard to the other, which is made to move also by the recoil
of the gun, without driving before it the small index piece ;
and the space over which the index piece is carried will shew
the force of the powder.
    The  arches moved over by the explosion of the different
kinds of powder will (hew, by the number of degrees, the
comparative strength of each.              A star is marked on that
arch which shews the strength           of powder of a mean quality;

only friction to which the instrument is subject ; but it is                  so
small that it may be considered          as  of no  consequence.        When
the index is worn out, its place may be easily supplied                   by a
new one.         It may    be readily comprehended that, by adding
a hook to the perforation at the extremity              of  the divided arc,
and a ring     in   the eye  of the   stopper, the instrument may be
employed for weighing.
XIV.     Account      of a Red   Substance observed on the Surface           of
    a Ftsb-Pond in Norway.              By   Professor   H. Strom *.
 IN the spring of        the year 1790, a pellicle, or substance           of a
red colour, was observed on the water at one end              of a fish-pond
in Norway, which           soon after    began to spread       till it covered
the whole surface.           During dry     and warm weather, the red
colour was more perceptible than when it was cold and wet.
It  was more visible also at noon,            than in the morning          and
evening.       I,    however, did not pay much attention to it
until the colour, about          the end    of June    and the beginning
of July,    became       stronger than it had ever been before ; it
was strongest at noon,           and    always proceeded,          in regular
order, from the end of the pond till it gradually extended
over the whole surface.          I filled a beer glass with the water,
which    had a red appearance         in the glass   ;  but the red matter
soon deposited itself at the bottom,             and    the water became
yellowisli  :  for a long time, however, it had a frothy pellicle,
which was         sometimes    of  a red and sometimes of a green
colour.     I   let fall a drop   of this pellicle on my microscope,
and beheld the singular phenomenon                exhibited in the an
nexed engraving,          (Plate IX.   fig. a.) which        represents    thi9
drop as seen when magnified.

3g8                      On a Red Substance observed
    I  beheld partly large and partly small bubbles, resembling
bright specula, surrounded              by   a  dark rim or margin, which
were      sometimes        like    small rings      (l,l),    and    sometimes
broader ;        so  that the bright speculum in the middle formed
the smaller part          (2,2)  .    Every where around were           seen  an
immense number of minute globules of the size                         as  repre
sented       in   the   figure;     consequently      astonishingly small      in
regard to the specula,             but similar to them in this respect,
that they had a bright point like                a speculum    in the middle.
At    first,    as far as   I could observe, they were black, or of a
 dark colour, the bright point excepted ; but the red colour
 afterwards shewed itself very clearly. In those that were
 red, the bright point was always seen ; but this was not
 always the cafe with the dark ones.                  All  these round bodies
 or globules appeared at first, though very seldom, to have
 some life and motion, but afterwards they entirely lost all
 movement ; and this was the cafe in particular with the
 red, which seemed entirely lifeless.                I could also clearly ob
 serve, that the red matter,              which    deposited   itself in abun
 dance at the bottom            of   the vessel, was nothing else than an
 assemblage         of such round globules which           had lost all life and
 movement.             Besides     these round globules         with   a bright
 point in the middle,            I  saw   in  the pellicle on the water,        as
 well    as   in   the water itself, another kind        of living animals in
  greater numbers (3), which were shaped like small fish, and
  perfectly similar to the Cercarits virides of              Miiller *, which
  produce the green covering on stagnant water; but with this
  difference, that they were no larger than they are represent
  ed in the figure, and that they had not a green but a dark
  appearance.          I   observed     also,   though with difficulty,      that
  the tail was forked          ; and    that some of them, close to the
  tail, had a bright point or reflection, while the body before
  was not brighter than that                of  the Cercaria    viridis.   These
  small animals moved with great alertness and vivacity                    in the

drops of water;           but they collected       themselves        sometimes
together (5 and 6),          and tumbled several          times    round in a
circle (4).      I observed also, that, when they began to lose
life and animation, their longish figure was changed, and
they assumed that of a triangle or funnel, with a tail or
tube (5).      Miiller     observed      the same thing in the Cercaria
viridis *, and        at last they acquired the form            of   a globule,
which is represented            also   in Miiller  f.      I have     no doubt
 that these globules were            the fame round animals,              though
 dead,   of which       I have already spoken        ;   especially as    Miiller
 fays of his Cercaria virides, that they can assume a globular
 form.     Of the bright points in the middle he fays nothing;
 and it appears singular to me that he did not observe them,
 as he viewed them much more magnified than I did.                             He
 fays as little   of    the red colour which           they can assume and
 communicate to the surface of the water, and nothing at all
  of the bright bodies or small specula inclosed in round rims,
  which    were perfectly like the small round globules                    with  a
  bright point in the middle, only that they were some hun
  dred times larger.           But I dare not affirm that they were of
  the fame kind,         and    only different in size.         It  is very pro
  bable that they consisted of the flime of the dead Cercaria,
  which formed bubbles by                  means   of the air        inclosed   in
  them ; for, that they were round like bubbles, appears from
  this circumstance, that they eluded every impression, and
  sometimes       divided themselves          into two or more smaller
  bubbles, and even by a stronger impression extended to a
  longish, oval, and irregular form like those marked (6), which
   shews that they consisted          of a tough slimy substance.         Among
   some small animate          of another kind,      seen sometimes         in the
   drops  of water, none          were more conspicuous than the              Bra-
   chionus urceolaris       \,   by its transparency, and          the three or
   four round balls, or ovaria, which it has at the hind part of

its body.            But what            distinguished         it    most was, that,             with
the bristles or hair at the fore part, it often put the water in
a fort of vortical motion,                        which        made          the small lifeless
globular animals move quickly round in a circle, as if they
had been alive (7).  Such was the nature of this substance
for a few days in               July, till it     increased more and more ; and
I found, when I filled a glass with                      it, a      covering on the surface,
of the       thickness         of   the finger, besides the matter deposited
at the bottom;                 but no living beings were                          now observed
in     it,   and      not many of the              dead globular                  animals: they
seemed all to be converted                      into the above red slimy matter,
the colour of which was perfectly similar to that of the
bright yellow ochre used for painting houses.
     What    I       have above said            will sufficiently            shew that the red
colour of water, which has                        so   often been         a   matter of terror
to the superstitious,                may arise from the innocent infusion
animals      ;     and that animalculæ,                  like those which               I      saw    in
fresh      or stagnant           water, may be found in salt water or the
sea,      will   be doubted               by   no one who knows that the latter
has its infusion animals also.                         We often             read    in books of
voyages,         that the           sea has sometimes                had the appearance               of
blood,       sometimes              of   snow    or milk;            and that       it    has even
sometimes            had       an appearance           as   if on fire.           All   these phe
nomena can be ascribed to nothing                            else    than the foreign mat
ters, and particularly small animals,                           which multiply             there      in
immense quantities, and are sometimes red, sometimes white,
and sometimes of                a   flame colour, like Miiller's Tricboda ig-
nila*, without including the                           Nereis        notliluca,         and several
others.          It   seems to me highly probable that,                            in regard          to
colour, they may be subject to different variations; as                                  is   the cafe
here, from black to red, and even from red to green;                                     as appears
from this circumstance, that the red skin or pellicle, after
standing         few days in the glass, was in some parts green.

the     so called      Gronjhe, which in spring is seen in the Nor
wegian sea»; especially as it rises or falls according to the
heat or cold.  The uncommon colour in water, which                                                         I
have      here    described,            is a remarkable phenomenon ; and,
during      the eleven           years       I   resided      in      the neighbourhood,                   I
never saw or heard               of   any change              of      the like kind in other
iisli-ponds.           I   therefore paid more attention to                            it,   and espe
cially as in former times such appearances                                          were considered
as portending wars and bloodshed                              :       but these superstitious
notions must               lose all credit when the above explanation                                      is
adopted,      and when the secrets                     of nature           are more accurately
explored.        In    regard to the cause                  of this phenomenon                I    must
confess that to me                                                    and that                easier to

                               it   is   inexplicable             ;                   is
fay what     it   is   not, than what                  it   is.       It   is   well known that
the quality of the atmosphere,                               some years,               can    produce
Worms       and        insects      in incredible numbers                       :    but what kind
of weather           is    necessary for the generation                         of   these infusion
animals,         and       whether       a   continual alternation of rain and
sun-stiine, which was the cafe in the summer above men
tioned, contributes to the phenomenon,                                       is      difficult    to be
determined       1
   P. S. The           red matter continued on the water during thd
whole month of August,                           and seemed still thicker                 ;      but the
red particles         were smaller,              and    seemed entirely destitute                          of
life.     The corrupted               and green             water below swarmed,                       on
the other hand, with the cercaria already mentioned                                          ;  which
sometimes         appeared       of      a   triangular           and sometimes               of cir

cular form,          as already         said.      Some green (lime was observed
also in the red matter; which however                                  did not proceed from
the latter       by   a    change       of   its colour from red to green,                            as

had opportunities, more than enough, of studying the nature
of this animal, far excelling the common fox in impudence,
cunning, and roguery. The narrative of the innumerable
tricks they played us, might easily vie with Albertus Julius's
history of the apes in the island of Saxenburg.                         They forced
themselves      into our habitations by night                 as   well     as   by day,
stealing all they could carry off, even things that were                              of no
use to them ;        as   knives, sticks, clothes, &c.               They        were so
inconceivably ingenious              as   to roll down our casks                 of   pro
visions    several poods        in weight,        and    then      steal     the      meat
out of them      ably, that at first we could not bring our
                  so
selves to ascribe the theft to them.    As we were stripping
an animal of its skin, it often happened that we could not
avoid stabbing two or three foxes, from their rapacity in tear
ing the flesli out of our hands. If we buried it ever so care
fully, and added stones to the weight of earth that was upon
it,   they not only found
                        out, but shoved away the stones,
                                    it
as men would have done, with their shoulders plying under
them, helping one another with all their might.                             If, think
ing   to secure     it,   we put any on the top          of   a    high post in the
air, they grubbed up the earth at the bottom,                               so   that the
post and      all came tumbling down,                   or one of them clam
bered up and threw down what was upon                         it   with incredible
artifice and dexterity.             They watched all our motions, and

accompanied us in whatever           we were about to do.                 If the
sea  threw up an animal        of  any kind,       they devoured it ere a
man    of us could   come up, to our great disadvantage               5   and   if
they could not consume it all at once, they trailed it away
in portions to the mountains,            where they buried it under
stones before our eyes       ;  running to and fro          as  long    as   any
thing remained to be conveyed away.                While this     was doing,
others stood on the guard, and watched                us.   If they   saw any
one coming at a distance,         the whole troop combined at once
and began digging all together          in    the sand,    till  they had so
fairly put a beaver or      a sea-bear      under the surface that not
a trace   of it was to be seen.        In the night-time,           when we
slept  in  the field, they came and pulled off our night-caps,
and stole our gloves from under our heads, with the beaver-
coverings, &c.        In  consequence        of which we always             slept
with clubs in our hands,          that,    if they    should    wake us, we
might drive them away, or knock them down.
    When      we made a halt to rest by the way, they gathered
around us and played a thousand tricks in our view ; and
when we fat still, they approached us so near that they
 gnawed     the thongs   of our    (hoes.       If we   lay down,     as   if in
 tending to sleep,     they    came   and      sinelled   our noses to try
 whether we were dead or alive           ;   if we   held our breath, they
 gave such a tug to the nose as         if they would bite it        off.     On
 our first arrival they bit off the noses, fingers, and toes of our
dead while we were preparing the grave ; and thronged                          in
 such manner about the infirm               and   sick,   that it was       with
 difficulty we could keep them off.               Every morning we saw
 these audacious animals patrolling               about among sea-lions
 and sea-bears lying on the strand,             smelling at such       as   were
 asleep to discover whether some           of them might not         be dead ;
 if  that happened to be the case, they proceeded                    to diffeel
 him immediately,        and    presently     after all were at work in
 dragging the parts away.          Because the sea-lions at night,             in
 their sleep, frequently overlay their young, they examine, as
 jf conscious of that    circumstance, every morning,               the wliole

herd of them one by one,                       and       immediately drag away tha
dead cubs from their dams.
   Seeing, now, that they would not suffer us to be at rest
night or day, we were in fact so exasperated at them that
we killed them young and old,                            and plagued            them by every
means we could devise.                         When             the party        awoke in the
morning, there always lay two or three at our feet, that had
been knocked on the head by some                                 of    us in the     night;    and
I  can safely affirm, that, during my stay on the island, I
flew above two hundred of them myself.       The third day
                I knocked down, within the space of
after my arrival,                                                                             three
hours, upwards of seventy of them with a club. They                                           were
so ravenous       that, with one hand,                      if   we held to them a piece
of   flesli,   they would come to                    it,   although we might have                a
stick or ax in the other to knock them on the head.
     When       these busy animals could not get hold                              of what they
wanted,        as the clothes            we put off,           &c.        one   of them would
void his excrement upon                        it,   and all the others which passed
would do the fame.                   From all circumstances                     it   was clear to
us, that they had had very little communication                                    with human
beings, and that the dread of man                                    is   not innate in    brutes^
but must be grounded on long experience.
      In October       and November they, like the other foxes, were
the most sleek and full of hair                      :   in January and February the
growth of        it   is   too thick   in April and May they begin to
                                          :
shed their coats           :   in June and July they had only wool on
them, and looked               as   if   they went         in    waistcoats.       In June they
drop their cubs, nine or ten in                            a    brood, in holes and cliffs
of    the rocks.       They         are   so   fond      of their young, that,             to scare
us away, they would bark and yelp                                    like dogs,      and thereby
betrayed their coverts.                   This       mode       of    preserving their young,
probably, has procured them the name of ice or rock foxes.
No      sooner do they perceive                       that their retreat           is   discovered,
    than, unless disturbed, they drag away the young in their
    mouths, and hide them in                    a    more secret place.                 On killing
    the young, the dam follows the slayer with grievous howl

snow, they bury themselves in the snow, and lie still as long
as it lasts. They swim across rivers with great agility; will
seize the sea-fowl by night                     on   the       cliffs when they have
settled to sleep ; but are themselves frequently victims to the
birds of prey.           These animals, which are now in such inex
pressible    numbers on the island, were most probably con
veyed        (since there is no other land animal in

west.       It   stands on the principal canal leading from the Nile
to the lake Mceris, and             is   surrounded            with cultivated      ground
producing that profusion                 of     roses     for which this place was
celebrated,        and which        were distilled into rose-water.                      The
mode of propagating them was                              by   continued layers;          the
young twigs thence                 arising being found to produce the
largest     and most fragrant flowers.                     The       rose-water    was ex
cellent, and sent to all quarters                    ;   but the cultivation        is   now
running gradually to decay

406           An Account of Mr. Brown's Travels
     After pairing three days at Feium Mr. Brown                                              proceeded
towards the lake,            of which he wished                              to make the circuit.
It       is the       Mœris of Strabo and Ptolemy                            ; and the testimony
of the        living in Egypt seems unquestionable. How
             latter
ever this may be, the lake now called Birket-el-kerun,   pro
bably  from  its  extremities bearing some   resemblance   to
horns, (hews no mark,                           as some suppose,of being the pro
duction of human art.                           The length, Mr. Brown says, may
probably be between thirty and forty miles                                        ;    the breadth, at
the widest part he could gain, was 5000 toises, as taken                                                with
a sextant         ;    that       is,    nearly six miles.                   The       utmost      possible
extent       of       the circuit must              of   course be thirty leagues.                       Se
veral fishermen,                  in miserable boats, are constantly employed
on the lake.                 The water             is    brackifli,          like most bodies              of
water under the fame circumstances.
     From Feium Mr. Brown                            travelled        south-east,            and at      Ha-i
wara saw two small pyramids of unburnt brick.                                                 Returning
to Bedis he               passed,       the day following,                   the pyramids           of Da-
ihur;        five      of which          appear successively,                 besides those           of Sa-
karra.        The third,                after those      of Hawara,               is   that of Medun,
which        has been very elegant.                       It   is    composed           of   large pieces
of the       usual soft free-stone,                  joined together with                    a    little ce
ment, and has been hewn off to                             a   straight surface.                  It   would
be extremely difficult to ascend to the top, which now very                                  is
broad; but      probable
                      it that
                           is there was another square com
pleting its summit, which has been removed. The fourth
is   the most southerly                   of the four pyramids of Dashur, where
there are two large                     and two small.         in the form of
                                                                     It      is                            a
cone terminating                    in an obtuse triangle, and                          is   now much
damaged.                  At Sakarra           a   great number exist,                  among which
ten are of            a   large size       *.
     *    Speaking of the pyramids of                Jize, well known             to all who have visited
Egypt, Mr. Brown says:                     "
                            An absurd opinion has recently been rated,
that the pyramids are hewn out of the rock cm which they stand but the                            ;
first ocular inspection would set aside this,                       the joinings of the stones being
every- wheic marked with cement.*'                        1   hii   is   a   fiat contradiction        of what
has been asserted            by   Bruce.
                                                                                                         On

                            through     Egypt and Syria.                         407
      On     the   1st  of March         1793    Mr. Brown left Kahira to
   proceed to Suez, which he reached after                   a  tedious    progress
   of  five days.       The town         is small, and       built of unburned
   brick.      It contains      twelve    mosques,     some    of which      are   of
   stone, but the most are mean buildings.                   The sea near the
   town is very shallow, yet there is a small yard for ship
  building.       The Arab        mode     of constructing     stiips is singular.
  They     have no art to bend           the   timbers    ;  none of them are
  crooked, except naturally so.                They are very slender ; and,
  where the upper and lower ribs join, do not pass over one
  another, but by the fide of each other.                   The     sea  here pro
  duces few fish.         Oysters,      indeed,    and    some others       of   the
  shell-kind, are      seen : the best fisli do        not come higher than
  Cossir.       Meat is     scarce ; bread       of  an inferior quality,       and
  sometimes       hardly eatable.          Butter and milk are brought in
  small quantities by the           Arabs. Water        is brought from three
 several places.         It  is always bought by the skin, at a con
 siderable price ; and           if  a war were to arise       with the Arabs,
 none could be found.
     On    the 8th     of March        1793    Mr. Brown        passed    the ford
 at Suez, and on the 14th arrived at                Tur.      On    the   18th   he
 left Tur, and on the aad, at half               past  three in    the morning,
 reached      the    Monastery        of Sinai.       The convent        is large,
with     a good    garden, to which          there is a subterranean           pas
 sage.      Within the walls           is a small     mosque for the conve
 nience of the Arabs.               The mountain now called Sinai is
high      and    abrupt   :   on the north side of it some snow was
 visible.     The whole       is a very remarkable rock          of   red granite,
interspersed with         spots to which        soil has been brought           by
human labour, or washed down by rain, and in which grow
almond-trees, figs, and vines.                Numerous rills         of excellent
water gush from various apertures in the precipice, and
wander among the little gardens.                  Sinai has two summits :
the highest,      it is believed, may be the Sinai             of Moses. The
weather being very clear,             Mr. Brown       observed from        Mount
Sinai the Eastern Gulph of the Red Sea, which appears very

small,    and more round and short than is laid down                 in the
latest maps.        Mr. Brown        returned     to Suez and      Kahira,
without meeting any thing remarkable on the road.
    Mr. Brown's views to the south of Egypt having been
 frustrated the preceding       year, he was reduced       to the alterr
native    of  abandoning any further projects in that quarter, or
 of waiting for      a more     seasonable     opportunity.     This    soon
 occurred. He        had formed a design        of penetrating    to  Abys
 sinia by the way       of Dar-Fur,       as he was taught to believe
 that he might hope there for the advantages                 of  a regular
 government, and, with proper management, might expect
 every favour from        the monarch.          At the moment of          his.
 return from Assuan to Afliut, the caravan               of Jelabs from
Dar-Fur,       called Cafflet-es-Souddn        *,   the Soudan caravan,
 arrived at El-wah.          It was then     reported,  that the     sale  of
 their merchandize and slaves,            of which they     had no great
 quantity, would be completed in about two months, and
 that then they would return home. Their stay, however,
 was protracted during the whole winter, and in the month
 of March 1793 they commenced their departure from Ka-
 hira for the Upper Egypt.                They   were slow in collecting
 such things     as were necessary,        and  Mr. Brown     made     use of
 the time      so   allowed to procure information from various
 quarters    respecting    the journey.
     On   the 2ist   of April     1793    he set out from Bulak,          and
  on the eighth day, the wind- having been often unfavour
  able, reached Afliut.          The   first care was to provide      camels
  for the    route;    but unfortunately they were at that time
  scarce.    He, however, at length obtained five at about 13I.
  each. A supply of food was also procured for the journey ;
  and the caravan        having assembled, after about fifty days,
  the expected moment of departure arrived. The party hav,
  |ng left Afliut on the 25th of May, encamped on the moun
  tain above it till the 28th.            On   the 31st   they arrived at
    • Soudan, in Arabic, corresponds to our Nigritia,

 for the country of the Blacks.
                                                                       Gcbd

                        through   Egypt and Syria.                        409
Gebel Rumlie,         a  high rocky mountain which they were to
descend.       It forms    the western fide   of  the ridge, which con-r
siitutes,   as  it were, the wall of Egypt, and the eastern boun
dary of the low desert in which            lie the Oases. It consists
of a   coarse tufa, and is of rugged and difficult descent. They
were employed         four hours and a half the following morning
in  passing    from   the foot of the mountain to Ain6 Dize, the
first place where water is found, and the northern extremity
pf   the great Oajis.        As    a hot wind blew here          during the
meridian hours, the thermometer stood at that time, under
the shade      of  the tent, at 116 degrees.          In marching from
Aine Dize         to Charje,     eight hours were       employed.        They
left Charje on the 7th of June, and on Monday the 10th.
arrived at Beiris.         On the 13th they proceeded to Mughefs,
the last village of the Oasis towards the southern desait ;
which they left on the 15th, and on the 20th reached Seb.
This    place is marked       by the production of       a quantity of na
 tive alum,      as the   name imports.        The   surface near       which
 the alum is found abounds with                 a  reddish   stone, and     in
many places is seen argillaceous earth.
    Having left Seb on the 21st, they arrived at Selime on
 the 23d.        On the 24th they rested, and, continuing their
 route next morning,          employed   five days more        in reaching
 Leghea.        While they remained          here,   they   felt  much in
 convenience from a suffocating          wind, which blew from the
 south,    and    raised she sand in clouds.         On the      2d   of July
 the caravan left Leghea, and on the 8th, after a                 severe  and
 fatiguing march, reached the          Bir-el-Malba, or          salt spring.
 The vicinity of this        spring is remarkable for the production
 of   natron, which appears         under various circumstances, and
 is of a quality different from that of Terane.                    It  is very
 white and solid, and, on immersion in water,                 becomes hot,
 and discharges a great        portion of    its air.     Small quantities
 of it are carried by the jelabs to Egypt, where it is sold at a
 high price, and is used principally for making snuff.                    The
  water found here is unpalatable and brackish.
                                                                         They

     41©            An Account os Mr.           Brown%s Travels
       They remained         at  Bir-el-Malha till      the 12th, and on the
     soth encamped       at a spot called Medwa.             On the        23d     they
    came to the first springs         within the limits of Fur, which are
    in this    place   called Wadi Mafruk. The white ant, tennis,
    was here exceedingly vexatious, building                its covered way to
    every thing     within     the   tent, and destroying all within                  its
    reach.      This, together with the rains, which were now in
    creasing,    and began, to pour in a torrent through the valley,
    obliged them to abandon their tents, and to take shelter in
    the next village     (Sweini), where Mr. Brown obtained an
   apartment in       the house    of Ali-el-Chatib, one of the princi
   pal merchants established           in the country.         There he spent
   eight or ten days,        and did not arrive at Cobbe, oae of the
   towns to which the jelabs chiefly resort, till the 7th of Au
   gust.    A Melek, or governor, on the part of the Sultan of
   Dar-Fur, generally         resides at Sweini;      and there all strangers,
   as  well as    merchants of the country, coming with the                     cara
   van, are obliged to wait         till  the pleasure   of   the;   monarch in
   disposing    of  them be known.
      As Mr. Brown           had come to the           country under          consi
  derable exceptions from the general rule               of merchants           trad'
  ing to this country, and, in the Arabic language, rather                          as
  Dtiif-es-Sultan,       the king's stranger,        in which light          he had
  been hitherto viewed by the natives, he expected                        to obtain
  immediate permission to continue his journey                      to the royal
  residence.       " I  observed," says he to the Melek                 of   Sweini
 and     other public officers,          "   that,  intending        to   visit the
 Sultan,      I   should   hardly have expected to be put back with
 frivolous excuses,       as  the non-payment          of duties which           you
 dare not explicitly demand             of   me,  and   tributes, under           the
 name of      presents, which have never yet been exacted of any
 stranger.       If any  duties be payable,        beyond      wbat have       been
 already discharged,         you are perfectly at liberty to detain all,
 or such part of the articles           I   bring with me,         as you may
judge sufficient to answer your claim,                but not to        refuse me
 permission      to go to the Sultan,        with whom       I  have business.
                                                                                Or,

                       through    Egypt and Syria.                        H\\
Or,    if  other reasons operate         to prevent my request          from
being complied with, and if any suspicions prevail relative
to my views in coming here, I desire, without further delay,
to be furnished with the means            of returning   to Egypt, before
I  suffer, as commonly happens            to strangers, from the effects
of   the climate, while     I am yet in the habit       of travelling, and
while the funds are yet unexhausted                which should support
me in my progress farther."
    The    misrepresentations      which had been made concerning
Mr. Brown,        and which had by this time reached the Sultan,
manacled the hands of the Melek, and prevented his remon
strance from having any effect.            Finding,   therefore,    no mode
of advancing till       the rest  of  the   caravan    should    obtain the
fame     permission,     he resolved     to follow the example         of the
other jelabs, and wait patiently the event.              At length,      after
the expiration of about ten days,             an order from the Sultan
arrived, directing that all the jelabs should               be allowed to
proceed      to  their houses on paying the duties               assessed   on
them.
      Before leaving Kahira,          Mr. Brown       had   been     apprised
that all commerce in Dar-Fur was conducted by means                         of
simple exchange.          To carry on this, in         such a way as not
to be grossly defrauded,         he was induced to seek for a person
who might go through this business for him, at least with
some      share   of probity.      The    person recommended to           him
for that purpose had been a slave-broker in the market of
Kahira     ;  and   though    Mr. Brown        expected   from him that
submission      and obedience      for which the lower       classes   of the
 Kahirines are, externally at least, remarkable, he was disap
pointed in his expectations. The letters with which he was
provided      for different merchants in this district, under whose
roof he might have had           a safe  lodging, could be of no use
till  he had seen the Sultan        ; for, till then, no person knew in
what character to receive him.               The object of this man,
therefore, was to prevent his introduction to the Sultan, and
to preclude       him from any opportunity of representing                 his
                                                                         cafe.

41   1           An Account of Mr. Brown's Travels
case.     They were no sooner arrived at Sweini than he found
means to employ one           of his  associates,   who bad been some
years established in the place, to go to the monarch and in
fuse into his mipd suspicions         of him   as a  Frank and an        In
fidel, who came to the country for no good purpose,                     and
whose designs it behoved         him   to guard against.       The villain
himself was in the mean            time not idle.      As   the   house in,
which     Mr. Brown       lodged had no doors, he took advantage
of this circumstance,        and his momentary absence, to secrete
from    a  box, which he had broken on the road,                a  quantity
of   red coral.       By  the help   of this commodity, Mr. Brown,
had expected to make          his way to the Great. At the end of
a   few days,     this agent returned, bearing a specious             letter
impressed with the Sultan's seal, ordering that no officer on
the road should presume to detain him, or take any thing
from him, till he came to the house of Ibrabim-d-Wobaijli
 (the name      of this  very agent)    in Cobbe,     where he was lo
rest himself till further orders.         In this situation,     seeing no
means      of immediate relief, Mr. Brown          began to feel impa
tience, which,       as he  continued in a    state  of inactivity, com
 municated the more rapidly its           pernicious influence to his
health.      On    the fourteenth    day he was attacked by a fever,
attended with extreme pain in the head. How long it lasted
he could not tell, having lost his recollection on the second,
day.    It  was afterwards     recalled by the effect     of  a dysentery*
which     lasted for two days,       and left  him too. weak to        assist;
himself.
    A  little more than a month elapsed, when, the symptom*
appearing      to diminish,    he again pressed to be permitted to
visit the residence     of  the Sultaji.     But he had reason to re
gret his impatience ; for, having at length obtained leave^
he proceeded         to  El  Fastier  only to repeat his        susserin<rs.
When he arrived at El Fasher, he was first introduced to
 the Melek Misellim, one of the principal ministers.                     He
received him with a rude stare, as an object he was unused
 to, which was followed by a smile          of contempt      and aversion.
                                                                         He

                            through       'Egypt and Syria.                               4ijJ
He was        seated, with           some     more      of    the royal attendants*
under a kind of awning                    of cotton cloth, on            a   mat spread
upon the sand.              After the common              salutations,         the    Melek
and his company entered into conversation                            on the natureof
his visit to the country              ;   while each made             remarks on hli
person, and offered conjectures as to his character and                                       in
tentions.        At length           a wooden bowl             of   polenta,     and          an-t
other of dried meat, were                     set before      them.      Mr. Brown's
illness deprived him of all inclination to eat, and, observing
the company not much inclined to invite him to join themj
and yet embarrassed                  to avoid      that ceremony, he relieved
them by declining             it,    and desiring       them to., begin.              When
they were satiated,           a   great number           of   foolish questions were
asked him         about Europe            ;   some     of which        he waved,              and
satisfied them         as    to others        in the best manner he could.
When         he observed that they grew tired                   of asking       questions,
he seized the       opportunity of explaining why                      he came there,
and what          favour he expected                   would    be shewn             to him.
"   Melek,"        said     Mr. Brown,             "    having come            from a far
distant country to Misr (Kahira),                        I     was    there     made           ac
quainted with the magnificence, the extended empire, and,
above        all, the justice and hospitality of the king Abd-el-
rachman.           Having        been used to wander over various coun

was told that my person and property would be secure    but                               :
since my arrival within the confines,                     I     have     found all these
assurances fallacious            ;    my inclinations          have been         thwarted,
my person treated with indignity,                         and       my property           plun
dered.       I   ask   redress —     I    desire the punisliment               of    the man

 from going there last year                   by

protection,         and three or four persons,             deserving confidence,
to attend me to the frontiers of Kordofan.                             I   have a small
present to offer         him,    consisting    of   such things as my circum
stances permitted me to bring.                  I   hope he may not refuse to
receive      it,   and to grant me the favour        I    aflc." — He answered                  :
" Merchant,          you are welcome to the           Dar.       The king             is   kind
to strangers, and he will favour you in all you wisti.                                What
ever you want, you have only to demand.                           He        has ordered
a   sack    of wheat      and four sheep to be sent you.                   At this time
it   is   not possible to       pass   through Kordofan         :   the Sultan has
a   great army there        j    and when the country shall be in sub
jection to -him, you may                pass   unmolested.          When             you are
admitted to his presence, you will tell him who has robbed
you, and what you have lost                    5    and   he    will       cause     it    to be
restored."          It   was now the hour           of prayer, and, when                       the
company commenced                  their ablutions,       Mr. Brown              retired.

 XVII.        On the Disappearance             os   Swallows        in     Autumn          ;    in
     a Letter from          Mr. Peter Cole                 to   Dr.        Mitchill,
     dated    New-York,          September 25, 1798 *.
I    N    consequence       of   the epidemic now raging               in   this devoted
city,        have not had an opportunity to give you                             a   detail     of
what
      I I    intimated to you some time ago relative to the dis
appearance          of swallows.
     In    my early years,         a   number of my school-companions
and myself           used   to make       it   a practice to hunt what we
termed Ground-Swallows                   {birundo riparia),            in   a        bank in
the neighbourhood  of this city, contiguous to where the
Jews burial-ground then was.      In one of these boyish
amusements          I    recollect two gentlemen            passed         nearly       by     us,
                     •
                         From the American Medical Refojilorj.
                                                                                           who

               disappearance      of Swallows in Auturtin.                    4.1     J
Who stopped and examined the birds we had dug out of the
hill; whereupon a conversation took place relative to the
migration of the swallows. The gentlemen both agreed that
they were preparing for their winter quarters ; and one of
them farther added,          that he supposed that numbers of them
kept in    a   meadow close by.        These observations          made such
strong impressions on my mind, that they have never since
been erased.
  After our revolutionary war was                   over,   and    my return
again into this city in 1783, in order              to be convinced         of   the
truth on this curious and controverted                 subject,    I   made      it   a
practice to walk around the Collect *, mornings and even
ings, in the seasons when they assembled, in order to mark
their flight or return again ; but could not discern any thing
material until the 3d instant. As I was standing at my door
between the hours of five and fix in the morning, I observed
a very large flock       of swallows flying in        an easterly direction.
I   immediately repaired to the pond, where there was already
a vast number collected in the reeds and rushes.                       They   con^
tinued coming for nearly the space of half an hour, and                          vast;
numbers of them were flying over the water in almost every
direction.       Some of these birds appeared to run on the sur
face of the water with          great rapidity towards the east corner
of the pond, and, in            the   twinkling of      an eye, disappeared
under the water and          rose no   more.
  They seemed to crowd principally towards that particular"
spot. But what is somewhat remarkable, and deserves par
ticular notice,       is,   that among them        I    observed       a   number
of white       ones intermixed    with    the rest.     While    I     was stand
ing on     the edge   of    the pond   with my      spy-glass,    Mr. Brooks)
a   particular acquaintance of mine, who lives near the place,
came towards me.      mentioned my errand to him.
                            I                       He
stood  with me considerable time, and saw the same*
                     a                                                           I
observed to him that there were white ones among therm
    * A   pond of fresh water adjoining   a   marsh in the vicinity of the city of
New-York.

   He replied, that    they were seen three or four days ago.                  His"
  Word    may be relied on as a man            of strict honour         arid   in
  tegrity.
     Thus, Sir, I have given you a stiort (ketch of what has"
  come, within my own knowledge, and what I earnestly
 wished to discover.        I hope    I   shall    not intrude upon your
  patience   if I subjoin   an extract from the Christian's,                Scho
  lar's, and Farmer's Magazine *.              It runs thus     :
     "   February 23, 1790.         In Ulster county, in the state of
 New- York, on an island in the Never-Sink-Creek, nearly
 in   the latitude   of 410 30' north, a       Mr. Baker, in the begin
 ning of the month of March last, having cut down                         a  large
 hollow beech-tree, to his surprise found the cavity in the
 tree nearly filled     with the common barn-swallows                  {birundo
 rustica)   of this country, in quantity (by his estimation) nearly
 two barrels    :  they were in    a torpid     state ;  but carrying some
 of   those  which were not injured by the fall of the tree near
 a fire,   they were presently re-animated by the warmth, and
 took the wing with their usual agility." —This may be de
pended on as a fact.
     I  take the liberty also to mention            another relation from
 the American         Museum    f.     It   is   taken    from     Mr. Josiah
Blakeley's letter to      Mr. Carey,      dated Baltimore,         January 7,
 1788.      As  the piece is  of   considerable      length,     I  sliall   only
quote a few passages       from it.     He     begins thus    :
     "  The  history   of our common swallows            has long been           a
problem in ornithology.           Whilst     people in general supposed
them birds of passage,         a sew,     who appear to be better in
formed, supported the contrary.              The opinion of the            many-
was     founded on what they thought probable ; that of the
few on facts.        In the year 1780 I was conversing with a
person,     who lived about twenty miles from Boston, on the
phenomenon of the sudden exit but gradual and irregular
return of swallows. The gentleman to whom                       I  made these

                                                                             417
remarks, replied, that they were not birds of passage; and
the cause of their sudden disappearance, but irregular return,
was, they had        a fixed day    for immerging       in the water, but
none for emerging from it. On my doubting his hypothesis,
he told me, that as a neighbour of his, not long before, waa
draining    a  pond, on a warm day, near the             season   of  the year
in which    the swallows first appear, his attention was attracted
by observing the mud, which, in consequence of draining
the pond, had for some time be'en exposed to the sun, move
and appear animated ; he then ordered                  a quantity       of this
mud to be conveyed           into   a room in his house,           which he
caused to be gradually warmed by a flow                   sire.    From this
mud there soon arose a number of swallows, hovering over
himself and family, who had been spectators of their resur
rection.
   These few observations,           however imperfect, may poflibly
afford a large field for speculation         to the philosophic          mind,
and lead to useful discoveries.           For my own part, I am now
become     a proselyte     to the  doctrine of the swallow's remain
 ing in a torpid     state   during the winter,        not only from        spe
culative researches, but from ocular demonstration *.

  pours.
       Rain. — If we      consider the days when          it rained little ot a
  great deal,      we ought to fay that the month was extremely
  rainy, for it rained twenty-two days : but the rain- in ge
  neral was not abundant, as there fell two inches less of
  water than usual.          This  observation     is applicable only to thte
  level   country; for in the mountains            the rain was        excessive,
  and    occasioned a very great swell in         the rivers and torrents.
       But   there   occurred two particular phenomena to be ob
  served, via. the fog and thunder.             On     the morning         of  thte
  18th, after a storm, which             had been preceded            by several
  others, the fun appeared extremely pale through                   a  light fog,
  which filled       the whole      atmosphere.        This fog    became till!
  more condensed         the following days       ; and was      not dissipated
  by the winds, nor even by the storm of the 26th in the morn
  ing, accompanied by            a great deal     of thunder, which was
  heard all along the direction of the mountains from one                       sea
  to the other.        This fog   still existed  in the beginning of July,
  and seemed to become thicker,                at least at certain hours.
  It    did not prevent       the   fun or stars of the first magnitude
   from being seen, except in the lower part of the horizon.
   People could look at the sun without being incommoded,
   and without using coloured or smoked glass.                  It appeared of
   different   colours, according to the kind            of   rays   which the
     tfference  in  the density    of the fog    suffered to pass.         As the
,                                                                          yellow

yellow and red, heing the strongest, were those which pierced
it oftenest, the sun appeared like a ball on fire, or of a blood
colour; which        gave     occasion     to many      whimsical      people,
whose     imaginations       were   heated,      to fee there, as       in the
clouds, the figures of men and animals.                     Very often the
fun, in the higher part of the atmosphere, seemed pale and
white by the absence of several coloured raysj                  and he ap
peared red when he was lower,                because his rays then pasted
•through a greater portion        of   the atmosphere.
    That it may not be imagined that this phenomenon ^
new in the world, I stiall here give a short account of thole
observed formerly, analogous to it. But it will first be proper
to fay a few words respecting           the cause of this extraordinary
fog, which     I  am    inclined to think came            from Sicily and
Calabria, where there were violent earthquakes.                   We know,
by the accounts given, that the heavens                 in those countries
appeared cloudy after the great shocks,               which may be rea
dily believed when we consider the immense exhalations that
must    have  been dispersed        throughout the atmosphere.              In
the month     of June     the south-east       winds prevailed       through
out all our country.         These winds at Venice are called Fo~
riant,   because they first take place on this fide           of  the gulph.
ft  is very probable that these winds,             traversing   that part   of
the atmosphere,       may have carried with them            a large mass    of
exhalations, which, being          stopped by the chain         of  the  Alps,
dispersed themselves        in Lombardy,          and  occupied even the
Alps, which       people,     with astonisliment, beheld red, or of
 different colours, according to the position of the fun and of
the observer.       It does not appear that these exhalations arose
from our territory, which was not               seen to smoke,      as is ge
nerally the cafe in the       time of    a  fog; but it proceeded down
wards, as   if it  had fallen from the atmosphere.               It   was not
seen to touch the earth, except when, by an optical illusion,
the nebulous stratum,          by being lengthened, appeared united
with   the sensible horizon.       It  occasioned no hurt, therefore,        to
the fruits  of the earth ; it is      said only that   it blasted the olives
                                    E   e  %                               and

and vines a little on the elevated grounds.                If   any CufferwJ
in  the flat country,      the    cause may be ascribed to the rains
which     took place at the time when they were             in bloom.
    If this fog arose, as      I  have said, from exhalations disen
gaged at the time       of  earthquakes,     it must have been dry, and
must have contained abundance of earthy, fiery,"mineral par
ticles, with a great deal of inflammable air and electric fire.
To    these may be ascribed the frequent            thunder which took
place, especially      towards the middle of the month.                  The
thunder in general made dreadful ravage, burning houses
 and destroying men and animals.                 Letters from Hungary
state, that, after several (hocks         of  an earthquake,      the city  of
 Krcmnitz was      set  on sire by lightning.         The   same fate was
 apprehended for Vicenza on the morning of the 26th, the
 repeated claps of thunder being so violent. Five or fix houses
 were that day struck            by the lightning,      which occasioned
 considerable     damage.         The lightning     fell also in about a
 dozen of places       in the neighbourhood,            particularly in the,
 mountains.
    I  shall here subjoin a sort      of chronicle of    the periods when
 the fun was seen obscured by fogs            ; and  I am    persuaded that
 many other instances          might be found in different authors.
 This notice will serve to banish every thing marvellous in
 regard to the fog      of  1783 ; and     to (hew that nothing hap

 XIX.       Observations       on Pumice Stone,             and    the   Places    u>ber,e
                found.        By Profeffor BecKMANN *.
 A UMICE             stone, pumex,         pierre-ponce,        pomice, is a porous,
light, friable, rough kind of stone, which floats in water j
neither strikes          fire  with      steel, nor effervesces          with     acids ;
contains little or no iron,               but sometimes           more, sometimes
less magnesia ; and,             in  a strong heat,        becomes fused to glass
without       the addition         of any other          substance.       On account
 of its singular properties,             an idea was         entertained, even in
the most ancient periods, that it must have originated in a
different manner from other stones.                          As it     was found        in
many parts floating on the                sea,   the ancients considered             it to
be a    kind of      hardened       sea-scum      ;   as   from the fame super
ficial grounds' the bones                 of the cuttle-fish, employed for
many purposes like pumice stone, are called sea-scum                                also.
More       attentive    observers,      however, perceived that it was in
debted      for its formation to the force of fire j especially                     as   it
was found, for the most part, near volcanoes,                           and was       ac
tually thrown up by them.
     It  is now known          with certainty, that            real pumice stone is
a volcanic .production, both that thrown up by the                             sea,   and
that found even in Germany,                    where there are no burning
mountains.            The    latter    kind is      a   proof that in these dis
tricts there        must     formerly have been volcanoes                   ;  and the
former,       of volcanoes         so  near the        sea   that their eruptions
 could reach it.            No place, however, abounds more with
 this kind of stone than the Lipari islands, particularly Lipari
and Vulcano,           from which, since the earliest periods t» *M
 Europe has been supplied with this stone, and chiefly by tha

more than what has been told us in the fables                        of the  poets,
 had they not been visited,                in the year 1781, by Dolomieu,
                                                                            •
 who published a mineralogical                    description of them          ; for
  all other travellers who have given accounts of Sicily fay
 nothing of them, partly                 because they followed the common
  routine,        and wished        to see only such objects as had been
 seen     by others— and          partly because these islands lie in a tem
  pestuous sea,        where      to  the danger of shipwreck is added that
  of being taken by the Barbary cruisers, who hover about in
  that neighbourhood during the whole summer. Travellers,
  however, who wish to see more than antiquities, and who
  are desirous to examine and describe                   more than things al
  ready known, may here expect a rich harvest, if they are
  accustomed to make observations in regard to natural his
  tory : for objects worthy of their notice cannot be want
  ing in        islands    where volcanoes          of  every kind exist,     some
  continually burning,               and   some   which, like Ætna and Ve
  suvius, are sometimes              at rest, and     sometimes in a state of
  violent       eruption      ;  where there      are   others   totally extinct ;

   Sicily, from the coast             of which     the nearest is distant about
   thirty Italian miles.             Dolomieu makes the number of them

small town of the same name.                  According      to Dolomieu,         it
is the inexhaustible magazine from which                      all Europe ob
tains pumice stone;             and    it has whole       mountains of that
substance,       in which large hules have been cut without any
perceptible decrease being observed.                   Next to Lipari, and
nearest      to Cape       Melazzo in Sicily, lies Vulcano, nearly
 twelve Italian miles in circumference, and separated from
 the former by       a    channel only one Italian mile in breadth.
 Its   sire is never    extinguished      ;  and it contains an inexhaust
 ible store of pumice stone, which has                 a perfect   resemblance
 to that    of Lipari.        Some of it is collected for foreign trade ;
 but this uninhabited island is visited,               at present,    merely on
 account of its wood, which grows on the south side of aa
 ancient crater.
      The pumice      stone,      however, of      these  islands, is very      dif
  ferent in regard to solidity, hardness,                and weight ; and          it
  may be distinguished into four kinds, one of which only is
  employed in foreign commerce. The first is grey ; has a
  close grain,      imperceptible interstices           and   fibres;      a consi
  derable weight         ;  great    compactness     ;   and   somewhat        of   a
  vitreous fracture.           This   stone, which      can be easily cut, is
  employed      as  corner-stones for buildings, and for all kinds of
  walls in general.            The town of Lipari           is almost       entirely
  built of it. — The        second kind is also grey; but lighter, more
  porous, and has more               perceptible fibres than the former,
  and does not float in water.              It  is used for arches ; and on
  that account great quantities of it are carried                 to   Sicily and
   Naples. — The third          is light,   porous, and full       of    fibres ;   it
   floats in water     ;   has a silky appearance        on the fracture; and
   is compact and of          a  hard grain, which         renders     it   exceed
   ingly proper for polishing marble and metals.                     This is the
   only kind employed in foreign trade.                —  The fourth kind is
   exceedingly white ; of a very tender texture,                 and    less  com
   pact than the others.            It  seems to have reached         the utmost
   degree    of extension,      to which      any substance can attain, for
   its parts to retain a connexion.              This kind    is fit for no pur

lishing almost every kind of substance                                           ;     and     it   is   exceedingly
proper for the purpose,                              as    it   is    soft enough to be rubbed to
a     fine powder              ;    and yet its finest particles                              remain fo rough
that they can attack and wear down the surface of bodies
without making scratches.  The powder of vitreous stones
would also rub off particles by friction, but, ok account                                                                 of
its      acute «dges, would leave scratches                                       ;     and      to pound           it     i»
fine as to prevent this inconvenience, would require much
more trouble and time than the pumice stone                                                           ;    and even
then, this fine powder of vitreous stones would suffer itself
to    pass over the bodies to be polished almost like argillaceous
earth, without                      making any                    impression              upon them.                 The
workmen, who employ pumice stone for this purpose,                                                              use       it
either pounded, sifted and washed, or in whole pieces,                                                          as the
hatmakers, curriers,                           and some workers                         in metal.            The         last
must choose such pieces                               as have          fine pores,              and are        so   large
that they can assume the form proper for rubbing or scower-
ing. On this account preference                                             is   given, in commerce, to
that kind of pumice stone which                                              does not               consist     of       too
smaU pieces.                    In general,                it   must be light,                   rough, friable,
of    a      grey colour, and free from sand or any other foreign

But             may be seen,        by    Dolomicu's            account, that           it   never can be an article

duced from the black                     by   its being bleached             in       the open air. But this         is   not

be 'pounded        remarkably fine       ;   and even then it will attack
the teeth too strongly.
     In countries where pumice stone can be procured at a
cheaper rate than among us, it is pounded and mixed with
the mortar used in building.                 This     is done    in Italy *    ; and
the cafe must have been the fame in former times, as pieces
of it    are frequently to be observed              in the mortar of ancient
walls.      It  has this binding property in common with terras,
pozzolana, and other volcanic productions.                         From this cir
cumstance         we might        be   induced         to  conjecture, that the
ancients       mixed      fine    terra    Jigillaris with pumice               stone
coarsely pounded, and formed                 it into moulded         masses,  which
 they dried      in   the    fun, in order to make those bricks for
 building, which,         as   Strabo, Pliny, Antigonus Carystius,                Yi-
 truvius, and others          f, tell us, with        some degree        of wonder,
 swam     in the water ;        and that, on account            of their lightness,
 they were peculiarly well adapted for many useful purposes.
 They expressly fay, that the ancients used, in making them,
 the mineral employed for cleaning silver-plate, which we may
 consider to have been pumice stone; though many other kinds
 of earths     are fit for the fame purpose.                This conjecture has
  given rife, in modern times, to experiments which have not
  yet been attended with complete success. It will be diffi
  cult, indeed, to obtain bricks             so   light by mixing clay with
  finely pounded pumice stone,               as  it will then form a body too
  compact and heavy.             From     a passage       in the Travels of Peter
  Delia Valle "J one might be induced to conjecture, that the
  art of making swimming bricks was known at Ormus, an
   island in the Persian Gulph, unless he meant perhaps to fay

  Sicily; but in Sicily              the heavy kind           of pumice     stone, which
  does not swim, is employed                    for that purpose.         It is worthy    of
   remark, that among the so-called Etruscan and other earthen
  ware,      as   well    as   among those which were formerly brought
  from Japan and China ostener than at present, there were
  vessels    much lighter and thinner than any that can be ma
  nufactured in Europe.                   It  is not improbable that Fabbront
  may have been              so  fortunate      as to discover       this preparation :
  at any rate, he not long ago laid before the Economical
  Society of Florence, for examination, a kind of brick, the
  specific gravity          of which was not               greater    than that of the
  lightest wood *.
      Most authors, who give an account of pumice-stone, speak
 of it    as   if it  were      to be found           in   the neighbourhood         of all.
 burning mountains.                   This, however, is false ; for it is not
 found among the                productions of all volcanoes, but only near
 those, as the mineralogists assert, the fire                      of which    has arisen
 in    such strata as have intermixed with                        them   a great deal     of
 feld spar.          It   is found nowhere in greater abundance than
 in   the    Liparine islands, as already                  said, though large quan
 tities of it are found in Iceland ;                        whereas it is very seldom
 seen near Vesuvius,                  and     never      in the neighbourhood             of
 Ætna.           The ancients, however,                   speak   of Ætnean pumice-
     • After      I  had written      this   article,   I   found in Gren's New     fbjfical
"Journal,     Vol.   II.   part 2. p. 129, a paper translated from           the Italian  of
Fabbroni,       by which it appears that he made his brick of a              kind of earth
dug up near Santa Fiora, in the territories of Sienna, which neither effer
vesces   with acids nor is fusible in the fire,           and  which, according   to his el
imination,       consists    of siliceous earth, magnesian earth, and aluminous,
earth,    in  the   proportions of 0-55, C15, and o-n. This earth, therefore,
seems to consist      of   the fame component parts, and           almost in the fame pro
portions as the so-called sea-froth.              According     to the prevailing   mode of
changing old names            and making new ones, Fabbroni calls the above earth
Farina foffllis, under which          is understood, at present, an earth arising from
effloresced    gypsum.

of the pumice-stone of Ætna, which                     he describes        as black

fumex of Juvenal          f,    though this phrase will admit of an
other explanation         ;   and perhaps       the poet meant only to in
dulge in a little occasional            raillery against the celebrated vo
luptuaries of Catina or Catana. I well know that we cannot
*xpect from poets, in general, the accuracy which must be
 observed by naturalists ; but those who consider the passage
 as admitting       of no doubt, may             support it by the testimony

 Lipari, in the neighbourhood of Ætna, during the eruption
 of 1787 ; but he adds, that nothing of the kind had ever
 been found near         Ætna before.

 haled from fix to eight quarts vital air.              The   muscle,    now
 receiving oxygenated         blood, afterwards caught the electric
 spark very      readily,     and a      genial    warmth     was    diffused
 throughout the paralytic hand. This was not a solitary ob
 servation, but constant ; and it seems to me very forcibly to
 prove the animating         principle derived      from the oxygen         of
the   ah* to the muscular fibre ;        a  principle not, as represented
 by Mayow, the most subtle, spiritual, and ætherial, but one
 that can be made obvious to our senses in the form of air,
 adhering to the calces of metals, and capable now of being
 conceived even by the most gross understandings.
     The patient, I am happy to add, by this combination of* ex
ternal and internal stimulants, was completely restored,                  and
has continued many months perfectly well.
     As the case is short, I will fay a few w ords on the combi
 nation of remedies. The Faculty, and other*, are always cry
 ing out for   the trials   of the airs   alone, and forget that in their
 own practice they employ a variety of means.                    Thus,      al
 though exercise      is recommended, is the stomach               neglected
 to be braced and stimulated         ?
     The following     case  from   John Hunter*         is very illustrative
of this   position :
     "A    lady,  of what    is called a nervous      constitution, arising
 in  some degree from an irritable stomach, often troubled with
 flatulencies, and what are called nervous head-achs, with
 pale urine at those times, uncomfortable feelings and often
  sinkings, had a tumor removed from the breast, and likewise
 near the arm-pit       :  nothing appeared uncommon              for a sew
                    * Vide Hunter     on tie Mod, p. 411.
                                                                       day'*

               Intelligence, and Miscellaneous Articles.                4ft
days-, when very considerable             disorders   came on.     She  was-
attacked     with     a  shivering, or cold sit, attended with the feel
of dying,       and followed with cold sweats.           It being supposed
she was dying, brandy was thrown                  in, which   soon brought
on a warmth,           and she was relieved.         The fits came on fre
quently for several days, which were also relieved by brandy;
and she took, in one of the most violent, half a pint of bran
dy.    While under           these affections, she had the bark as a
ftrengthener        ; the musk occasionally, as a sedative,       in pretty
large quantities;          camphorated    jalap frequently, as an     anti-
spasmodic ; and, towards the last,               she took the valerian rtl
large quantities         : but whatever effects these might have in
lessening      the disease, on the whole ibey were certainly not
equal   to   it without     the brandy."
    John Hunter judiciously             adds   :
                                                   "A   question  naSuTally
occurs   :   Would       the brandy alone,    if it had been continued as
 a medicine, have cured her without the aid               of the other me
 dicines   ?     The other medicines,        I think, certainly could not
 have done it ; nor do          I believe   that the brandy could have
 been continued in such quantity               as to have prevented    their
 returns   :    if so, then the two     modes    were happily united, the
 one gradually to prevent,           the other to remove       immediately
 the fits when they came on."

  cular letter :

fidered the antiquity, changes, and the present state              of their
own country as primary objects of their research ; and, with
a view to facilitate such discoveries, a permanent committee
has been established, among whose duties the following have
teen recommended            as  requiring particular attention   :
   "   i .  To procure     one or more entire skeletons     of the  Mam
moth,      so called, and of such other unknown animals as either
have been, or hereafter may be discovered in America.
    " 2.    To obtain    accurate plans, drawings, and descriptions
of whatever is interesting (where              the originals cannot be
had) ; and especially of ancient fortifications, tumuli, and
other Indian works of art : ascertaining the materials com
posing them, their contents, the purposes               for which they
were probably designed,           &c.
    " 3. To invite researches into the natural history of the
earth, the changes it has undergone as to mountains, lakes,
rivers, prairies, &c.
    " 4.     To inquire into the customs, manners, languages,
and character of the Indian nations ancient and modern,
and their migrations.
   "  The importance of these objects will be acknowledged
by every lover of science, and, we trust, sufficiently apologise
for thus troubling you; for without the aid of gentlemen
who have taste and opportunity for such researches, our
means would be very confined.                 We   therefore solicit yoor
communications, now or in future, on these subjects ; which
will  be at all times thankfully         received,  and duly noticed in
the publications of the Society.
    "  As     to the first object, the committee suggest, to gentle
men who may be in the way of inquiries of that kind, that
the Great Bone         Lick on the Ohio,       and other places     where
there may be mineral salt, are the most eligible spots for the
purpose, because animals are known to resort to such place*.

sirous that cuts      in various directions may      be made into many

     With     pleasure  we   announce to naturalists         Mr. Baker's
collection of American         insects.     In his   museum      at   New-
York may        be seen about three     thousand    species,   principally
arranged according to the Linnæan system. They were col
lected chiefly by Mr. Jotham Fenton, who has been nearly
fix years engaged in entomological pursuits.               The species of
this collection were mostly caught in the neighbourhood ot
 the cities    of New-York       and New-Haven.
                               FIRE-BALL.
     A very    remarkable phenomenon of this kind was                seen  in
 the county      of Kent,  and the neighbourhood,        on Sunday the
 22d September, at about 35 minutes past eight in the even
 ing.    It came from the south-west, anil pasted         in  a south-east
 direction till it sunk in the horizon.          It seemed to he nearly
  of the   size of the moon, but of     an oval form, or rather in the
  form of an ox's bladder, the thickest             end coins: foremost.
  The sky, which was dark and stormy, was illuminated during
  its passage more brightly than by the full moon.               Its colour
  ¦was  a vivid white,   inclining   a little to yellow  ;  and it seemed
  as   if followed by     a  few smaller     globules, or rather large
  sparks    of  a   red colour,    which   kept   at the fame       distance
   from its body during         the whole     time thas it was visible,
   which    was for several seconds.
                              ASTRONOMY.
      A   comet is now visible in our hemisphere.               It was first
   seen  on the 6th inst, near the lower side of the quadrangle
   of Ursa Major, from which it has been moving about 30 in
   24 hours, following the direction of the tail, and through
   one shoulder of Bootes,
