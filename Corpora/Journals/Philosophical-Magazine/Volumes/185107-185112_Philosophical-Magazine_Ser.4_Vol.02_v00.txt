2                   M. R. Clausius                  on the Moving Force                    of Heat,
from a warm body to a cold one; for example, the vapour which
is generated in the boiler of a steam-engine, and passes thence
to the condenser where it is precipitated, carries heat from the
fireplace to the condenser.          This transmission Carnot regards as
the    change   of heat    corresponding     to the work produced.             He
says expressly, that no heat is lost in the process, that the quan
tity remains unchanged; and he adds, “This is a fact which
has never been disputed; it is first assumed without investigation,
and then confirmed by various calorimetric experiments.                        To
deny         it,
            would           reject the entire theory
                                  be    to                   heat,      which          of                 of                it
forms the principal foundation.”
I      am not, however, sure that the assertion, that                   the pro                           in

blished        experiment.        Perhaps  the  contrary    might       asserted                          be
with greater justice; that although                                      no
                                                   such loss may have been
directly proved, still other facts render              exceedingly probable   it

   This equation may be regarded as the analytical expression
of the above maxim applicable to the case of permanent gases.
It shows that Q cannot be a function of v and t as long as the
two latter are independent of each other.     For otherwise, ac
cording to the known principle of the differential calculus, that
when a function of two variables is differentiated according to
both, the order in which this takes place is matter of indiffer
ence, the right side of the equation must be equal 0.
   The equation can be brought under the form of a complete
differential,        thus:
                                 dq=du-A.Rºd,                                    .     .    .   .    (IIa)

           U                                         This differ
ential equation is of course unintegrable until we find a second
condition between the variables, by means of which t may be
expressed as a function of v.  This is due, however, to the last
member alone, and this it is which corresponds to the eaterior
work effected by the alteration; for the differential of this work
is pdv, which, when p is eliminated by means of (I.), becomes
                                           R(n+1)           dº.

  24     M. C. F. Schoenbein   on the joint Influence exerted by Light
  of any free oxygen, has no appreciable action upon the indigo
  solution; for you may keep them together any length of time
  (even in sunlight) without being able to perceive any diminution
  or change of colour. So soon, however, as you permit oxygen
  or atmospheric air to enter, an action will ensue, very slow in
  the dark; comparatively speaking, very rapid in solar light.
      The simplest way of exhibiting the action is this: suspend
  moist strips of limen dyed with indigo solution in a mixture of
  gaseous   sulphurous acid and oxygen gas or atmospheric air.
  When placed in the dark, such strips require many weeks to
  become entirely white, whilst a strong moon’s insolation of one
  and a half, or at most two hours’ duration, will completely bleach
 them.                                  -
      As a matter of course, the colour of aqueous sulphurous acid
  mixed up with some indigo solution and shaken with oxygen
  or atmospheric air, will also be much more rapidly discharged in
  solar light than it is in the dark.   100 grammes of a weak sul
 phurous acid, coloured by 1 gramme of the standard indigo
  solution, on being continually shaken with atmospheric air and
 exposed to a strong sun, lost the colour within twenty minutes.
 It is hardly necessary to mention, that the bleaching power is
 exerted as long as there is free oxygen and sulphurous acid; for
 no sooner has the latter disappeared, i.e. been transformed into
 sulphuric acid, than the action ceases to take place in a per
 ceptible degree.                                    -
     I was curious to see how much of     my standard indigo solution
 could be destroyed by a given weight of pure sulphurous acid.
 Five grammes of the latter, mixed up with 200 grammes of water,
 were therefore put into a bottle holding about two litres and
 filled with atmospheric air, then 50 grammes of the standard
 indigo solution added, the whole exposed to the action of solar
 light, repeatedly shaken, and the atmospheric air now and then
 renewed.     There being little sunshine, the colour of the liquid
 was discharged within a couple of days, and in the course of six
weeks (very deficient in sunshine) I have been able to destroy
600 grammes of the standard indigo solution, and find that there
is still a very perceptible quantity of sulphurous acid in the
mixture. The discharging power is therefore not yet exhausted.
     Now to discharge the colour of 600 grammes of my indigo
solution, I require nearly 11 grammes of the strongest nitric acid
 (the monohydrate), or fully 18 grammes of good chloride of lime;
and 5 grammes of pure sulphurous acid having already done the
same work, and being able to do still more, we see that sulphu
rous acid enjoys a most extraordinary indirect oxidizing power.
I   say “indirect,” because the acid itself has nothing to do with
the oxidation of indigo; the only part it performs conjointly

and the Oxidability of certain                              substances        upon common Orygen.                      25

they are facts; and facts, too, which in my opinion will, if once
better understood than they are now, throw floods of light upon
the thick darkness with which the chemical world is as yet
covered.   And                 I
                     am inclined to think so, because it is very
likely that the so called catalytical phaenomena reveal the very
elementary, and on that account the most important, actions or
functions of matter.

  28          Dr. Tyndall on                    the Progress      of the Physical Sciences:
     Through two prisms situated so that the hypothenuse edges
  form a straight line, an object appears unchanged in size and
  shape, but inclined at an angle which is twice as large as that
 inclosed by the planes of refraction of the two prisms. For it is
  clear that the double reversion takes place in the same manner,
 whether the two lines in which the productions of the hypo
 thenuse surfaces of the prism cut the object form a right or an
 acute angle with each other.          Everybody will admit that when a

or the frustum of a pyramid, appears with regard to the surface
of the paper either as convex or concave relief, then the said
drawing viewed through the prism with one eye, and with the
other eye naked, will appear in convex relief; when the prism is
held before the other eye, the stereoscopic combination of both
images gives rise to a concave relief.            If the drawing be turned

rotation of 90° causes the coincidence of the images to appear as
a plane projection. A rotation of 180°, on the contrary, changes
it from concave to convex. During the rotation, the hypo

cases under the same angle; but in the second case we imagine
that it lies further away. Hence the idea of a larger surface
seen at a greater distance, and the apparent diminution of the
inclination.
     This explanation is corroborated by the following experiment:
A   small gypsum bust was placed before a polished hollow mirror,
so that the reversed image seen with both eyes fell beside the
bust. Without changing the position of the right eye, the left
eye was closed. The image receded immediately to the surface
of the mirror, and appeared much larger; it was observed under
the same angle, but fancied to be at a greater distance.

always stand at equal distances.   It is a proof that the combina

   A disc of carbonate of lime, in which the particles were brought
by pressure more closely together in one direction, set itself with
the line of compression equatorial.     This line therefore corre
sponds with the axes of arragonite and calcareous spar.
   The same coincidence was exhibited between a disc of pow
dered carbonate of iron and the crystal of the same substance.
The direction of compression, like the axis of the crystal, set
equatorial.
   Besides those bodies whose chemical composition is the same
as that of the crystals examined, others of powdered glass, chro
mate of lead, and phosphate of lime were also submitted to ex
amination. Of conducting bodies, oxide of manganese, oxide of
iron, antimony and bismuth, were examined; the direction of
compression in          all
                    these substances set itself between the electric
poles equatorial.

42             Mr. P.     J.   Martin on the Anticlinal Line of
namely, that the basins, as they are called, of London and Hamp
shire were once united; or more properly, as I showed in my
“Memoir,” that these great synclinals had no existence till the
convulsion we then contemplated raised the barrier between them;
and that they could not therefore be the areas of a marine deposit
posterior to the epoch of their formation.
   At the time these speculations were given to the world, men's
minds were fully engaged in the investigation of the formation
and succession of strata, their age and organic contents, and less
to geological structure; and there was a disposition to repress
opinions founded on any appeal to periods of extraordinary
activity. The doctrines of uniformity in geological causation
had then the ascendency, and Sir Charles Lyell advanced his
theory of the gradual erosion of the Weald and the quiet trans
port of the materials into the adjoining basins*.    For several
years after this I was myself otherwise and better employed, and
did nothing in the prosecution of my research; but from time
to time other observers ventured timidly to differ from Mr. Lyell,
especially when in contemplation of the accidents of water-shed,
and as appearances of violent disruption were occasionally deve
lopedt.       Still, having full confidence in the truthfulness of my
                                                                      ...i
early interpretation of the structural phaenomena ever under my
observation, and intending some day to satisfy myself with givin
the world a history of the Weald denudation, I made
excursions, as my leisure would permit, into Hampshire and
Wiltshire, believing that the same parallel lines of fracture and
concomitant aqueous denudation would there exhibit (in the
great chalk dome of those counties), mutatis mutandis, the same
or similar features.       I say “with a difference,” because it could
not be     supposed   that a country composed of so ductile a material
as the chalk, ever reluctant to disclose the secrets of             dispo
                                                                      its
sition except when great disruptive violence has been used, would
offer the broad and unmistakeable marks of disturbance to be
found     in the variable beds     the Wealden,
                                         of               its

 self    inthis direction on two accounts.       First, because      have

 always found that,         discussing the affairs
                              in                          of

 *   This hypothesis took such entire possession     ofthe pub<U+017F>ic mind, and
my opinions fell    so
                     much into abeyance, that two     three years after, when
                                                     or

Chichester,   was told that
               I               was “all wrong,”—“that Mr. Lyell had given
                                    I
the true explanation, and Dr. Mantell had confirmed it.”        thought that

this hypothesis     of
                    Sir     Lyell had been entirely withdrawn; but

persons generally well-informed on the subject found it difficult,
or could never be persuaded to abstract themselves from the
notion, that the Weald denudation was a piece by itself, that it
was to be viewed and spoken of as a district from which certain
removals had been effected, by whatever means, and where changes
had taken place, in which the neighbouring countries did not
share.   It was therefore most desirable that Dr. Buckland's
original views of the elevation of the great chalk district should
be restored in the public mind; and that the idea of a general

  tion at Devizes is met by that of the general line extending from
  S.W. to N.E. from the Dorsetshire to the Yorkshire coasts. I
  should also say, of as many degrees of latitude, but, except as a
  speculation of the highest order of probability, I am not prepared
  to include the parallel lines of elevation of the Isle of Wight in
 this disquisition; and it would be an area inconveniently large
 for the discussion of matters of a practical nature.

                                                            P.  J. MARTIN.
           [Read before the Geological Society, December   16, 1840.]
     A   paper   was read before the Geological Society in 1827,
 afterwards     enlarged   into a small quarto volume, published the
 following year, under the title of a “Memoir on a part of West
 ern Sussex, with some observations on the Weald Denudation,”
 &c.     In this paper some new facts and some speculations           were
 advanced on the construction of the Weald,—its cross fractures,
 drainage and other phaenomena, illustrative of the simultaneous
 operations of upheaving force, and violent aqueous abrasion.
     In pursuance of the subject, some additional remarks were
 offered to the public in the Philosophical Magazine for February
 1829, on the extent and magnitude of the abraded materials;
 and to show also, that although the word “denudation ” was
 usually restricted to the Weald valley, the chalk country, espe
 cially that of Hampshire and Wiltshire, ought to be included in
the same category; and, in fine, that the upburst of the Wealden,
and the area comprised in the chalk-boundaries of what was
called “the great denudation of the Weald,” did not present any
features attributable to disturbing forces, distinct and separable
from those of the surrounding districts.
    The object of the present inquiry is to trace the lines of dis
turbance from and into the Weald, through the great expanse of
chalk which separates the western parts of the basins of London

                           the London and Hampshire Basins.                                          45
and Hampshire, and their probable connexion with the corre
sponding lines of the vales of Pewsey, Warminster and Wardour.
The construction and arrangement of the chalk country will
follow; and the whole will serve, when the drainage and other
geological and geographical features come to be considered, as a
suitable introduction to a reconsideration of the phaenomena of
disturbance and denudation. The district in question, moreover,
forms with the Boulonnais a convenient geological whole, whether
considered apart, or in conjunction with other “lines of eleva
tion,” or denuded countries of suspected contemporaneity.
    In reference to the connexion of the Weald with the Wiltshire
valleys above mentioned, the sum of our present knowledge may
be gathered from the following passage in Professor Phillips's
“Treatise on Geology*.” “In England, two lines of subter
ranean movement have long been known, by which the tertiary
 and secondary strata have been raised into anticlinal ridges and
 sunk into synclinal hollows. They both range east and west, or
 nearly so; one line, viz. from the Vale of Pewsey, by Kingsclere,
 F      am, Guildford, and through the Weald of Sussex to Bou
 logne, is somewhat parallel to the vale of the Thames, &c.” And
 in reference to the Vale of Wardour, and          probable connexion     its
 with the western    extremity     the  Weald,        of
                                                the latest information
is   to    derived from Dr. Fitton’s History
          be                                         the Strata below         of
 the Chalkt.      Dr. Fitton says, “The beds        Harnham Hill, im      at
 mediately          on
                 the south      Salisbury, are inclined

deserves inquiry, whether the continuation      the fissure pro                 of

inquiry; and will anticipate the result

    46                Mr. P.         J.   Martin on the Anticlinal Line of
    culate with another which is projected westward from the “head
    of the Wealden denudation.”
       On inspecting Mr. Greenough's map or Dr. Fitton’s appended
    to the above-mentioned memoir, it will be observed that a direct
    point is made by the Vale of Wardour toward the south west
    corner of the head of the Weald.    And in like manner, an incli
    nation is shown  by  the Pewsey  line of valleys at Kingsclere to
    bend toward the north-west corner at Farnham.        The axes of
    elevation appear to run in these two directions, and the geogra
    phical features of the country are in accordance with them, as
    indicated by the high grounds. Nevertheless, the anticlinal lines
    which constitute these axes of elevation are distinct and separate,
    whether they be contemporaneous or not. The Burghclere Hills
    sink down and do not unite with the North Downs; and the
    high grounds south of Salisbury, although continued eastward
    to the Test, in the neighbourhood of Romsey, decline in a syn
    clinal hollow to rise again in the high hills about Winchester,
    which are the proper continuation of the South Downs.
       To make out this in detail, I begin at the upper or western
    end of the Weald denudation.        This district, which Dr. Fitton
    has called the “head of the Weald denudation,” is a valley
    ranging almost directly north and south, about sixteen or seven
    teen miles in length and (east and west) five or six in breadth.
    We may for the sake of brevity call it the Wolmar Valley, Wol
    mar Forest being one of                         its
                                       most prominent features.                                              It   is
    bounded           on
                   the north                   by
                                   the Hogsback,        the south      the        on                        by
    bold eminences       Butser Hill and the South Down
                                of                              range,                                            on
    the west     by

    and    on

tral line heaves in succession the higher beds of the lower green
sand and the galt; and tilting up the malm or upper greensand
beds, it gives them a prominence which they do not elsewhere
assume, and enters the chalk between the salient angles of
Hawksley and Worldham.        The central rent is at Selborne, and
the highest  point  in the chalk hills of this part of the Alton
range is a little south and west of that village.
   South of the central anticlinal line another enters the Wolmar
Valley by Trotton and Rogate, and passing by Petersfield enters
the upper greensand and chalk about a mile north of East-meon *.
As this line runs the whole length of Sussex, and then traverses
the Hampshire chalk and crosses- the Test, it will merit a more
particular description.
    The third anticlinal line which traverses the Wolmar Valley
runs north of the other two, and is more strongly marked in
this part of            its
                    course than the one last mentioned, though else

history of an invention recently brought into use in America,
by which electro-magnetism is introduced as an agent in the
determination of differences of terrestrial longitude, and for
various astronomical purposes in which the exact noting of time
enters as an important element.
   On the 9th of June 1844, Capt. Charles Wilkes, U.S.N.,
made the first experiment for determining longitudes by means
of the electric telegraph, between Washington and Baltimore,
 with chronometers rated at each place.        All subsequent experi
 ments for determining longitudes by the electric telegraph in the
 United States, have been made at the expense of the Coast Sur
vey, and by              its
                   officers,                     or   by

 immediate supervision.

                 to Geodetical and Astronomical purpases.         53
  experiment was repeatedly performed that year by Mr. Walker,
  assisted at Philadelphia by Prof. E. O. Kendall, Director, and at
  Jersey city by Prof. E. Loomis.
       In July and August 1848, an extensive series of star-signals
  and clock-signals, by coincidences, were exchanged between the
  Harvard Observatory at Cambridge, Mass. and the observatory
  in the garden of the late Peter Stuyvesant in New York city.
  The work was under the charge of Mr. Walker, assisted re
  spectively by William Crouch Bond, Esq., Director of the Ob
  servatory at Cambridge, and Prof. E. Loomis at New York city.
  During these experiments, Mr. Bond conceived the idea of using
  an automatic circuit interrupter, and on the recommendation      of
  Mr. Walker, received in July 1848, an order from Prof. Bache,
  superintendent, for the construction of a clock for this purpose
  in conformity with Mr. Bond's drawings, then before    the superin
                                                      -
  tendent.
      This clock was completed in 1850, and forms part of the ap
  paratus in use at Cambridge in 1850 and 1851.         The work of
  1848, in July and August, forms the date of the first connexion
  of Mr. Bond and his two sons, Messrs. George P. and Richard
  F. Bond, with the use of the magnetic telegraph line for longi
  tude, and with the machinery and apparatus for the same.         It
  preceded by two months the work between Philadelphia and
  Cincinnati of the year 1848, when in the month of October the
  attention of Prof. O. M. Mitchell, and afterwards of Dr. John
  Locke, was turned to the subject.       The fact that Prof. Bache
  had ordered an automatic circuit interrupter of Mr. Bond in the
  preceding August, was communicated both to Prof. Mitchell and
  Dr. Locke previous to their undertaking similar experiments.
      On the 26th of October 1848, Prof. O. M. Mitchell, at the sug
  gestion of Mr. Walker, prepared a circuit interrupter with an
  ordinary eight-day clock, and used it to graduate the running
  fillets of paper for several days.
      It was not used in the work with Philadelphia, clouds having
  prevented work on the 27th, proposed for the purpose. The
  same mode which Prof. Mitchell used had been proposed by
  Joseph Saxton, Esq. in 1846, but has not been adopted by Prof.
  Bache and Mr. Walker, from apprehension of injury to the per
  formance of the astronomical clock which must be used for the

      On the 26th of October 1848, Dr.    J. Locke having stated his

, undertake experiments to obviate them.

Mr. Ellis's           paper, that I have been here referring to
                                      will   see
some   parts of his reasoning  at pp. 324, 325; and is requested
also to observe, that in pointing out the invalidity of a particular
objection against the Edinburgh Reviewer’s result, am not de                                           I
fending his argument, about which       shall say something here     I
after.
        If it
        be now asked what positive grounds there are for using
the method of least squares in the case of a moderate number of
observations, beyond motives of mere convenience,       think it                                           I
may be answered that the method has been proved by Gauss (in
the Theoria Combinationis Observationum, &c.) to be a very good
method, though it has not been proved to be the best method.
He has not shown that it gives the most probable result; but he
has shown that it gives a result such, that if the whole system
of observations were repeated an infinite number of times, the
average value of the square of the error would be a minimum.
Ipresume that                  Mr. Ellis does not mean to imply more than this
when he says                    (p.
                                  321) that “Gauss afterwards gave another
demonstration which      perfectly rigorous.”
                                        is             fact, Gauss him              In
self expressly points out that there          something arbitrary      is                                                    in

instances in illustration of the above remark; but there are two
which         I
         must mention briefly.
   The first is the Edinburgh Reviewer’s proof, commented upon
by Mr. Ellis. Of course it was easy to annihilate          considered                                      it,

                                    was not before acquainted.      It
 contains some   investigations on certain applications of the theory

                                 ought to have referred.      On the
 subject of the credibility of testimony, my remarks appear to be
entirely consistent, so far as they go, with those of Professor De
Morgan.      But from what he has said in p. 46 of his Memoir,                                           I
am uncertain how far he would agree with my account of the
surprise excited by the accidental occurrence of a symmetrical
event.       I
            shall not, however, enter further into that subject, as
enough has been said to make it intelligible what the question
is; and any reader who shall have taken the trouble to follow
the reasoning of these papers and of Professor De Morgan's,
will be in a position to form his own judgement upon                                        it.

         GENTLEMEN,
As you  have announced your intention to publish translation
   of the memoir of M. Clausius on the mechanical agency
                                                                          a
of heat, which appeared last summer in Poggendorff’s Annalen,
I beg leave to offer to you the English version of a letter on the
subject of the First Part of M. Clausius's paper, which was ad
dressed by me to the editor of that journal, and published in the
9th Number for 1850.
                       I   am, Gentlemen,
                                  Your most obedient Servant,
                                        W. J. MAcquor N RANKINE.

Letter from     Mr. Macquorn Rankine                 to   Dr.   J.   C. Poggendorff".
    Having observed in your Annalem der Physik und Chemie for
April 1850 a very able and interesting paper on the motive power
|.
of heat, by M. Clausius, I beg leave to call your attention to a
  aper which was presented by me to the Royal Society of Edin
         in October 1849, read on the 4th of February 1850, and
published in the 20th volume of their Transactions, Part First; in
which paper, among other results, I have arrived at conclusions
respecting the specific heat of gases and vapours, and the latent
heat of evaporation, agreeing with those of M. Clausius, and de
duced from principles, and by means of a method, which, though
differing in some details from those employed by him, are the
same in their essential points.   In doing so, I have no wish to
detract from the merit of M.   Clausius, or to establish any rivalry
between him and     myself; on the  contrary,                   I
                                                am gratified to find
the results of my investigations confirmed by so eminent an
authority.            -
    It is probable that you have had, or will soon have, an oppor
tunity of seeing the part of the Edinburgh Transactions to which
I  refer; should that not be case, however, I shall be glad to
send you a copy of the paper as soon as                    I
                                              am aware of a conve
nient and secure means of conveyance.        In the meanwhile                           I
shall give you a summary of             its
                                  contents.
    Itconsists of an introduction and four sections.

as  to the constitution of matter, called the Hypothesis of Mole
 cular Vortices.   Its chief suppositions are the following:—
    1. That each atom of matter consists of a nucleus or central
physical point enveloped by an elastic atmosphere, which is re
tained round it by attraction; so that the elasticity of bodies is
made up of two parts,      one arising from the diffused portion of
the atmospheres, and resisting change of volume only; the other
arising from the mutual actions of the nuclei, and of the portions
of atmosphere condensed round them, and resisting not only
change of volume, but change of figure also.
    2. That the changes of elasticity produced by heat arise from
the centrifugal force of revolutions or oscillations amongst the
particles of the atomic atmospheres, diffusing them to a greater
distance from their nuclei, and thus increasing the elasticity
which resists change of volume only, at the expense of that
which resists change of figure also.
    3. That the medium which transmits light and radiant heat
consists of the nuclei of the atoms vibrating independently, or
almost independently, of their atmospheres; absorption being                                                the
transference           of
                  motion from the nuclei      the atmospheres, and     to
radiation        its
              transference from the atmospheres        the nuclei.                 to
    This last  supposition      peculiar    my
                                            is  own  researches,  to

first two having more                  or
                            less resemblance    ideas previously en     to

              others.

     I

tions required by the practical formulae of Pambour to suit them
to the true mechanical theory of heat.    It is proved, that, from
the nature of the    steam-engine,  we cannot expect to convert
more than about one-sixth of the heat expended in evaporation
into available power, the remainder escaping into the condenser
or the atmosphere.     The actual amount so converted is in many
ordinary engines less than one-twenty-fourth part. The paper
concludes with two tables for practical use,_the first for calcu
lating the pressure of steam from the volume, and vice versd;
and the second for computing the effect of expansive working in
steam-enginesl.

XII.   Description        and Analysis of Loganite, a new Mineral
   Species.    By       T. S. HUNT, Chemist to the Geological Com
   mission   of Canadat.

       white crystalline limestone mixed with pale green serpen
tine, phlogopite, pyrites, and rarely crystals of apatite.
   Form very imperfect, but has the appearance of a prism replaced
   * A comparison of the results of those formulae and tables with Mr. Wick
steed's experiments on the Cornish engine at Old Ford is given in the
            Transactions, vol. xx. part 2, together with a method of deter
mining the proportions of an expansive engine which shall perform a given
amount of work at the least possible pecuniary cost.
   Subsequently to the publication of the above letter, I became acquainted
with the second part of M. Clausius's paper, the object of which is to adapt
the principle known as Carnot's law to the mechanical theory of heat.
That law, as modified by M. Clausius and Prof. W. Thomson of Glasgow,
is as follows:—
   When a machine converts heat into expansive power by communicating
heat to a substance at a higher temperature (T,), and abstracting heat from
 .
it at a lower (to), the maximum proportion of the heat converted into expan
sive power to the whole heat received is a function of the two temperatures
  #.
only, and independent of the nature of the substance.
            since succeeded in proving, that Carnot's law is not an indepen
dent principle, but is deducible from the equations given in my original
          and that the function of the temperatures of receiving and emitting
 eat, which expresses the maximum value of the fraction                 of the   whole heat
converted into expansive power, is the following:
                                           Th–To
                                           71–k’
k being a constant, which is the same for           all   substances   in   nature.   (Trans.

it appears from the third analysis that the amount of silica in
the second is rather too low, we may regard the first as ex
pressing more exactly the ratio, which is just 1:2, and which
makes it a protosilicate in the nomenclature of - M.

   The peroxide of iron is to be regarded as replacing a portion
of the alumina, so that the mineral is essentially a hydrated sili
cate of magnesia and alumina, which, denoting Al;        Al<U+017F>º, will                            i.

   The only mineral hitherto described which approximates to
this in constitution is chlorite, which belongs to the same type,
and is represented by SiO'(Al3; Mg; H3); the principal dif
ference in chemical composition being in the proportion of water.
The hardness and other physical characters of this mineral are,
however, such as to distinguish it completely from chlorite, and
                             of its
seem to warrant        erection into     new species, for which        a                                    I

Sir   Lectures on Astronomy delivered at the Meetings                              of the Friends
  of the Ipswich Museum.   By George BIDDELL AIRY, Astronomer
  Royal.     London: Simpkin and Marshall. 8vo. pp. 247.
       E wish   to call attention to this work, on account of its intrinsic
         merits, and the circumstances under which it was produced.
About four years ago, some of the leading inhabitants of Ipswich,
feeling a deep interest in the welfare of the working classes, and
believing that the cultivation of the intellect would tend greatly to
promote their physical and moral improvement, resolved to establish
an institution for this especial object.      A museum was formed con
taining books, scientific instruments, specimens of the fine arts,
natural history, geology, &c., to which admittance twice a week, free
of charge, has been granted to all. From time to time, as oppor
tunity served, intelligible and untechnical lectures in various branches
of science have been delivered, which have been very numerously
attended.    To show the quality of the instruction afforded, it is suf
ficient to  say   that the Astronomer        Royal, Professors Sedgwick,
Henslow, Owen, E. Forbes, Ansted, Playfair, &c. have been the
lecturers.   The museum has been most handsomely supported by
the inhabitants of the town and the neighbouring nobility and gentry,
and is now very rich in several departments.             It is not the least
pleasing characteristic of this admirable institution, that it has been
founded and supported by a union of persons of different ranks,
politics and religion, who seem to have felt no difficulty in discover
ing a wide neutral space in which all good citizens may agree.
Members of the Society of Friends have been most zealous in this
good work; indeed it           is,
                              we believe,      Mr. George Ransome, one
                                                          to
of  the honorary secretaries, that      very large portion
                                             a                   the merit         of           is
due; but two successive Bishops           Norwich have presided
                                                 of                       the              at
harmonious anniversary meetings, and the names we have just cited
as   coadjutors show that nothing narrow                       or
                                                     exclusive has entered
into the management.              Itequally agreeable
                                       is                     state, that theto
general good conduct        the persons for whom this institution was
                             of
mainly formed has fully equalled the expectations                 their well       of
wishers.     At  Ipswich,      as most places where the experiment has
                                     in
been fairly and judiciously tried, confidence         the people has been
                                                                in
met    ontheir side     bystrong
                          a       sense     self-respect
                                                   of    and responsibility.

had long been intimately connected with some          principal pro          its
                                                                     on of
moters, offered    to                                   astronomy, which

      As   might           be
                        expected    from Mr.      Airy,   these lectures are quite ori

hended by that class of people.         It is not my object, however, to
deal with what    may    be called the picturesque in astronomy.       I have
proposed it to myself as a special object, to show what may be com
prehended, by persons possessing common understandings and ordi
mary education, in the more elevated operations of astronomical
science. The lectures will be, therefore, of what I may call a mathe
matical kind.     But in speaking of this, I beg that the ladies present
will not be startled. I do not mean to use algebra or any other
science, such as must be commonly of an unintelligible character to
a mixed meeting. When I use the word mathematical, I mean that
it will be my object to show how the measure of great things may
be referred to the measure of smaller things; or to sum up in few
words, it will be my object, in an intelligible way, to show the great
leading steps of the process, by which the distance of the sun and
the stars is ascertained by a yard measure—the process by which the
weight of the sun and the planets is measured by the pound weight
avoirdupois.     Occasionally I shall be prepared to go into details;
but my principal business will be to show the great steps upon which
those who wish to study astronomy may enter, and by which they
may attain a general comprehension of the rules which will lead
them from one step to another.”—PP. 3, 4.
    This design has been kept steadily in view throughout the course,
but it is not possible to convey any idea of the author's method or
success by extracts.       We would however call attention to the ma
 sterly analysis of one problem of considerable intricacy, viz. the de
termination of the parallax of the sun, and consequently of his di
stance, by observations of the transit of Venus. As this is the con
necting link between measures upon the earth's surface and the
dimensions of our system, great pains have been taken to make the
process intelligible.     The further step of investigating the parallax,
and   consequently    the distance of the fixed stars (where that is prac
ticable), is also elucidated; and the author, with evident satisfaction,
thus sums up the several steps. “By means of a yard measure, a
base-line in a survey was measured ; from this, by the triangulations
and computations of a survey, an arc of meridian on the earth was
measured; from this, with proper observations with the zenith sector,
the surveys being also repeated on different parts of the earth, the
 earth's form and dimensions were ascertained; from these, and a
previous independent knowledge of the proportions of the distances
of the earth and other planets from the sun, with observations of the
transit of Venus, the sun's distance is determined; and from this,
with observations leading to the parallax of the stars, the distance
 of the stars is determined.         And every step in the process can be
 distinctly referred to  its            is,

a certain time is easily calculated; and again, from the dimensions
of the earth's orbit, the space through which the sun draws the
earth in the same time is also found. These data and the well-known
law of gravitation, that the attractive power varies as the mass of
the attracting body divided by the square of the distance, assigns
the proportion of the sun's weight to the earth's weight.         A similar
method applies to                    all
                          the planets which have satellites; and those

    In the above table, the horizontal force was obtained by vibrations,
 and reduced to 0° Reaumur.        Before and after my journey in 1847,
 the force was determined at Dorpat by Gauss's method, and the
 needle employed compared therewith and reduced to the intensity in
 London=1372.        Subsequently I preferred for trying the needles,
 Poisson's method, at least for traveling purposes; but some alterations
 require to be introduced in Poisson's formula, as he has overlooked
 some things.    With the same needle which I employed in both my
journeys, I have made more than 60 determinations of absolute
 force at Dorpat, partly in a room and partly in the open air, and in
 temperatures varying from         –
                                  13° R. to +25° R., and have found a
very good accordance.       I also made several-
                                                  such determinations in
the journeys of 1848 and 1849.
    As I do not possess an observatory, and cannot employ a Bifilar
 in my dwelling-house, it has not been possible for me to compare
 the variations of the force with my determinations; I have however
 made use of the following method:— If X be the magnetism of the
earth and m that of the needle, I seek not X but m; this latter
quantity depends on the temperature t and the time T, as the needle
is not constant; but if I combine              all

more nearly the rate of the apsidal motion, when the arc of vibration
becomes very small. Twelve experiments, averaging about 20 minutes
each, gave 11°-60 for the azimuthal horary motion, when the mean
length of the arc was 11 inches and the ellipticity +0.19 inch;
and seventeen similar experiments gave 11°-39 per hour, when the
ellipticity was —0.17 inch. The mean length of arc, ellipticity, and

ing the attention of astronomers to one of my memoirs upon instru
mental errors, in which I have incidentally treated of eclipses", it
may perhaps not be considered amiss for me again to dwell upon
the notions which I published last year.
    In accordance with these notions, it would be of importance to
determine the temperature of the atmosphere, and especially its
variations, by means of very delicate thermometers, and at different
 elevations above the surface of the earth.     If even aeronauts would
 consent to make an aerial ascent on the 28th of July, they would un
 doubtedly enjoy during the complete eclipse, a very beautiful spec
 tacle; they would be certain, at all events, to render their under
taking of great scientific interest, by carefully determining the vari
 ations of the temperature at an elevation of some thousands of metres.
 Probably some very useful information upon the temporary constitu
 tion of the atmosphere during the eclipse might be obtained by mea
 suring several very exact zenithal distances of the sun or the moon,
 before, during, and after complete obscuration.         M. Otto Struve
 has informed me that arrangements will be made, at least at one
 station, in conformity with the plan suggested by me, and this
 good news diminishes my regret at not being able to render my
 feeble cooperation in this noble astronomical undertaking.         I may,
however, be permitted to recall to the attention of observers a
phaenomenon which the Report of the British Association has omit
 ted to notice, undoubtedly because the phaenomenon has appeared
 too doubtful or completely exceptional.       But as numerous stations
 ought to be arranged in several lines perpendicular to the progressive
motion of the shadow, and as the observers ought to occupy every
possible position within the cone of the shadow, it is probable that
no phaenomenon, however rare and exceptional, will escape attention
when so scientifically directed.      I must say a few words here upon
the brilliant points observed by Ulloa and M. Valz upon the disc of
the moon.      In consequence of an inherent tendency of the mind,
which at first always attributes substance and reality to appearances
by which it is struck, the luminous points have been explained as
material apertures existing in the substance of the moon.           But in
 my opinion, one and the same theory is sufficient to explain both the
external protuberances and the internal apertures; this consists in
viewing them as two distinct effects of mirage produced temporarily
in the atmosphere; and I have pointed out the probable connexion
of these phaenomena, which are so dissimilar in appearance, in the
excellent Astronomical Journal of my learned friend Mr. Gould,
published in the United Statest. They both depend upon the distri
bution of the temperatures of the layers of air parallel to the visual
rays; except that in the second case, and in consequence of the posi
tion of the observer, the trajectory presents a point of inflection which
does not exist in the case of the external protuberances.           These
statements are very reservedly made; as regards the fact itself, it is
based upon evidence, the entire value of which is known to astrono
mers. M. Walz must himself have been forcibly struck by                  it,
                                                                       for

                                                  remarked          in

   As the altitude of the sun will be very different at the various
stations, from Norway to the Black or the Caspian sea, the thickness
of the layers of the atmosphere which must exert some influence
upon the phaenomenon, will vary in a very marked degree.           Now,
the height and the brilliancy of the red mountains will depend essen
tially upon this thickness; hence it must be expected that the moun
tains will be larger and more marked to observers situated towards
the eastern extremity of the band traversed by the shadow, unless a
greater depression of temperature compensates, towards the west,
for the effect of a less thickness of the refracting layers of air. It is
here again evident how far the measure of these variations may prove
of interest in regard to the proofs to which it may be condescended
to submit the preceding ideas. The eclipse of the 28th of July will,
I hope, be completely decisive, thanks to the admirable understand
ing of the astronomers of the two great countries.—Comptes Rendus,

     HE    controversy in reference to the source of voltaic electri
        city, appears to be decided, at least in England, in favour
of the chemical theory. A voltaic current seems generally ad
mitted to be nothing else than the circulation, in another form,
of the sum of the chemical affinities developed in the circuit.
Is it not therefore time, since electric currents are susceptible of
minutely accurate measurement, that an attempt was made to
analyse the forces circulating in our batteries, and to assign to
the different substances present the value of the respective affi
nities they mutually exert, from the united action of which
results that balance of forces constituting the effective power of
the battery :
   Accurately to measure and tabulate the combining force of the
constituents of compound substances, as we now do their com
bining quantities, specific gravities, &c., would be an important
step  in chemical science, and a great addition to our know
ledge of the natural history of the materials of the globe.
   Many attempts have been made roughly to estimate these
forces by purely chemical experiment; and tables have been con
structed of the strength of affinities, in which, without nume
rical values, substances have been arranged, with more or less
accuracy, in the order in which they expel each other from their
combinations. Estimates have also been formed, founded on
other considerations, but with little pretensions to numerical
exactness.    Accurate measurements, again, have been made by
several  methods,   and by various observers, of the intensities of
current developed in different voltaic arrangements, and with

and by which the resulting current is transmitted.   The copper
and dissolved oxygen  tend also to produce an opposing  current,
for which the zinc plate would serve as ode; but this current is
overcome and masked by the much stronger one of the other
pair, and is only manifested by diminishing the force in com
parison with what it would have been, if a plate wholly indiffer
ent to the oxygen was substituted for the copper.  The formula
of the force may  be thus stated,
     2   for    0–0             for   H+H   for 0—(c for           0–0        for   H+H           for   0);
leaving a balance of affinities, after the elimination of equal and
contrary forces, of
                           (2–c) for 0.
     If this
          view be correct, the inconstancy of the water battery
must arise from the exhaustion of the dissolved oxygen on the
surface of the copper plate, this being the only element of which
the supply is deficient in quantity; a conclusion fully warranted
by the above experiments with the resistance tube.        And it is to
the abundant supply of this element in the Daniell’s battery that
its superior constancy is owing.
   The substitution for the copper plate of any other conducting
substance having no affinity for either oxygen or hydrogen, would
destroy the negative portion of the formula (2–c) for 0; and
the deflection of the needle by a current passed through the re
sistance tube would be then proportional simply to the affinity of
the zinc for oxygen.     And thus the relative affinity for oxygen of

       To the Editors   of the Philosophical Magazine                   and     Journal.
         GENTLEMEN,
       OME communications which I     have received since the pub
       lication of my letter on the Theory  of Probabilities in the
last Number of your Journal, have led me to think that a little
further explanation of certain points involved in it may be desi
rable. This explanation              I
                               the more readily offer, because it
appears to me that upon one of the points in question, viz. the
prevalent doctrine among mathematicians concerning the inves
tigation of the probabilities of causes, I have made a statement
which          careful survey of authorities does not fully warrant.
          a more
As the question lies at the foundation of some of the most in
teresting applications of the theory of probabilities, am desirous          I
of stating how it has really been viewed by eminent writers; and
I shall subsequently notice certain other points suggested to me
in the correspondence above referred                      to.
   The problem under discussion was the following:—Given the
probability   p    of
                  the truth     the proposition.
                                    of                the condition   If
A  has been satisfied, the event     has not happened.    Required

  has happened, the condition       has not been satisfied.    And
itsBcorrect solution,    given

I have remarked that       has generally been erroneously held,
                               it

             I                  to
                            refer.
   The doctrine that P=p        expressly taught
                                     is               the Edinburgh   in
Review (Quctelet        on

                                     -      that some law                                                              of
mature, some cause was concerned.”
    The same doctrine seems to me to be strongly implied by
Laplace in the Introduction to his great work on Probabilities.
Discussing the question of a primitive cause, fixing the direction
of rotation of the planets in their orbits, he introduces the object
of his inquiry in the words “pour avoir la probabilité avec
laquelle cette cause est indiquée.”      And then having determined,
on the hypothesis of the absence of such determining cause, the
probability against the phaenomenon of rotation in one uniform
direction, he says, “Nous devons done croire au moins avec la
même confiance qu'une cause primitive a dirigé                 mouvements                        les
planétaires, surtout      nous considérons que l’inclinaison
                                    si                                   plus                                du

petite.”    Laplace does not indeed expressly affirm the principle
under consideration, but         appears       me that his language does
                                                 it                    to
in  some  degree  give     sanction.

  à priori as likely as not that a sufficient ground for a determi
  mate phaenomenon should exist in nature.            All that we can infer
  from the general solution                       is,
                                      that unless the existence       such                         of         a

   2nd. That upon the supposition of the absence of such cause,
or simple combination of causes, certain results appearing to us
equally probable, the probability of that definite combination of

but that there appear to be no grounds further than the analogy
of Nature for determining a.        [The difficulty here is not that
we are choosing among causes equally probable, but that we are
attempting to assign the a priori probability of the existence of a
condition of things, or in other words, to compare the probabi

              presence and           of its

clear and well-marked distinction between these cases, accom
panied by a distinct statement     of the grounds upon which,
whenever constants are determined, their determination is effected.
  The question has been suggested to me by a correspondent”,
to whom I am indebted for some valuable remarks, whether
the general method described in my last paper involves any
fundamentally different idea of probability from that which is
commonly accepted.          He observes, that the results which                                                     I
have  given  are in accordance with the principles of the established
theory. As the same question may present itself to other minds,
I would remark that the theory of probabilities has, in the view
                                                              it,

as correct, the equation (IV.) will thereby be rendered unneces
sary for the nearer determination of (IIa.), inasmuch as the same
object is arrived at in a much more complete manner by equa
tion (9.), which flowed immediately from the combination of the
said assumption with the original maxim. The equation (IW.),
however, furnishes us with a means of submitting both princi
ples to a reciprocal trial. The equation (9.) was thus expressed,

and when we compare this with equation (IV.), we find that
both of them express the same thing; with this difference only,
that one of them expresses it more definitely than the other. In
(IV.) the function of the temperature is expressed in a general
manner merely, whereas in (9.) we have instead of C the more
definite expression A(a +t).
   To this surprising coincidence the equation (W.) adds      testi                             its

   We   see   that the values of C found in both cases increase, like
those of A(a+1), slowly with the temperature. They bear the
same ratio to each other as the numbers of the following series:
                            1; 1:13; 1:22; 1:27;
                            1; 1:12; 1:17; 1:31;
and when the ratio of the values of A(a+t) (obtained by setting
a=273) corresponding to the same temperatures are calculated,
we obtain
                            l; 1:14; 1:21; 1:39.
This series of relative values deviates from the former only so far
as might be expected from the insecurity of the data from which
those are derived : the same will also exhibit itself further on in
the determination of the absolute value of the constant A.
   Such a coincidence of results derived from two entirely differ
ent bases cannot be accidental.              Rather does it furnish an im

portant corroboration of both, and also of the additional inci

   Let us now turn again to the application of equations (IV.)
and (W.); the former, as regards permanent gases, has merely
served to substantiate conclusions already known.                         For vapours,
however, and for other substances to                    the  principle       of Carnot
may be applicable, the said equation furnishes the important
advantage, that by it we are justified in substituting everywhere
for the function C the definite expression A(a+t).               -
   The equation (V.) changes by this into
                           r=A 10.6-0%.                       .     .     .   .   (Va.)
we thus obtain for the vapour a simple relation between the tem
perature at which it is formed, the pressure, the volume, and
the latent heat, and can make use of it in drawing still further
conclusions.
   Were the law of M. and G. true for vapours at their maximum
density, we should have

existing at the time; with proportionately greater tension, the
numbers were too large. The case, however, is not finally set at
rest by these experiments; for, as remarked by Regnault, it is
doubtful whether the divergence is due to the too great specific
heat of the developed vapour, or to a quantity of water condensed
upon the sides of the glass balloon. Other experiments, wherein
the vapour was not developed in vacuo but saturated a current of
air, gave results which were tolerably free+ from these irregulari
ties; but neither from these, however important they may be in
other respects, can a safe conclusion be drawn as to the deport
ment of the vapour in vacuo.
   The following considerations will perhaps serve to fill up to
some extent the gap caused by this uncertainty.   The table (IV.)
shows that the lower the temperature of the vapour at       max                                         its
imum density, the more nearly      agrees with the law    M. and

G.; and hence we must conclude, that the specific weight for
low temperatures approaches more mearly the theoretic value
than for high ones.       therefore, for example, the value
                                        If                  0-622                                       of

From this we should derive for 0° the specific weight 0.643
instead  of 0-622, and the other numbers of the above table would
have to be increased proportionately.   But we are not yet jus
tified in making so wide an application of the formula (26.), as
it has been merely derived empirically from the values contained
in Table        III.;

tent ourselves with an approximation similar to that furnished
by the numbers in the foregoing table; so much however we may
conclude, that these numbers are rather too small than too large.
  By combining (Va.) with the equation (III.), which was im
mediately derived from the original maxim, we can eliminate
A(s-o), and we have remaining

  XIX. A             Description of Matlockite, a new Oxychloride                                                    of    Lead.
                             By R. P. GREG, Jun., Esq.”
      WRIGHT of           Liverpool has recently obtained from the
 MR. old heaps of the level      mine at Cromford, near Matlock,
 a small number of   specimens   of the murio-carbonate of lead, or
 phosgenite of Haidinger; and he has also found a few specimens
 of another ore of lead, differing in appearance from any of the
 known salts of that metal.
    At my request this mineral has been examined by Dr. Robert
 Angus Smith of Manchester, and his analysis of it has afforded
 the following results:—
                         Chloride of lead                       .        .           .       .        55.177

                                                        -                                             99.549
The proportions by theory would be—
                         Chloride of lead                   .       .        .           .       .     55-46
                         Oxide of lead .                    .       .        .           .       .     44'53
                                                                                                       99.99
   This gives a definite chemical composition of 1 atom of chlo
ride of lead combined with 1 atom of oxide of lead; differing in
this respect from Mendipite, in which the proportion of chloride
to that of oxide is as 1 to 2.
      The specific gravity of Matlockite is 7:21, and                                                          its   hardness

                                is                                                                                            it

inch thick, being placed in a polarizing instrument having the
planes of polarization of the polarizer and analyser at right
angles to each other, the angular radius of the first blue ring in
air was found to be 22°81'.”
   Dr. Smith has also analysed a crystal of the n urio-carbonate
of lead, and has obtained—

corresponding to 1 atom of chloride combined with 1 atom of
carbonate, which agrees with the proportions given by Klaproth
and Berzelius.

  I shall call 28 a unit of translation *; consequently the nume
rical magnitude of up is to be found by multiplying the numerical
magnitude of u by that of v, and by the sine of the angle which
v makes with u.

which I suspect there are relics of tertiary beds.
     Of thevalleys themselves, a stricter examination would pro
bably show that groups of fissures, puckerings, or subordinate
contortions, accompany the great central upheaval.    That these
phaenomena exist in greater force in the Weald Valley is most
probably owing to the great thickness of the Wealden formation.
If a section of the whole Wealden in this great exposure could
be obtained, it would exhibit the appearances we observe in some
ancient schistose formations, and which obtain most probably in
argillaceous deposits of                           all

mitude and direction of whose axes are continually varying.          In
order to see how R produces these effects, suppose it resolved
into two components, R cos p and R sin p: the former, acting
along the tangent, either accelerates or retards the elliptic velocity;
whilst the latter, acting in the direction of the normal, increases
or diminishes the angle q, which the tangent makes with the
radius vector.    These variations of p and v are the immediate
effects of the disturbing force.  The momentary variations of the
elements of the orbit depend on and may therefore be expressed
in terms of them, so that by the application of the rules of the
integral calculus we can calculate the total variation of these
elements produced in a given time.

138    On the Apsidal Motion         of a freely     suspended Pendulum.
As the last two terms of this expression are periodic, it is evident
that the progression of the apse during one complete vibration
of the pendulum is equal to
                                   3rab

In this equation,    g, l, a, b are supposed to be expressed in feet.
   The  length  of the pendulum used in our experiments was 35-4
feet; consequently, assuming gravity to be 32-19 feet, equation
(14.) will become for the pendulum used by us
                               N=5886 x ab;             .     . .   . .   (15.)
   At the commencement of the experiments, a = 24 inches, b=0;
at the end of first hour, a = 13 inches, b=-134 inch.
   The above figures are taken from ten experiments.                    Taking
the means of the semiaxes at the beginning and end of the hour,
and converting them into feet, we obtain ab=-009 square feet.
Hence
                                 N=0°53.             .  .     . .   . .   (16.)
The progression of the apse is consequently a little more than
half a degree in the first hour, and of course in the succeeding
hours should be considerably less in consequence of the small
value of the product ab.
   The observed deviation from 12° per hour (due to the rotation
of the earth, at the latitude of Dublin,) in the ten experiments is
contained in the following table:–
                  Right-handed motion.    Left-handed motion.

   A  comparison     of the foregoing table with (16.) shows, that
although apsidal motion, of the kind here considered, accounts

for the greater part of the observed deviation, it leaves about
three-tenths unaccounted             for.
   In the account of Mr. Bunt's experiments, contained in the
June Number of the Magazine, the observed deviation of the
apse for every tenth of an inch of semiaxis minor is given for
the pendulum used by him, which was 53 feet in length.
   The observed deviation per tenth of inch semiaxis minor is
07 of a degree per hour.
   On calculating (14.) for this pendulum, we find
                            N=21:46 x ab.                .   .        .     .   .     .        (17.)
Substituting in this expression the values 3-5 feet and 1 inch
for a and b (as stated in Mr. Bunt’s communication), we obtain
                                N=0°-626.            .   .   .        .     .   .     .        (18.)
     In this case the formula agrees more nearly with experiment.
     In Mr. Bunt’s communication in the last Number of the
Magazine, he states as the result of a new set of experiments,
that he found the correction for ºth of an inch ellipticity or
semiaxis minor, in a mean arc of about three feet, to be 0°43
per hour. If we apply equation (17.) to this case, the result is
0°-27, which differs much more from observation than Mr. Bunt's
former determination of the correction.   From all this it would
appear, that other causes beside the apsidal motion here con
sidered operate in disturbing- the angular motion due to the
earth's rotation.

takes place.
   Inasmuch as the steam between B and EF loses the greater
part of the vis vira which it possessed at B, a quantity of heat
equal to that formerly expended in the production of this portion
of the vis viva must be again produced; this portion of the ris
viva does not therefore at all enter into the calculation of the
entire quantity of heat consumed up to EF; so that, without

    The author commences his paper with the following                                                            words:–

that the difference between the two sums in question is very small
ifthe stations be equally elevated above the surface. It is not, how
ever (nor can be geometrically), shown that this difference is not
greater than the probable error of observation, and therefore it may
be useful to find an expression for this small difference in terms of
the latitudes and longitudes of the stations, in order to see whether
it may be in any case greater than the probable errors of observation,
and large enough to be worth taking into account.”
   The author then investigates by accurate formulae of analytical
geometry, as applied to the co-ordinates of points which satisfy the
spheroidal equation, the expressions for the tangents of the angles
of reciprocal azimuths of two stations, and forms the accurate ex
pression for the tangent of the sum of azimuths, and for the tangent
of the excess of this sum above the sum of corresponding spherical
azimuths.    The expression is then cautiously reduced, and it is
found, at length, that the value of this excess is insensibly small;
amounting only to 0"-000003 x mºn, where m is the number of de
grees in the distances of the stations, and n the number of degrees
in the difference of latitude.     Then the influence of difference of
heights is computed; and it is shown that, though (in cases which
may arise in practice) it is greater than what has just been found,
yet that it also will be insensible.
   At the close of the meeting, Mr. De Morgan made some remarks
upon the Gregorian Calendar, as an instrument for determining the
moon's phases with sufficient accuracy to settle the question of
moonlight.    Having been led to examine it in this point of view, for
the purposes of a collection of almanacs which he is preparing for
publication (and which has since been published), he found that it
may be made to give the day of new moon or of full moon right in
three cases out of five, and with an error of only one day in almost
in all
    the other cases; the error      two days occurring only about once
                                              of

                                                                     of

moon.    Now, half a lunation being, on the average, 14; days, it
follows that, unless the mean new moon happen in the first quarter
of its day, the mean full moon is on the sirteenth day; so that, in
the long run, the sixteenth is the proper day three times out of four.

 determine the astronomical full moon; which is as correctly deter

     “This   theorem, however, fails totally when the minor axis of
 the oval is small.      It is then found that the velocity of progress of
 the  apses   is  nearly proportional to the minor axis.            But, although
 the movement of the        pendulum     in this case    may    be defined to any
 degree of accuracy by infinite series, it does not appear that it can
 be expressed in finite terms of any ordinary function of the time.

to justify the belief that it might not only indicate the direction, but
measure the angular value of the deviation of the pendulum plane
from the meridian.      Computing this value for an hour to be 12°-H,
we watched the result and found the arc passed over to be 13°. When
this observation was recorded, the pendulum was supposed to have
commenced its vibrations on a north and south line; but that was
an error; it was really swung from east to west.
   In repeating this experiment, I have been more anxious to vary
the conditions, in a few arranged observations, than to accumulate
many similar results. We have observed in four azimuthal planes;
one of our balls weighed eight pounds, the other twenty pounds:
one was an oblate, the other a prolate spheroid; suspension was
effected at first by thoroughly softened catgut, afterwards by un
twisted silk: we have compared small and large arcs, counted the
periodical times of vibration in three planes, noted the direction of
motion in the elliptic path of the pendulum, and estimated the
length of            its
              minor axis. We have recorded results when          ellip                                                    no

  When this experiment was recorded                                                 I   had but slight expectation
of being able to apply a correction to results which were so largely
influenced by elliptical motion.    While making it my attention was
mainly directed to the rather difficult task of correctly estimating the
minor axis of the ellipse (the most important of the elements for de
termining             its
              rotatory effect), and    only twice recorded the length

   After many failures the apparatus became tolerably efficient, with
a pendulum of 68-7 inches, as deduced from the vibrations, 22:64 in
a minute.   The balls used were a prolate spheroid weighing 64 lbs.,
and a globe weighing only 11%lb.      I have obtained the best results
with the smaller weight.     The suspensions have been silk, gutta
percha, and various contrivances of points and sockets of agate, brass
and steel. The best results have been obtained with gutta percha,
and sockets of agate and steel. The arc mostly used was from 16
to 20 inches. The experiments were seldom continued beyond half
an hour. By that time the chord of vibration was reduced to about
7 or 8 inches, and the errors of experiment were thought likely to be
too great, with so short a radius, if longer continued.  The ball, in
whatever direction swung, presents the same face to the same side
of the room.

differ essentially from muscular fibre, whether striped           organic                               or

    7. “On the Reproduction of the Ascaris Mystaw."              By Henry
Nelson, M.D. Communicated by Allen Thomson, M.D., F.R.S.
Received May 22, 1851.
    The author commences with a brief anatomical description of the
Ascaris Mystar, found in the intestinal canal of the Domestic Cat;
with more especial reference to the organs of generation in the two
sexes. He traces the gradual formation of the semen; originally
thrown off as seminal particles by the caecal extremity of the tubular
testicle, the exterior of each solid particle enlarges to constitute a
cell, while the interior retains                      its
                                        consistency and forms       nucleus.                            a

    As soon as the vitelline granules and germinal vesicle have dis
appeared, the whole interior of the chorion is filled with a clear fluid,
in which a few granules and the germinal spot are seen to remain.
By swelling up this constitutes the embryonic vesicle and spot. A
membrane separates from the interior of the chorion, and contracting
on the granules forms a spherical yolk, in the centre of which is the
embryonic vesicle. This is the perfect ovum.             The subsequent di
visions of the    embryonic     spot, vesicle and   yolk  are described; the
author   particularly  pointing   out the   gyrations  of the embryonic ve
sicle  immediately    after division.    As soon as the whole interior of
the egg has been filled by the subdivisions of the yolk, the external
granules coalesce and form a continuous membrane internal to the
chorion, which by gradual depression on one of                sides forms first                   its

same aspect as the obscure train          produced by the cloud in a very
different   region   of the   sky.   They   were distinguished from it how
ever    by  their  size,  which was much less; each extended only a
degree in diameter.        They were displaced in a perceptible manner
toward the     south-east,   in proportion as the sun declined toward the
horizon.      They   continued to be visible at least two hours, to my
companions as to me.           But we knew not to what cause to attribute       .
them.      No perceptible obstacle in the immense panorama which we
commanded could produce shadows in their direction, and serve thus
to explain their presence.
    The disposition of the atmospheric vapours in layers, may some
times engender appearances which are confounded with those of
shadows.        Long observation, and the variations of tint of the dark
bands, serve to avoid the error.         An example of these false shadows
was presented to me two days after from the plateau of the Barillette.
 A few minutes before sunset, the ground of the sky assumed a very
 marked gray colour, trenched upon by three horizontal bands tole
rably long, of a more leaden colour, and which converged toward the
 east. These bands, which would have presented an inverse distribu
 tion if they had been parts of the space destitute of light, became
 gradually of a bright rose colour a few minutes after the twilight
 came on. They were therefore only formed by a slight haze, sus
 pended at a great height in the atmosphere.—Bibliothèque Univer

 ON   THE ARTIFICIAL FORMATION OF CORUNDUM AND DIASPORE
           BY THE WET METHOD.            B.Y. M. H. DE SENARMONT.
     Not long since I laid before the Academy         some experiments upon
 the artificial  production    of several kinds of minerals by the wet me
 thod, under the combined influences of heat and great pressure ; and
 I endeavoured to explain in this manner the formation of a peculiar
 class of metalliferous deposits, principally formed from liquid agents.
     Various minerals belong to another class of deposits where the
 influence of gaseous agents appears to have predominated, where
 water, which has played an important part in these phaenomena, must
 have acted principally in the state of vapour. It must not, however,
 be expected that we should find a well-marked line of demarcation
 between these two kinds of formations.              Those substances which
 mineralize thermal       waters,   frequently   perhaps  spring from depths
 below the earth's surface in the form of volatile      compounds;   the liquid
 and   gaseous,   agents   have been   present  in very  variable proportions,
 and the phaenomena musthave presented numerous intermediate stages
 between their two extreme limits. It is moreover very difficult, even
  in a chemical point of view, to imagine the action of water to be very
  different when filling the same space in the state of a very strongly
  heated liquid, or when saturating it in the state of vapour under enor
  mous pressure.
     Numerous kinds of minerals must therefore be formed, almost             in
  differently, under one or the other of these conditions.

   If a hydrochloric solution of an oxide of the formula R* O° or
RO2 be strongly heated, the acid, even when in excess, becomes free
in the solution, and the oxide is separated. The complete precipi
tation moreover corresponds to a temperature which appears to de
pend upon the state of dilution and the excess of acid present.            In
this manner I have obtained the sesquioxides of iron and chromium
and titanic and stannic acids, in a pulverulent, amorphous and an
hydrous state; the latter alone presenting traces of crystallization.
Alumina, on the other hand, crystallizes, under favourable circum
stances, in the anhydrous state in the form of corundum, and in the
hydrated state in the form of diaspore. The corundum obtained by
heating a dilute solution of hydrochlorate of alumina to a tempera
ture which must exceed 662°F., is a white crystalline sand, which
scratches the emerald when pressed between two polished plates. It
is insoluble in acids, unalterable by heat, and under the microscope
is seen to be uniformly composed of minute, very distinct, almost
cubic rhombohedra; they are usually perfect, and more rarely modi
fied by truncatures tangential to the culminating angles, perfectly
transparent, and acting regularly upon polarized light. These rhom
bohedric crystals are often accompanied by others, elongated, and in
thin layers, the lateral boundary of which is terminated by two pa
rallel right lines, and towards each extremity by two obtuse symme
trical beveled lines. Like corundum, they are insoluble in acids,
but when heated they become changed, and then some of the alu
mina is dissolved by sulphuric acid; which singular property M. Da
mour detected in diaspore.         In the natural state they are transpa
rent, act strongly upon polarized light; and their neutral lines are,
one parallel and the other perpendicular to their greatest length.
We may convince ourselves, by the aid of the camera lucida, that
the plane obtuse angle of the terminal slopes is nearly equal to 115
degrees. All these characters are those of diaspore, in layers parallel
to the plane of cleavage, and there can be no doubt that the prismatic
crystals belong to this species.
   It is worthy of remark, that the natural diaspore almost always
accompanies corundum in         its various repositories; and this associa
tion  is also one    ofthe  geological   proofs which every means   of   arti
ficial production    aiming    at imitating   the processes of  nature must
satisfy.

precipitated    toassume   a  regular   structure.    This separation may     be
retarded   by rendering    the liquid  very  acid;  but then

                                                     to the present some
of the first minds in Germany, France and England have been de
voted to the investigation of this subject. One of the most import
ant aspects of the inquiry is the relation which subsists between
magnetism and diamagnetism. Are the laws which govern both
forces identical ? Will the mathematical expression of the attrac
tion in the one case be converted into the expression of the re
pulsion in the other by a change of sign from positive to negative :
    The conclusions arrived at by Plücker in this field of inquiry
are exceedingly remarkable and deserving of attention.                 His
first paper, “On the relation of Magnetism and Diamagnetism,”
is dated from Bonn, September 8, 1847, and will be found in
Poggendorff’s Annalen and in Taylor's Scientific Memoirs.               He
sets out with the question, “Is it possible, by mixing a mag
netic substance with a diamagnetic, so to balance the opposing
forces that an indifferent body will be the result” This ques
tion he answers in the negative.        “The experiments,” he writes,
“ which I am about to      describe,   render it necessary that every
thought of the kind should be abandoned.”
    One of these experiments will serve as a type of the whole,
and will show the foundation on which the negative reply of

Dr. Tyndall     on Diamagnetism      and Magnecrystallic Action.         167
  During an investigation on the magneto-optic properties of
crystals*, which      I
                    had the pleasure of conducting in connexion
with Professor Knoblauch,       I
                               had repeated opportunities of ob
serving phaenomena exactly similar to those observed by M.
 Plücker with the cherry-tree bark; but a close study of the sub
ject convinced me that the explanation of these phaenomena by
no means necessitated the hypothesis of two forces acting in the
 manner described.    Experiment further convinced me, that a
 more delicate apparatus than the balance used by M. Plücker
 would be better suited to the measurement of such feeble mani
festations   of force.
  An   exact acquaintance with electro-magnetic attractions ap
peared to be a necessary discipline for the successful investiga
tion of diamagnetic phaenomena; and pursuing this idea, an
inquiry was commenced last November into the action of an
electro-magnet upon masses of soft iron.       I was finally led to
devote  my entire attention to the attraction of soft iron spheres,
and the results obtained were so remarkable as to induce me to
devote a special memoir to them alonet.
   In this investigation it was proved, that a ball of soft iron,
separated by a small fixed distance from the pole of an electro
magnet, was attracted with a force exactly proportional to the
square of the exciting current.       Now this attraction is in each
case the product of two factors, one of which represents the mag
netism of the magnet, and the other the magnetism of the ball.
For example, if the magnetism of the magnet of any given mo
ment be represented by the number 4, and that of the ball by 3,
the attraction, which is a consequence of their reciprocal action,
is represented by the number 12.          If we now suppose the mag
netism of the      magnet   to be doubled by a current of double
strength, the ball will have        its
                                    magnetism also doubled, and the
attraction resulting will    be expressed         by
                                                the number 48. Thus
we see that     adoubling  of the  power      of
                                              the magnet causes four
            attraction;
                                                                           in as
times the                 and that while the attraction increases
the square      the current, the magnetism
                of                                     of
                                                   the ball increases
 the simple ratio    of
                      the current itself.

thus cleared. We know the law according               which the magnet

                                              have   simply       to

diagonally opposite to each other, and through each a helix of
copper wire was introduced and wedged fast.       Each helix con
tained a core of soft iron, which was  pushed  so far forward that
a line parallel to the sides of the box through which the helices
entered, and bisecting the other two sides, was a quarter of an
inch distant from the interior end of each core. The distance
between the two interior ends was six inches, and in this space
a little beam of light wood was suspended.     At the ends of the
beam two spoon-shaped hollows were worked out, in which a
pair of small balls could be conveniently laid. The beam rested
in a paper loop, which was attached to one end of a fine silver
wire. The wire passed upward through a glass tube nearly
three fect in length, and was connected at the top with a torsion
head.   The tube was made fast in a stout plate of glass, which
was laid upon the box like a lid, and thus protected the beam
from currents of air. A floor of Bristol board was fixed a little
below the level of the axes of the cores, the “board’ being so cut
as to   to fit
         close      the helices: the two corners

the point which      I
                    have already reached, when I learned that a
memoir on diamagnetism by M. Edmond Becquerel had ap
peared in the May number of the Annales de Chimie et de Phy
sique.    In this memoir the views of Plücker are also contro
verted, and a number of experiments are adduced to prove the
identity of the laws which regulate magnetic attraction and dia
magnetic repulsion. The argument employed by M. Becquerel
is the same in principle as that furnished by the foregoing ex
periments. He proves that the repulsion of bars of bismuth,
sulphur and wax, increases as the square of the exciting current,
and that the attraction of a little bar of iron follows the same
law. We have both been guided in our inquiries by the same
fundamental thought, though our modes of carrying out the
thought are different.
     Ihave observed many phaenomena, which, without due con
 sideration, would lead us directly to Plücker's conclusions; a few
of these     I
             will here describe.   The bismuth balls were placed
upon the beam, and one core was excited; on the top of the ball
opposite, a particle of iron, not the twentieth part of a common
pin-head in size, was fixed.    A current of 10° circulated in the
helix, and the beam came to rest at the distance of 4° from the
zero of the under graduation.                 I
                                     then permitted the current to
increase gradually. The magnetism of the iron particle and the
diamagnetism of the bismuth rose of course along with              but                        it,
the latter triumphed;     the beam was     repelled, and finally came
                                                                 a 9°
to rest against   stop which was placed
                     a                          distant.
   The particle      of
                    iron was removed, and        small crystal    car                         of
bonate   ofiron put        inplace; itscurrent    a  15° circulated     of                           in
                                                                                 it 3°
the helix, and the beam came          rest     about
                                              to         distant from
                                                             at
zero. The current was raised gradually, but before        had reached
30° diamagnetism conquered, and the beam receded              the stop                   to
as before.
     Thinking that this apparent triumph         diamagnetism might
                                                                 of

exactly proportional      the square
                               to         the exciting currents.
   Thinking also that certain reciprocal action between the bis

muth and the crystal, when both were placed together         the mag                     in

distant from zero.                          The current was now gradually raised, but
when  it reached 35° the beam receded and was held firmly
against the stop. When the circuit was broken it left the stop,
and, after some oscillations, came to rest at zero.
   These experiments seem fully to bear out the notion of
Plücker.     In each case we waited till both forces were in equi
librium; and it might be thought that if the forces followed the
same law, the beam ought not to move.               Let us, however, clear

   The spheres         calcareous spar were placed upon the beam,

and the latter was exactly balanced.       The index above was                                                  so
placed, that when the beam came         rest, the attached glass fibre
                                                                     to

board underneath.      Two dots were placed upon the glass cover,
about the fiftieth                    of   an
                          inch asunder, and the fibre was observed
through the interval between them.            The beam was about
4  inches below the   cover,   and parallax  was thus avoided.     On
exciting both cores the balls receded, the index above was softly
turned against the recession, till the fibre was brought once more
into exact coincidence with the fine black line, and the torsion
necessary      effect this was read off upon the graduated circle
                          to

        The repulsion                 of   the spheres was measured                        in   four different

   Each of the helices which surrounded the cores was composed
of two isolated wires; the four ends of these could be so com
bined that the current could pass through both at the same time,
as if they were a single wire, or it could be caused to traverse
one wire after the other.    The first arrangement was advan
tageous when a small exterior resistance was an object to be
secured, the second when the force of the battery was such as to
render exterior resistance to a certain extent a matter of indif
ference.          above experiments the first arrangement was
                 In the
adopted.   Before commencing, however,      had taken fresh acid      I
and freshly amalgamated zinc cylinders, so that the battery was
in good condition. The second arrangement was adopted, that
is,the current was allowed     traverse one wire after the other,

The index was then turned in a direction opposed to the attrac

expresses the attraction. The crystal was first placed so that                                                      its

of the corroboration.
    Faraday has discovered, that if a bismuth crystal be suspended
in the magnetic field, it will set itself so that a line perpendicular
to the plane of most eminent cleavage will be axial; this line he
calls the magnecrystallic axis of the crystal.          In the memoir

   Here again the torsion-balance furnishes              with the direct           us
proof       of
          this affirmation. Two cubes                                 of

     A  comparison of both tables shows us that the line which
 stands equatorial in the magnetic field is most strongly repelled
 upon the torsion-balance, exactly as in the case of the crystal;
 the repulsion in the direction of this line and in a direction per
 pendicular to the same being nearly in the ratio of 3: 2. Similar
 experiments were made with cubes of powdered carbonate of
 iron. The line of compression in the magnetic field stood axial;
 and when laid upon the torsion-balance, the mass in the direc
 tion of this line was attracted most strongly.

Mr. Thomson, would certainly bear suspicious resemblance            a
the conclusion that part      greater than the whole.
                                  a              is    This result
has been  entirely unsought.   The models were constructed with

Dr. Tyndall on Diamagnetism and Magnecrystallic Action.                                    183
the view of establishing the general fact, that the repulsion in
the line of compression is greatest.     That this has fallen out in
the manner described is a     pure accident.    I have no doubt what
ever that models might be made in which this difference of action
would be double of that exhibited by the crystal.
   The case, however, is not yet free from suspicion; the gum
water with which it is necessary to bind the powder may possibly
exert some secret influence. When isinglass or jelly is com
pressed, we know that it exhibits optical phaenomena similar to
those exhibited by crystals; and the squeezing of the metallic
dough may induce a kind of crystalline structure on the part of
the gum sufficient to produce the phaenomena observed.
   An experiment to which                  I
                                   was conducted by the following
accident will set this doubt, and I believe all other doubts re
garding the influence of compression, completely at rest. Having
repeated occasion to refer to the deportment of crystals in the
magnetic field, so as to be able to compare this deportment with
the attraction or repulsion of the entire mass upon the torsion
balance, through the kindness of Professor Magnus, the great
electro-magnet of the University of Berlink was placed in the
room where       I
                 experimented.     One morning a cube of bismuth
was suspended between the moveable poles, and not knowing
the peculiarities of the instrument, I chanced to bring the poles
too near each other.      On closing the circuit, the principal clea
vage of the crystal receded to the equator. Scarcely however was
this attained, when the poles were observed moving towards each
other, and before           I
                         had time to break the circuit, they had
rushed together and caught the crystal between them. The
pressure exerted squeezed the cube to about three-fourths of                                its
former thickness, and         immediately occurred         me that the to
theory      proximity,           it it
                               were true, ought        tell here. The

with the same unvarying result; the line of compression always
stood equatorial, and it was a matter of perfect indifference
whether this line was the magnecrystallic axis or not. The ex

surfaces; between the plates thus obtained various pieces of bis

 Dr. Tyndall on Diamagnetism and Magnecrystallic Action.                                                                   185
      Looking back to Tables IX. and X., we            see that the line
which was there most strongly repelled is here repelled most
feebly, and vice versd, the change being due to compression.
      I
      have been careful to make similar experiments with sub
stances concerning whose amorphism there can be but little
doubt. A very convenient substance for showing the influence
of compression is the white wax used in candles. The substance
is diamagnetic.     A little cylinder of the wax suspended in the
                                                  its of its
magnetic field set with         axis equatorial.         was then placed                       It
between two stout     pieces     glass   and  squeezed      thin       six                             as            as

length, which coincided with the axis            the previous cylinder,             of
axial, and           its
                shortest dimension      equatorial.
   The plate was then cut into little squares, these were laid one
upon the other and then pressed together                 compact cubical                      to   a
mass.     Two such cubes were placed upon the torsion-balance,
and the repulsions       the line       compression, and

    Preserving the current constant at 50°, the index of the tor
sion-head was turned gently against the repulsion, and in this
way the ball was caused slowly to approach the magnet.        The
repulsion continued until the glass fibre of the beam pointed to
2°; here an attractive force suddenly manifested itself, the ball
passed speedily on to contact with the core end, to separate it
from which a torsion of 50° was requisite.
    The circuit was broken and the beam allowed to come to rest
at zero, a space of about T'ath of an inch intervening between
the ball and the end of the magnet; on closing the circuit the
beam was attracted.      The current was once more interrupted,
and the torsion-head so arranged, that the beam came to rest at
3° distant; on establishing the current again the beam was re
pelled.   Between 0° and 3° there was a position of unstable
equilibrium for the beam; from this place to the end of the
magnet the attraction was triumphant, beyond this place repul
sion prevailed.
    Here we see, that on approaching the pole, the attraction of
the magnetic particle mounts much more speedily than the re
pulsion of the diamagnetic ball; a result the reverse of that ar
rived at by M. Plücker, but most certainly coincident with that
which everybody who has studied electro-magnetic attractions
would expect.      Shall we therefore conclude that ‘magnetism’
increases more   quickly  than “ diamagnetism f° The experiment
by no means justifies so wide a generalization. If magnetism be
limited to the attraction of soft iron, then the above conclusion
would be correct; but it is not so limited.     Plücker calls the
 attraction of his watch-glass magnetism, the attraction of a salt
 of iron bears the same name, and it so happens that the attrac
 tion of a salt of iron on approaching the poles increases incom
 parably more slowly than the attraction of iron itself. The proof
of this remarkable fact I will now proceed to furnish.
   From one end of a very fine balance a sphere of soft iron, 4th
of an inch in diameter, was suspended.    Underneath, and about
#th of an inch distant from the ball when the balance stood
horizontal, was the flat end of a straight electro-magnet.    On
sending a current of 30° through the surrounding helix, the
ball was attracted, and the force necessary to effect a separation
was measured: it amounted to 90 grammes.         A plate of thin
window-glass was then placed upon the end of the magnet, and
the ball allowed to rest upon      The weight necessary
                                               it.           effect                       to
                                                                     of by
a separation, when the magnet was excited      the same current,
amounted       to   1   gramme.         Here         an   interval           about   ºrth      of   an
inch was sufficient        to
                           reduce the attractive force                         to   ºth   of    that
exerted   in   the case of contact.

the iron ball, was laid upon one end of the torsion-balance; the op
posite core was excited by a current of 30°, and the force necessary
to effect  a separation of the core and the sphere was determined:
it amounted to 20° of torsion. The same plate of glass used in
the last experiment was placed against the core end, and the
force necessary to effect a separation from it with a current of
30° was also determined.       The difference, which in the case of
the soft iron amounted to ##ths of the primitive attraction, was
here scarcely appreciable.     At a distance of ºrth of an inch the
sphere of sulphate of iron was almost as strongly attracted as
when in immediate contact.
   Similar experiments were made with a pellet of carbonate of
iron, and with the same result. At a distance of 4th of an inch
the attraction was two-thirds of that exerted in the case of con
tact. An interval of roºmth of an inch is more than sufficient
to effect a proportionate diminution in the case of soft iron.
   A salt of iron in the immediate neighbourhood of the poles
behaves like iron itself at a considerable distance, and the de
portment of bismuth is exactly similar. A slight change of po
sition will make no great difference of attraction in the one case
or of repulsion in the other.       To make the antithesis between
magnetism and diamagnetism perfect, we require a yet undisco
vered metal, which shall bear the same relation to bismuth, an
timony, sulphur, &c., which iron does to a salt of iron.         Whe
ther nature has such a metal in store for the enterprizing phy
sicist, is a problem on which I will hazard no conjecture.
           Principal Results of the foregoing Investigation.
    1. The repulsion of a diamagnetic substance placed at a fired
distance from the pole of a magnet is governed by the same law as
the attraction of a magnetic substance.
   2. The entire mass of a magnetic substance is most strongly at
tracted when the attracting force acts parallel to that line which sets
arial when the substance is suspended in the magnetic field; and the
entire mass of a diamagnetic substance is most strongly repelled
when the repulsion acts parallel to the line which sets equatorial in
the magnetic field.                          -
   3. The superior attraction and repulsion of the mass in a par
ticular direction is due to the fact, that in this direction the mate
rial particles are ranged more closely together than in other direc
tions; the force eaerted being attractive or repulsive according as
the particles are magnetic or diamagnetic.       This is a law appli
cable to matter in general, the phanomena ea hibited by crystals in
the magnetic field being particular manifestations of the same.

  192               Mr. P. J. Martin                          on the         Anticlinal Line of
 abundantly apparent      that the same causes have produced the
  same effects in the whole course of our line, as regards these
  surface-phaenomena, two circumstances have conspired to give a
  broader aspect and a more decided character to them in that part
  of it which is generally called the “denudation of the Weald.”
     First, the greater violence of disruptive force in that part of
 it; and secondly, the greater variety in the strata there exposed,
 and their greater tenacity and durability, as compared with the
 more ductile and friable chalk.
    A description of the cross-fractures and drainage of the Weald
 was begun by myself in 1828, continued in the foregoing memoir
 in 1840, and prolonged by Mr. Hopkins, in illustration of his
 “Theory of Elevation” (Geol. Trans. vol. vii.). I accept Mr.
 Hopkins's description of the structure of the Weald, as a faith
 ful representation of some of     most prominent features; and   its
                     add anything

stones, flexures in clays.   Both Dr. Mantell and Mr. Hopkins
have observed    perpendicular  faults of great magnitude in the
Hastings sands.     There are many minor ones in my own neigh
bourhood, in the lower greensand; and there are some remark
able downcasts along the Surrey Hills. I will here describe one
of them. Where the traces of the Peasemarsh anticlinal are lost
near Albury, a line of disturbance takes off in a north-easterly
direction, through the chalk between Shere and Horseley. The
farms in the Ordnance Map of Pobley, Green-dean and Pots

Ordnance Map, it is to be observed that there is a very remark
able valley   separating the broad expanse of lower greensand
country in the neighbourhoods of Maidstone and of Sevenoaks,
into two groups: I shall call it the valley of Plaxtole, from the
village of that name.      Here all the thick and tenacious beds of
the  Kentish-rag,   as well as the upper beds of the greensand, have
been swept clean away, so that the drainage from the country
up to the foot of the chalk hills, above Ightham and Rotham
(through which this fissure does not appear to extend), is brought
down by a rivulet running in the bottom of the valley, due south
toward the Medway, near Tunbridge.             The escarpments of this
valley are anticlinal; and there            unless        is,

Plaxtole    to Crouch, tilted westward, and giving undeniable
testimony       the extraordinary swell

Another remarkable instance           this sort of   anticlinal may    of                                 be
seen  in   aridge   running   north and south between Wotton and

palaeontology  is a passion, and whose indomitable ener
triumphs over the difficulties of position and infirmities of health,
and makes himself the object of our own “especial wonder”—
from the commanding points of this elevation, we look north and
south over the long ranges of longitudinal flexures, and observe
that the most strongly marked and most influential of these are
the most distant; they lift the chalk downs on either side and
regulate their position. The strong flexure of the Hogsback is
propagated from Farnham eastwards in a strong line of elevation,
at least as far as Sevenoaks”; and it is more than matched by
the Greenhurst line, which, with little intermission, regulates the
escarpment of the South Downs from Beachy Head to the borders
of Hampshire. If we advance further west and take our stand
at Itchingfield or Five Oaks, we find that we are still within the
range of the same disruptive courses; and looking west from
thence, we see in the profile of the country before us, and at
twelve miles distance, the passage of the central line of elevation
through the lower greensand, in the shape of a valley of eleva
tion at Haslemere, flanked by the bold eminences of Black Down
on the south and Hindhead on the north.

Burghclere Hills, and the anticlinal vales of Pewsey and Kings

   These experiments, very tedious and difficult to conduct, do
not appear to indicate any particular law.
   Much in this department of electricity appears yet to be done
before we are able to define the laws of conduction, and there
are many difficulties to be encountered.   It is almost impossible
to get wire of any  length of equal thickness and texture.   It is
also not easy always to obtain the same connexions, and the least
variation in this respect vitiates the experiments.  Some of the
anomalies in the tables are to be traced to these causes.
   A  difference of temperature also, it appears, will affect con
duction.     Even bending the wire with so delicate an instrument
as the torsion galvanometer will affect the experiment; and
twisting will alter          its
                       powers permanently,

     HOSPHORUS,      a substance abundantly diffused throughout
       the animal. wererable, and mineral kingdom, is obtained
by processes which, although they have undergone many altera
tions and improvements during nearly two centuries, are still
troublesome, expensive and difficult. According to M. Hellot's
method, the description of which occupies many pages in the
Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences, 1737. in order to obtain
one ounce of phosphorus we must submit to the tedious and dis
gusting process of evaporating nearly three hogsheads of putrid
urine. Dolfuss, who was more successful, obtained but 54 grains
from 100 pints.     Henckel first and Marggraff afterwards, by
adding plumbum corneum to urine evaporated to thickness after
being allowed to putrify for two months, procured two ounces
and a half of phosphorus from nine or ten pounds of the inspis
sated matter: by this improvement the product was doubled,

          M. Donovan     on the Preparation     of Phosphorus.       203
By the distillation of the phosphoric acid with charcoal, Wiegleb
obtained ten drachms and a half of phosphorus from two pounds
of bone-ashes.     In the hands of Dolfuss, the same quantity of
bone-ashes    furnished rather less than five drachms.          Pelletier
sometimes obtained so much as 34 ounces, and sometimes but
half that quantity from two pounds of bone-ashes.
                                                                  i.
   Although these methods may be thus epitomized, the prac
tical details are very troublesome.      It is not always easy to obtain
an adequate supply of bone-ashes.          So truly did Lagrange ap
preciate this difficulty, that in his instructions for burning
he directs as the first step that a brickwork one yard in diameter
and nine inches high shall be erected.          Others order a furnace
for the purpose, the chimney of which must necessarily be high,
in order to carry off the truly abominable fumes. When the
burnt bones are procured, the task of pulverizing and sifting
them, so that their substance shall be permeated and acted upon
by the sulphuric acid, is of no small labour, as the middle por
tions of the cylindrical bones are exceedingly hard. The wash
ing out of the phosphoric acid from the voluminous, pasty, and
somewhat tenacious sulphate of lime, is troublesome ; for much
of the acid obstinately adheres.       If the sequel of the process be
to obtain the acid in the solid  state,  the evaporation of the various
washings to dryness is exceedingly tedious.           But when lead is
employed to engage the phosphoric acid from the washings, the
resulting phosphate of lead is so bulky, so retentive of water,
and by the ordinary means so difficult to dry, that the increased
quantity of phosphorus procurable in this way scarcely compen
sates the trouble and loss of time.         Beside all this there is an
other   defect;  the precipitate, whether obtained from acetate or
nitrate of lead, contains lead in some state different from the
phosphate, more in the case of the former salt than of the latter,
and thus, during the distillation, the retort is partly occupied
with an unproductive material. The acid liquor, beside phos
phate of lime, always contains a little sulphate of lime, great in
proportion to the quantity of water used in the washing; and
this gives origin to sulphate of lead, which not only uselessly
occupies the retort, but by suffering decomposition, during the
distillation with charcoal, evolves sulphur; and this inquinates
the phosphorus produced to a certain extent.
    The precipitation of acetate or nitrate of lead by fresh urine,
 and the distillation of the precipitate with charcoal, might to
 some persons appear a convenient and simple process when large
 supplies of urine can be procured at once, as in barracks, hos
 pitals, or prisons. But the advantage is far from being so great
 as it appears; for there are other substances present besides
 phosphates, which will afford precipitates with salts of lead.         In

   With regard to the quantity of earthy salts contained in harts
horn, few analyses have been made.       Dr. Pearson calcined his
hartshorn-shavings to a brown colour, and obtained 54% per cent.
Neumann, who only tried the tops of the horns, recovered 60 pounds
of black caput mortuum from 100 pounds. Many trials gave
me an average of 62 per cent. when the shavings were burnt to
whiteness.   These white ashes consist almost entirely of phos
phate of lime; and it appears that hartshorn by calcination
returns at least twice as much phosphate of lime as fresh bones.
The horns of a fallow-deer will weigh about 13 pound.
   These different forms of bones and horns present us with
phosphate of lime in states which possess different advantages:
some hold out the inducement of cheapness; some of facility in
employing them:                 allthem answer the purpose.

   After the nitrous solution of the earthy salts has been obtained,
the next step is to detach from it the phosphoric acid. This can
be done in the usual manner by a salt of lead. Chloride of lead,
although successful in the process of Henckel and Marggraff,
does not answer here; for a boiling solution of it added to the
nitrous solution does not produce any precipitation; and chloride
of lead crystallizes as the mixture cools. Nor will nitrate of
lead occasion a precipitate; for the phosphate of lead, if it be
formed at all in this case, remains in solution in the free nitric
acid. Acetate of lead answers the purpose perfectly: if a solu
tion of it be poured into the nitrous solution of phosphate of
lime, phosphate of lead precipitates instantly.
   It has been stated by Giobert that when acetate of lead is
poured into a solution obtained by acting on bone-ashes with di
lute sulphuric acid, the acetate is decomposed, not only by the
phosphoric acid, but, as he believes, by the water; and he adds,
that the precipitate not only contains phosphate of lead, but calx
of lead, which adds materially to      quantity.          its
                                                   He further states

                   of                    the same manner butin                                              in   a
less degree; and hence                      he

   The little village of Chipping lies near the bottom of the val
ley contained by the parallel ridges of Bowland Hills and Long
ridge Fell, which bound it on the north-west and south-east,
leaving it open to the sea in the south-west, while in the east
and north-east the horizon is terminated by Pendle Hill and the
Newton and Waddington Fells.                 It is watered by a brook to

                       name,    whose waters flow         general through      in                              a

distance between whose sources can scarcely                    more than two          be

   It now remains to describe the scene to which my attention
was principally directed, and which alone suffices to distinguish
this flood from all others that                             I

    The eastern side of Parlick, which rises to the height of about
1400 feet above the sea, presents an exceedingly steep ascent
richly clothed with fern. On this face of the hill seven huge
scars have been hollowed out by the water, varying from five to
                                                                   the hill;                          of

    From the account which has been given, it appears that the
 overflowing of Chipping brook was mainly attributable to the
 sudden discharge of a large volume of water on the side of Par
lick; that this discharge must have partaken somewhat of the
nature of a water-spout, and must have consisted of several
distinct discharges,                     all
                           contained within the space       about 150                            of

as the source whence   it is obtained; but when the minuteness
of the quantity is taken into account, the assimilation of nitrogen
by plants, though improbable, may certainly still be held an
open question.
     It is
        to the decomposition of the carbonic acid in the atmo
sphere that vegetables are mainly indebted for the carbon which
forms the basis of their structure. The proportion of carbonic
acid in the air in which different plants will thrive has engaged
the attention of many experimenters, and is still the subject of
investigation. This at least is clearly ascertained, that, unless
in strong sunshine, plants are destroyed by being placed in an
atmosphere of pure carbonic acid.
   The aqueous vapour in the air not only supplies hydrogen and
oxygen to the organized vegetable structure, but serves many
other purposes of a more physiological character.
   We proposed examining the growth of plants when exposed to
the action of gases that do not occur in the normal atmosphere,
or of the ordinary gases in very unusual proportions.
   Our first experiment was made with hydrogen gas. A pansy
was placed in an atmosphere consisting of 95 per cent of               hy
drogen and 5  per cent. of carbonic acid. The glass vessel in
which it was   confined had a capacity of 53 cubic inches.    It
was inverted  over water, so that connexion with the outer air
was entirely precluded, and yet there was very little surface of
water exposed to the artificial atmosphere within.  A little ad
ditional carbonic acid was introduced from time to time to re
place that absorbed by the liquid.      The plant when first experi
mented    upon had one blue flower in full bloom and one in the
bud; for the first ten days the bud was gradually opening; but
a slight mouldiness then came on, which increased during the
next fortnight, by which time the plant having drooped deci
dedly, it was thought unnecessary to prolong the experiment.
For the sake of comparison another pansy was placed in a glass
vessel filled with atmospheric air,      all
                                          other circumstances being
equal: the plant became mouldy          about the same period
                                        at                            as
                                                                    the
other; but the mould did not advance beyond the lower leaves,
and the plant continued healthy for weeks.
   Two flowering grass-plants (Poa annua) were placed            in
                                                                vessels
of the same character and capacity           asthe preceding experi
                                                  in
ment, and protected from the external air              in
                                                    the same manner.
The one vessel was filled with    pure  hydrogen    gas, the other with
common air.      The plants grew and appeared healthy for about
a fortnight, when mouldiness supervened            in
                                                 each instance.   Thus
                               hydrogen
                  no of
the substitution     unmixed               gas  for the normal atmo
sphere produced       visible alteration.
   The next experiment was with           mixture
                                          a             hydrogen and

plant would derive                  its
                        nutriment from the aqueous vapour, and
the carbonic acid produced           the respirationby    the flies, while        of
these   again  would feed   upon   the sugar;    and we should thus have
the same balance between the vegetable and animal kingdoms                                                as
obtains       nature, except that the animal would not feed upon

with the others. The pansy and the stock dried up and died in
the course of a day or two; but the grass-plant grew and seemed
healthy for several weeks, mouldiness only appearing on partially
decayed portions. We surmised that the deleterious effects of
this gas, which we as well as other experimenters had observed,
might be attributed to the phosphorus vapour which it always
contains when prepared by the usual method.        Accordingly, we
have   subsequently  employed  pure   nitrogen gas  evolved by the
mutual action of nitrite of  potash  and chloride of ammonium at
a high temperature. A pansy placed in this atmosphere under
a glass vessel of 54 inches capacity inverted over water, remained
flowering and vigorous for between two and three weeks.
   It is curious to remark the readiness with which mouldiness
grows in nitrogen gas. A receiver half-full of nitrogen happened
to be left standing over the pneumatic trough, and a bung was
floating on the surface of the water inside. In a few days' time
a white growth was observed upon the bung; and not on it only,
but also in patches over the surface of the water.       A bottle also
partially filled with the gas was standing inverted in ordinary
spring-water; the surface of the liquid inside was soon found
covered with small patches of mould, which continued to increase.
    A pansy and grass plant were placed in a receiver containing
 180 cubic inches of pure oxygen gas, inverted as usual over
water.    Both plants were in flower at the time of their intro
duction; they grew considerably taller, and the Poa showed
extraordinary luxuriance in fructification.     After about twenty
four days the grass became mouldy, and the pansy drooped a
short time afterwards.
   Two similar plants were placed under a receiver of similar
capacity, but filled with nitrous oxide.     In order to exclude the
external air, the glass vessel was inverted over water saturated at
the ordinary temperature with the same gas. The water how
ever gradually absorbed the nitrous oxide within, allowing it to
diffuse into the atmosphere without; thus the liquid rose in the
receiver, but it allowed of the continuation of the experiment for
two months, during which time no extraordinary effect upon
either plant was observable.      Davy records a trifling experiment
upon a sprig of mint, which, so               far

as sulphurous    acid or cyanogen, but that “its power is much
inferior.”    They  found that 23 cubic inches of carbonic oxide,
with five times the volume of air, had no apparent effect upon a
mignonette plant in twenty-four hours, but that it drooped
when removed from the abnormal atmosphere. We imagine that
the death of this plant must be ascribed to some other cause,
since we have kept a pansy in a healthy condition for four weeks
in 53 inches of pure carbonic oxide gas.
    It order to ascertain what effect different gases might have in
accelerating or retarding germination, and what compounds of
carbon were capable of affording nourishment to the young plant,
four onions just commencing to sprout were taken, weighed and
placed in vessels containing respectively carbonic acid, carbonic
oxide, coal-gas collected by displacement, and atmospheric air
containing eight per cent. of light carburetted hydrogen pre
pared by the decomposition by heat of an alkaline acetate. The
four vessels containing these bulbs were each capable of holding
53 to 54 cubic inches of gas, and were inverted over water as in
the previous instances.     The water employed to prevent access
of air to the vessel  containing the carbonic acid was itself satu
rated with the same gas; that employed for the hydrocarbons
was an alkaline solution, so as to absorb any carbonic acid which
might happen to be present in the gas, or which might be gene
rated by the growing root itself.   A comparative experiment was
made with another onion placed under a glass shade under similar
circumstances as to light, heat, &c., but open to the atmosphere.
The onions selected had each a plumule of about half an inch
in length, and the experiments extended through the months of
April, May, and June. The onions in the atmospheres contain
ing hydrocarbons grew rapidly, and put forth fresh roots.     After
thirty days the plants were taken out of the coal-gas and car
buretted hydrogen, as they had grown to the top of the vessels,
being at the time in a very healthy condition. The onion in air
grew, but not so fast.     Those placed in carbonic acid and car
bonic oxide stopped growing, and eventually became rotten. In
each instance they lost weight.
    In the early part of the year a crocus commencing to sprout
was placed in a jar containing 70 cubic inches of carbonic oxide
mixed with 100 cubic inches of atmospheric air, inverted over
alkaline water so as to absorb any carbonic acid that might be
formed. The rootlets of the bulb dipped into clear water. The
 crocus grew and put forth abundance of long leaves, but it never
 flowered.   After remaining in this state for fifteen weeks, the
 experiment was discontinued, and the bulb and plant were found
to weigh 285 grains, which was one grain less than at the com
 mencement of the experiment.        The gas within the receiver

decreased very much in volume, but was beginning to increase
again towards the close, when the plant was becoming unhealthy
in appearance.                                        -
     A
     precisely similar experiment was made with light carburetted
hydrogen prepared from the acetates in the place of the carbonic
oxide: the growth of the plant was similarly affected, but it
proved that this gas (at least in the proportion of seven parts of
carburetted hydrogen to ten of air) is not poisonous to the bulbous
rooted plant in question.   We have not performed any experi
ments with unmixed carburetted hydrogen or olefiant gas; it is
to be expected, however, that they would be found equally inno
cuous with carbonic oxide, hydrogen, and others which have been
examined.    Drs. Turner and Christison found no deleterious
effect in twenty-four hours from a mixture of 4} inches of olefiant
gas, with 100 times as much air. The action of gaseous hydro
carbons upon plants is a separate branch of inquiry, as it involves
the interesting question as to whether these gases are capable of
being assimilated or decomposed by the living organism of the
vegetable, and thus of contributing to     support.              its

other continental mathematicians, and because of the importance
of the geometrical and other applications of which it admits, and
of the inquiries to which it indirectly gives rise. We shall be
concerned in the following discussion with systems of homoge

present purposes                  I
                      propose to give the name of aggregative
functions, consisting of ordinary homogeneous functions of the

one sum made homogeneous by means of powers of new variables
entering factorially.

composable     into factors,  then it is evident that we must have
R=R'. R', and consequently that          the existence of such a parti
cular resultant as R' will argue the necessity of the existence of
another resultant R'; in other words, the resultant so found
cannot be in a strict sense the true and complete resultant for
the particular case assumed, and yet the process employed ap
pears to give the complete resultant, or at least it is difficult to
see how the wanting factor escapes detection.           To make this
matter more clear, take a particular and very simple case, where
m=2 n=2 p=2=0, so as to form the system of equations
             Aa2+ Bxy + Cy^+ (Da + Ey)2 =0).
             Alaº-H B'ry--Cy” + (D'a 4-Ey)2=            (C.)
                           la + my-H  m2          =0 }
    By virtue of my theorem, the degree of the resultant R' is
2(2+2+ 1)—3.          1 =7, but the resultant R of the system
         Aa”--Bay-H Cy” + (Da + Ey)2 +F2* =0
         Ala” + Bay-H Cy” + (D'w + Ey)2+F'2°=
                      lw-H my + m2                   =0º    (D.)
which becomes identical with the former when F=0, F=0 is of
 2 x 2+2 x 1 + 2 x 1, i.e. of 8 dimensions. Hence it is evident
 that when    F-0,    F =0, R must become R' x R".
    It will be found in fact, that on the supposition of F=0, F=0,
 R becomes equal to n x R'; and accordingly, besides the portion
 R’ of the resultant of system (C.), found by the method in the
 text, there is another portion n which has dropped through; but
 it may be asked, is n truly a relevant factor? were it not so, the
 theory of the resultant would be completely invalidated; but in
 truth it is ; for n=0 will make the equations in system (C.), con
 sidered as a particular case of system (D.), capable of coexisting; the
 peculiarity, which at first sight prevents this from being obvious,
 consisting in the fact that the values of      º, #  which satisfy the
 three equations when n=0 become infinite.
    Thus, finally, we have arrived at a clear and complete view of
 the relation of the particular to the general resultant.
    The general resultant may be zero, in which case the particular
 resultant is something altogether different from an ordinary re
 sultant; or the particular resultant may be a root of the general
 resultant, or it may be more generally the product of powers of
 the simple factors, which enter into the composition of the general
 resultant; or lastly, it may be an incomplete resultant, the fac
 tors wanting to make it complete being such as when equated to
  zero, will enable the components of the resultant to coexist, but

not for other than infinite values of certain of the ratios exist
ing between the variables.
   Without for the present further enlarging on the hitherto
unexplored and highly interesting theory of Particular Result
ants, I will content myself with stating one beautiful and general
theorem relating to them; to wit,        F=0, G=0, &c. be a       “if
given system of equations with the coefficients left general, and
R be the resultant of F, G, &c., and if now the coefficients in
F, G be so taken that R comes to contain as a factor or be coin
cident with R", then will R'=0 indicate that (when the coeffi
cients are so taken as above supposed) F =0, G=0, &c. will be
capable of being satisfied, not, as in general, by one only, but
by (m) distinct systems of values of the variables in F, G, &c.,
subject of course to the possibility, in special cases, of certain of
the systems becoming multiple coincident systems.”

the resultant of Ternary Aggregative Functions, that is to say

but not above half as strong. The galvanoscope was again low
ered with respect to the coil; the swing was now to C, and
powerful.    Finally, the galvanoscope was again lowered until
the needle stood in the same position with respect to the lower
end of the axis of the coil as it did at the commencement with
regard to the upper end; the swing was to C, and equally pow
erful with the corresponding swing to A.
   165. The coil was now arranged as usual with its axis hori
zontal, having that end which before pointed to the zenith now
directed to the needle of the galvanoscope.    The swing was to
A   when the steam passed.
   166. The pewter coil (29.) was supported in the same position
as in (165.), and so arranged that the fountain (77.) could easily
be connected with or removed from the coil.     The zinc screen
and  galvanoscope were used as in the foregoing experiments  with
steam; and the water-way of the cock of the fountain, which
was the passage of the least diameter through which the water
passed, was <U+017F>º inch across. Water was placed in the fountain
and made to boil, the air was then pumped in, and the fountain
was united with the coil.  On opening the cock of the fountain,
and so allowing the water to flow through the coil, the needle
started towards A, and the swing produced was about one-third
the length of the scale. The fountain was immediately removed,
rinsed out with cold water, charged again with cold water, and
then reunited with the coil which was still hot.   The cock of
the fountain now being opened, the swing was to C, and nearly
as strong as before.
   167. The iron core (131.) was placed in the coil. Hot water
now being sent through the coil produced a violent swing to A;
and then, while the coil was hot, sending cold water through it
produced nearly as strong a swing to C; in both instances the
needle vibrated across and considerably outside the field of view.
Sending cold water through, the coil also being cool, produced
no magnetic effect.
   168. These experiments show that the magnetism of the coils
is an effect of heat independent of condensation.
   169. A piece of stout copper wire, 4 feet 2 inches long and
# inch diameter, was covered by winding tape about
                                                           it; some
copper wire,    ºn inch diameter,  and covered,  was now wound out
side the tape, and the rounds lay nearly close together without
overlapping. The stout copper wire, having been thus covered
throughout     its
                 whole length, was next wound up into    a   helixof
eleven  convolutions,   which did not   overlap  each other, and the
internal diameter of the coil was 1-3 inch. The current from
a  galvanic battery being transmitted through the fine copper wire,
caused this compound helix     to  possess similar magnetic proper
tics  tothose  of the pewter  coils.

 difference of temperature between the exterior and interior sur
 faces of the tube, this difference of temperature being greater at
 those parts of the tube forming the exterior of the coil than at
those portions internally situated.   Now the difference of tem
perature will, from a thermo-electric action, throw the surfaces
into opposite electrical states, the intensity of which will vary
with the difference of temperature; consequently those parts of
the tube which have the greatest difference of temperature will
produce electricity, which will circulate by overcoming the resist
ance opposed by those parts where the difference of temperature
is less.   Suppose a small portion of pipe cut out from the coil
in the   shape of a right cylinder. Now looking at one end, which
gives an annulus, and bisecting this annular space, not the metal
 itself, by a straight line, and supposing that in one of the halves
 so obtained the difference of temperature is greater than in the
other half; then a chain of the metallic particles producing elec
tricity will cause the current to flow along the curved boundary of
the metal until it comes to a part where the difference of tempera
ture is less, and at this point it will more or less force         way across;          its

lines of equal magnetic intensity, follows at once from refer
ring terrestrial magnetism to the internal heat of the earth;
for where the climate is coolest, the difference of temperature
will be the greatest, and there the electric developments will be
more powerful.      This explanation of the cause of terrestrial
 magnetism is so far independent of the hypothesis used to ac
 count for the magnetism of the coils, that if the magnetism of
 the coils proceeds from the direct conversion of heat into mag
 metic force, then terrestrial magnetism results from a similar
 transformation.

   176. The foregoing experiment (174.) is decisive in showing
that the increase of electricity in such experiments as (95.) does
not result from the specific inductive capacity of cloud, which
can differ but little if at

     # inches.   When the cock of the boiler was opened, the steam
   struck on the lower side of the ball and passed thence to a wire
  gauze screen, placed at a distance of ten inches from the ball;
  this screen was connected with the two-leaved electrometer.
   Positive electricity passed very slowly to the screen; but on now
  allowing the steam to escape negatively electrified, the leaves of
  the electrometer almost immediately diverged to their full extent;
  on shutting off the steam, positive electricity began to pass about
  as slowly as before; again allowing the steam to play on the ball,
  the leaves diverged with positive electricity as previously, and
  these actions could be repeated a great many times.

 noise is being produced, is not sufficiently full and accurate.

5 sacral, and 18 caudal vertebrae.     The first to the fifth dorsal ver
tebrae are characterized by having the ordinary number of articular
processes (zygapophyses), two before and two behind; and by
having three articular surfaces for the ribs on each side, one on the
centrum, one on the neurapophysis, and one on the diapophysis.
The sixth dorsal vertebra has an accessory zygapophysis between
the posterior pair; the thirteenth dorsal has one between the anterior
pair; the seventh to the twelfth inclusive have the accessory median
zygapophysis between both the anterior and posterior pairs of the
ordinary zygapophyses.       The fourteenth and succeeding dorsals
 have no costal surface on the diapophysis or centrum.           The fif
teenth has both metapophysis and anapophysis—the latter with an
articular surface: the sixteenth superadds the parapophysis with an
articular facet.
    The lumbar vertebrae lose the costal surface on the centrum, and
retain the metapophyses, anapophyses and parapophyses.               The
 nature of these accessory processes was explained by reference to
 the descriptions and figures of the exogenous processes of vertebrae
 in Part I. of the present Memoir.
    The characteristics of the cervical vertebrae were next detailed.
    Of the five anchylosed sacral vertebrae, three are confluent with
 the iliac bones, and two with the ischia.
    The fourteen anterior caudals are characterized by articular sur
faces for haemapophyses.       These elements are separate from each
other in the first caudal, and confluent as usual at their distal ends,
forming a ‘chevron-bone’ in the others. The posterior zygapophy
ses lose their articular surfaces in the eleventh caudal; the anterior
ones disappear in the twelfth : the metapophyses have subsided in
the fifteenth.   The neural canal is unclosed above in the sixteenth ;
and the vertebra is reduced to its central element in the last two
caudals.
    The skull is remarkable for          its
                                      small proportional size, for    long             its
and slender cranial   portion,  its large  and  complex  zygomatic arches,
 its broad truncate facial part, with the slender produced premax
illaries, and for the great depth             of
                                        the middle     the lower jaw.

the acromion is expanded, produced and confluent with the coracoid;

    Only four digits are developed, the first             “pollex' being obso       or

 Diprotodon and Nototherium afford a similar contrast with the
 Kangaroos of Australia, and the towering Dinornis and Palapteryx
 with the small Apteryx of New Zealand.             But the comparatively
 diminutive aboriginal animals of South America, Australia and New
 Zealand, which are the nearest allies of the gigantic extinct species
 respectively characteristic of such tracts of dry land, are specifically
 distinct, and usually by characters so well marked as to require a
 subgeneric division, and such as no known or conceivable outward
 influences could have progressively transmuted.            Moreover, as in
  England, for example, our Moles, Water-voles, Weasels, Foxes and
 Badgers, are of the same species as those that co-existed with the
 Mammoth, Tichorrine Rhinoceros, Cave Hyaena, Bear, &c.; so like
 wise the remains of small Sloths and Armadillos are found associated
 with the Megatherium and Glyptodon in South America; the fossil
 remains of ordinary Kangaroos and Wombats occur together with
 those of gigantic herbivorous marsupials; and there is similar evidence
 that the Apteryx existed with the Dinornis: and the author offered
 the following suggestions as more applicable to or explanatory of the
 phenomena than the theory of transmutation and degradation. He
 observed, that in proportion to the bulk of an animal is the difficulty
 of the contest which, as a living being, it has to maintain against
 the surrounding influences which are ever tending to dissolve the
 vital bond and subjugate the organised matter to the ordinary che
 mical and physical forces.        Any changes, therefore, in the external
 circumstances in which a species may have been created to exist,
 will militate against that existence in probably a geometrical ratio
to the bulk of such species. If a dry season be gradually prolonged,
 the large mammal will suffer from the drought sooner than the
small one; if such alteration of climate affect the quantity of
vegetable food, the bulky Herbivore will first feel the effects of the
stinted nourishment; if new enemies are introduced, the large and
conspicuous quadruped or bird will fall a prey, whilst the smaller
species might conceal themselves and escape.            Smaller quadrupeds
are   usually, also, more   prolific than larger ones. The actual presence
therefore of small species of animals in countries where the larger
species of the same natural families formerly existed, is not to be
ascribed to any gradual diminution of the size of such larger animals,
but is the result of circumstances which may be illustrated by the
fable of the ‘oak and the reed'; the small animals have bent and
accommodated themselves to changes under which the larger species
have succumbed.

   With borax, M. Ebelmen formerly obtained microscopic crystals
-of alumina; the addition of a substance which gives a somewhat more
 difficult fusibility to the flux, as carbonate of baryta or silica, caused
 the production of beautiful crystals of alumina of the most splendid
 lustre.    These crystals had the form of a six-sided double pyramid,
appearing very considerably truncated on both summits, so that they
resembled the strongly flattened plates of iron-glance of the volcanoes.
The measurement of the angle between the lateral facets and the
base showed that it was identical with those of corundum.           This
artificial corundum scratched quartz and topaz easily.
   By using the phosphates as solvent, tantalic, niobic, and titanic
acids were obtained in crystals.     Titanic acid crystallizes from the
phosphate in long needles, the specific gravity of which is =4:283,
hence identical with rutile.
   All the artificial crystals which the author obtained have been
optically examined by him, and found, with the exception of those
belonging to the regular system, to exhibit the action upon polarized
light.—Comptes Rendus, vol. xxxii. p. 330–333.
FURTHER RESEARCHES UPON CRYSTALLIZATION BY THE DRY                            ME
                THOD.  B.Y. M. EBELMEN.
   In my former investigations, I employed as solvents for the ele
ments various fluxes which are volatile at high temperatures, such
as boracic acid, borax, and acid and alkaline phosphates.         It struck
me that some new series of compounds might be obtained by using
alkaline instead of acid fluxes, such as the carbonates of potash and
soda, which are so frequently employed in mineral analyses for dis
solving by the dry method those substances which are not acted
upon by acids.      These substances, like boracic acid, possess the
double property of assuming the liquid state at temperatures easily
produced in our furnaces, of dissolving a large number of metallic
oxides, and of becoming completely volatilized in open vessels at a
temperature slightly above that at which they undergo fusion.
   When a mixture of silica and magnesia, in such proportions as to
constitute the bisilicate, is exposed to a high temperature with bi
carbonate of potash, after the lapse of some days we obtain a per
fectly liquid vitreous mass, at the bottom of which very transparent
colourless crystals are formed.     These are easily separated from the
fused mass, by treating it with very weak acids and solution of
potash, which dissolves the glass without acting upon the crystals.
They are easily recognized as peridote. I have succeeded in mea
suring their angles. The facet g' is well-marked; the other facets
which I have detected are those of        eº,

in the same manner crystallized in cubes, the edges of which are
slightly truncated; the compound is slowly separated, by the action
of weak acids, from the vitreous matter in which it is formed ; its
density is -4° 10; it is identical with the mineral to which M. G.
Rose has given the name of Perowskite, which was first found in the
Ural, and more recently in the volcanic districts of the Kaiserstuhl.
   The silicate of glucina, when fused with excess of alkaline carbo
nate, yields a semi-vitreous mass, from which microscopic crystals
may be separated by the action of acids; the crystals consist of per
fectly pure glucina; their specific gravity is 3-02; they are not acted
upon by acids, excepting hot and concentrated sulphuric acid.
   I have also obtained various accessory products in these experi
ments, as platinum crystallized in very brilliant octohedra and cubo
octohedra.     The results which have just been described, differ very
clearly from the ordinary phaenomena of vitrification. This, it is well
known, occurs in a mass of glass which is slightly softened, but not
fused, and the ill-defined crystals which have been obtained, differ
but little in chemical composition from the vitreous mass which sur
rounds them.       In the present case, on the other hand, the crystals
are formed in the midst of a perfectly liquid mass of glass, and their
properties and chemical composition are completely different from
those of the vitreous portion.
   In conclusion, I must point out another method of crystallization,
which, like the method by evaporation, has                 its
                                                       analogue       the ope   in

 NEW STATIC AND DYNAMIC THEORY OF ULTIMATE PARTICLES.

 nomena in the following light, a clear and evident explanation of
 them will result.
    A body is composed of contiguous but not continuous parts, and
 these, instead of being rigid and hard, are eminently compress
 ible and elastic.      These contiguous parts form molecular groups
 and systems, which may be arranged differently in regard to each
 other, in virtue of the attractive force acting from molecule to mole
 cule, from system to system.          In accordance with this view, liquids
 would be formed by strongly compressed and but slightly adherent
 molecular groups; solids, by less strongly compressed but not ad
herent groups; and lastly, aeriform fluids would be constituted by
still less compressed molecular groups, and these much less adherent.
 If the arrangement of the systems be destroyed, the equilibrium
between the attractive and the elastic force disappears; the internal
molecular movement increases, the vibrations augment, the elastic
 force gains the ascendant, and the matter expands, becomes dissi
pated and attenuated on assuming the elastic state, which state
precedes every chemical phaenomenon.
    I have endeavoured on these principles to explain all the phaeno
mena of physics and chemistry, in the same manner as the general
laws of mechanics.
    In accordance with this hypothesis, the phaenomena of capillarity
are merely a necessary consequence of the expansion of matter at                                     its
edges,     of the adhesion        the expanded layer

254.                        Mr. F. Claudet                 on a Class    of
the form of regular octobedrons, small, sparkling, and of a ruby
red colour, very much resembling small crystals of chrome-alum.
   This salt, which is an intense colouring matter, is sparingly
soluble in cold water, 1 part requiring at 60°F. 244 parts of water;
it is soluble to a much larger extent in water at the boiling-point,
to which it imparts a very deep red colour; it is however slightly
decomposed, and altogether so on boiling the solution; but this
may be prevented by keeping the solution slightly acid with
hydrochloric acid.
   Hydrochloric acid, saturated solutions of chloride of ammo
nium and sodium, completely precipitate the new salt from                                                  its
solution; alcohol acts      the same way. The salt
                                      in                 not decom                     is

           boiling hydrochloric acid.    Sulphuric acid evolves hy

operation chlorine comes off from some decomposition.             Nitric
acid partially transforms the salt into the nitrate           the base.                  of
Potash and soda     decompose    the solution      the salt,   hydrated

moisture is produced, which would necessarily be formed if any
oxygen existed in the compound.
     he analysis of this salt was effected in the following manner.
The chlorine was estimated from the chloride of silver, obtained
on boiling the solution with an excess of nitrate of silver and
nitric acid. In the cold the precipitation by nitrate of silver is
not complete.       The cobalt was determined by reducing a certain
quantity of the substance introduced into a tube with a bulb, by
pure hydrogen and heat. The nitrogen was estimated as am
monia, by distilling the salt with caustic soda, receiving the
ammonia into hydrochloric acid, and determining the weight of
the double chloride of platinum and ammonium. The ammonia
was also obtained by heating the salt with soda-lime, according
to the method of Will and Warrentrapp.            This last process, how
ever, gave less accurate results, a deficiency of about 1 per cent.
in the nitrogen being found. The hydrogen was determined by
combustion of the salt with a mixture of oxide of copper and
chromate of lead, and copper turnings.
   The following are some of the results obtained:—
                                                                   Per cent.

256                     Mr. F. Claudet           on a Class   of
making a difference only of 0.37 per cent.   The results obtained,
however, agree pretty well together; and as they do not differ
                                                   I
much from the calculated numbers, am much inclined to believe
sixteen the true number of equivalents of hydrogen in the salt;
       I
and am further confirmed in this view by the manner in which
the salt is decomposed by heat.    A combustion-tube about two
feet long was closed at one end and bent at right angles within
about half an inch of the closed end, so as to form a kind of re
tort.   A certain quantity of the salt was rubbed into a paste
with a little water and rolled up into the size of a pea. When
quite dry, this was dropt into the tube and made to enter the
small retort; mercury was then gently poured into the tube,
which was gradually filled and then inverted in a mercurial
trough.    The mercury descended about a quarter of an inch in
the  tube, on account of a small quantity of air which remained
in that  portion containing the salt. The retort part of the tube
was now slowly heated by means of a spirit-lamp until the salt
was entirely decomposed.      The gas produced occupied nearly
the whole of the  tube, which was two feet in height.   On allow
ing the tube to cool, and introducing a small quantity of hydro
chloric acid, the whole of the gas was absorbed with the excep
tion of a column of about three-quarters of an inch in height,
showing that the space above the mercury was entirely composed
of ammoniacal gas. Now the decomposition of this salt into no
other gas than ammonia, and no other solid products than chlo
ride of ammonium and protochloride of cobalt, is only compatible
with a certain number of atoms of hydrogen, which is sixteen,
for—
               3Cl., 200,   5N, 16H =2CoCl4. NH4 Cl-H4NH3.
Had there been one or two equivalents less of hydrogen, one
equivalent of ammonia would have been broken up, giving hy
drogen and nitrogen not condensed by the hydrochloric acid.
  Assuming, then, the above number of atoms to be correct, and
applying Berzelius's theory of the copulated compounds, the for
mula of this salt may be written—

that it is a sesqui-conjugated compound, if it may be so called,
being composed of 3 equivalents of the salt united with 2 equi
valents of the adjunct.
    Another way of grouping the atoms of this compound is the
following, proposed by Mr. Graham:—
                               NH2 Co?
                         Cl34 NH8, NH4
                               NH3, NH4
Here NH* Co” represents an ammonium in which 2 equivalents
of hydrogen are replaced by 2 equivalents of cobalt; while NH”
NH* represents an ammonium in which l equivalent of hydrogen
is replaced by ammonium itself, as the hydrogen of ammonia is
replaced by ethyle, methyle, &c. in Wurtz's and Hofmann's bases.

                       N{ tº-2C         N {{h.
The compound would then be viewed as a double salt, composed
of l equivalent of a chloride of cobalt-ammonium and 2 equiva
lents of a chloride of ammonium, in which the fourth atom of
hydrogen is replaced by ammonium.
    This peculiar compound has the property of forming double
salts with bichloride of platinum and bichloride of mercury.
    Double salt with bichloride of platinum.—On adding a warm
solution of the salt to bichloride of platinum in excess, a silky
crystalline buff-coloured precipitate falls down, much less soluble
than the salt itself; it may therefore be well washed with water,
thrown on a filter and dried.
    12 grains of this double salt were fused with carbonate of
soda, dissolved in hot water and filtered, to separate the platinum
and oxide of cobalt. The solution neutralized with nitric acid
and precipitated with nitrate of silver gave 20'll grs. Ag Cl–
4.975 Cl-41.6 per cent.        The filtrate of platinum and oxide of
cobalt  ignited was treated with boiling hydrochloric acid, which
dissolved out the cobalt, and left 4:05 platinum = 33.75 per cent.
    18-59 grains of double salt reduced by hydrogen gave 8:06
mixed metals =43.35 per cent, giving 9:60 per cent. for the
 cobalt. The double salt is consequently composed of 1 equiva
lent of the new compound- and 2 equivalents of bichloride of
platinum.

   The study of this and other allied compounds of cobalt which
exist will no doubt greatly extend our views respecting the com
pound ammonias.
   The chlorine of the original chloride may also be eliminated
by any silver salt, an analogous cobalt salt containing the acid of
the silver salt being formed and remaining in solution.              In this
way I have been enabled to obtain a sulphate, nitrate, oxalate,
acetate, and carbonate of the new base.            From the carbonate I
have   prepared   the bromide and iodide which have the octohedral
form of the chloride, are equally sparingly soluble in water, and
of a still darker ruby colour. The bromide was found to con
tain 61:15 per cent. bromine, the calculated amount being 61.8
per cent.
    The insolubility of this ammoniacal compound of cobalt in
boiling hydrochloric acid may be advantageously turned to ac
count in the preparation of chemically pure cobalt, and also in
the qualitative examination of substances containing small quan
tities of cobalt.    The pulverized ore or           oxide            its

      T the Meeting of the British Association at Southampton,
        in September 1846, I had the honour of explaining to the
Section of Geology and Physical Geography my views respecting
the physical configuration of the Table-land of Abessinia § ; and
at the Meeting at Swansea, in August 1848, I enunciated before
the same Section my hypothesis as to the sources of the Nile in

of mountains running along the eastern side of Africa from north
to south.                         -
   To the southward of about the 2nd parallel of south latitude,
and between the 29th and 34th meridians of east longitude, is
the country of Mono-Moézi or Uniamézi—names which may
be respectively interpreted “the king of the moon” and “the
possession of the moon; ”—and in this country, which forms a
portion of the table-land, various considerations induced me to
place the sources of the Bahr-el-Abyad or White River, the direct
stream of the Nile.      And                   I
                                  expressed the opinion that the
“Mountains of the Moon” of the geographer Ptolemy, in which
he places the sources of the Nile, consist of the mountain range
of Eastern Africa, which flanks the country of Mono-Moézi to
the east, instead of being, as we see them usually marked in the
maps, a range stretching across the continent from east to west.
    The direct stream of the Nile, which I thus conceive to have
its sources in the mountains of Mono-Moézi, was in 1840 and
 1841 ascended beyond the 5th parallel of north latitude by the
 second of the expeditions sent by Mohammed Ali, Pasha of
 Egypt, to explore            its
                       course, and was found         joined   about        to   be             in
 9° 20' N.  lat.     by
                    two principal arms, viz. the Keilak     Bahr-el                       or
 Ghazal, and the Sobat, Telfi,      River     Habesh. The former,
                                                   or                of
which joins the main stream from the west, and               which the               of of
course is yet unexplored,         apparently the Nile       Herodotus
and other writers anterior                to is
                                   Ptolemy. The latter, namely the
Sobat, which falls into the Nile from the east, the lower course               is
of the Godjeb, the principal river         Kaffa, which    of    upper                   in   its
course    joined         by
                     three other streams, bearing         common the                in
name   of is
           Gibbe, and draining the extensive elevated districts
in the south     Abessinia Proper now occupied

powerful Galla tribes. Further, the Bahr-el-Abyad            true Nile,                  or
and the Sobat      Godjeb, appear

    latitude, had already begun exploring the interior of the continent.
    In the month of October 1847, Mr. Rebmann penetrated west
    wards to Teita, “a country whose mountains rise to such a height
    out of the vast surrounding plains, that on some eminences near
     Rabbai 'Mpia they are to be seen at a distance of 90 miles;”
     and in the April following (1848), the same missionary performed
     a journey further into the interior, to the still more elevated
     country of Djagga, where, at a distance of rather more than 200
     geographical miles from the coast, in a direction about W.N.W.
    from Mombas, he made the remarkable discovery of a lofty moun
     tain, named Kilimandjáro, of which the summit is covered with

                              The existence of snow on Kilimandjáro has
                            Europe,  though it is difficult to say on what
    reasonable      ground.      However, on subsequent journeys, both
     Mr. Rebmann and his colleague Dr. Krapf have satisfied them
     selves of the fact; and unless it be intended absolutely to im
     pugn their veracity, their evidence cannot be rejected.
        In Djagga Mr. Rebmann obtained information respecting the
     country of Uniamézi—or Mono-Moézi, as it is designated by
    the early Portuguese, by whom it was first mentioned—situ
     ated considerably further inland; and towards the end of the
     year 1848 the same missionary returned to Djagga, for the
     purpose of ascertaining the practicability of reaching Uniamézi.
     Having been assured by the king of the former country of his
     readiness to assist him on the journey, he returned to the coast,
    whence, on the 5th of April 1819, he again set out on his way
    into the interior; his intention being to proceed, if possible, as
    far as the large lake in Uniamézi, respecting which also he had
     obtained information in Djagga, and which, from the name of
w    Usámbiro attributed to          it,
                                     appears            to    be

    early Portuguese maps; and when there                  purposed making

                                                     the west coast     Africa.
     On this    journey,    however, Mr. Rebmann was unable            proceed
     beyond Djagga; the king               that country, Mamkinga, having

supposed    by him to be the upper course of the Sabaki, which
falls into the Indian Ocean close to Melinda.              The absolute
height of the bed of the river where thus crossed is not given;
but it must be considerable, inasmuch as the river thence runs
upwards of 200 geographical miles through a mountainous coun
try before reaching the ocean. From the valley of the Adi
Dr. Krapf ascended about 1800 feet to “the plain of Yata,” on
reaching which he says, “We had a majestic view of the whole
region around. We viewed the serpentine course of the Adi
towards the west and north-west; we saw the hills and plains
of the wild Wakuafi; we noticed the mountains Noka, Djulu,
Engolia, Théuka, in whose vicinity lay the road we had taken to
Kikumbúliu. Eastward we saw the mountains of Mudumóni,
which separate the Galla country from Ukambáni.                   To the
north, Ukambáni Proper lay before our view.               Had     been a                    I
mere traveller pursuing only geographical objects,          would, stand           I
 ing on the plain of Yata, have considered myself amply compensated
 for the troubles I had sustained on the road; for a great many
 geographical problems were solved in an instant on the height
 of Yata+.”      From this it is evident that Dr. Krapf must have
 attained an elevation of several thousand feet, even if he had not
 already reached the summit level of the table-land of Eastern
 Africa.
    Of the geographical results of this journey, one of the most
 important is the discovery of another snowy mountain, named
 Kénia, of larger size, if not of greater elevation than Kilimandjáro.
 Kénia is thus described by Dr. Krapf:—“The sky being clear, I
 got a full sight of the snow mountain..... It appeared to be like
 a gigantic wall, on whose summit I observed two immense towers,
 or horns as you may call them. These horns or towers, which
 are at a short distance from each other, give the mountain a
 grand and majestic appearance, which raised in my mind over
 whelming feelings. Kilimandjáro in Djagga has a dome-like
  summit; but Kénia has the form of a gigantic roof, over which
 its
                                                                                                            on no
      two horns rise like two mighty pillars, which              have                  I
  doubt are seen      by
                       the inhabitants     the countries bordering
                                                       of
 the northern latitudes         the Equator.
                                      of          Still less       doubt                do  I
  that the volume     ofwater which Kénia issues          the north runs      to
towards the basin          of    the   White Nilet.”
   Though this conclusion       the worthy missionary
                                             be of           only                               is

and he was informed there by the Bari negroes, the last natives
he met with, that beyond those mountains the river comes
straight from the south. From the summit of Logwek Dr. Knob

a lofty mountain-chain, the outlines of which were barely dis
cernible through the haze of the atmosphere, and which, from

least equal altitude will be discovered. And even if it should be
ascertained that one of the head-streams of the Nile has its
origin on the northern flank of Kénia    Dr. Krapf conjectures),            (as
we may        be

ary 1841, was informed there that “the rainy season would not
commence for two months, that is to say, not till the end of
March or beginning of Aprilº.”
   Crossing the Line, we learn from the experience of Dr. Krapf
and Mr. Rebmann, that in the mountainous regions west of
Mombas, within four degrees south of the Equator, the rainy
season sets in towards the end of March or the beginning of
Aprilt, that is to say, at the same time precisely as it com
mences within the like distance north of the Line; and it con
tinues till the end of June or the beginning of Julyf. And
seeing that the commencement of the rains is the same within
five degrees north as it is within five degrees south of the Line,
it may reasonably be inferred, in the absence of direct evidence
on the subject, that their duration is likewise in both cases the
same ; whence it will result that throughout the equatorial

      and duration of this “rain of bounty’” are, like as on the Abes
      sinian plateau, irregular and uncertain, we may fairly infer that
      it has at times no sensible effect on the volume of water in the
      Nile.Hence we may understand how it happened that in the
  year 1841 the river, so far from rising in the middle of January,
  as it did in 1850, continued falling till the end of that month”.
     In Lower Egypt, precisely at the period of the regular equa:
  torial rains, namely, “during the months of April, May and
  June, the waters of the Nile are at their lowest level. Towards
  the end of June the river at Cairo begins to rise, without the
  occurrence there of any rainy season, and without the existence
  of the slightest apparent cause. The increase of the Nile usu
  ally continues three months, from the summer solstice to the
  autumnal equinox, when                               its
                                  waters again begin gradually                                                       to

important, and in the present paper       will confine myself to a    I
proof of its truth.

    (3.) That decomposition absorbs       much heat              as

sitions      no
              heat   given off. We know, for instance, that car
bonic acid and magnesia         combining produce certain amount
                                              in                                            a
of  heat, and that sulphuric acid and potash likewise give rise
to  a definite quantity; and yet when sulphate         magnesia and                         of
carbonate         of
                potash are mixed       solution, although such com
                                                            in

dification) occurs.    Does not the decomposition neutralize the
effect of the combination                     ?
    (4.)     In
             cases     simple decompositions the same result does
                             of

amounts       of

bination taking place at the same time, a positive loss of tempe
rature ought to result; and it occurred to me that the decom
position of water by the galvanic battery might be an experi
mentum crucis.      I forgot, however, the heat that is produced by
the resistance offered to the current in passing through the
water.    Still, on consideration, I saw that the experiment would
prove whether decomposition occasioned loss of heat or not; for
although heat is given out by the resistance, might not the
amount of that heat be greater if no decomposition accompanied
it? If the idea I adopted were correct, not only should such be
the case, but the difference should be the amount of heat the
liberated gases would give if again chemically combined.        And
now the problem was to find, whether the heat produced by a
galvanic current passing through water was what was due to the
resistance offered, or whether decomposition       made it less, and
how much less
    (9.) The manner in which I endeavoured to solve this question
was as   follows:—
   Having set a battery, consisting of twelve Daniel’s cells, copper
cylinders 5 inches high, 3 inches in diameter, with brown paper
diaphragms and amalgamated zinc, into action as one series, I
noted to what distance the needle of a tangent galvanometer
moved when the current passed through the copper ring, which
was 12} inches in diameter.          I then included in the circuit a
volta-electrometer holding acidulated water, and again noted to
what division of the scale the needle moved, the current having
passed through the fluid in the electrometer with the decompo
sition of the water.     The difference of the tangents of the angles,
when the electrometer was included and when it was not, showed
the resistance the water offered to the current.            I now removed
the  electrometer,   and in   its
                                place    introduced      fine platina wire
                                                             a
of          length   as
                                                                 of to
    such a              offered the same resistance            the current
that the water did, which     I  knew         by
                                             the needle        the tangent
instrument being equally deflected                 by
                                                 both.       had therefore
                                                                 I

                                                        of
sequently developing the same amount               heat; but
                                                    it of
                                                                         in
                                                                    one case
decomposition was present,      in the other      was not.     What,   then,
was the result      Exactly  what   Ianticipated—the       heat liberated by
the passage      the current through the water was less than that pro
                of
duced    by   its
               passage through the wire, and         the same amount that
                                                        to
the  gases given  off would  develope      again
                                          if      chemically   combined.
    (10.)I   tested the truth       of
                                     this result            by
                                                       many experiments
varied   in different ways, both         as  the quantity and intensity

 leaves from the       fluid,   and substituted a platina wire of such a
 length as kept the needle, the current having passed through the
 wire, at 21 degrees. The same fluid into which the electrometer
 leaves had been immersed now surrounded the wire; the current
 in the former case passing through the water and consequently
 with decomposition, in the latter through the wire without it;
 and after traversing the wire for the same length of time, the
 temperature of the fluid was raised from 75° to 90°, that is 15
 degrees, or 7° more than in the case where decomposition accom
 panied it; although in both cases the same resistance was offered
 to the current, and of course the same amount of heat generated;
 therefore the 7° were absorbed by the decomposition.             In the two
 minutes that the experiment lasted, 3 cubic inches of gas were
 given off: now if these gases were made to combine chemically,
 what amount of heat would they produce : The same that their
 separation caused a loss of, viz. about 7° F. to an ounce of water
 acidulated as above; for 3 cubic inches of the mixed gases in
proper proportion to form water weigh 387 gr. ; and as oxygen
is §ths of the mixture, it must weigh .344 gr. Now as 1                                           lb.   of
oxygen combining with hydrogen would cause the temperature

conducted the galvanic current; the same fluid was used and the
same vessel; in fact everything was the same, except that in one
case decomposition accompanied the resistance, in the other it
did not; and in the former the temperature did not rise to the
same degree as it did in the latter, and it was as much less as
the combination of the gases given off would have produced if
combined.
    I
    also placed two glass tubes, each containing the same quan
tity of acidulated water, in one of which were the leaves of the
electrometer, in the other a platina wire offering the same resist
ance as the fluid, in the circuit; so that the galvanic current
passed through both at the same time, and with the same result
as in the other experiments.

nicated last April to the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and since
published in the Transactions (vol. xx, part II.) under the title

    I  take the present opportunity of correcting a mistaken ex
pression in my first communication regarding steam issuing
from a high-pressure boiler, by which I gave a false, or an                                              in
adequate, representation of the connexion of that application of
Mr. Joule’s general principles which                            I
                                             was bringing forward,
with one which he had himself made in one of his published
papers.     The following is the passage of my communication
 (addressed as a letter to Mr. Joule), which requires correction:—
    “The pretended explanation of a corresponding circumstance
connected with the rushing of air from one vessel to another in
Gay-Lussac’s experiment, on which you have commented, is cer
tainly not applicable in this case, since, instead of receiving
heat from without, the steam must lose a little in passing through
the stop-cock or steam-pipe by external radiation and convec
tion*.”       Iwrote this under the impression that Mr. Joule had,
in his   paper  “On the Changes of Temperature produced by the
Condensation and Rarefaction of Airt,” pointed out the incor
rectness of an explanation often given of Gay-Lussac’s experi
menti, and shown that the phaenomenon could be truly explained
only by taking into account the heat developed in the                                              air   by
friction     in   its
                 passage from one vessel      the other through the

Th;      rotation of the plane of vibration, in M. Foucault's pen
      dulum experiment, admits of being deduced from the equa
tions of motion; and as some of your readers may wish to see
the problem solved on dynamical principles, I venture to offer
the following investigation for insertion in your Journal.

Atherfield beds consisted of a series of loose porous sands and
clays of no great thickness, interposed between the green sand
stone and the top of the Weald clay; and that it was by the
removal of these loose materials, during the act of denudation,
that these large masses of stone had been let down as we now
see them.
    To produce this effect to so remarkable a degree at this point,
two circumstances have combined,—the sharpness of the angle
when the denudation was brought down to this part of the river
fissure, and the projection of the greensand country as before
mentioned into the Bedham Hills; which rise at least 500 feet
immediately west of the river, and would cause the flood of de
nudation in the flux and reflux of                           its

284                   Mr. P.      J.   Martin on the Anticlinal Line of
present, though                 in a lesser degree, the same dislocation as the
Pithingden            Hill.
  The transverse fissure-valleys which transmit the affluents of
that branch of the Arun called the Western Rother by Pet
worth and Lodsworth+, present the same downcast of stony beds.
A  quarry opened in the Petworth Rectory grounds some years
ago was just the counterpart of the one at Pithingden.      In other
less angular parts of the greensand escarpment, wide fissures,
open joints filled with rubble, and other signs of violence, abound
where the intersections of hollow ways or stone quarries expose
their basset edges to observation.      On the north side of the
Weald, again, the Kentish-rag country is not without these
signs of violent disruption,-the escarpments of Boughton
Malerbe, Boughton-Monchelsea, and Sutton-Wallance, for                                                    in
stance; and            I
                 strongly suspect that the dislocation at Tilbur
stow or Tilvester Hill, described by Dr. Mantelli, is a slide of
this kind.
   Much more might be said, and many more localities pointed
out, to show the effects of violent watery abrasion in these escarp
ments; but I pass on to the equally important subject of dilu
vium or drift.
   4.       I
         should have preferred the use of the former word to de
signate the transported materials of the area under review; because
I abjure for them every idea of other means of transport than a
diluvial action,-be it short and transient, or be it longer, and
frequently repeated till the denudation was complete.            But since
the repudiation of the theoretical views on which that term was
founded by             its
                   author, and the general adoption             the word                      of
drift, gives latitude     the use    to  the phrase,    of
                                                         shall use both         I
words indifferently, with the understanding that              diluvium                    if
used,   Imean (as     believeI    everywhere meant now) the drift

   The first and uppermost we may call the Tertiary Zone. The
beds and sprinklings of this division consist mainly of shingle of
the eocene aera, with some angular flints and sandy or argilla
ceous loam, abounding everywhere with rounded pebbles.
   The next, the Cretaceous Zone, consisting entirely of angular
or unbroken flints, in which we very rarely find a pebble except
when entangled in a more than usual invasion of the clays of
the lowest tertiary formations.
   The Subcretaceous, which consists of angular <U+017F>lints with a large
admixture of the ironstone, sandstone, and chert of the green
sand beds.
   And fourthly, the Wealden Zone, in which the <U+017F>lints, except in
a few points on the margin of this formation, have disappeared
along with the pebbles and other materials characteristic of the
strata higher in the order of geological superposition.          It will
be convenient, perhaps, to put this in a tabular form:—

usual organic remains of what is called the Pleistocene.          In the
third, these are very rare; and in the fourth there are none
at all.
   All   the mineral substances of these several zones belong to
the strata which are found in and around the great anticlinal
line, if it be determined that the “grey wethers” are the pro
duction of any of the tertiary beds.        And no substances foreign
to these strata are to be found in the drifts; unless it be that
some intrusions from the older beds west of the area in review
may by accident be found in that part of the line; of which,
                    I
whether or no, am not critically certain.

cannot now have any possible conception, then                unhesitatingly               I

                               the London and Hampshire                  Basins.                     287
misgivings on this head, for he has allowed the elephant beds
their proper place and prominence in the chapter on diluvium.
     Dr. Mantell's description of these cliffs is perfectly faithful;
and I have only to add, that they form an excellent type of the
passage of the tertiary into the cretaceous zone of drift.            In the
composition of that portion of them which lies to the east of
 Kemp Town,                I
                     imagine the sands to be derived from the plastic
clay; the angular flints and chalk-rubble from the eroded chalk
rock in the vicinity; and the shingle bed or ancient beach at
the bottom belongs to the pre-eocene epoch, and is the beach of a
 sea of which we now know nothing more, than that it beat upon
the chalk before the deposit of the tertiary formations; and was
 most probably the parent of the great shingle beds of the plastic
 clay, of which so much has been said.
     The second, or Cretaceous Zone.—As before said, on drawing
 nearer to the bare and abraded chalk-hills, the rounded gravel of
 the tertiaries ceases to be a feature in the composition of drift;
 and although a few are to be found in the “vents” (? rents) and
 fissures of the chalk, and some stragglers adhering to the rolled
 clays and clay loams which still linger amongst the drifts of the
 verge of the Downs, they give place to a plentiful coating, and
 in some cases large accumulations of entire and broken flints;
 and here and there beds of loam and patches of chalk-rubble.
  In the line of country to which these belong also, we find the
  “grey wethers” or Druid sandstones, and the flint conglomerates
  of the eocene aera,_witnesses of the demolition of the strata
  which lay on the chalk before the catastrophe of elevation.
      It is scarcely necessary to say, that            the Down country  all
  affords      ample display
               an                   this sort  of                 of

 288         On       the   Anticlinal Line of the London and Hampshire Basins.
 conveniently deep and illustrative section of this bed of creta
 ceous diluvium, long worked for road materials, is to be found
 near Burford Bridge.     The materials here are firmly impacted
 and  loosely cemented  together, like the Brighton cliffs, by their
 own carbonate of lime; which gives an appearance, as at Brighton,
 approaching to regular stratification.   But there is nothing here
 to remove this accumulation from the    category of common cre
 taceous drift.   Beds of this kind show themselves on the banks
 of the Mole in the hollow way near the bridge on the Reigate
 road; and also on the verge of the gault in digging foundations
 of houses at the foot of Reigate Hill. Shifting to the South
 Downs country, the same appearances are to be found on the
 abraded surface of the chalk near Chichester*.      The Port-field
 there has  long been worked for  angular  flint mixed with chalk
 rubble; and between that place and the Union house at West
Hampnet, there was some time since, and perhaps is still, a flint
gravel pit the exact counterpart of the Dorking one, and com
posed of the same materials as the diluvial beds there, and as
those on which Brighton is built.      I may here observe, that it
was the great denudation of the chalk, and the spread of these
drifts along the flat country south of the Downs from Chichester
to Brighton, and the raised beaches of eocene shingles, which
gave early observers the idea of     being                  its
                                              ancient sea-bed,                an                                 of
which the chalk downs were the      border;-a   position perfectly
untenable.
   Before we quit the chalk downs and enter the denudation
below,           we
           may observe that, although the escarpment
                                                                                                     of of

   Chemists well know the numerous difficulties presenting them
selves at every step in organic chemistry; and as we have now
worked for more than twelve months upon cloves, we feel convinced
that others who ventured upon this department left it impatiently
on account of the numerous obstacles daily appearing, and the
small quantities of some of the substances derivable from this spice;
e.g. it would be utterly impossible to obtain enough of eugenine
from the aqueous extract of ten or twelve pounds of cloves; and
the acid we are about to describe, and which is produced by the
action of nitric acid upon the aqueous extract of cloves, could not
be obtained in sufficient quantity for examination from less than
twenty pounds. One pound of cloves yields two grains of im
pure acid.
                       Preparation of the Acid.
   About twenty pounds of cloves were introduced into a copper
boiler and well-macerated with four gallons of water, and then
boiled briskly for an hour; the dark brown liquid syphoned off,
and the pulpy mass boiled with successive portions of water until
the solution withdrawn was nearly colourless. These several
decantations amounted to about thirty gallons of liquor, which
were evaporated to about six gallons. We found upon treating
a small portion of the brownish decoction with nitric acid that
the action was most violent.
   The mixture frothed up to about twelve times                    volume,  its
consequently this was           warning for future operations, We
                                    a
divided the six    gallons  into twenty       thirty portions, treating
                                                       or
each with nitric acid        the cold. When the intumescence had
                               in

the deposit from the canary-coloured fluid. The filtration was ex
tremely tedious; it occupied upwards of a month: the precipitate
was edulcorated completely with boiling water, until the liquid
percolating did not redden litmus paper. When cold water was
employed, the filtrates were always milky, which, however, disap
peared on boiling.    The filtrate was evaporated to a small bulk,
when fine yellow micaceous scales deposited.      They were col
lected and redissolved in boiling water, then precipitated by ace
tate of lead, and the lead salt washed by decantation to separate
the last traces of acetic acid; an excess of sulphide of hydrogen
was next passed through the lead salt suspended in water, the
whole boiled and then filtered through pure animal charcoal,
which gave a colourless solution that on evaporation yielded to
our satisfaction splendent white crystals of the acid. The crystals
were insoluble in alcohol, aether and cold water, soluble in hot am
monia, in potassa, and in large quantities of boiling water; con
centrated sulphuric acid leaves it intact in the cold, but in the heat
carbonizes      it,

    Having finished the investigation of the acid, we concluded
that it might have been formed from the oxidation of euge
nine by nitric acid; but this we found not to be the case. We
obtained eugenine in transparent pearly laminae from the di
stilled water of cloves, but in very small quantities; it is only
very slightly affected by strong nitric acid. Dumas assigned it
the subjoined formula, which we deem the correct one:–

are parallel to a principal axis are dependent on the position of
the plane of the waves.          From this it would follow, that the

   Now the ellipses D and D' coincide as often as the normal to
the plane of the waves coincides with a principal axis. When
the plane of the waves runs parallel with a principal axis, both
these sections in the direction of the said axis possess axes of
equal length.    It seems, in fine, that for homogeneous media
these two sections differ from each other only in an inappreciable
degree; that is to say, for these media the following relations
appear to be very nearly correct:

ments gave 162 revolutions per minute with the first, and 130
with the second magnet.
   In the further prosecution of my inquiries, I took six pieces
of round iron of different diameters and lengths, and also a piece
of hollow round iron, half an inch in diameter, and "sth of an
inch thick in metal; these were bent into the U-form, so that
the shortest distance between the poles of each was half an inch;
each was then wound (with the usual precautions to ensure insu
lation) with ten feet of covered copper wire of ºth inch dia
meter.   The lengths and diameters are given in the following
table. No. 1 is the hollow magnet.     The attraction was ascer
tained by suspending a straight steel magnet, 1% inch in length,
horizontally to the beam of a balance, and bringing the several
electro-magnets directly underneath at the distance of half an
inch, which was preserved by the interposition of a piece of wood
half an inch thick. Care was taken that the battery remained
constant during the cyperiments.

   Nothing can be more striking than the difference between the
ratios of lifting to distant attractive power, in the different mag
nets; whilst the steel magnet attracts with a force of 23 grains
and lifts 60 oz., No. 3 attracts 5-1 grains and lifts 92 oz.
   The following are some general directions for making electro
magnets for lifting:—1st. The magnet, if of considerable bulk,
should be compound, and the iron used of good quality and well
annealed.      2nd. The bulk of the iron should bear a much
greater ratio to           its
                     length than       generally the case. 3rd. The

                      be                       flatly and accurately   fit
to  the armature.    And 4th. The armature should           equal                          be           in

I    shall now proceed      consider with greater care what form
                                           to
of electro-magnet      best for distant attraction,
                                 is                      that     the                 as         is

things must           be   considered; the length                      of   the iron, and        its   sec
tional area.
     Now with regard                 to    the length        ofthe iron,   have found that

                         do not think that the difference between
the two is so great as to counterbalance the practical advantages
which solid bars would give if used in the engine.        shall now                            I
therefore  attempt  to determine the sectional area of solid iron
most proper for various galvanic powers.
   I  made five straight electro-magnets of square iron wire Tºrth
of an inch thick; each was 7 inches long, and wound with
twenty-two feet of insulated copper wire of Tºth of an inch dia
meter.    No. 1 consisted of nine, No. 2 of sixteen, No. 3 of
twenty-five, No. 4 of thirty-six, and No. 5 of forty-nine square
iron wires, arranged in the form of square prisms.       Five other
electro-magnets were made of square iron rod, but in every other
respect were exactly similar to the first.   The following are the
attractions (at half an inch distance) for a straight steel magnet,
with three different voltaic forces.

the numbers  opposite the wire magnets  are less than they would

the bar magnets are most powerful of the larger ones.

upon.
      The accompanying figure re-ac,
presents the form      of galvanometer
I    have employed.       The needle n
is 2 inches long.        The wire is 10
 feet long, and      ºth   of an inch in
 diameter: it is      disposed   in four
 circumvolutions, mercury cups
                                                                       "ac
 being placed at the parts marked
 a, b, c, d, e. The coils cross one another at w, w, but in every
 other part they are in the same plane.           By this contrivance the
 forces of the several coils are made equal to one another, or, as
  it would seem, not perceptibly different.
       The process of graduation was conducted in the following
  manner:—The electricity of a constant battery was first passed
  through each of the coils in succession, and the deflection of the
   needle was observed to be the same in each case.             A current of
   a certain intensity was then passed from a to b, a to c, a to d,
   and a to e, taking care to decrease the resistance of the battery
   wires in proportion as the length of that part of the galvano
   imeter wire through which the current passed was increased, and
    I  marked the several deflections of the needle on the card of the
   instrument 1, 2, 3, 4,       I then increased   the power of the battery
    until the needle stood at the mark        2, when the current passed
   from a to     b; the former     process was then repeated, and      I thus
    observed the quantities 2, 4, 6 and 8; and going on in the same
               I
    manner, had the card of the galvanometer marked with the
    numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, &c. In using the galvano
    meter the current is passed from a to b, and the above numbers
                                                                      -
    indicate absolute quantities of current electricity.
        In order to obtain a definite idea of the quantities indicated
    by my galvanometer, I took a diluted acid, consisting of ten
    parts water and one of sulphuric acid, spec. grav. 1-8, and passed
    through it a current which deflected the needle to the mark 1.
     In seven minutes 0.62 of a cubic inch of the mixed gases was
                                         |.
    produced. The clectrodes employed in the above experiment
     were pointed platina wires 1:1            asunder.
        The  electro-magnets     used first were those described in my last
     communication. They are straight and square, 7 inches long,
     and wound with twenty-two feet of copper wire Tºth of an inch
     in diameter.     Five of them were constructed of bar iron, and
     five  corresponding     ones of square iron wire.       The sections of
     those marked No. I. are ºths of an inch square; a dimension
     which is successively- increased in Nos.         II, III,  and IV. until
      No. V., which are ºrths of an inch square.

     Thebarelectro-magnetswere suspended in succession, vertically,
 from the beam of a balance; the corresponding wire electro-mag
 nets being brought vertically underneath, so that ºth of an inch
 intervened between the poles of the two magnets.                      Electrical cur
 rents of the quantities exhibited in the table were passed through
 the continuous line of conductors presented by the galvanometer
 and electro-magnetic coils.               The attraction was measured in
 grains by ascertaining the weight required to raise the suspended
 electro-magnet from a piece of wood ºth of an inch thick, placed
on the upper pole of the lower electro-magnet.

    Every one of the magnets used in the above series of experi
ments, except Nos. VI. and VII., was wound to two thick
nesses by the wire; and in the large ones the iron was left un
covered at equal intervals.                I   must mention, however, that
Nos. WI. and VII. had to be wound to three thicknesses in some
parts on account of their small size. On this account the mag
netic attractions of these two pairs were somewhat deteriorated.
    It does not appear from the experiments that any great loss
of power arises from an increase of the length of the mag
nets.     It is plain, that, as the magnets in Table II. are wound
with three times the length of wire, twenty-four of current elec

            demonstrating            a limit to the Magnetizability                     of Iron.               813
tricity in the first table should have the same effect as eight in
the second table.     The difference, if any, should be due to the
increased   length   of the iron. I do not think myself justified
in assigning any amount to this difference, which, however, seems
to increase in value as the section of the magnets decreases. In
order to determine this and many other circumstances of great
interest, it would be necessary to conduct experiments in a much
more comprehensive manner, and to examine more minutely into
the various powers of hard and soft iron and iron wire.
        I
     think, however, that I have by these experiments discovered
a most important law, namely, The attractive force of the electro
magnet is directly as the square of the electric force to which                                                 its

                confessed that there are many instances

gathered from our own historians.          Up to the time (1831) when
Dr. Rosen published his edition and translation of Mohammed Ben
Musa, we knew nothing of the Arab writers except in fragments.
Dr. Rosen's contribution   (which is also that of Mr. Warburton)
showed us the manner in which, and the writer by whom, the Indian
science was made Arabian. M. Woepcke lets us into the secret of
the progress made by the Arabs themselves; and a comparison of
the writings of the introducer and of the improver will show that
the science had made remarkable advances. This comparison, how
ever, we must leave to the interested reader, on account of the space
it would require.
   M. Woepcke gives the Arabic text, a French version, a running
paraphrase in modern language, and various additions and notes.
He has earned a right to the gratitude of all who take interest in
watching the progress of science, by the able manner in which he
has performed every part of the task of which we can judge. We
say this that we may not be supposed to give an opinion of the
translation; this we are compelled to leave to those who know how
to decipher the methodical scratches and scrawls which we fully
believe, upon testimony, to represent Arabic words.

   This little work contains a short account of the theory of the
chemical action of light, with simple directions for producing pho
tographic pictures by different agents, bringing down the descriptions
to the most recent improvements at the time of publication. Among
these the production of images upon glass plates naturally assumes
a very prominent place, forming, as it does, in practice a marked step
in advance, from the extreme beauty and minuteness of detail that
can be attained by the employment of the transparent medium, ren
dering photography still further available for scientific purposes.

matters of the uterus and Fallopian tubes were made up of blood
discs, cylindrical epithelium, granular corpuscles, and a few spindle
shaped bodies.
    The second case was that of a girl who had died at St. Luke's
 Hospital, where the supervision of the patient was quite as strict as
 that in the last case.  In this instance the anatomical features were
precisely like the preceding.     The right Fallopian tube contained a
globular body similar to that found in the left on the former occa
sion. This globular body, on being crushed between two pieces of
glass and examined under the microscope, was found to consist ex
 ternally of a mass of nucleated cells, the remains of the tunica gra
nulosa, and of a transparent ring, enclosing an opake granular
mass, and a highly pellucid spot.     The author considered that this
body was the liberated ovule, and the influence of chemical reagents
                                                       -
served to support his opinion.
    An examination of the corpora lutea found in both cases, showed
that they consisted of large granular corpuscles and oil-globules.
    The conclusions arrived at by the author were as follows:—
    1. That ovules escape from the ovaries of women during the
period of menstruation; and that their escape is a spontaneous act,
taking place quite independently of sexual intercourse.
   2. That immediately before, or else consentaneous with, the
escape of an ovule, the whole substance of the Graafian follicle
becomes charged with effused blood; and that a sort of fatty dege
neration of the effused matter soon afterwards takes place.
   3. That the mere presence of a yellow body containing a clot in
the ovary, is not by any means a certain sign of recent impregnation.
   4. That a sanguineous fluid is poured out over the whole mucous
tract of the generative system during the catamenial period.
   5. That the results of the observation tend to confirm the opinions
entertained by Wagner, Bischoff, Barry, and Wharton Jones, con
cerning the membranous nature of that portion of the ovule known
as the zona pellucida.
   6. That the oil-globules of the yelk are either enclosed in a           di
stinct.jmembrane, or else that a structureless solid material pervades
the entire substance of the vitelline body, and so binds the several
component elements of it together.
   7. That the recognition of the germinal vesicle removes some
doubts concerning   its appearance and position      the germ-mass.

 servations, which are numerous, the author enters into an explana
 tion of the whole system of tidal streams in the English Channel and
 North Sea, as deduced from these observations, and also as to what
 he considers to be the cause of the peculiar movement of the streams
 in these channels. He supposes, in conformity with Dr. Whewell's
 theory, a tide-wave to pass along the western shores of Europe, and
 to enter the English Channel and North Sea by opposite routes, and
 to arrive off the Texel and Lynn at the same tidal hour as the tide
 wave in the English Channel arrives off the Start and Jersey.
 From these points there are thrown off branch or derivative waves,
 which differ materially both in dimensions and rate of travelling from
 the parent wave. These waves roll on towards the strait of Dover
 and there merge into each other and form a combined wave.
     The effect of this wave upon the tidal establishments of the Chan
 nel had long been known ; but                            its
                                              influence upon the streams          the                       of

                                      observation the author considered that,

  May 9, 1851.-Some Views respecting the Source of Light, &c.
By James Nasmyth, Esq., F.R.A.S.
   “Impressed with the conviction that the progress of science has
often been most importantly advanced by the setting forth of hypo
thetical views as to the nature of those causes which result in great
phaenomena,         I
                am, for these reasons, induced to hazard and venture
forth with some views on the subject of the nature of solar light,
more especially in reference to the well-known but most remarkable
phaenomena, occurring in the case of stars of variable and transitory
brightness, as also in reference to those wonderful results of geolo
gical research, namely, the unquestionable evidence of the existence
of an arctic or glacial climate in regions where such cannot now
naturally exist; thus giving evidence of the existence of a condition
of climate, for the explanation of which we look in vain to any, at
present, known cause.
     “I must plead the fact of the existence of such wonderful phae
nomena as these alluded to as my apology for thus attempting to
come forth with what, although they may appear crude, theoretical
notions, yet may, as tending to direct increased attention to im
portant phaenomena, so lead in due time to the development of
truth, and extend the present bounds of our knowledge of those
mighty laws which are so mysteriously indicated by the existence
of the phaenomena in question, and with the evidences of which we
are yet surrounded.
     “A course of observations on the solar spots, and on the remark
able features which from time to time appear on the sun's surface,
which I have examined with considerable assiduity for several years,
had in the first place led me to entertain the following conclusion;
namely, that whatever be the nature of solar light,             main source         its
appears    to
            result from           an
                              action induced                        on
                                                    the exterior surface                             of
the solar sphere,                                 doubt not all who have
                                                on in
                       conclusion
                          a              which                I
attentively pursued observations         the structure     the sun's surface   of
will agree.
   “Impressed with the correctness           this conclusion,
                                                        of        was led            I               to
consider whether we    might    not  reasonably   consider the true source
of  the latent element      lightof    reside, not
                                            to         the solar orb, butin                          in
space itself; and that the grand function and duty              the sun was         of
to act    as  agent for the bringing forth into vivid existence its due
               an
portion     the illuminating       luciferous element, which element
           to of
                                       or                                                           I
suppose             be
                diffused  throughout      the boundless regions       space,               of
and which      that case must
                in                         be
                                    perfectly   exhaustless.
   “Assuming, therefore, that the sun's light            the result    some
                                                                          is                   of
peculiar action          by
                     which       brings forth into visible existence the

stellar orbit, have passed, and may yet have to pass, through regions
of space, in which the light-yielding element may either abound or
be deficient, and so cause him to beam forth with increased splen
dour, or fade in brilliancy, just in proportion to the richness or
poverty of this supposed light-yielding element as may occur in
those regions of space through which our sun, in common with
every stellar orb, has passed, is now passing, or is destined to pass,
in following up their mighty orbits.
   “Once admit that this light-yielding element resides in space,
and that it is not equally diffused, we may then catch a glimpse of
the cause of the variable and transitory brightness of stars, and
more especially of those which have been known to beam forth with
 such extraordinary splendour, and have again so mysteriously faded
 away; many instances of which abound in historical record.
   “Finally, in reference to such a state of change having come
over our sun, as indicated by the existence of a glacial period, as is
now placed beyond doubt by geological research, it appears to me
no very wild stretch of analogy to suppose that in such former pe
riods of the earth's history our sun may have passed through portions
of his stellar orbit in which the light-yielding element was deficient,
and in which case his brilliancy would have suffered the while, and
an arctic climate in consequence spread from the poles towards the
equator, and leave the record of such a condition in glacial hand
 writing on the everlasting walls of our mountain ravines, of which
there is such abundant and unquestionable evidence.             As before
said, it is the existence of such facts as we have in stars of transi
tory brightness, and the above-named evidence of an arctic climate
existing in what are now genial climates, that renders some ade
quate cause to be looked for.      I have accordingly hazarded the pre
ceding remarks as suggestive of a cause, in the hope that the sub
ject may receive that attention which                 its
                                               deep interest entitles
                                                                                                it

obtain.
   “This view the source light,
                          of              of respects the existence
                                                     as               the                      of

   Description of the Apparatus for observing Transits, by means of
a Galvanic Current, now used at the Observatory of Cambridge,
U.S.    By Mr. G. P. Bond +.
   The apparatus exhibited to the Society, is the same which has
been for some time past in use at the Harvard Observatory, U.S.,
and is the property of the United States Coast Survey.            It consists
of an electric break-circuit     clock,  a galvanic    battery  of a single
Grove's  cup, and the     spring  governor,  by  which a uniform motion
is given to the cylinder carrying the paper.
   The electric clock is of the form proposed by Mr. Bond. Though
different in             its
                 object and construction, the effect produced             the                                     is

namely, the interruption          the galvanic circuit

the old method, and the liability to errors in the minutes and seconds
is increased. A saving in the quantity of recording surface was also
requisite.
   The apparatus invented at Cambridge for this object is called
the spring governor.         The train of wheels which communicates the
motive power to the cylinder connects with a small fly-wheel.                    This
fly is for supplying momentum, and holds no part in the regulation.
Beyond this fly, reckoning from the cylinder, is a half-seconds
pendulum, with a dead-beat escapement. The connexion between
the escapement-wheel and the fly is through a short spring.                      The
elasticity of this spring allows the motion of the escapement-wheel
to be completely arrested at each vibration of the pendulum, while
the momentum of the fly, acting for a small fraction of a second
only on the spring, keeps up the motion of the cylinder.                    The ma
chinery is thus completely under the control of the pendulum.                      No
accumulation of irregularity can take place beyond the limits of the
bending and unbending of the connecting spring.                       After this is
adjusted to         its
                    minimum, the continuous rotary motion will                   per                        be

  Extract of                      Mr. Lassell.
                      a Letter from
  “I have been       very busy, and have brought to a most successful
issue my efforts to support my two-foot speculum free from sensible
flexure.     All has gone on well and come right at once; and the
speculum having been once placed in the tube, I have neither
reason nor inclination to take it out again.             was pretty sanguine,  I
yet must acknowledge the result has gone beyond my hopes. I an
nounced the details of the plan to the British Association at Edin
burgh *, and there is a clear and sufficient description of it in the
Report just about publishing, or perhaps already out. I have scarcely
varied at all in carrying it out.        I have found 27 or 28 levers suf
ficient: and these are about as many as can be conveniently applied
without interfering with the 18 discs and levers for zenithal support.
 Moreover, I have found cementing fulcral blocks of speculum metal
 upon the back with plaster of Paris quite efficient—firm enough to
 bear twice the requisite strain.        Each lever, in a horizontal position
 of the   tube,  supports   15 lbs. of the speculum's weight; diminishing,
 of   course,  as the   telescope   approaches the zenith, where they are
 inactive.     The  superiority    of action of the telescope since the ap
 plication of this apparatus, I think none but myself who have seen
 it in both states can yet appreciate, and the atmosphere now alone
 remains my formidable and unconquerable foe, as it is indeed of

of digestion, the blood which issues from the liver          the hepatic veins        by
(veines   sus-hépatiques)    invariably    contains sugar,  both      man and                        in
animals, whatever the nature                      of
                                      their food may be.
   The liver         most animals, and particularly
                        in                                     mammifera,              in                           is

            that the blood        the ventral vena portae, returning from
                                             of

that it is by the hepatic veins, and them alone, that the sugar is
conveyed into the general circulation; and 2nd, that when the he
patic veins carry sugar, the tissue of the liver is also saturated with
it in a high proportion.   No other organ of the body is in the same
condition;   so that the constant presence      of the saccharine principle
is distinctive of the tissue of the liver  during   digestion.   These facts
have been     proved  by  a  very  great  number of direct experiments,
and confirmed in a variety of animals belonging to nearly every order
of the zoological series. Without entering on details, I shall enu
merate the species on which my investigations have been made.
    On man, in the state of health, I have three times had the oppor
tunity of ascertaining the presence of sugar in the liver; first on the
body of an executed criminal ; next in an individual killed acci
dentally by a gun-shot; and lastly, in a case of sudden death.

pig, rabbit, hare, black rat, and brown rat. Ruminantia—goat, sheep,
ox.     Pachydermata—horse, ass, pig.

    Among the Articulata, I have detected sugar in the liver of some
 decapodous Crustacea, as the crawfish and lobster; but in this branch
 of the animal kingdom the organs of nutrition undergo such profound
 modifications that the determination of the liver would lead to un
 necessary discussion.

whenever, by any means, a violent commotion of the nervous system
is produced.
   In the whole extent of the nervous system, I have found only one
limited spot of the medulla oblongata where a lesion occasions the
opposite effect. Thus, when in dogs or rabbits we succeed in prick
ing the medulla oblongata with a sharp-pointed instrument within
the narrow space, limited below by the origin of the pneumogastric,
and above by the emergence of the acoustic nerves, we ascertain after
a short lapse of time that the saccharine principle has been formed
so abundantly as to spread throughout        the organism.    The bloodall
and other liquids    the body are surcharged with it; the urine eli

      Th;    polarity of bismuth is a subject on which philoso
          phers have differed and continue to differ. On the one
side we have Weber, Poggendorff, and Plücker, each affirming
that he has established this polarity; on the other side we have
Faraday, not affirming the opposite, but appealing to an                                                   in
vestigation which is certainly calculated to modify whatever con
viction the results of the above-named experimenters might have

334                  Dr. Tyndall on the Polarity of Bismuth,
tions, together with the fact of having in my possession a piece
of bismuth, whose peculiar structure suggested the possibility of
submitting the question of diamagnetic polarity to an additional
test, are the inducements in which the present brief inquiry
 originated.
    2. In December 1847 a paper on ‘Diamagnetic Polarity’ was
 read before the Academy of Sciences in Berlin by Professor Pog
 gendorff, the result arrived at by the writer being, that a bis
 muth bar, suspended horizontally and occupying the equatorial
 position between two excited magnetic poles, was transversely
 magnetic,+that side of the bar which faced the north pole pos
 sessing north polarity, and that side which faced the south pole
 possessing south polarity; the excitation being thus the oppo
 site of that of iron, and in harmony with the original conjecture
 of Faraday.
    3. The method adopted by the writer was as follows:—the
 bismuth bar was suspended within a helix of copper wire, the
 coils of which were perpendicular to the axis of the bar. The
 helix was placed between the opposite poles of a magnet, so that
 the axis of the helix was perpendicular to the line joining the
 poles.   The bismuth took up the usual equatorial position,                                                            its
 length thus coinciding with the axis     the helix. On sending              of

    an electric current through the latter the bar was weakly de
    flected in a certain direction, and on reversing the current, a
    feeble deflection in the opposite direction was observed.  The
    deflection was such as must follow from the supposition, that
    the north pole  of the magnet had excited a north pole in the
    bismuth, and the south pole of the magnet a south pole.
       4. It will be at once seen that a considerable mechanical dis
    advantage was connected with the fact that the distance from
    pole to pole of the transverse magnet was very short, being
    merely the diameter of the bar.                                If
                                         a piece of bismuth, instead
    of setting equatorial, could be caused to set axial, a mechanical
    couple of far greater power would be presented to the action of
    the surrounding current. Now it is well known that bismuth
    sets in the magnetic field with the plane of most eminent clea
    vage equatorial; hence the possibility, that if a bar of bismuth
    could be obtained with the said plane of cleavage perpendicular
          its
           length, the directive power            bar might     suffi                                          be

    of  the magnet.     The cylinder, which             instant before was         an
    motionless, was deflected, forming         the limit           swingat                    of    its                an

 336          Dr. Tyndall       on the   Polarity     of Bismuth,
librium for the bar was at an angle of 35°, or thereabouts, with
the axial line.
   7. Looking from the south pole towards the north pole of the
magnet, or in the direction of the current as it passed over the
bar, that end of the bar which faced the south pole swung to the
left.
 %. The current through the helix being interrupted and the
bar brought once more to rest in the axial position (which of
course is greatly facilitated by the proper opening and closing of
the circuit), a current was sent through in the opposite direc
tion, that is from the north pole to the south; the end of the
bar, which in the former experiment was deflected to the left,
was now deflected an equal quantity to the right.      I have re
peated this experiment a great number of times and on many
different days with the same result.
   9. In this case the direction of the current by which the
magnet was excited was constant, that passing through the helix
which surrounded the bismuth cylinder being variable.         The
same phaenomena are exhibited if we preserve the latter constant
and reverse the former.
   10. A polar action seems undoubtedly to be indicated here;
but if a polarity be inferred, it must be assumed that the north
pole of the magnet excites a south pole in the bismuth, and the
south pole of the magnet a north pole in the bismuth; for by
reference to the direction of the current and the concomitant
deflection, it will be seen that the deportment of the bismuth is
exactly the same as that which a magnetized         needle freely
suspended between       the poles         must        exhibit under the same
Circumstances.
  11. The bar of bismuth was them removed, and a little bar of
magnetic shale was suspended in      stead;     its
                                              set axial.   On
                                                            it
sending  acurrent  through the  surrounding helix,    was de          it
flected in the same manner         as
                                   the bismuth.   The piece     shale       of
was then removed and        little bar
                            a               of
                                          iron was suspended within
the helix; the residual magnetism which remained            the cores in
after the cessation    ofthe exciting current was sufficient       set          to
the bar axial;     very feeble current was sent through the helix
                   a
and the deflection observed,—it was exactly the same          that         as        of
the bismuth and the shale.
   12. These results being different from those obtained                             by
M.   Poggendorff,  I  repeated his experiment with              all
                                                      possible care.
   bar of  ordinary  bismuth,      an
                                  inch     length
                                                inand about 0:2                      of
an Ainch in  diameter, was suspended within the helix;     exciting    on
the magnet,   it receded     the equator and became finally steady
                            to
there.    The axis of the bar thus coincided with the axis of the
helix.  A    current being sent through the latter, the bar was
distinctly deflected.    Supposing         an
                                        observer           to
                                                   stand before the

magnet, with the north pole to his right and the south pole to
his left, then when a current passed through the upper half of
the coil from the north to the south pole, that end of the bis
muth which was turned towards the observer was deflected
towards the north pole; and on reversing the current, the same
end was deflected towards the south pole. This seems entirely
to agree with the former experiment.       When the bar hung equa
torial between the excited poles, on the supposition of polarity
the opposite ends of                     all   its
                               horizontal diameters were oppositely
polarized.     Fixing our attention     one                      on
                                               these diameters, and         of
supposing that end which faced the north pole         the magnet                            of                           to
 be gifted with south polarity, and the end which faced the south
pole endowed with north polarity, we see that the deportment
to    beinferred from this assumption      the same     that actually is                      as
exhibited; for the deflection        polarized diameter of  the same

of the     bar observed             in   the experiment.
    13. The following test, however, appears                        more refined       to    be
than any heretofore applied. Hitherto                      have supposed the    we
helix      so
          placed between the poles that the direction                         coils                    of   its
was   parallel        to
                   the line which united         them;              now   suppose      let   us
it  turned 90° round,                    so
                                that the axis                              of
                                                       the helix and the line
joining the poles may coincide.                 this position the planes

friend; “either you must refer the weakening of       a quadrant to
magnetic interference, or you must conclude, that that induced
state, whatever it be,which causes the bismuth to be repelled by the
magnet, causes it to be attracted by the coil, the resultant being
the difference of both forces. In the same manner the strengthen
ing of a quadrant is accounted for by the fact, that here the                                                        in
duced state which causes the bismuth to be repelled by the
magnet causes it to be repelled by the coil also, the resultant
being the sum of both forces.        The matter may be stated still
more    distinctly  by   reference to Reich’s experiments+.      He
found that when a bundle of magnet-bars was brought to bear
upon a diamagnetic ball suspended to the end of a torsion
balance, when similar poles were presented to the body, there was
a very distinct repulsion; but if one half of the poles were north
and the other half south, there was no repulsion. Let us imagine
the two halves to be brought to bear upon the ball consecutively;
the first half will cause it to recede to a certain distance; if the
secondunlike half be now brought near, the ball will approach again,
and take up                  its
                   original position. The question therefore appears
to  concentrate itself into the following:—Is this “approach’
due    the fact that the magnetic forces
        to                                the two halves annul                   of
each other before they reach the ball,         the result                        or   is    it                   of
compensation     inductions    the diamagnetic body itself?

the sphere as an induced magnet, whose power is directly pro
portional to the inducing one. Were the magnetism of the
sphere a constant quantity, a magnet of double power could only
produce a double attraction; but the fact of the magnetism of
the sphere varying directly as the source of induction leads us
inevitably to the law of squares; and conversely, the law of
squares leads us to the conclusion that the sphere has been
induced.
   27. These sound like truisms; but if they be granted, there is no
escape from the conclusion that diamagnetic bodies are induced;
for it has been proved by M. E. Becquerel and myself+, that the
repulsion of diamagnetic bodies follows precisely the same law as
the attraction of magnetic bodies; the law of squares being true
for both. Now were the repulsion of bismuth the result of a
force applied to the mass alone, without induction, then, with a
constant mass, the repulsion must be necessarily proportional to
the strength of the magnet. But it is proportional to the square
of the strength, and hence must be the product of induction.
    28. In order to present magnetic phaenomena intelligibly to
the mind, a material imagery has been resorted to by philoso
phers. Thus we have the ‘magnetic fluids' of Poisson and the
‘lines of force’ of Mr. Faraday. For the former of these Pro
fessor W. Thomson has recently substituted an ‘imaginary mag
netic matter.”   The distribution of this “matter’ in a mass of
                                                                                                         of its
soft iron, when operated on by a magnet, has attraction for
result. We have the same necessity for            image      the case     an        in

Notmistslittle   a        has recently occurred
                               controversy              che
          with regard to the nature of the combination which
                                                                                                 amongst
is stated to take place between arsenious acid and albumen.
According to Prof. Liebigt, these two bodies combine in atomic
proportions, and it is owing, he says, to this circumstance that the
vitality of the organs is destroyed in cases of arsenical poisoning.
The same opinion, it seems, is entertained by Dr. Sheridan Mus
pratt of Liverpool, who has lately published some resultsf which
certainly appear to establish the truth of the hypothesis.    Other
chemists, on the contrary, say that this statement of Liebig’s is
founded on error—that arsenious acid does not, under any cir
cumstances, form a true chemical combination with albumen,
and is only separated by the latter substance from              solutions                           its

boiling water; care being taken to reduce the compound to a
still more minute state of division, by patient trituration in a
mortar, after each digestion, &c. The washings, on being treated
by Reinsch's process, were found to contain a large proportion
of arsenious acid.
   The insoluble residue having been digested in water for about
twelve or fifteen hours, as before described, was dried and weighed.
It  amounted to about 29 grs.”         It was then boiled in strong
hydrochloric acid, when it dissolved with the characteristic
colour of the proteine compounds. Upon testing this solution in
the usual manner, only exceedingly minute traces of arsenic
could be detected; a quantity insufficient to yield, on oxidation,
a perceptible sublimate of arsenious acid.

 LIII.  An Account of the late John WALsh of Cork. In a              letter
        from Professor Boole to Professor DE MoRGAN*.
      MY   DEAR    SIR,                              Cork, April 12, 1851.
.
 AFTER       an interval which you will,     I fear, think to have been
       needlessly protracted,    I am at length able to transmit to
 <U+017F>ou some of those particulars which you have desired me to col
     respecting the life of the late John Walsh of Cork. What             I
have to relate to you will constitute a remarkable, and in some
respects a melancholy story.        This I say, not because I think
that there is evidence that the subject of my letter was on the
whole an unhappy individual; on the contrary, he appears to
have been a man of cheerful habits and hopeful temperament;
but because upon any serious view of life and of human concerns,
it must ever be a mournful spectacle to see earnestness and per
severance and many of the nobler elements of character wasted
upon pursuits altogether void of any useful result. That Mr.
Walsh's labours were of this nature you will have already learnt
from the communications which he was in the habit of addressing
to you, and of which I have heard you speak; but with what
unwearied ardour these labours were pursued, and of how abiding
a passion they were the fruit, you will only learn to estimate
from the facts which    I have now to communicate to you. What
ever  may  be  thought  of Mr. Walsh's abilities, you will feel it
impossible not to admire his singular application, and not to
regret that it was not directed to some more profitable if less
ambitious end.
   I think it proper to premise that, for the information contained
                I
in this letter, am mainly indebted to Mr. K., now a scholar of
Queen's College, Cork, who was for some years a pupil of Mr.
Walsh, and to whom his instructor's books and manuscripts
were bequeathed.      Mr. K. has been so good as to submit the
latter to my inspection, and has given me full permission to
make such use of them and of his own communications as                    I
think proper.      I have also had the opportunity of conversing
with the  physicians   who attended Mr. Walsh during his last          ill
ness while a patient in one of the infirmaries, and finally in the
Union workhouse of this city, and from them             I have received
much interesting information.
   John Walsh was born at Shandrum, on the border of the
County of Limerick, probably about the year 1786. Hisparents
were small farmers; and the only education which he appears to
have received was from itinerant schoolmasters, a class of teach
ers of humble rank, who resided, while imparting their little
stock of knowledge, with the parents of their pupils, and thus
              *  Communicated   by Professor De Morgan.

   Prof. Boole's Account of the late John Walsh of Cork.                     349
may have contributed to foster that respect for learning which
still characterizes the Irish peasant. Of his mother, Mr. Walsh
always spoke with great affection, attributing to her influence
his first love of letters.  He also held in kind remembrance one
of his early school-fellows, John Harding, to whom in later life
he dedicated a little tract on “The General Principles of the
Theory of Sound.”
  When about 28 years of age, John Walsh, in company with
Harding, removed to Cork. Necessity, however, compelled the
friends to separate. Walsh, who wrote a fine hand, an accom
plishment which he stated that he owed to his mother’s instruc
tion, obtained employment as a teacher of writing in ladies’
schools. He also received private pupils, and at a subsequent
period was engaged as writing-master in two respectable boys’
schools in the city.   The teaching of writing and arithmetic
appears to have been his chief source of subsistence; for although
he sometimes obtained pupils in the higher mathematics, this
was not a frequent occurrence.     Mr. Walsh is said to have been
a careful and diligent writing-master, and to have succeeded in
making his pupils in arithmetic understand and like the subject.
The few testimonies which I have heard of his abilities as a
teacher of the higher mathematics would not lead me to think
that he was equally successful there.     He is stated to have been
too intent on enforcing  his own    peculiar views.   Indeed there
can be little doubt, from an examination of his papers, that
upon this subject he laboured under a peculiar mental halluci
 nation.
  At what time Mr. Walsh        began to write on mathematical
topics I am not able to determine.      By degrees, however, this
class of speculations appears to have absorbed his entire interest.
He became convinced that the differential calculus was a delu
sion; that Sir Isaac Newton was               shallow sciolist, if not an
                                                a
impostor; and that the universities and academies of Europe
were engaged in the interested support of a system of error.
Whether this was a sudden conviction, or whether it was the
gradual result of the successive disappointments which he was
destined to endure in his attempts to convince the world how
misplaced        its
                 confidence had been,            not easy
                                                it   is       determine;
                                                               to
but the latter       the more probable view.
                        is                             However this may
have been, Mr. Walsh was for           series

stant endeavour              to
                          induce the    principal    learned societies         of
Europe      print his communications. His posthumous papers

352             Prof. Boole's Account                   of the      late   John Walsh of Cork,
of letters which had been received by him, in reply to his appli
cations, from different learned societies.  The most interesting
of these  conveys a report by Poisson and  Cauchy on one of his
papers submitted to the Academy of Sciences.        That report
points out clearly what I have already had occasion to remark in
other instances, that Mr. Walsh's supposed discovery, in so far
as it was true, was not original.             In a subsequent report by
Poisson upon another communication, that great analyst, refer
ring to the former one, stated explicitly that Mr. Walsh's papers
did not merit the attention of the Academy.
    Certainly Mr. Walsh had no right to complain of the treat
ment which he received from the French Academy. Alluding,
however, to their rejection of his first paper, he observes in his
MS. memoir on the Calculus of Variations,—
    “Such was the commencement of a controversy, or rather
persecution, scarcely yet known to exist, but which will hereafter
be recorded as one of the most memorable aeras in the history of
human knowledge. . . . . It [the paper] merited a more profound
                                an its
consideration of          contents than M. Poisson thought well                                                 to
bestow          on
              them;        error     which M. Poisson was not aware
                                                   of
of  the consequences,         affecting  as the future history in  science                           of
      only
                                                                                   in of
not         his own   character,   and the character      the institution
of  which             he
                     member, but that
                           is
                            a                 the age    which    oflives.”                           he
    From the scientific societies           his own country and
                                                             of         the                                of
United    Kingdom,    Mr.Walsh received less attention than from the
French Academy. The latter stated the grounds upon which
his communications were declined; the former simply declined
them. To establish the rule               propriety      of
                                                        such cases      not       in                       is

     Prof. Boole's Account of the late John Walsh of Cork.           353
  Mr. Walsh continued to pursue his       avocation as a writing
master in Cork until the year 1845, when a paralytic seizure
threw him almost helpless upon the charity of those who had
known him in better days.       Among his papers is a subscription
list, testifying that the appeal made for him to the benevolence
of his fellow-citizens was not unheard.      Ihave however been
informed upon credible authority, that the first use which Mr.
Walsh made of the sum put into his hands was to rush into
print. It will not be surprising to learn that about this period
he was for some time confined in the city jail for debt, and that
shortly after he was an inmate of the Union. For the particulars
of this part of Mr. Walsh's life I am indebted chiefly to Mr. K.,
who, with a zeal and fidelity of which there are not many exam
ples, continued to retain his former relation to his old, and one
would think, helpless instructor.      In the solitary prison-cell,
or surrounded by paupers in the crowded Union, poor Walsh
might still enjoy the satisfaction of descanting upon his favourite
topics to his one remaining pupil.     It is a happy circumstance,
that, never having married, he had no family cares to weigh
upon his spirits. What time poor Walsh spent in the Union
in this his first visit to it I have not ascertained; but before
long he was removed, chiefly through the benevolent interces
sion of Dr. Finn, one of the physicians of the North                 In
firmary, to that Institution, where he remained for some months.
It is not improbable that at this period his disease may have
been accompanied by cerebral excitement, for he is described
as having been a rather intractable patient.        Peculiar notions
which he had formed on the          subject of religion led him to
attempt to convert some of his fellow-patients to the same
views.    I have been informed by one of the physicians who was
then in attendance at the infirmary, that he would rise at night
from his bed, and addressing the other patients, declaim in the
most earnest manner against the belief in the immortality of the
soul. The particular argument upon which he relied is stated
in a paper which a short time before he had printed under the
title of Metalogia.    It   is, his own words,
                                  in             asfollows:—
    “The Deity    iscoeternal with Time and Space, and has            all
his attributes infinite. He cannot confer any     of
                                               these attributes
on thinking beings; for     the Divine Being could confer any
                             if
one  of his attributes, viz. immortality, for example, therefore
inductively  he  could confer          all
                                  his attributes      on
                                                      mankind, and
make them    coequal   to
                        himself    everyinrespect, which would        be
contradictory and absurd.     Therefore, &c.”.   In the same paper,
which is  interesting  asbeing probably his last performance,         he
thus defines the science     Metalogia, and describes
                             of                            its

causes of such phaenomena as ignorance would persuade us had

would excite a smile, if the whole history did not too deeply
draw upon the sources of pity, as, First—“The falsehood of the

well that they would, but              I
                            forbear to utter them.’” Some time
after this Walsh consented to see a Roman Catholic clergyman.
To him he revealed the potent spell. It was the argument of
the Metalogia.
   It was at the commencement of an awful period that John
Walsh sought an asylum in the Cork Union.          The autumn of
1846 and the whole of the following winter and summer will
long be remembered in Ireland.        The food of a nation had
perished, and a desolation unexampled in modern times came
down upon the land. At the time of Mr. Walsh’s admission,
the Union house built for the accommodation of 2000 persons was
already crowded.    Ere long the number of       inmates exceeded          its
7000, and despite        of   all       provide accommodation for
                         endeavours                       byto

                                                  Walsh breathed

had for some time laboured.
    Mr. Walsh was man   a         agreeable address, and, when treated

and courteous manners.         In the affairs of the world he was                                     a
child, and was apt          become the dupe
                             to                                       of

With   proper  oeconomy        mighthe have saved sufficient        support                 to

moral   obligation,   but         of       an

this cause we    may   attribute the intemperate tone          his remarks            of

apparently to Mr. Walsh’s pertinacious obtrusion of his views
upon the public, says, “Let us hope that the person who in our
day occupies himself with printing his mathematical       reveries
against the method of fluxions and the first section of the Prin
cipia, and who insults the public taste by publishing the foulest,
most vulgar abuse of the ‘Saxon Philosopher,” may not succeed
in making his reflecting countrymen believe that the name which
all mankind have consecrated       receive only veneration repre

(averaging  half a mile) approximately represents the thickness of
the upper  or solid portion of the plutonic rock. Such     assume                 I
to have been the condition of things when that great elevatory
movement commenced which upheaved the westernmost side of
our island. It is irrelevant here to inquire whether this general
upheaval was effected by the mere expansion caused by increased
temperature, or by the introduction from other quarters of vast
masses of fluid matter beneath the elevated area.   It will be suf
ficient to admit that a special volcanic focus existed beneath the
syenitic axis of Malvern, and that                 its
                                        energies were called into
action  simultaneously  with the more general movement which
elevated the area        of
                     Herefordshire and Wales.
   We may now suppose that the elevatory forces beneath the
Cambrian region had accumulated            overcome the super

have saved them from denudation.    As, however, the coal-fields
of Wyre  Forest and the Clee Hills on the north present a less
development of the series than is seen in Dean Forest, I have
reduced the thickness of the Coal-measures and Carboniferous
limestone which once existed on the west of the Malvern Hills
to about 2300 feet. Adding these amounts to the thickness of
the Upper Silurian, Caradoc sandstone, and syenite, we obtain
a total of at least 13,000 or 14,000 feet for the amount of dislo
cation between the two sides of the Great Fault; an amount
greater, perhaps, than can be paralleled in any other instance of
a single fault which the world can produce.              Nearly one-half of
this amount may, however, be assigned to the more local forces
which elevated the Malvern syenite; so that about 7000 or 8000
feet would represent the difference of level between the strata in
the less disturbed parts of Herefordshire west of Malvern, and
their equivalents now buried beneath the New Red Sandstone of
Worcestershire, allowing about 1000 feet for the thickness of
the latter down to the subjacent Coal-measures.

    The fluid matter which suppose to have thus forced up the
solid syenite may itself have never reached the surface.                 The

   The district here referred to seems to be exactly analogous to
the well-known elevation crater of Woolhope, distant only seven
or eight miles to the westward, in which we also see the ineffec
tual struggles of a focus of volcanic energy to burst through the
incumbent strata.      Here also the concealed volcano has left a

 behind by the retiring waves of the denuding flood, after the
 previous removal of the thousands of feet of upper coatings.
     Soon after           I
                      began to turn my attention to these surface
 changes,       I
               was attracted to large masses of a ferruginous breccia
 which were frequently ploughed up and brought “to bank” by
 the labourers, who gave it the name of “Iron-rag.”                     found                         I
 afterwards that it was anciently extensively sought for and taken
 out of the hollows in which it lay, and smelted like bog iron-ore
  (which it sometimes resembles), when the fields of Sussex were
 filled with “iron furnaces.”         On closer inspection too, found                                 I
  that many hill slopes were enriched with a thin coating of dilu
 vial loam, and especially on the borders of the river-courses,
 high above the reach of modern alluvium. For the truth of this
 I   may cite the border slopes of the river Arun from Stopham to
  Rudgwick+, and onward over half the parish of Slinfold towards
  Horsham,_of the Adur from Henfield into the “forest-ridge”—
  and of the Medway in the greater part of               course through thea its

line of country from Tunbridge Wells toward Hastings, come
conveniently to our aid in identifying the existence of these
loams; and I particularly recommend the inspection of a section
near Etchingham Church”, where a luxuriant hop-garden is seen
standing on a bed of loam at least twenty feet in thickness; and
from thence for several miles across the valley of the Rother by
Rotherbridge, loam-beds of various thickness are traversed.    To
any one having leisure and patience for the task, I think it not

    HAYING  regard to the rotation of the earth, viz. the amount of                                              its

                            upon the Flight            of a Projectile.                           387
into account the rotation of the earth: but independently of this
consideration, it becomes a very interesting question on account
of the amount of effect that is produced.
   When I first heard of M. Foucault’s pendulum experiment, I
felt perfectly satisfied in my own mind that the principle was
correct, by imagining the case of a projectile discharged at an
object at some distance in the line of the meridian; and       com                           I
municated to Professor Barlow a solution of the     question,  as to
the apparent deviation of the plane of the pendulum in different
latitudes, by determining the angular velocity of the tangent to
the meridian, previously to any similar demonstration appearing
in print. Although this may not be the most elegant solution,
I   think it is more easily comprehended by the majority of per
sons. The investigation of the following problem is according
to this method.
     In the experimental practice of 1839, a 56-pounder of 97 cwt.
with a charge of 17 lbs. of powder and an elevation of 35°, pro
jected a ball 5600 yards, the time of flight was 34". What effect
 would the rotation of the earth have in causing the shot to fall
 to the right or left of the object fired    assuming the latitude at,
of   the place    52°7 as
     Suppose the earth                   to    be
                                perfect sphere, and
                                               a       geographical                a
 mile equal      2000 yards, and for the sake
                      to                         simplicity the gun      of

      Let AEQA' represent

the  equator  EQ, and                    let

388        Capt. E.     M. Boxer on the Effect of the Rotation of the Earth
tion of the shot may be found by drawing A'C parallel to AB, and
BC will be the difference of length of the two arcs AA’ and BB,
which will be the deflection of the shot. It will be observed
that the two tangents AB, AC are assumed to be parallel; but
this is not strictly correct; for the same reason as in the pen
dulum experiment, the apparent revolution of the plane of the
#
pendulum at any place upon the surface of the earth will not be
               hours.    And the reason of it is this: the path of the
point      A
         when projected upon a horizontal plane will be a curve;
therefore in the case of the projectile, the shot only receiving an
impulse due to the earth's rotation at the point A from which
position it is fired, the two tangents manifestly will not be per
fectly parallel; but the correction from this cause would be so
small as not to be of any moment in an approximation of this
sort. In the case of the pendulum, the path of the point of sus
pension when projected upon a horizontal plane being a curve,
unless the arc of vibration be infinitely small, the law of inertia
will cause the ball to take an elliptical motion, and an apsidal
motion will be the result. We will therefore take the two tan
gents to be parallel, or rather AA'to be equal to BC,

that there would be, and perhaps the most intelligible manner
of showing this         follows:—
                        is   as
   The line joining   the north and south points        any place upon of
the earth’s surface          tangent        great circle     that point
                              is     a

passing through the two poles; and the line joining the east

and west points is the tangent to another great circle passing
through the place at right angles to the former, and may be re
presented by the two lines NS, WE; these lines always of course
remaining at right angles to each other. We will suppose that
                                     TN
two guns are placed at P, which is 52°lat., the one pointing due
south and the other due west, at two objects 5600 yards distant
from P in these directions, and that they are both fired at the
same moment.       Now the directions in which the balls are fired
are at  right angles to each other, and there is nothing in the
rotation of the earth to alter the relative positions of the two lines
drawn from the guns to the shot during any moment of their flight.
   It has been shown that the shot fired due south will be
deflected 10.914 yards to the right of the object in 34". Let the
above figure represent the north and south, and east and west
lines, at the end of 34". Now the position of the ball fired due
south will be B, SB being equal to 10.914 yards; join PB, and
draw BP at right angles to PB; then if PB and PB' be equal,
WB will be 10.914 yards. This perhaps may not be rigorously
correct, as the correction necessary to be made on account of
the horizontal curved motion of the point where the gun stands
would not be so great in the one case as in the other.
   By the same reasoning, it can be shown that the deviation of
the shot will be the same in amount in the same latitude, or
nearly     so,
            whatever may        be
                                 the direction  ofthe range, and that
the deviation will  in   allcases    be   to
                                         the right   of
                                                      the object.
   In different  latitudes,     appears,
                               it        from what has been stated,
that the amount    of  deflection depends upon the length      of range,
the time     flight,
             of       and the cosine      of
                                          the latitude    of

will therefore be obviously greatest at the pole, and may be said
to vanish at the equator.
   It may be interesting here to ascertain what the deflection
ought to be, solving the question by the apparent deviation of
the plane of the pendulum in 34". The tangent of the arc of
vibration maybe looked at in the same light as the line drawn from
the gun to the shot at any moment of            flight; for there  its                             is

      The solution of the problem given by me in the paper before
 alluded to presents itself under an apparently different and rather
 less simple form.   Thus, in the case in question, we shall find
 according to that solution,
                          (prº-FQiy)(p3?--qay)(p3?--qay)

    The two determinants, however, are in fact identical, as is
 easily verified, for the coefficients of as and y” are manifestly
 alike; and the coefficient of aºy in the second form will be
 made up of the three determinants,
               a b d         a     c  c     b  b  c
                    b     c     e                b     d       d            c       c     d

of which the latter two vanish, and the first is identical with the
coefficient of aºy in the first solution. The same thing is obvi
ously true in regard of the coefficients of ry” in the two forms,
and a like method may be applied to show that in          cases the                                all
determinant above given     identical with the determinant
                                            is                                                                of   my

 408           Mr.       J. J.    Sylvester on a remarkable Discovery in the
 caring to calculate f, g”, it is enough for our present purpose to
 satisfy ourselves that g cannot be zero, as then the product
 would have a factor (a +8+y)*.          Hence, then, on putting
 a=be, 8=ac, y=ab, we see that the discriminant, when m is 0,
 will be of the form
                      s,"+fs.”. Sºº-Hys.”. s.
But when       is 0, H, vanishes, and there is no term s, or s, in
                     m
 H2. Hence evidently the discriminant Huo just found cannot
be dependent on H, H+, or HG; nor is it possible to make
Ho-HpH.”+qH.”. He, i. e. (p + 1)s,”--fs.”. s.”--gs.”. s. a per
fect square on account of g not vanishing; so there is no Hs
upon which Huo can depend.         Hence, admitting, as there seems
every reason to do, that the number of invariants of a function
of w, y of the degree m is m—2, we find that the four invariants
in the case of the first degree are respectively of the second,
fourth, sixth, and tenth dimensions, a determination in itself as
a step to the completion of the theory of invariants of no minor
importance.
   But it seems hopeless by means of these forms to arrive at the
desired canonical reduction.     The forms, however, of s, s, ss are
very remarkable as not rising above the 1st, 1st and 2nd de
grees respectively in             Also H, vanishes when m=0 and
                                           si,    s2,    ss.

   The marginal dia

method of putting the
pendulum in motion,
which ourobservations
proved to us must be
done with great pre
cision.  At the cir
cumferenceofthecircle
over which the pen
dulum was to oscillate,
a box A was made sta
tionary by means of
weights. On          its
                  upper
surface,  at the extremity nearest the circle, was placed           small                    a
block  of hard wood,               C,
                          which served for adjusting the proper
            elevation, and for supporting the thread which held

                                     a

neated, their affinities in many instances established, and philologists
have done something towards a solution of the subtle question of
their unity of origin. The general intellectual movement of the age,
the buoyant delight with which the philosopher ever explores the
more unbeaten tracks, and the interest with which the imagination
lingers about those regions of inquiry where facts merge in specula
tion, may in some degree account for the rapid advancement of the
science.    Man, too, is at length beginning to feel that the natural
history of his species constitutes an object of research, which, whilst
it more immediately concerns him, involves questions of equal          in
terest with any that can be agitated in other departments of science.
    Unwearied energy, a cautious critical spirit of investigation, and
 extensive philological research, entitle Dr. Latham to the highest
rank among modern ethnologists.         None have done so much to fill
the void created by the death of Dr. Prichard. Within the short
period of a year no less than three works have emanated from his
pen.     Of these, the first constitutes a tolerably comprehensive text
book of the science, and will prove of infinite service to the ethno
logical student. Of the other two, whose titles head the present
notice, the one is rather practical in purpose and character, the other
 deals with some of the more abstruse and intricate questions which
everywhere beset the inquirer in this department of science.        Each
work is arranged in the form of lectures, delivered, one series at
 Manchester, the other at Liverpool; additions having been made by
 the author prior to publication.
    ‘Man and his Migrations,’ though published the last, is anterior
 in point of subject matter, and first merits consideration.     The first
three lectures are devoted to a general review of the progress of
 ethnology, the several branches of the subject, their relative value,
 and the proper mode and order of investigation.          Its history is
 traced up from the imperfect notices of ancient writers, to the period,
 scarce half a century back, when principally through the labours of
 Blumenbach, it first assumed the aspect and fair proportions of a
 science.   A just tribute is paid to the researches of Dr. Prichard,
 who first associated the philological and zoological series of inquiries,
 and whose work will ever be invaluable as an encyclopaedia of facts
 for the student.    In reference to the influence of climate upon race,
 our author notices an hypothesis of Dr. Knox, that no race can
 maintain a permanent footing in any country for which it was not
 originally destined. In support of the hypothesis, Dr. Knox ad
 duces the American Anglo-Saxons, whose existence in the NewWorld
 he considers to depend on the continual infusion of fresh blood from
 the father-land.    Notwithstanding this constant renovation, he be
 lieves that   they  are gradually degenerating; a notion, we fancy,
 which our relatives on the other side of the water will be scarcely
 inclined to adopt.    Dr. Latham hazards no opinion on the matter,
 and   merely observes that “it is forcibly and confidently expressed.”
 We however doubt altogether the truth of the assertion. The fre
 quent migrations from this country are chiefly to settlements in the
 interior; and there is no reason for supposing that the families       in

                    Notices respecting New Books.                   415
habiting the larger towns have for years in any way depended on
such periodical reinfusion for life and vigour.    That climate has pro
duced some effect, as diminished muscular and adipose development,
a somewhat lower average longevity, we readily admit.        Change of
condition, too, has engendered different habits, a peculiar tone of
thought, &c.; but for the present let us not talk of degradation.
The following suggestions of Dr. Latham throw some light on the
subject of acclimatization.
   “A European regiment is decimated by being placed on the
Gambia, or in Sierra Leone.      The American Anglo-Saxon is said to
have lost the freshness of the  European—to     have become brown in
colour, and wiry in muscle.     Perhaps he has. Yet what does this
prove     Merely the effect of sudden changes; the results of distant
transplantation;   the imperfect character of those forms of acclima
tization which are not gradual.      It was not in this way that the
world was originally peopled. New climates were approached by
degrees, step by step, by enlargement and extension of the circum
ference of a previously acclimated family.     Hence the experience of
the kind in question, valuable as it is in the way of Medical Police,
is comparatively worthless in a theory as to the Migrations of Man
kind. Take a man from Caucasus to the Gold Coast, and he either
dies or takes a fever. But would he do so if his previous sojourn had
been on the Gambia, his grandfather's on the Senegal, his ancestor's
in the tenth degree on the Nile, and that ancestor's ancestor's on
the Jordan—thus going back till we reached the first remote patriarch
of the migration on the Phasis 2 This is an experiment which no
single generation can either make or observe; yet less than this is
no experiment at all, no imitation of that particular operation of
Nature which we are so curious to investigate.”—Pp. 69, 70.
   In respect to the phaenomena of the present distribution of races,
and the probable order of migrations, several circumstances must be
considered. Where contiguous races differ materially in character,
as in the case of the Majyars and surrounding European tribes, the
Hottentots and Kafirs, either encroachment or displacement of the
isolated family is implied. Where contiguous islands are peopled
by different tribes, the same conclusion is not necessarily forced
upon us. “The populations of two islands may agree, whilst that
of a whole archipelago lying between them may differ. Yet this is
no discontinuity; since the sea is an unbroken chain, and the inter
vening obstacle can be sailed round instead of crossed. The nearest
way from the continent of Asia to the Tahitian archipelago—the
nearest part of Polynesia—is via New Guinea, New Ireland, and
the New Hebrides.       All these islands, however, are inhabited by a
different division of the oceanic population.    Does this indicate dis
placement?     No. It merely suggests the Philippines, the Pelews,
the Carolines, the Ralik and Radak groups, and the Navigator's Isles
as the route; and such it almost certainly was.”
   We perfectly agree with Dr. Latham in making so light of the
migration from Asia to America.       To account for the peopling of the
New World, there is no occasion to call up from the deep any fabu
                                  2  F2

lous Atlantis, as a resting-place on the high ocean-road for adven
turers from Europe and Africa. Neither need we fall back on the
theory of a Scandinavian or Welsh colonization, although the North
 men are known to have visited Labrador, and probably the coast
more southward; and Madoc, for aught we know, may with his
followers have taken the same direction.              Everything favours the
 probability that the migration took place from north-eastern Asia,
 by Behring's Straits—which were narrower formerly than now—or
 by the Aleutian chain of islands. Such is the geographical continuity
 here, that Dr. Pickering asks, “Where shall Asia end, and America
 begin?’ If we look to the physical characters of the tribes inhabiting
 these parts, we find the American variety passing by insensible gra
 dations through the Koluschians and Esquimaux into the Mon
 golian.   This view is further favoured by certain traits of resem
 blance in customs and religious observances, and by such comparison
 of languages as has hitherto been instituted.
    Where physical and other characteristics fail in establishing affi
 nity, philology frequently comes to our aid, and vice versd. The
 difference between the Hottentots, Kafirs, Negroes, Copts, and other
 African races is very striking, but the labours of the philologist have
 succeeded in establishing a complete chain of affinity.         On the other
 hand, if we regard the Chinese in reference to their peculiar mono
 syllabic language, they appear completely isolated from surrounding
 races; but then physical character allies them beyond a doubt to
 other Mongolian families. We cannot accompany our author through
 the various stages of the argument.          It would appear, however, that
 while the  probable    course of   migration   may be readily traced in re
 ference to  America,     Africa,  Polynesia   and Australia, when we come
 to  Europe  difficulties  multiply.    The more we know of the ethnology
 of this quarter,   the more are we     mystified. - The effects of conquest,
 displacement, intermixture, must be considered; and the value of
 names, ancient or recent, be determined.            Isolated languages, too,
 the  Basque   and   Albanian,    stare us in the face, and archaeological
 research  presents    us with traces of a race anterior to the Celtic dis
 tribution. Our difficulties again would seem to increase tenfold
 when we reach south-western Asia, the supposed locality of the
 cradle of the human race. But if Dr. Latham has brought us no
 nearer to a satisfactory conclusion, he has at least stated fairly the
 complicated questions involved in the inquiry, and cleared the road
 for future progress.      His researches, as far as they have gone, lead
 him to believe that the human family originated somewhere in             in
tratropical Asia from a single pair, although he does not pretend to
have arrived at any proof of this.
    A knowledge of what we would term practical ethnology, of the
living characters of the races composing various nations, is indispen
sable alike to the historian and the statesman. Through such know
ledge only is the former in a position to reason philosophically on,
and trace to their true cause the movements that are ever convulsing
society; and the government of a dependency will be enlightened
and liberal in proportion as it is based on an intimate acquaintance

   The author has compared theory and experiment in various par
ticulars, and has found the agreement perfect.         It will be sufficient
to mention here one result of theory, which is of great generality
and of considerable elegance.       It applies to the system of rings seen
by reflexion in a mirror, either plane or curved, when a luminous
point is placed anywhere near the axis, and the eye occupies any
other position likewise near the axis.       The result is as follows:–
Join the eye with the luminous point, and likewise with              image,                                    its

            GENTLEMEN,                                                            July      1851.
      S M. Foucault's experiment is now an engrossing topic in scien
          tific circles, I beg leave to forward a verification of it for this
place, lat. 57°9' N., and to offer a few remarks tending to explain
 some of the phaenomena connected with it in a manner somewhat dif
 ferent from that usually adopted.
    Every experimenter is struck by a tendency of the pendulum to
 get into an elliptical orbit, and is disposed to ascribe the ellipticity
 to the imperfection of the apparatus, the resistance of the air, or some
 cause accidental and not essential to the experiment.                        But as a
 greater or less amount of ellipticity sooner or later makes its appear
 ance in every instance, it would appear reasonable to infer that it
 must proceed from some cause inseparable from the conditions of
 the motion; and on consideration, it is obvious that the path of the
pendulum from the very first will not be in a straight line across the
table, but in a curve approaching to an ellipse; for the body, when
 steadied at the circumference of the table and let go, is acted upon
by two forces, viz. gravity, which would carry it in a straight line
 over the centre, and a lateral impulse derived from the rotatory mo
tion of the circumference of the table with respect to                     own centre.     its

a motion in an opposite direction to that of the impulse.                      A little
attention to the circumstances will however remove this difficulty,
and show that the contradiction to theory is only apparent.
    If a pendulum is swung in a tub of water, drawn to the circum
ference and let go with a considerable lateral impulse from west to
east, the resistance of the dense fluid causes it at each successive
vibration to fall visibly short of the height or distance from the centre
attained by it at the previous one, and the line of apsides sensibly
recedes, i. e. moves from east to west, and this retrogression con
tinues until the whole fluid has acquired a rotatory motion).
    Now the resistance of the air must produce an effect similar in
kind, though not equal in degree, on a body moving in                          and this                   it,

over that expected from computation.                  The error arising from this

PENDULUM ExPERIMENTS AT THE PHILosophical                                        INSTITUTION,
                    BRISTOL.       BY THOMAS G. BUNT.
       To the Editors      of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,
   A   short time before I had concluded my pendulum experiments
in St. Nicholas Spire, I was requested by the Curator of the
Bristol Philosophical Institution to try what results I might be able
to obtain from a pendulum which had been erected there. The
suspending apparatus of this pendulum is precisely the same as
that which I last employed at St. Nicholas, and described in your
Number for July. The ball is an accurately turned sphere of lead,
weighing 35lbs; the suspending wire is of bright iron; and the length
of the pendulum, carefully computed from the number of its oscilla
tions in a given time, is 22.73 feet. A pointed wire projects from
the bottom of the ball, and reaches to within about ºth of an inch
of the azimuth circle, which is of 12 inches diameter, beautifully
engraved and printed on a card.           Across the circle, fastened down
by a pin through     its  centre,                           card,     inch wide,
                                                               of by
                                 isa   moveable index                            I
                                                                    of
divided   lengthwise     into  inches,  and laterally      parallel  lines,  Tºth
of   an inch asunder. By watching the motions             the wire over these
divisions the semi-axes major and minor               and (a  may   b)   read off, be
                   tenths, and the latter      hundredths,
                                                                         of of
the former   to                              to                 an inch.
   The Curator informed me, that the earlier trials             this pendulum
were   very   unsatisfactory.     At that time      was   suspended     from the
                                                       to it

by persons walking upon it; but             removing the suspending screw
            floor,       attaching      a on so
                                             strong bracket projecting from

          other sources of error entirely got rid of.
             In experimenting with this pendulum, I have again confined my
          self to very small arcs of vibration.         One of the many advantages of
          this method                    is,
                               that the ball and lower portion         the pendulum can                                    of

             My experiments with this pendulum are divided into two classes,

                               Mean value of a     = 1°7    inch.
    The latitude of the Philosophical Institution is 51° 27'16", the sine
of which x 15° 2'28" (= the angle through which the earth rotates
in 1 hour of mean time) gives 11°7638.
    The set of long experiments performed at St. Nicholas gave a
mean motion of 11°750 per hour, instead of 11°7631 as per theory,
the latitude being 51° 27' 0".
    The close agreement thus obtained between theory and experi
ment, by two very different pendulums, and at two different stations,
not only confirms the truth of Foucault's hypothesis, but seems to
show that the latitude of a place may be found, by means of this
experiment, with a considerable degree of accuracy.

            LXVI.   Onthe Mechanical Theory of Electrolysis.
                    By Prof. WILLIAM Thomson +.
1.      ERTAIN      principles discovered by Mr. Joule, and pub
           lished for the first time in his various papers in this
Magazine, must ultimately become an important part of the
foundation of a mechanical theory of chemistry. The object of
the present communication is to investigate, according to those
principles, the relation in any case of electrolysis between the
electro-motive intensity, the electro-chemical equivalents of the
substances operated on, and the mechanical equivalent of the
chemical effect produced in the consumption of a given amount
of the materials; and by means of it to determine in absolute
measure the electro-motive intensity of a single cell of Daniell’s
battery, and the electro-motive intensity required for the electro
lysis of water, from experimental data which Mr. Joule has
kindly communicated to me.
   2. If a galvanic current, produced by means of a magneto
electric machine, be employed in electrolysis, it will generate, in
 any time, less heat throughout      entire circuit than the equiva
                                               its

we find from the preceding expression, by substituting 20 x 5280
for a, be an electro-motive force of 1,549,000, or very nearly half
of that which is required for the decomposition of water.        It
is not probable that the current produced by the action of this
force alone through the wire connecting the platinum plates
would be found to be sensible; since a sensible continuous cur
rent with water and platinum electrodes in the circuit can
scarcely be obtained by any electro-motive force less than that
which is required for the continued gaseous decomposition of
water.    The existence of the inductive action might, however,                                   I
think, be tested by using a galvanic battery of very low intensity,
to assist the electro-motive force arising from induction, and by
adding a little nitric acid to the liquid till it is found that a sen
sible current is produced.     It might then be observed whether or
not, when the tide turns and the water flows in the other direc
tion through the channel, the electrical current becomes insensible,
or becomes less than it was; and whether it goes on again as
before when the tide turns again, and the water flows as it did at
first. There would probably be some difficulty experienced in
keeping the electro-motive force of the battery sufficiently con
 stant during twelve hours to make the experiment perfectly satis
 factory, and many difficulties that could not be foreseen might
 occur.   If, however,    any state
                                  in     the tide the mean rate per
                                                     of

 and  a half,  it probable
                     is     that the inductive action   might produce
a   sensible electric current               in   the      telegraph
                                                       wire without such
assistance.     It   very much                  to   that the experiment

who was the first to give an electro-chemical equivalent in abso
lute electro-magnetic    measure, and by other experimenters,

the number (15:438) of grains in a gramme, by the number
(3:2809) of feet in a metre.      The electro-chemical equivalent
of water is obtained  by multiplying  that of hydrogen by 9; and
according to the theory of equivalence in electro-chemistry,
it might also be obtained by multiplying the electro-chemical

     Mr. Leybourn  came to London, as most young men do, to
make his   way in the world. He had served an apprenticeship
to a business in Shields; but during that period had contracted
a strong propensity to the study of mathematics, and had deter
mined somehow or other (as he should find an opening) to render
his inclinations coincident with his “bread-and-cheese.” toils.
The companion of his pilgrimage was the late Mr. Glendinning,
the printer of Hatton Garden.
  Mr. Leybourn was fortunate enough to obtain the partiality
and friendship of Dr. Hutton; and being a handsome young

graphs of my deceased friend Professor T. S. Davies, have been confided to
me by Mrs. Davies.        From the strong internal evidence offered by the
opening paragraph of the above paper, I infer that the present are the
“remarks’ alluded to by Professor Davies at p. 394 of vol. xxxvi. S. 3, and
reserved by him for another occasion.        They were apparently not intended
by their author to stand alone; but in the difficulty, perhaps impractica
bility, of realizing the views of one so many of whose scientific aspirations
were frustrated by death, I hope to find a sufficient apology for so placin
them. They form at            events    all            an

an inch square, with the attractions of electro-magnets 30 inches
long and of the sections 1 inch square and 2 inches by 1.      In
these experiments the poles of the attractive magnets were ºth
of an inch distant from one another, and it is probable that the
deterioration of the attractive energy of the long electro-magnets
was principally owing to the greater extent of their polar surfaces.
    Hence also corrections ought to be applied to the attractions
of the larger electro-magnets in Tables I. and II. of my previous
paper, in order fairly to compare their respective powers with
those of the smaller magnets.
    These corrections would not, however, be of sufficient amount
to affect the general conclusion at which I have arrived, with
regard to the laws under which magnetic attraction (as applicable
to the production of motive force) is developed by electricity,
viz. that the attraction of two electro-magnets towards each other
is in every case represented by the formula M-W*E*, where M
demotes the magnetic attraction, W the length of wire, and E
the quantity of electricity conveyed by the wire in a giren period
of time; a formula modified merely by the effects of approaching
saturation, of the conducting power of the iron, and of the                            di
stance of the coils from the surface of the iron.
     Ihave observed that magnetic and electro-magnetic attractions
decrease in certain cases in the simple ratio of the distances.
This was found to be the case, particularly when the magnets
were long and the distance between them small.          Mr. Harris
has noticed the same    phºenomenon  in his “Experimental  Inquiries
concerning the laws of Magnetic Forces.”       It may be almost en
tirely accounted for by the complex action previously illustrated.
It is impossible to doubt, that the law of magnetic attraction is
that of the inverse square of the distances.

variety of forms have been given to the electro-magnet both as

It was my desire to make my experiments as exact as possible;
           I
and as wish the relation of them to be clear and definite,                                                     I
shall begin with some observations on the measure of current
electricity indicated by my galvanometer.

   The galvanometer of which                            I
                                 made use in the last series of
researches was connected with an electrolytic apparatus furnished
with very fine platina wires.          Voltaic currents of varied intensity
were then conducted          through the circuit which included the two
instruments, the circuit being broken at the end of two or three
minutes in each case, and the hydrogen measured in a graduated
glass tube.       The mean of ten trials gave 0.76 of a grain as the
quantity of water decomposed during cach hour by the electrical
current indicated by the unit of my former quantity num
bers.     Hence the current indicated by 118 of these last would
decompose nine grains, or one equivalent of water per hour.
This current             I
                     propose to call a degree in the present paper.
The dimensions of the single coil of the above galvanometer are
12 inches by 6, and the deviation of                                      its

   There was considerable difficulty in observing the smaller lift
ing powers.    Nevertheless it is certainly the case, that the power
retained after the circuit was broken was very nearly equal to the
lifting power, with small electric forces.
   When the whole current is not entirely cut off, but merely
reduced in intensity by the interposition of a bad conductor, a
surprising quantity of magnetism may be supported by a very
small electric force.                 I

LXIX.     On the Products of the Destructive Distillation of Animal

I now operated.      The preliminary process of rectifying the oil,

at a manufactory. The whole           was introduced     oil

half-full, and after two or three days, during which the agitation
was frequently repeated, more water was added, and the solution
of the bases separated from the oil. To this fluid acid was
added, so as to have a distinct excess; and it was then boiled for
the separation of Runge's pyrrol, to which reference has been
made in the first part of this paper.    As, however,    observed                           I
that a very  powerful and  pungent  odour was evolved when the
fluid began to boil, and the vapours presented the characteristic
reaction of pyrrol in a very high degree, the head of the boiler
was luted on, and the condenser attached, for the purpose of
endeavouring to obtain that substance, which in my previous
experiments          I
                had not done. The fluid which distilled over
carried with it a small quantity of oil, which, at the moment of
distillation, was perfectly colourless, but soon acquired a reddish
shade, and in the course of a few days became almost black.
The greater part of this                  oil
                                   passed over with the first portion                                      of
water; but the last traces adhered with great obstinacy                the                           to

of another base, in order to obtain which the fluid was slowly
evaporated, allowed to cool at intervals, and the sal-ammoniac
which deposited was separated by straining through cloth and
expression.  After the separation of several crops of crystals, a
dark-brown mother-liquor was left, which refused to crystallize
by evaporation on the water-bath, but on cooling solidified into
a mass of long foliated crystals, which soon deliquesced in moist
air. These crystals still contained traces of sal-ammoniac, for
the separation of which they were evaporated to complete dry
ness on the water-bath, and dissolved in the smallest possible
quantity of absolute alcohol, with the aid of heat.        The filtered
fluid, on cooling, deposited a few tabular crystals mixed with a
little sal-ammoniac, which was got rid of by a second filtration;
and the filtrate, when treated with animal charcoal and further
concentrated, solidified, on cooling, into a mass of large foliated
crystals.
    These crystals are long, transparent, and colourless plates,
entirely without odour, and with a pungent and bitter taste.
In moist air they deliquesce rapidly. Solid potash added to
their concentrated solution causes the immediate escape of a
gaseous base resembling ammonia, but distinguished by                                            its

cessive portions of that substance, as long as it continued to be

then introduced into a large retort, furnished with a thermome
ter and a tubulated receiver kept cold by ice, and connected first
with a U-tube immersed in a freezing mixture, and then with a
large vessel of water, in order to collect the gaseous bases which
began to escape with effervescence almost as soon as heat had
been applied.     At a temperature under 150°Fahr. drops began
to condense in the neck of the retort, and the fluid entered into
rapid ebullition.   At 212° the receiver was changed, and the                                                oil

could not in general be produced as evidence of the existence of
ethylamine, but under the particular circumstances of the case,
the next term of the same series on either side of it having
been detected, it may be considered as sufficiently conclusive of
its presence.
   The occurrence   of these bases enables us to establish, on
satisfactory grounds, the constitution of petinine.     In the first
part of this paper, an analysis of that base is given, which agrees
in the most perfect manner with the formula C* H% N, which
was also confirmed by that of         platinum salt.            its

464               Dr. Anderson       on the Products     of the
in my former preparations.               I
                                    subjected the whole of the oils
boiling above 212° to a systematic course of fractionation, each
fraction being distilled alone, and the product collected in a fresh
series of bottles, and the receivers changed at every ten degrees.
In the earlier rectifications each fraction spread itself over a
very large number of degrees, and showed little tendency towards
concentration to fixed points. The distillations were repeated
no less than fourteen times, but even after all this the indications
of boiling-points were extremely indistinct.       Sometimes in one
distillation certain fractions appeared larger than others, but
their pre-eminence disappeared again in succeeding rectifications.
Still a certain improvement was manifest, some of the fractions
being confined more nearly to the range of degrees within which
they had boiled at the previous rectification.       It was obvious,
from the whole   phaenomena   of the distillation, that the separation
of the different bases was going on, although with extreme
slowness; and at this point          I
                                  endeavoured, by the examination
of the    platinum   salts obtained at different temperatures,      to
determine the constitution of the bases which these fractions
contained; and as I knew from previous experiment that the
quantity boiling between 270° and 280° consisted of picoline,                          I
had from this fact indications of the temperatures at which bases
were likely to be found, and         I
                                have thus been enabled to deter
mine the existence of two substances belonging to the same
homologous series with that substance.
                                    Pyridine.
   The first of these bases, to which I give the name of pyridine,
occurs in the fraction boiling about 240°. This fraction has an
odour precisely similar to that of picoline, but more powerful
and pungent.       It is perfectly transparent and colourless, and
does not become coloured by exposure to the air.           It dissolves in
water in   allproportions, and       also readily soluble both
                                      is                                the    in

     Itis clear, from these analyses, that the salt obtained is that
of the base of which the analysis is given above; but it is equally
evident, from the presence of small quantities of picoline, that
the base itself was not obtained in a state of absolute purity,
notwithstanding the close approximation of the experimental
results with those required by theory.                have been struck       I
throughout the whole course of the investigation by the fact,
that when the fraction corresponding to the boiling-point of any
particular base has been analysed, results very nearly correct
were obtained, even when the substance was very far from being

tion, that the fraction boiling between 270° and 280°, after one
or two rectifications, gives precisely the results obtained from
pure picoline, although on further rectification the fluid will
begin to boil about 250°, and a small portion will still remain in
the retort when the thermometer has risen to 300°. It              how                            is,
ever, readily intelligible, that this should          the case when we      be

strata as a water-bearing one, as Mr. Prestwich has observed, is
the greensand.    The upper greensand of the Vale of Pewsey and
the subordinate valleys of that line of elevation, is satisfactorily
disposed of by Mr. Prestwich.      Its rainfall, like that of the chalk
of that line of country, is stopped  by the gault, and much of it
carried off southward by the Wiltshire Avon.  But the inflection
which brings down the Kennet eastward, and the synclinal which
throws out the waters of the Basingstoke Canal, would assist in
filling the beds under London, and feeding any Artesian wells
carried deep enough there.
    Of the greater and more important exposure of the Lower
Greensand in the great plateaua of Wolmar Forest, Hind Head,
the Hambledon, Hasscomb and Ewhurst Hills, there is more to
be said.

                     the London and Hampshire                     Basins.                          473
the Sevenoaks and Maidstome countries, we find that the flexures
which rule the line of the escarpment of the North Downs run
longitudinally south of the greensand escarpment; so that the
infiltration of the Reigate, Nutfield and Westerham Hills, is
turned toward London.             But further east in the Sevenoaks
 district, the flexure at Montreal, first noticed by Dr. Fitton and
afterwards spoken of by Mr. Hopkins as the “Sevenoaks anti
clinal,” and then another in the Maidstone district, which, as
Dr. Fitton informs me, brings the Weald clay up at Tenterden
 Heath, must produce a strong diversion, and throw much of the
rainfall of these districts severally into the Medway and the
Darent.
     But if I may venture an opinion on such a subject, neither
these nor any of the minor flexures and faults that can be traced
through the districts, the subject of Mr. Prestwich's research,
 should militate against a trial of the efficacy of Artesian wells
carried through the superincumbent strata into the greensand
under London.          The faults and flexuses that run cast and west
within the     great   synclinal cannot be of much moment as ob
 structive   agencies.    In my earliest publication have spoken of          I
 Windsor as a chalk “outlier-by-protrusion,” and of the Isle of
 Thanet as another, and it is probable that the Deptford chalk is
 intermediate in the same parallel of elevation; but these, and
 such as these, would not be likely to offer anyºerious obstruc
 tion to the constant infiltration from higher levels. Borings
 through the chalk to the level of the gault would probably absorb
 the supply of the springs which now issue from that stratum round
 London, and cspecially those which take their rise only during
 great engorgements of              it.
                                   Such are the “winter-bournes”                                    of
  Hampshire and Wiltshire, and such intermitting streams                  the               as
 Lavant and the      Bourne,   which               do
                                          not fill till the  ordinary  issues
 are insufficient for the transmission        the superabundant supply.

also advocated the use of the word “ Glauconite ” for greensand,

Wealden.      If this also had been adopted, it would have been
taken  up  by  the French geologists, who would have found their
subdivisions of Glauconie crayeuse and Glauconie sabloneuse con

ance.     This arrangementin relation to the long and important
flexure of Greenhurst on one side, and of the anticlinals of the
Wale of Wardour and Portsdown on the other, appears to corre
spond with that intercurrency, or digitation of fissures, which
Mr. Hopkins seems to consider an essential part of his system.*.
   I have previously spoken of the same arrangement on the
north side of the great anticlinal, in the decline respectively of
the Peasemarsh line, or more properly of the Froyle and Pop
ham-beacon line, and that of Pewsey, in the Basingstoke country.
   Lacerated Escarpments.-Although minor indications of this
phaenomenon,     familiar to the practised eye, occasionally peep
out, it is not often that we can get behind the mass of débris
with which the basset edges of stony strata are encumbered.                          I
have spoken of the entrance to a quarry of the upper green sand
stone at Ray Common near Reigate, exhibiting unequivocal
marks of the original violence.     That quarry is now in disuse,
but an open one is being worked a little to the east of the same
place, on the outskirts of which obscure indications of contor
tion and displacement are visible; such as to show, that if a
clean section could be obtained, transversely to the plane of
stratification, from the chalk above to the gault beneath, a good
specimen of lacerated escarpment would be brought into view.
There is at this point a very remarkably prominent terrace of
the stratum in question, illustrative of the projection given to
such indurated layers at the angles of cross fracture, the trans
verse valley of Smitham-bottom running out southward here by
Merstham and Redhillf.
   Denudation and Diluvium.—It has been suggested to me that
so remarkable a feature as the bare sand-rocks about Tunbridge
Wells ought to be noticed in any disquisition on the Weald
area, however summary.        No one can look at these rocks, or
walk over those of Eridge Park, without being struck with their
singular position and prominence, not in any way accountable
but on the supposition of the violent abrasion of diluvial flood.
It is well known that similar appearances are to be found the                  all
world over, where layers         of
                               durable and destructible materials
alternate with each other.     And no one can view the wilds                         of
Henley Heath and Bexley Hill, and the head         Hartingcombefof

 herbage), or walk round the slopes of Hind Head, and look down
 into the combs and gullies below, without having his mind filled
 with images of the mighty flux and reflux, that not very long
 ago (speaking in geological epoch) scooped out these valleys and

       I
       have not time to do more than notice the account of Mr.
 Mackie's bone-bed at Folkstone, in the last Number of the
 Journal of the Geological Society. It is a specimen, and within
 the range, of my subcretaceous zone of drift, into which a few
 pebbles of the lowest tertiary have strayed. Much loam and brick
 earth seem to enter into the composition of this bed, and make
 it,       the bottom
           as   in           the Peasemarsh gravel, more than usually

employ the other, and cases may perhaps arise in which it will
be necessary to use a combination of both forms.

Thus the solution of the proposed is made to depend upon those
of equations of a lower order.
   Examples might be given to illustrate the use of the theorems
(B) and (D), which are a generalization of (A) and (C); but the
method must be plain from what has been done, the only dif
ference being that we should have p(x) in the room of a, and
$(D) in the room of D, and the symbols ºr and a would be more
general.
   In reducing equations to the forms (1), (2), &c., we shall
obtain from the same equation results of different forms by giving
different forms to the arbitrary functions X(w), A(D); which is
one advantage which these functions give us, and we must give
          .
them that form which will render our transformed equation the
most convenient for solution.   But in some cases, instead of sup
posing Ma), A(D) integer, or even rational functions, of w and
  , we       so determine their form as to take away from the
equation functions of them which are neither integer nor rational.
   The examples (5) and (6), with their solutions, might be de
duced from those of (3) and (4) by the commutation of symbols
mentioned further back, and by a suitable change in the func
tions concerned; and it may be presumed universally, that by
making this interchange of symbols in any linear equation and
itsits
    solution, we shall obtain                  as

one fluid, water for instance, might be applied to other fluids.
   A very simple law of this nature was expressed by Dalton.
Calling those temperatures which belong to equal tensions cor
responding temperatures, the law ran thus:—In the case of any
two fluids the differences between the corresponding temperatures
are    all   equal.
   This law agrees pretty well with experience      the case                                              in                 of

experimental researches of Avogrado and Faraday to be preferable
to the law of Dalton, still the manner in which M. Groshans
deduces his equations leaves much to be desired.      He premises
the deduction by two equations which can only be regarded as
approximately correct, inasmuch as they contain the expression
of the law of Mariotte and Gay-Lussac for vapours at their
maximum density. For the further development, however, he
makes use of the following proposition:—If in the case of any
two vapours the temperatures are so chosen that the tensions
of both are equal, then, if the density of each vapour at the
temperature in question be measured by       density   the boiling    its
point, these densities are equal.  This  proposition     introduced                    is at

    This equation is evidently the mathematical expression of the
law of tension mentioned above; for to apply the function which
in the case of any one fluid determines the tension from the tem
perature, to any other fluid, it is only necessary to multiply the
temperature by a different constant, which constant is easily
found when the tension for a single temperature is known.
    It is thus shown, that, in so far as the validity of equation
 (Va.) is granted, the two laws expressed by the equations        and                                    (I)

not only from non-volatile chlorides, but also from those metals
the chlorides of which are easily volatilized.     That arsenic might
be volatilized in this   way,  and be thus   detected,  occurred to Dr.
Clarke, Professor of Chemistry in Marischal College, Aberdeen,

some years ago, but, so far as know, he has not prosecuted the
subject. My attention was lately drawn to it more particularly,
by the perusal of a paper, in which processes are described
for the separation of metals from one another, in analysing
their ores and alloys”.      The perusal of that paper induced me
to take up the consideration of the subject, and the results of
the experiments which                      I
                             have made have confirmed the opinion
I  had  entertained,  that the volatilization of arsenic, by the action
of  chlorine, as  suggested  by Professor Clarke, would add another
to the many tests which we have of the presence of arsenic.
   The question at first occurred, How is arsenic, in the state of
arsenious acid, to be made to unite with chlorine? This was sug
gested by the results of the trials recorded in the paper referred                                        to,

  experiment, toward which the increments in the force continually
  approach, as if the opposed bodies were only susceptible of a given
   amount of induction under the existing circumstances.
      Taking the force toward the limit of action, the amount of induc
   tion is in some inverse ratio greater than that of the simple distance;
   it was not however in any case found to exceed the inverse sesqui
  plicate ratio or ; power of the distance; as the distance is diminished
   the induction is as the distance inversely, but may in the mean time
   be as the 4 or ; powers of the distances inversely, or near those
   powers.     On further diminishing the distance, the induction was
   found in certain cases to be as the 3 and         powers of the distances,
   thus  causing   a series of changes   in the law of magnetic attraction as
   commonly observed, which have hitherto greatly embarrassed the
   views of philosophers in their inquiries into this species of force.
   When the convergence is slow the induced force may not for a long
   series of terms appear to change, but when from any circumstance
   the convergence is accelerated, then the changes become more
   marked and successive. As a general result, however, the author is
-
   led to conclude, that magnetic induction is as the magnetic intensity
   directly, and from the       to the # power of the distance inversely.
      In the course of these inquiries, it was found that the induc
   tive action depended, not on the mass, but on the surface of the
   magnetic substance, and that magnetism, like electricity, exhibits a
  decrease of intensity when the surface of the iron upon which it is
  disposed is extended. A hollow cylinder of soft iron was carefully
  prepared in a lathe, and fitted with a solid interior core capable of
  being drawn out from within the cylinder; this compound body was
   exposed to the inductive action of a powerful magnetic bar, and the
   induced force estimated by the reciprocal force of attraction ex
   erted between the mass and a cylinder of soft iron suspended from
  the author's magnetic balance, or from one arm of a light beam, set
   up in the way of a common balance. The degree of force being
  observed, the solid core was drawn out so as to extend the surface
  of the mass under induction.         The intensity immediately declined,
  and   again   increased on   replacing   the solid within the hollow cylin
  der, being a result of exactly the same character as that produced
  by the extension of an electrified surface.        When the interior solid
  core was removed altogether, then the induced force remained un
  changed, it being precisely the same whether the body were taken
  hollow or solid. In accordance with this result, hollow cylindri
  cal magnets were found as susceptible of magnetic power as solid
  masses of the same temperament and dimensions; an unmagnetized
  solid and tempered steel cylinder, placed within a hollow tempered
  steel cylinder, does not become magnetic on touching the external
  cylinder in the usual way. The magnetism, however, of a hollow
  cylindrical magnet is partially destroyed by placing within it a cy
  linder of soft iron, or the reverse poles of another magnet; nor can a
  hollow cylinder of tempered steel having a solid core of soft iron
  be rendered magnetic by the usual methods of touch.              These re
  sults, it is considered, supply the experiments thought by Mr. Barlow

                                        Royal Society.                                                               495
 so desirable to confirm his deductions relative to the action of iron
 shells and balls on the compass needle, which he found to be as the
 # power of the surface, whatever the weight and thickness of the
 liton.
     The author now proceeds to notice the investigations of Hawks
 bee, Brook Taylor, Muschenbroek and others, and thinks the inqui
 ries of these philosophers have not been sufficiently considered or
 appreciated; that instead of the results exhibiting anomalies and
discrepancies, they are really necessary consequences of the more
 elementary laws of induction, and perfectly explicable upon the fun
damental principles of magnetism. He endeavours to show, that by
 the changes in the law of the induction, as already stated, laws of
 force will arise perfectly coincident with the results arrived at by
 Hawksbee, Brook Taylor and others; that is to say, the law of force

 by Brook Taylor; or as the # power inversely, as found by Martin;
or in the inverse duplicate ratio of the distance, as observed by
Lambert; or as the simple distance inversely, as determined by Mus
chenbroek in several cases; or it may be as the cubes of the                                                             di
stances inversely, as stated by Newton.                 Examples are given in
 which these several laws were found to obtain.
     In examining the laws of magnetic repulsion, similar results are
arrived at. The inductive forces here, however, are subversive of
the existing polar arrangements; hence the apparent repulsion: so
long as the existing magnetic polarities remain unchanged, the law
of force will be generally as the second power of the distance in
versely; when the distances are small, it will be inversely as the
simple distance; when the inductive actions subvert the existing
polarities, then the law of force appears irregular and subject to no
regular variation, as observed in              the early experiments with re
                                                         all
pellent poles.

   The author admits the difficulty in the way of the employment of
such terms as quantity of magnetism, magnetic charge, and the like,
and therefore only employs them according to the common accepta
tion of such terms, and not as referring to any particular hypothesis:
he thinks there must necessarily be in such inquiries an element fairly
enough expressed by the general term quantity as expressive of the re
lative or absolute magnitude of the cause, whatever it be, upon which
the observed effects depend, and thinks it so far essential to obtain
exact quantitative measures.       In electricity we may estimate the
charge conveyed into a battery by means of the unit measure, and we
can at pleasure operate with one-half, one-third, &c. the quantity of
electricity numerically expressed; but we have as yet no such mea
sure in magnetism, and we are quite uncertain as to the quantity of
effective magnetism in operation.     The author hence endeavours to
verify the law of magnetic charge just mentioned by a direct quan
titative experimental process.     A cylindrical rod of soft iron being
surrounded     by three successive coils of covered copper wire, was
placed under the trial cylinder of the magnetometer and exposed to
the operation of one or more precisely equal and similar batteries;
one coil being appropriated to each battery.        It is inferred that if
one battery and one coil produced one measure of magnetism, two
batteries and two coils would develope two measures, and so on; so
that we should have only to determine the attractive force under
this condition ; now the attractive forces were found to be as the
square of the number of batteries in action upon this cylinder, that
is to say, as the square of the magnetism induced in the iron; hence
the quantity of magnetism is as the square roots of the reciprocal
forces.    If therefore the reciprocal force between a magnet A and
a cylinder of soft iron taken at a constant distance were represented
by an equivalent of 4 grains, whilst the similar force with a magnet
B at the same distance were represented by 9 grains, then the effect
ive quantities of magnetism and operation in each case would be as
 W4 : V5, that is as 2: 3.
    Availing himself of this law, the author endeavours to deduce     ex
perimentally the magnetic development in different points of a regu
larly tempered and magnetized bar, taken between the magnetic
centre and extremities; and he finds by a very careful manipulation,
that the magnetism in these points is directly as the distance from
the magnetic centre; the reciprocal force on a small trial cylinder
being as the squares of the distances from the centre.
    Some striking analogies in the state of a magnetized steel bar and
the common Leyden jar are noticed in this communication, from
which it would appear that the conditions of electrical and magnetic
force are precisely the same, and from which the author concludes
that magnetic attraction is reducible, as in electricity, to an action
between opposed surfaces; he thinks that a predisposition to identify
these forces with that of gravity and other central forces has led
many profound mathematicians and philosophers to question unduly
the accuracy of every result not in accordance with such a deduction.
He observes that Sir Isaac Newton considered “that the virtue of the

Communicated by Thomas Bell, Esq., Sec. R.S. &c.
   In this communication the author describes the effects that were
produced on a moderately sensitive galvanometer by exposure to
the sun's rays, and which were observed by him during a period of
four months, commencing on the 14th of November, 1850. The
instrument is described as consisting of forty-six turns of covered
copper wire, ºth of an inch in diameter. The helix is blackened with
ink at   its
           southern extremity, and has    single magnetized sewing   a
needle suspended               by
                           about sixteen inches         silken fibre       of  centre.               in   its

alone, nor without the formation of a complete electrical circuit.
But in these experiments hitherto the completion of the circuit
had not been attempted.         During the course of the experiments
the circuit was established     by  means of a connecting wire between
the   mercury    cups,  and the circuit was again and again completed,
and as    frequently   broken,  without any deviation occurring in any
of the  results,  either during  the progression, stationary condition, or
decline of the needle.
    That these phenomena were the result of the action of the sun's
rays upon the helix itself, was further shown, from the circumstance
that when the sun remained clouded for days together, there was no
deflection of the needle; that when the helix was partly shaded by a
pillar, or the window-frame, the instrument indicated an amount of cur
rent corresponding to the number of coils of wire illumined; and that
the illumination of the whole bundle of wires at the southern extremity
of the helix was necessary to produce the usual results, for when a
burning lens of high power was employed to condense the rays and
throw them in a focus upon one or two wires only, no deflection of
the needle was observed. It was also further shown that the action
of the rays upon the helix was attributable to that portion situate
chiefly at the southern extremity, for the whole instrument was in a
variety of ways and at different periods shaded from the solar rays;
but its results were unaffected, unless the south end was obscured,
 when the needle immediately declined; or the north end was illu
 mined when the deflections were lessened, or the motion of the
 needle took place in the opposite direction.
    A pile of red-hot burning embers held in the vicinity of one ex
tremity of the helix caused a slight deflection of #2, and when held
at the opposite extremity, caused a deflection in the opposite di
 rection.                                                    -
    The author states a remarkable circumstance, viz. that vibrations
and neutral action were observed during bright sunshine about the
 11th of December, and again on the 23rd of January; that previous
to the former period the deflections of the needle were to the left
hand; between these two periods they were to the right-hand; and
 after the latter period always to the left, after a given hour of the day.
 During the early sun, however, they were to the right-hand, and as
 the sun approached a given altitude, they were invariably to the
deft-hand.     Deflections observed during the summer season were
also to the   left-hand;   but those of the early sun were not submitted
 to the test.
    On testing the instrument with a voltaic pair, it was shown that
 the current passed from south to north above the needle with the early
sun, or when the indicator deflected to the right-hand, and beneath
the needle with the rays which proceeded from a considerable eleva
tion, or when the needle deflected to the left-hand.
    In conclusion, the author states that the results of these experi
 ments evince to his mind more than ever the unity of force; and
that experimental evidence appears to justify the conclusion at
 which he has long since arrived, that there is one, only, universal force

the    following   manner:—One           the extremities of       the tube was            of

 I    have divided the analyses into three series:—1st, analysis               the                           of

                                                                          in

                 in                                  Taking     the mean       the                           of

find that 10,000 vols. normal atmospheric air contain 4:008 carbonic
                                    of
acid, 2101'425 oxygen, and 7894.557 nitrogen, which are nearly
 the same proportions          those which have been found for normal
                                        as

                           in             Europe. However,

 the atmosphere,          readily seen that the composition
                            it   is                                      the air               of                  is
 not absolutely constant.        Perceptible differences exist, which vary
with the meteorological conditions; thus after               long rain the car   a
 bonic acid and     oxygen    are always       smaller   proportion
                                                              in        than after
a   long drought; however, these differences are only appreciable
 when the analysis has been carried out with very great accuracy.
    In the New World, where the seasons are more defined than                                                      in
 Europe, these variations are more easily detected. During the fine
 season the normal air always contains             little more oxygen and
                                                                     a                                             a
little more carbonic acid than             the season    in  the rains. Thus,    of

  The greatest difference amounts consequently to 1:434 for the
carbonic acid and to 4-167 for the oxygen.   These differences are
nearly the same as those which I found between the atmospheric air
of Paris and that of Havre, analysed under meteorological condi
tions corresponding to the two seasons of South America.
   It follows that the composition of the air which we respire is the
same in Europe and in the New World as far as regards the oxygen
and the nitrogen, whether it be taken at the level of the sea or at an
elevation of 3000 metres; the only difference is the amount of car
bonic acid, which appears, especially on the high mountains, to be
somewhat greater than in the valleys and on the sea-shore.
   With respect to the analyses of the air collected on the ocean, they
have yielded a very interesting result. In the day-time this air con
stantly contains a little more oxygen and a little more carbonic acid
than during the night.     This difference becomes more perceptible
as we leave the coasts; and it is probably owing to the solar rays,
which, heating the surface of the sea during the day, disengage a
portion of the gases which the sea-water holds in solution, and which,
as is well known, contains more oxygen and carbonic acid than
atmospheric air.

   The analyses of the abnormal air of New Granada present us
with results not less interesting. From time to time, once or twice
in the year, the atmosphere of New Granada contains an extraordi
nary proportion of carbonic acid, which coincides with an appre
ciable decrease of oxygen, and consequently alters the constitution
of the atmosphere in a very marked manner.
   The great number of volcanoes which exist in the New World,
and the clearing of forests which are effected every year in this
country, may cause these alterations.    It        fact, during these is,   in
clearances that the constitution                    of

   3. If oxygen gas is introduced in small quantities at a time into
the bulb filled with nitric oxide, the magnetism diminishes until the
proportion of the two gases becomes sufficient to form hyponitric
acid (N.O.).     The action is then apparently null. On adding still
more oxygen, the magnetism reappears and continues to increase.

geologists, that dolomite has been formed naturally by aqueous
agency, is proved by this experiment not to be absolutely correct, as
it may also have been formed by magnesian vapours issuing from the
interior of the earth, and gradually converting limestone into dolo
mite.—Comples Rendus, vol. xxxiii. p. 64.
                       NEW PHOTOGRAPHIC PROCESS UPON GLASS.
                               BY M. J. R. LE MOYNE.
   The process in question is completely practical, and does not
merely refer to a few accidental occurrences.    Nearly a year ago, I
found that the    impressions upon glass sometimes presented a posi
tive aspect, and after a short period, my researches in this direction
furnished me with tolerably good specimens; but I did not succeed
in arriving at a sure and constant method until after making a long
series of continuous attempts; these have extended to the present
time.
   The object of most of my experiments was to overcome the well
known inconveniences of the albuminous plates, and, independently
of the positive process, I have made considerable progress in the
production of the impressions by the following modifications, which
in fact constitute a new method of preparation                                        :-
    1. Purification of the albumen of the whites of eggs by keeping
them for a long time, and even adding sugar to produce slight fer
mentation, which clarifies them much better than the beating process
which is generally adopted. This first addition of sugar (8 grs. to
each white of egg) does not prevent the necessity of subsequently
adding the quantity already recommended (38 to 46 grs.) to obtain
greater sensibility to light; and with the processes I afterwards
employ, the presence of this substance increases the adhesion of the
coating, instead of diminishing      which has been urged   it, an ob                                       as
jection           to   it.

    REFLEXION OF LIGHT FROM THE SURFACE OF LIQUIDS.
  The following are the conclusions of M. Jamin, from a series of
experiments recorded in the Annales de Chimie et de Physique for
February            1851       :—
   1st. Liquid surfaces polarize light incompletely and elliptically.
   2nd. Liquids having a high index of refraction have a positive
anomaly, or difference of phase, between the principal components
of the reflected motion.                                        -
   3rd. This   anomaly   becomes   negative when the index is  very small.
   4th. There are substances, whose indices are about 1:4, whose
polarization is rectilineal.
   5th. The laws of the intensities and anomalies are represented      by
                                                             º
the formulae of M.   Cauchy.
   6th. If substances are superposed, the reflexion from their surface
of separation follows the same laws.
   7th. In this case it is impossible to predict the value and the sign
of the coefficient of ellipticity.
   The memoir moreover includes a table of the constants of reflexion
for a number of liquids.—Journal of the Franklin Institute, July 1851.

                      following
                       pressure  and expansion of gaseous sub
stances may be deduced from that which may be called the
hypothesis of molecular vortices, being a peculiar mode of con
ceiving that theory which ascribes the elasticity connected with
heat to the centrifugal force of small revolutions of the particles
of bodies.
    The fundamental equations of this theory were obtained in the

from the want of experimental data,                              its

          SECTION        I.   On the Hypothesis                   of Molecular         Vortices.
   (2.) The hypothesis of molecular vortices may be defined to
be that which assumes—that each atom of matter consists of a
nucleus or central point enveloped by an elastic atmosphere, which
is retained in       position
                        its               by
                                   attractive forces, and that the elasticity
due      heat arises from the centrifugal force
         to                                               those atmospheres, of
revolving       or
               oscillating about their nuclei          central points.  or
   According        this hypothesis, quantity

of the molecular revolutions or oscillations.
    Ideas resembling this have been entertained                 many natural      by
philosophers from          very remote period; but

I  have therefore left indeterminate.              Those questions are the
following.                                      -
  First. Whether the elastic molecular atmospheres are conti
nuous,            discrete particles.                                                   a be

                                                                              to

         a                matter,     wholly the result

                                                           the    is                                  of
repulsions   discrete particles.
                   of
   Secondly. Whether       the centreat each molecule there        of                                      is

                  as applied to Gases and Vapours.                  511
a real nucleus having a nature distinct from that of the atmo
sphere, or a portion of the atmosphere in a highly condensed
state, or merely a centre of condensation of the atmosphere, and
of resultant attractive and repulsive forces.      Therefore, although
the word nucleus    properly  signifies a small central body, I shall
use it in this paper for want of a better term to signify an atomic
centre, whether a real nucleus or a centre of condensation and
force. I assume, however, that the volume of the nucleus, if any,
is inappreciably small as compared with that of the atmosphere.
    (4.) I have now to state a supposition, which, so far as      I  am
aware, is peculiar to my own researches.         It is this:–that the
vibration, which, according to the undulatory hypothesis, constitutes
radiant light and heat, is a motion of the atomic nuclei or centres,
and is propagated by means of their mutual attractions and repul
Szons.
   It will be perceived at once, that from the combination of this
supposition with the hypothesis of molecular vortices, it follows
that the absorption of light and of radiant heat consists in the
transference of motion from the nuclei to their atmospheres, and
conversely, that the emission of light and of radiant heat is the
transference of motion from the atmospheres to the nuclei.
                                               I
   It appears to me that the supposition have stated possesses
great advantages over the ordinary hypothesis of a luminiferous
aether pervading the spaces between ponderable particles, espe
cially in the following respects.
   First. The propagation of transverse vibrations requires the
operation of forces, which, if not altogether attractive, are of a
very different nature from those capable of producing gaseous
elasticity, and which it is difficult to ascribe to such a substance as
the aether is supposed to be; while attractive forces between the
atomic centres are perfectly consistent with their being kept
asunder by the elasticity of their atmospheres.
   Second. The immense velocity of light and radiant heat is a
natural consequence of this supposition, according to which the
vibrating masses must be extremely small as compared with the
forces exerted by them.
                                                                        -
    Third. According to the most probable view of the theory of
dispersion, the unequal refrangibility of undulations of different
lengths is a consequence of the distances between the particles

SECTION        II.   Investigation      General Equations
                                         of    the                              between    the
                       Heat and the Elasticity of a Gas.
    (5.)   Inow proceed to investigate the statical relations between
the heat and the elasticity of a gaseous body; that is to say,
their relations when both are invariable. The dynamical rela
tions between those phaenomena which involve the principles of
the mutual conversion of heat and mechanical power by means
of elastic fluids, and of the latent heat of expansion and evapo
ration, form the subject of another paper.
    (6.) It is obvious that, in the condition of perfect fluidity, the
forces resulting from attractions and repulsions of the atomic
centres or nuclei upon their atmospheres and upon each other,
must be considered as being sensibly functions merely of the
general density of the body, and as being either wholly inde
pendent of the relative positions of the particles, or equal for so
many different positions as to be sensibly independent of them;
for otherwise a certain degree of viscosity would arise, and con
stitute an approach to the solid state.         For the same reason, in
the state of    perfect   fluidity,   each atomic atmosphere must be
considered as    being  sensibly    of uniform density in each spherical
layer described round the nucleus with a given radius, and the
total attractive or repulsive force on each indefinitely small por
tion of an atmosphere must be considered as acting in a line
passing through           its
                        nucleus; that force,                  the density,

    (13.) Any such motion of the particles of a portion of matter
confined in a limited space will in general give rise to a centri
fugal tendency with respect to that space.         In order to obtain
definite results with respect to that centrifugal tendency in the
case now under consideration, it is necessary to define, to a cer
tain extent, the general character of the supposed movement.
   In the first place, it is periodical ; secondly, it is similar with
respect to so large a number of radii drawn in symmetrical direc
tions from the atomic centre, as to be sensibly similar in                                                          its

atmospheres of two atoms of the same or different kinds, the
conditions of permanency laid down in article 13 for vortices in
the same atmosphere, these conditions take the following form:—
   First. The superficial atomic mean elasticities must be the
same; in other words, the superficial atomic mean densities
must be inversely as the coefficients of elasticity of the atmo
spheres.   This is the condition of equilibrium of pressure.
   Second. The law of variation of the elasticity from the centre
to the circumference of a vortex, as expressed in equation (5),
must be the same for both atoms; and this law depends on the
quantity        -

   Temperature is a function of universal constants, and of the vor
tical vis viva of the atomic atmospheres of so much of the substance
as would, in the condition of perfect gas, fill unity of volume under
unity of pressure at some standard temperature.
   The equation (12a) further shows, that in any two perfect gases,
the respective values of the quotient of the pressure by the density
corresponding to the same temperature, bear to each other a con
stant ratio for                  all

the unit of pressure is an atmosphere of 760 millimetres of mer

density in the perfectly gaseous state at 0°Centigrade, under a
pressure of one atmosphere, which has been found from M. Reg

 Mº,        M. Regnault's      experiments   were made at temperatures

   The table shows only one instance in which the difference be
tween the result of the theory and that of experiment exceeds
•0000136; the limit, according to M. Regnault, of the errors of
observation capable of arising from one cause alone,—the uncer
tainty of barometric measurements.                     That discrepancy takes
place in one of the determinations of the coefficient E' for car
bonic acid gas under the pressure of one atmosphere.                        In the
other determination, the discrepancy is less than the limit.
    The agreement between theory and experiment is most close
for the highest pressures; and M. Regnault has shown (p. 100)
that the higher the pressure the less is the effect of a given error
of observation in producing an error in the value of the co
efficient.
    The theory is therefore successful in calculating the coefficients
of dilatation of gases, so far as the means at present exist of put
ting it to the test.

     (36.) The principle stated           Section   in                II.
                                                        article 11, that the
elasticity       of   the atomic atmosphere     proportionalis         density,          to   its
might                                     saying,     by
            of be
                 otherwise  expressed               that the elasticity    any                       of
number           portions       of
                              atomic  atmosphere,    compressed  into    given                      a
space,     is    equal     to
                           the sum     the elasticities which such portions
                                                of
would respectively have,                 if they occupied the same space separately.

                        as applied to Gases and Vapours.                                  541
  If  the same principle here laid down for portions of atomic
atmosphere of any one kind of substance be considered as true
also of portions of atomic atmosphere of substances of different
kinds mixed, and if it be supposed that when two or more gases
are mixed, there is no mutual force exerted between atoms of
different kinds, except the elastic pressure of the atomic atmo
spheres, it will then evidently follow,
    First, that the mixed gases will only be in equilibrio when
the particles of each of them are diffused throughout the whole
space which contains them.
    Secondly, that the particles of each gas taken separately will be
in the same condition as to density, elasticity, arrangement and
mutual action, and also as to gravitation, or any other action of
an external body, as if that gas occupied the space alone.
    Thirdly, that the joint elasticity of the mixed atomic atmospheres
at any given point will be the sum of the elasticities which they
would respectively have had at that point, if each gas had occu
pied the space alone.
    Fourthly, that the value of the elasticity, positive or negative,
resulting from the attractions and repulsions of separate atoms,
will be the sum of the values it would have had if each gas had
occupied the space alone.        And,
    Fifthly, that the total elasticity of the mixed gases will be the
 sum of the elasticities which each would have had separately in
 the same space.
     If there are any mutual actions between the particles of dif
 ferent gases except the elasticity of the molecular atmospheres,
 these conclusions will no longer be rigidly true; but they will
 still be approximately true, if the forces so operating are very
 small. This is probably the actual condition of mixed gases.
     (37.) On applying the same principle to the case of a gas
  mixed with a vapour in contact with                 its
                                                 liquid,     obvious, that
                                                                      of is
                                                                 it
if   the attractions and    repulsions      the  particles
                                                of           the gas upon
  those  of the vapour are null,        inappreciable, the direct effect
                                           or                                               of
  the  presence      of
                      the  gas upon    the elasticity assumed       the va         by
  pour   at   given temperature will also

                                                           inappreciable.
      The gas, however, may have            slight indirect influence,

ciently great.     It will be afterwards shown by experiment that
the result last mentioned actually occurs.
    But it is not the size of the flame alone which determines the
character of the current, it also depends upon the intensity of
the combustion.       The portions of the lamp No. 2 which surround
the wick are    exactly  of the same dimensions as the corresponding
parts of No. 1. In the experiment, however, the wick of No. 2
was a simple one, and had been used for some time.             On raising
it until a flame of equal magnitude with the former was attained,
the needle still showed a weaker current. Even the lamp No. 1
itself, after having burnt for some time, was no longer able to
cause a divergence of 20°.
    The inclined position, which, as before stated, was given to
the platinum foil, is more favourable than the horizontal, for
the latter causes a weaker combustion.           When the platinum was
held at some     height  above the     chimney,   and was changed from
a horizontal to an inclined       position,  the angle  was increased by
the change from 9° to 10°; this is a natural result of the fact,
that a greater draft is permitted by the latter position, and thus
the power of the flame is increased.           The platinum being held
high above the chimney in a horizontal position, an angle of 5°
was observed; and on inclining                          it,
                                            the angle increased     6°8.                        to

   The investigation of these currents by means of the galvano
meter carries along with it the doubt, as to whether the increase
of the angle is due to an increase of the electric tension between
the different parts of the flame from which the electric fluid is
conducted, or to a diminution of the resistance within the flame.
It is therefore necessary to separate these quantities. This sepa
ration is generally effected by the introduction of other known
resistances.    To obtain a general notion of the electric tension
of the different portions of the flame, I have resorted to a some
what shorter method, which consists in introducing the current
caused by the flame into a circuit in which another current of
known value circulates.     Heretofore the circuit was composed
of the flame, the connecting wires and the galvanometer; into
this I now introduced a bit of zinc and copper which dipped into
a vessel of water.   Let this arrangement of zinc and copper be
called an element.    By means of the commutator, the current
developed by this element might be transmitted in the same
direction as the current due to the flame, or in an opposite direc
tion.        I
           will name the side to which the flame-current causes
the needle to move the positive side, and the opposite side the
negative.

quite reach the top        theof chimney,  and the  platinum   foil held               at

                  the zinc and copper element.           When, however,
two such elements were        introduced,   and the current which they
originated was directed against that proceeding from the flame,
the latter was overcome and the needle moved                  the negative
                                                                         to

     The deviations  the needle were different when the chimneys

however, the wick was raised by degrees, and the flame by this
means increased, the needle receded more and more towards 0;
and by continually increasing the flame, was caused to cross to
the negative side.  In this case, therefore, the current of the
single copper and zinc element overcame that of the flame,
although both had to contend with the same amount of resist
ance.    This change in the direction of the needle must therefore
be referred to a change in the electro-motive force which origi
mates the current.        As the zinc and copper have remained un
changed, the cause of the phaenomenon must be sought in a di
minution of the electro-motive force of the flame.              This diminu
tion is without doubt due to the fact, that the flame when thus
increased acts against the inner surface of the chimney so as to
originate a number of conducting threads of flame between the
chimney and the platinum, which, owing to their shortness and
position in the flame, possess a greater power of conduction, but
a less tension at their extremities, than that existing between
the top and bottom of the flame. That the resistance to con
duction in this state of the flame is very much decreased, may
be inferred from the magnitude of the negative angle.                   Even
this reversion of the     angle  could be     brought    about with a  single
element when the chimney was removed, and a piece of platinum
was pushed sideways into the flame at a greater or less distance
above the wick, and then connected with the lamp; for in this
case also the electric difference between the respective portions
of the flame which encompassed both pieces of platinum was less
than the difference between the top and bottom of the flame.
When a platinum wire, which was smelted into a thin glass tube,
was introduced into the flame, and when the plate of platinum was

was observed.       By directing the current             of
                                                        the zinc and copper
element   against   this,  the needle was       brought   down and set                on
the negative side.        When the flame was diminished until its
luminous point reached merely                                  the chimney,
                                                                of

tainly due, not    to   an increase      conductibility, but
                                         of                           higher

tension. The opposition            of
                                    the zinc and copper element reduced
this angle only    to  14°.
   These experiments furnish            convincing proof that the flame

                                   Fluids.         By R. CLAUsius+.
       R.     WILLIAM THOMSON                                     has described an experimental
M        investigation, conducted by himselff, and originating
in a theoretic view entertained by his brother, James Thomson.
The latter had concluded, from the known principle of Carnot,
that by an increase of pressure the freezing-point of water must
be lowered, which view was completely verified by experiment.
    Some time ago I published a theoretic memoiri, in which
the principal part of Carnot's law is retained, but altered in
one minor particular. This alteration rendered certain of the
conclusions heretofore deduced from the principle impossible,
while others remained valid; the latter being those whose cor
rectness or high probability had been demonstrated by expe
riment. Now as the above conclusion regarding the freezing
point of fluids has also been substantiated experimentally, and
thus in a scientific point of view has obtained a greater signifi
cance than one would be inclined at first sight to attribute to so
small a difference, I feel myself called upon, in behalf of my
theory, to show that my alteration of Carnot's principle is in no
way opposed to this result S.   And applying at the same time
the original maxim which I have assumed, a new conclusion is
 arrived      at,
            which, although practically unimportant,      account                            on

                       the numbers which      embraces, deserves            it

the pressure and temperature, and a the volume of a unit of

place both in the same sense, and hence in the difference

racy for c—h the difference of both specific heats simply. If

   From this we must conclude, that when the freezing-point
changes, the latent heat must also change; for water is cal,
and, according to Person*, ha<U+017F>) 48.  Hence we have—
                                                                  ;
                            # =052-1-0-29–0-81
that is to say, when the freezing-point of water is lowered by
pressure, the latent heat decreases 0-81 for every degree.
   We must not confound this result with that already expressed
by Persont.     From the circumstance that the specific heat of
ice is less than that of water, the latter concluded with great
probability, that when the freezing-point, without increasing the
pressure, is simply lowered by preserving the fluid perfectly mo
tionless, the latent heat must then be less than at 0°.      This
decrease  may  be expressed by the equation—
the above equation (2) therefore shows, that when the freezing
 oint is lowered by pressure, the latent heat, besides the change
                                   º
 ue to the last-mentioned cause, suffers a still further diminution
expressed by the quantity                     ; this in the case of water is =0:29,
and it is this which corresponds as equivalent to the exterior
work accomplished.

   If the opinion expressed by Faraday, in April 1834 (Exper.
Researches, 919), with reference to the galvanic batteries then
known, that the oxidation alone is concerned in producing the
current, and the dissolution of the oxide in acid is electrically
inoperative, be true for Daniell’s battery, the number (II.) is the
thermal equivalent of the electrically effective chemical action.
Joule’s number (III.) is considerably greater than this, and falls
but little short of (I.), the thermal equivalent of the whole che
mical action that goes on during the consumption of a grain of
zinc. If we take successively (I.), (II.), (III.) as the value of 6,
and take for e and              J
                        the values 07284 and 44758, which were

corresponds      the  equivalents    used      Dr. Andrews,a      taken                         be

as the equivalent of zinc, instead of 323 which   used in my                        I
former paper).    According to Dr. Andrews’ experiments, the
combination of this with gaseous oxygen would evolve
                     #x33808,                    or 1039.3 units of heat.
Hence the thermal equivalent of the whole chemical action cor
responding to the consumption of a grain of zinc in Smee's
battery is
     1301 +369–1039.3, or 630-7. . . . . . (I.)
The equivalent of that part which consists of the oxidation of
zinc and the deoxidation of hydrogen is
          1301–1039.3, or                            261-7       .    .    .    .     .        (II.)
Hence (I.) if the whole chemical action be efficient in producing
the current, the electro-motive force is 2056200.
   (II.) If only the oxidation and deoxidation be efficient, the
electro-motive force is 853190.

with which the battery operates on a very long thin wire connect

initial working external electro-motive force, depends on the pri
mitive state of the platinized silver plate.   It could never                                        be
greater than to make the initial working force be
                                J
                    x 1670 x e, or 5444500,
corresponding to the combination of zinc with gaseous oxygen,
and of the oxide with sulphuric acid.        It might possibly reach
this limit if the platinized surface had been carefully cleaned,
and kept in oxygen gas until the instant of immersion, or if it
had been used as the positive electrode of an apparatus for de
composing water, immediately before being connected with the
zinc plate; and then it could only reach it if the whole chemical
action were electrically efficient, and if there were no “chemical
resistance” due to the affinity of the platinized surface for
oxygen.
   9. It is also to be remarked, that the permanent working elec
tro-motive force of a galvanic element, consisting of zinc and a
less oxidizable metal immersed in sulphuric acid, can never exceed
the number 2056200, derived above from the full thermal equi
valent for the single cell of Smee's, since the chemical action is
identical in all such cases, and the mechanical value of the ex
ternal effect can never exceed that of the chemical action. In a
pair consisting of zinc and tin, the electro-motive force has been
found by Poggendorff 4 to be only about half that of a pair con
sisting of zinc and copper, and consequently less than half that
of a single cell of Smee's. There is therefore an immense loss
of mechanical effect in the external working of a galvanic battery
composed of such elements; which must be compensated by heat
produced within the cells.                  I
                                   believe with Joule, that this com
pensating heat is produced at the surface of the tin in con
sequence of hydrogen being forced to bubble up from               instead                 it,
of  the metal itself   being  allowed     combine with the

tive electrode, and one with zinc, the other with platinum or
platinized silver for the positive electrode. The electro-motive
force of the latter cell would be sufficient to excite a current
through the circuit, but it might be found convenient to add
electro-motive force from some other source*.
   10. PRoP. II. The resistance of a metallic conductor, in terms
of Weber's absolute unit, is equal to the product of the quantity of
heat developed in it in a unit of time by a current of unit strength,
into the mechanical equivalent of a thermal unit.
   11.       If
           H denote the quantity of heat developed in the con
ductor in a unit of time, by a current of strength y, the me
chanical value of the whole effect produced in it will, according
to the principles established                               by Joule, be           JH.        But this effect
is produced by the electro-motive                                  force,          F, and therefore,      by

        Taking as the thermal unit the quantity of heat required to
    raise the temperature of a grain of water by 1° Cent., we find
    57-213 as the heat generated in the silver wire in one second,
    of which the mechanical equivalent is 44758 x 57:213. Divi
    ding this by the square of the strength of the current, we find
                                               15276000
    for the absolute resistance of the silver wire; and by multiplying
    by 74964, we deduce

    for the absolute resistance of the mercury conductor.                                           Multi
     plying each absolute resistance by the sectional area of the con
     ductor to which it corresponds, and dividing by the length; and
     again, multiplying each resistance by the mass, and dividing by
     the square of the length, we obtain the following results with
     reference to the specific resistances of silver and mercury at about
     10° Cent. of temperature.

         15. The “conducting powers” of metals, as ordinarily de
     fined, are inversely proportional to their specific resistances re
     ferred to unity of volume.                    Hence, according to the preceding
     results, the conducting powers of silver and mercury at about
     10° Cent. of temperature are in the proportion of 1 to 01744.
     According to the experiments of M. E. Becquerel (Dove's Reper
     torium, vol. viii. p. 193), the conducting powers of silver and
     merºy at 0° Cent. are in the proportion of 1 to 017387; and
     at 100° Cent., of 1 to 022083: at 10° Cent, they must there
     fore be nearly in the proportion of 1 to 01786, which agrees
     very closely with the preceding comparative result. Again, accord
     ing to M. Becquerel's experiments, the conducting powers of
     silver and copper are,

            to the Measurement          of   Electro-motive                 Forces.                   561

and therefore
                at    10°              ---                    1 to      '915.
Hence the specific resistance of copper at about 10° Cent. refer
red to unity of volume, may be found by dividing that of silver
by 915; and from the preceding result, it is thus found to be
2-080. Multiplying this by 3810500, the weight in grains of a
cubic foot of copper, (found by taking 872 as the specific gra
vity of copper,) we obtain for the “specific resistance” of copper
the value 7925800.
    16. Weber, in first introducing the measurement of resistances
in absolute units, gave two experimental methods, both founded
virtually on a comparison of the electromotive forces with the
strengths of the currents produced by them, in the conductors
examined; and he actually applied them to various conductors,
and obtained results which, reduced to British units, are shown
in the following table. The first four numbers in the second
column are deduced from M. Weber's results, on the hypothesis
that the specific gravity of each specimen of copper is 872.
The only numbers given on the authority of M. Weber are the
first four of the column headed “Specific resistance.”         The
                                                    ...

are shown in the same table for the sake of comparison.

   The great discrepancies among the first four numbers of the
third column, each of which is probably correct in three of                                            its

   17. It is very much to be desired that Weber's direct process,
and the indirect method founded on estimating, according to
Joule’s principles, the mechanical value of the thermal effects of
a galvanic current, should be both put in practice to determine the
absolute resistance of the same conductor, or that the resistance
of two conductors to which the two methods have been separately
applied, should be accurately compared.     Such an investigation
could  scarcely be expected  to give a more approximate value of
the mechanical equivalent of a thermal unit than has been already
found by means of experiments on the friction of fluids; but it
would afford a most interesting illustration of those principles
by which Mr. Joule has shown how to trace an equivalence be
tween work spent and mechanical effect produced, in     physical                      all
agencies    which heat

  “On Depressions of the Wet-bulb Thermometer during the Hot
Season at Ahmednuggur, in the Deccan.” By Colonel Sykes, F.R.S.
&c.
  The author     states that he is indebted to Major William Coghlan
for the tables of hourly depressions of the wet-bulb thermometer
during the months of March and April of the present year, which
form the subject of this communication, and which are a necessary
supplement to his paper recently published in the Philosophical
Transactions.      The observations at Ahmednuggur, lat. 19° 05'
49" N., long. 74° 48' 10", elevation above the sea 1911 feet, which
were undertaken by Dr. Forbes Watson, commenced on the 18th
of March, and were continued to the 14th of April inclusive.
They were made hourly from 6 A.M. to 9 P.M., giving 16 hourly re
cords daily; but on the 24th and 29th of March, and on the 4th,
8th and 10th of April, they were continued throughout the twenty
four hours. The instruments employed were a dry- and a wet-bulb
thermometer, by Adie, perfectly alike and giving precisely the same
indications when both were dry, and a self-registering thermometer.
They were suspended on a platform attached to a window under the
verandah of the house, with a N.W. exposure, and were protected
from radiation and reflexion of heat from the ground.          As, from
some preliminary observations, it appeared that the depression of the
wet-bulb varied in every case with the intensity and duration of the
draught of air upon              it,

which abutted          the wet-bulb, and the operation was continued

the air, the temperature of evaporation, and the mean depression of
the wet-bulb, the means of these elements have been taken and are
presented in a table. In this table are also given the dew-points as
determined by means of Mr. Glaisher's factors and by Dr. Apjohn's
formula, with the differences by the two methods. The author re
marks that the first feature which presents itself, in running the eye
over this table, is the enormous amount of the depression of the wet
bulb compared with our European experience. In March, the mean
depression at no hour was less than 14°8 at 7 A.M., increasing to
29°-6 at 3 P.M.; in April, the mean depression was never less than
 17°-3 at 7 A.M., increasing to 29°-9 at 3 P.M.; and many observations
necessarily much exceeded the maxima means. The next feature is
the increase of the mean depression with that of the mean tempera
ture, from 6 A.M. until 3 P.M., and then a decline with the decline of
temperature until 9 P.M.; but not in the same ratio as the increase
in the morning. With reference to the practical application of these
observations with a view to determine the amount of moisture in the
atmosphere, or to fix the dew-point, the author remarks that it will
 be seen from this table that Mr. Glaisher's factors give a higher dew
point than Dr. Apjohn's formula, varying in March from 6°l at 8 A.M.
 to 11°-9 at 6 P.M., and in April from 5°-6 at 7 A.M. to 10°4 at 9 P.M.;
 and these varying discrepancies do not appear to have gradations of
 increment or decrement dependent upon increase or diminution of
 mean temperature, or increase or decrease of the depression of the
 wet-bulb.    These remarks apply to the means of the observations;
 but with reference to isolated observations, the discrepancies by the
 two methods become much greater. On the 9th of April, at 8 P.M.,
 the temperature of the air being 97°, the wet-bulb with a moderate
 draught 60°5, and with a strong draught 60°, the depressions were
 respectively 36°5 and 37°, and the dew-point for the latter depres
 sion determined by Mr. Glaisher's factors would be 41'5, and 12.6
 by Dr. Apjohn's formula.     In illustration of this part of the subject
 the author gives an extract of a letter from General Cullen, from
 which it appears that at Cochin on the Malabar coast, the tempera
 ture of the air being 96°, the wet-bulb 61°, the dew-point by Jones's
 hygrometer 38°, the dew-point by Mr. Glaisher's factors would be
 43°5, and by Dr. Apjohn's formula 22°1.

 J. J. Waterston, Esq. Communicated by Lieut.-Colonel Sabine, R.A.,
  V.P. and Treas. R.S. &c.
     The author of this paper commences by stating that the relation
 between the pressure and temperature of vapours in contact with
 their generating liquids has been expressed by a variety of empirical
  formulae, which, although convenient for practical purposes, do not
  claim to represent any general law; and that some years ago, while
  examining a mathematical theory of gases, he endeavoured to find
  out, from the experiments of the French Academy, whether the den
 sity of steam in contact with water followed any distinct law with
  reference to the temperature measured from the zero of gaseous ten
 sion (situated at —461°Fahr. by Rudberg's experiments, confirmed

566                                          Royal Society.
by Magnus and Regnault).    To avoid circumlocution, he calls tem
peratures  measured from this zero G temperatures, and observes
that if t represents the G temperature, A the density of a gas or
vapour, and       p     its   elastic force, the equation
                                                      t.A=p

        represented on the chart, are then given, the G temperatures being

            The author remarks that the observations on the vapour of water
        below 80° show a small excess of density above what is required by
        the line corresponding to those at higher temperatures; and that it
        is a curious circumstance that the law of expansibility of water also
        becomes disturbed at about the same temperature. In proof of this,
         the observations of M. Despretz (Ann. de Chim. vol. lxx.) being pro
        jected, by making the volume the ordinate to the square root of the
         G temperature as abscissa, these observations above 25° C. or
         77°F. give in the most exact manner a conic parabola; but below
         77° they no longer give that curve.
            The equation to the parabola for temperatures above 77°F. is
         a(v–0)=(w/t—p)", in which v is the volume at the G temperature

   Or, lastly, according to a third hypothesis, which includes both
the former ones, only a portion of the aether is free, the other por
tion being attached to the molecules of bodies and participating in
their motion.
   This latter hypothesis was proposed by Fresnel, and con
structed for the purpose of equally satisfying the phaenomena of
aberration, and a celebrated experiment of M. Arago, by which it
has been proved that the motion of the earth has no influence
upon the refraction which the light of the stars suffers in a prism.
   We may determine the value which in each of these hypotheses
it is necessary to attribute to the velocity of light in bodies when
the bodies are supposed to be in motion.
   If the aether is supposed to be wholly carried along with the body
in motion, the velocity of light ought to be increased by the whole
velocity of the body, the ray being supposed to have the same direc
tion as the motion.
   If the aether is supposed to be free and independent, the velocity
of light ought not to be changed at all.
   Lastly, if only one part of the aether is carried along, the velocity
of light would be increased, but only by a fraction of the velocity of
the body, and not, as in the first hypothesis, by the whole velocity.
This consequence is not so obvious as the former, but Fresnel has
shown that it may be supported by mechanical arguments of great
probability.
   Although the velocity of light is enormous comparatively to such
as we are able to impart to bodies, we are at the present time in
possession of means of observation of such extreme delicacy, that it
seems to me to be possible to determine by a direct experiment what
is the real influence of the motion of bodies upon the velocity of
light.
   We are indebted to M. Arago for a method based upon the phae
nomena of interference, which is capable of indicating the most
minute variations in the indexes of refraction of bodies. The expe
riments of MM. Arago and Fresnel upon the difference between the
refractions of dry and moist air, have proved the extraordinary
sensibility of that means of observation.
   It is by adopting the same principle, and joining the double tube
of M. Arago to the conjugate telescopes which I employed for deter
mining the absolute velocity of light, that I have been able to study
directly in two mediums the effects of the motion of a body upon
the light which traverses      it.
 I   will now attempt    to  describe, without the aid   of

was the course     of the light      in

a  cylindrical lens the solar rays penetrated almost immediately into
the first telescope     by
                         a   lateral opening very near    to   its
                                                                 focus.   A

the axis  of  the telescope, reflected the rays  in   the direction  of the
object-glass.
    On leaving the object-glass, the rays having become parallel among
themselves, encountered         double chink, each opening      which cor

 length, 1":487.
     The two bundles, always parallel to each other, reached the ob
ject-glass of the second telescope, were then refracted, and by the
 effect of the refraction reunited at                                     its

the object-glass, and been thus rendered parallel                             each other,                    to

the tubes, the two bundles           again    passed the double chinks, re-entered
the first telescope, and           lastly    intersected               focus         passing

    By making water move in the two tubes at the same time and in
contrary directions in each, it will be seen that the effects should be
added. This double current having been produced, the direction
may be again reversed simultaneously in the two tubes, and the
effect would again be double.
    All the movements of the water were produced in a very simple
manner, each tube being connected by two conduits situated near
their extremities, with two reservoirs of glass, in which a pressure
is alternately exercised by means of compressed air. By means of
this pressure the water passes from one reservoir to the other by
traversing the tube, the two extremities of which are closed by the
mirrors.    The interior diameter of the tubes was  5*3,    their length
 1"487. They were of glass.
    The pressure under which the flowing of the water took place
might have exceeded two atmospheres. The velocity was calculated
by dividing the volume of water running in one second by the area
of the section of the tube. I ought to mention, in order to prevent an
objection which might be made, that great care was taken to obviate
the effects of the accidental motions which the pressure or the shock
of the water might produce. Therefore the two tubes, and the
reservoirs in which the motion of the water was made, were sus
tained by supports independent of the other parts of the apparatus,
 and especially of the two lunettes; it was therefore only the two
 tubes which could suffer any accidental movement; but both theory
 and practice have proved that the motion or flexions of the tubes
alone were without influence upon the position of the fringes. The
 following are the results obtained.
    When the water is set in motion the fringes are displaced, and
according as the water moves in the one direction or the other, the
 displacement takes place towards the right or the left.
    The fringes are displaced towards the right when the water is run
ning from the observer in the tube situated to his right, and towards
 the observer in the tube situated to his left.
    The fringes are displaced towards the left when the direction of
 the current in each tube takes place in a direction opposed to that
 which has just been described.
    With a velocity of the water equal to 2" a second, the displace
 ment is already very sensible; with a velocity of 4 to 7 metres it is
perfectly measurable.
    After having demonstrated the existence of the phaenomenon, I
 endeavoured to determine its numerical value with all the exactitude
 which it was possible to attain.
    By calling that the simple displacement which was produced when
 the water at rest in the commencement was set in motion, and that
 the double displacement which was produced when the motion was
 changed to a contrary one, it was found that the average deduced
 from nineteen observations sufficiently concurring, was 0.23 for the
 simple displacement, which gives 0.46 for the double displacement,
 the width of a fringe being taken as unity. The velocity of the
water was 7-069 metres a second.

572             Intelligence and Miscellaneous    Articles.
   This result was afterwards compared with those which have been
deduced by calculation from the different hypotheses relative to the
aether.
   According to the supposition that the aether is entirely free and
independent of the motion of bodies, the displacement ought to be
null.
   According to the hypothesis which considers the aether united to
the molecules of matter in such a way as to participate in its mo
tions, calculation gives for the double displacement the value 0.92.
Experiment gave a number only half as great, or 0'46.
   According to the hypothesis by which the aether is partially carried
along, the hypothesis of Fresnel, calculation gives 0:40, that is to
say, a number very near to that which was found by experiment; and
the difference between the two values would very probably be still
less if it had been possible to introduce into the calculation of the
velocity of the water a correction which had to be neglected from
the want of sufficiently precise data, and which refers to the un
equal velocity of the different threads of fluid; by estimating the
value of that correction in the most probable manner, it is seen that
it tends to augment a little the theoretical value and to approach
the value of the observed result.
   An experiment similar to that which I have just described had
been made previously with air in motion, and I have demonstrated
that the motion of the air does not produce any sensible displace
ment in the fringes. In the circumstances in which that experiment
was made, and with a velocity of 25 metres a second, which was
that of the motion of the air, it is found that according to the hy
pothesis by which the aether is considered to be carried along with
the bodies, the double displacement ought to be 0-82.
   According to the hypothesis of Fresnel, the same displacement
ought to be only 0.000465, that is to say, entirely imperceptible.
Thus the apparent immobility of the fringe in the experiment made
with air in motion is completely in accordance with the theory of
Fresnel.    It was after having demonstrated this negative fact, and
while   seeking  for an explanation by the different hypotheses relating
to the aether in such a way as to satisfy at the same time the phae
nomena of aberration and the experiment of M. Arago, that it ap
peared to me to be necessary to admit with Fresnel that the motion
of a body occasions an alteration in the velocity of light, and that
this alteration of velocity is greater or less for different mediums,
according to the energy with which those mediums refract light, so
that it is considerable in bodies which are strongly refractive and
very feeble in those which refract but little, as the air. It follows
from this, that if the fringes are not displaced when light traverses
air in motion, there should, on the contrary, be a sensible displace
ment when the experiment is made with water, the index of refrac
tion of which is very much greater than that of air.
   An experiment of M. Babinet, mentioned in the ninth volume of
the Comptes Rendus, seems to be opposed to the hypothesis of an
alteration of velocity in conformity with the law of Fresnel.        But

                      Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                               573
on considering the circumstances of that experiment, I have remarked
a cause of compensation which must render the effect of the motion
imperceptible.    This cause consists in the reflexion which the light
undergoes in that experiment; in fact it may be demonstrated, that
when two rays have a certain difference of course, that difference
is changed by the effect of the reflexion upon a mirror in motion.
On calculating separately the two effects in the experiment of M.
Babinet, it is found that they have values sensibly equal with con
trary signs.
   This explanation renders still more probable the hypothesis of an
alteration of velocity, and an experiment made with water in motion
appears to me completely appropriate to decide the question with
certainty.
   The success of the experiment seems to me to render the adop
tion of Fresnel's hypothesis necessary, or at least the law which he
found for the expression of the alteration of the velocity of light by
the effect of motion of a body; for although that law being found
true may be a very strong proof in favour of the hypothesis of
which it is only a consequence, perhaps the conception of Fresnel
may appear so extraordinary, and in some respects so difficult, to
admit, that other proofs and a profound examination on the part of
geometricians will still be necessary before adopting it as an ex
pression of the real facts of the case.—Comptes Rendus, Sept. 29,

  OBSERVATIONS                   UPON THE RADIATION OF LUMINOUS BODIES.
                                    BY M. BAUDRIMONT.
  On looking at a very brilliant light, it sometimes appears to be
surrounded by brilliant luminous rays, clear, free from cloudiness,
and which must not be confounded with those caused by the eye
lashes when the eyes are partially closed. These rays may be ob
served most distinctly by looking at an image of the sun reflected
upon the surface of a convex glass, or still better upon a lens having
a considerable curvature.          They may be most easily observed by
looking at an image of the sun formed in the focus of a lens placed
at the extremity of a tube blackened in the interior. If the observer
place himself in a room into which the light penetrates only through
a narrow opening, the phaenomenon appears with great splendour,
and it may even be said with extraordinary magnificence. The rays
 are either white, or present all the colours of the spectrum. In that
case a motion appears to take place in their interior, which cannot be
compared with anything better than that of a liquid circulating with
 difficulty in narrow channels in which it meets with obstacles.
 There are also seen irregular concentric rings, which appear to move
 from their common centre. Whatever may be the circumstances in
 which the observer places himself, and whatever may be the precau
 tions which are taken to obviate the complication of the phaenome
 non, the rays do not appear disposed as those in a circle; they have
 not   all   common centre, but form entangled bundles
             a                                                          very pe   in   a
 culiar manner.
     At first sight was struck with the resemblance which appeared
