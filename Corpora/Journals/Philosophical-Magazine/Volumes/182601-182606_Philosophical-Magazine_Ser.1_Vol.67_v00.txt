   differing from other meteoric stones, and which, according to
   their appearance, as well as to Balduin's analysis, contained
   copper, which some other circumstances render still more
   probable.
      [The following instances are cited by Dr. Noeggerath in
   Schweigger's Neues.Journal, Band. xiv. p. 357, from Beccher's
  Laboratorium, published in 1680: their dates are of course
  prior to that period.

  a  great  storm a mass of iron fell from the heavens, together
              §.
  with a number of stones; and that the iron measured sixteen
  feet in length, fifteen in width, and two in thickness.
      Paulus           says, in his Cosmographia, that six iron axes
  had fallen from heaven; upon which Beccher remarks that
  he does not believe them to have been really awes, but that
  they might have had the form of those weapons, as the stones
  which fall have, and whence they have received the name of
  Donnerärte, or thunder-awes, in the German language.—This
 *
  relation seems doubtful, as the stone weapons of the aboriginal
 inhabitants of Europe have been called thunder-bolts, &c. in
          language. EDIT.]

the source of the Yellow River, in Eastern Asia (according to
 Abel-Remusat’s account in the Journ. de Phys. May 1819) is
of this description. The Moguls say that it fell down from
heaven; and they call it Khadasoutsilao, i.e. rock of the pole.

inch long, and a little less in breadth, and seems intended to
                               One end is a little broken off. One
side is a little more convex than the other, on which a small

elliptic slab of jasper of a reddish brown is let in; and on this
a star and a moon by the side of it are engraved. As the
ancients considered substances fallen from heaven (Baetylia) as
something sacred (upon which subject see the works of Mün
ter and Fred. von Dalberg), and as on several coins, &c. the
meteoric origin has been indicated by a start, it probably
indicates that this iron fell down with a fiery meteor of the
apparent size of the moon. Now it seems more probable that
it is a part of the iron which fell in Lucania, about fifty-six or
fifty-two years before Christ, as mentioned by Pliny, Hist.

having proved insecure, a new and unobjectionable method
has been adopted.
   In the instrument represented by the preceding cut, the ig
niting wire is soldered into the summits of the two brass wires
(WW), which pass through the bottom of the socket (S),
parallel to the axis of the glass recipient (G), within which
they are seen. One of the wires is soldered to the socket; the
other is fastened by means of a collar of leathers packed by
a screw, so that it has no metallic communication with the
other wire, unless through the filament of platina, by which
they are visibly connected above, and which               I
                                                   have already
called the igniting wire. The glass has a capillary orifice at
the apex (A), which by means of a lever and spring (apparent
in the drawing) is closed, unless when the pressure of the spring
is counteracted by one of the fingers of the operator. The
sliding rod (seen at R) is accurately graduated to about 320
degrees.
  So easy is it to manipulate with this instrument, that any.
number of experiments may be performed in as many minutes.
The ignition of the platina wire is caused by either of four
calorimotors, each consisting of four plates of zinc, and five
of copper. They are       suspended all one beam, to   may    as    be
seen   in   fig.   2   following.

The acid for exciting the  plates is contained in the jug below,
which may be so uplifted as to surround with acid either of
the calorimotors.     Hence while one is in operation, the others
are, by repose, recovering their igniting power. Or by using
a vessel (fig. 3) large enough to receive, and containing acid
power may be doubled. The vessels for holding the acid are
made of copper, covered with a cement of resin rendered
tough by an adequate admixture of mutton suet.

illustration.  This glass screws on to the socket (S), the other

cepting the employment of an electrical machine, or electro
phorus, to ignite the gaseous mixture, in lieu of a calorimotor.

     Thisvessel being filled with water, and immersed in the
pneumatic cistern, the apex being just even with the surface
of the water, one-hundred measures of atmospheric air, and a
like quantity of nitric oxide, are to be successively introduced.
The residual air may then be drawn into the eudiometer, and
ejected again into the receiver through the water, to promote
the absorption of the nitrous acid produced.      Lastly, it may                                       |
be measured by drawing it into the instrument, and ejecting
it into the egg-shaped receiver (fig. 8), or into the air, when
the quantity of it will appear from the number of degrees
which the sliding-rod enters during the ejection.   That in this
way gas may be measured with great accuracy may be de
monstrated by transferring any number of measures, taken
separately, into the semi-oval receiver, and subsequently re
measuring them.

which I have undertaken to discuss.                   It seems to be the ge

M.   Poisson's supposition, that the thickness          the molecule                           of

joins the two other extremities of the fixed conductors: as the
 action which results from this portion is exerted in a contrary
direction, a momentum is obtained of which the sign is opposed
to that of the momentum of which we have just obtained the
 value, it must be added to the first; and what is very remark
 able, the total momentum takes a form much more simple. In

the whole demonstration hinges) is a function of the latitude
by account, of the time nearest noon, determined by means of
that latitude and of the middle time connected with it; and
must evidently partake, in any future combination, of the                                                            in
exactness to which each of these quantities may be subject;
and that inexactness, we have seen, may be very considerable.
We ask then, how is it possible that any combination or trans
formation of n can lead to an exact result, or to the correction
of an inexact one? But to prop this, it is gratuitously sup
posed that,          t                  –
                         r : t c :: n : 1,            –
                            Or, t       –   c : c     – r ::         1   : n   –   1,
                            Or, t       –c=           m
                                                          -.
                                                          –1
Now, this implicitly supposes that a certain fixed relation
must always subsist between t, r, and e, and that they will con
stantly bear the same invariable relation to n. With such an
order of latitudes, the correction certainly may sometimes suc
ceed; but is such order to be always expected in practice?
We may with as much truth suppose,
                     r — t : t c :: n : 1,            –
                            Or      t – c r + – 2t :: 1: n –

                                    t –c =
                                              –           n      1        °

  It  is evident, therefore, that the correction derived from the
Doctor's reasoning will be conditionally true, and at best but
very uncertain in practice.       Hence I am not at         surprised                            all

mistake into which your learned correspondent P.                        fallen

     In the first place, did not “abandon” the arguments em
ployed in my first paper on Mr. Herapath's demonstration.
They still remain opposed to the view which I then took of
the process in question: and my second paper was intended
to show the inefficiency of that demonstration, also under.

 may have. The truth seems to be, that sensible objects have
 many characters which make so slight an impression on the
 mind, that they do not in passing through it become the sub

 what the various flavours are to the taste, too delicate and

 the nicer qualities of things are long before they are observed,

Miller had called C. minor. We have found it repeatedly on
the mountains in Cumberland, and have seen it in herbaria
mistaken for the C. radicans, which is a strongly marked and
totally distinct species.        Recent and authentic specimens of
this last plant are, however, desiderata to the London botanists.
The descendants of Dickson's original plants still survive; but
whatever might be the authority of the finder, it is still desi
rable to have it confirmed.
   Lamium maculatum wants confirmation even as an English
plant: much more then does it need to be authenticated
as found wild in woods in Scotland. Stachys ambigua appears to
be confined to the North.           It is but imperfectly known among
 Southern botanists; and that knowledge is derived from dried
specimens, which in such difficult species are but unsatis
factory. The Rhinanthus major is entirely new.                    For this
addition we are indebted to a very active and successful bo
tanist, Mr. James Backhouse of York, who distinguishes it at
first sight by           its
                          greater size, being two feet high, much

allied in habit. The characters employed by Mr. Brown are
said to be easy of detection as soon as the skin of the seed is
removed, there being no separate albumen; and these afford
the most natural, and indeed absolute, primary characters of
these plants.     “They serve,” says our author, “to divide the
whole into great natural sections, liable, as far as I can find,
to no exception; the genera under each section being easily
characterized, and proving much more natural, in habit and
fructification, than those found by Linnaeus.”
    Whatever objection may, at first sight, appear against the
use of these characters in the cotyledons, as                          little
artificial assistance to the tyro, they are invaluable in the ab

knowledge of habit and look, which we pointed out at the

cape from the                At Hastings even double flowers may

which Mr. D. Don had found in Scotland, Mr. Peete in
Kent, and to these may be added, by ourselves in Glamor
ganshire, is regarded (and we think rightly) only as a variety
of tuberosus. Vicia angustifolia of Sibthorp and others is                in

rine forest at Charmouth, Dorset, by H. T. De la Beche, Esq.
F.R.S., G.S., &c.—A circumstance, seeming to indicate the
existence of the remains of a submarine forest near the mouth
of the Char, was lately pointed out to Mr. De la Beche by Miss
Mary Anning. Upon a flat of some extent, stretching into
the sea in front of the beach, only visible at low water, and
composed of lias, patches of a blue clay show themselves, im
bedding pieces of blackened wood lying horizontally, similar
in appearance to those usually met with in submarine forests:
some of them are large, but the greater number must have
been derived from small trees.     Mixed with these are a few.
hazel-nuts, and abundant remains of plants, chiefly such as
are found in marshy grounds. Angular and blackened pieces
of chert and flint, precisely resembling those which occur in
the diluvium on either side of the Char, form the substratum
of this clay, which has been worn away in most places by the
rolling of the large pebbles thrown up by the action of the sea
upon the beach.         - - -

    Dec. 16.-A paper was read, On the chalk and sands be
neath it (usually termed Green-sand), in the vicinity of Lyme
Regis, by H. T. De la Beche, Esq. F.G.S. &c.
   Mr. De la Beche observes, that we ought not to suppose that
the sands, marles, and clays which are immediately subja
cent to the chalk in the East of England, can be traced into
other and distant countries, where however these sands, &c.,
as a mass, may be easily recognised.       That this cannot be
done even at comparatively short distances it is the object of
this communication to prove, by examples derived from the
cliffs at Lyme Regis in Dorsetshire, and Beer in Devonshire;
detailed sections of which are given, and the succession of the
strata and the organic remains which they contain fully de
scribed. . The author first treats of the chalk, and the sands
and sandstone usually called green-sand, as they occur be
tween Lyme Regis and Axmouth, and then notices the same
formations as they are exhibited in the vicinity of Beer.
    From this examination it appears, that though there is a
great correspondence in the organic remains, considerable
changes take place in the mineral composition and characters
of the beds both of chalk and underlying sands, in short       di
stances. Mr. De la Beche considers it probable that the Beer
stone is the equivalent of the Malm-rock of Western Sussex.

of the West of Sussex,                and the   N.E. of Hants, &c., by R. J.
Murchison, Esq. F.G.S. &c.
 In this memoir Mr. Murchison describes the geological
 relations, distribution, and characteristic fossils of the strata of
 that part of the west of Sussex which is bounded on the south
 by the chalk escarpment of the South Downs, and that part
                                           ºppºi:
 of Hampshire which is included by the Alton chalk hills.
          .
 These strata, commencing below the chalk, in a descending
 series, are, 1. Malm-rock, or                              Gault.—
 3.  Ferruginous    green-sand.—4.        eald  clay.  The Weald
             .
 clay in      valley of Harting Combe may be regarded as the
 central nucleus of this district; mantling round which, and ex
 tending up to either chalk range, the other formations are de
 veloped in regular succession: the breadth and boundaries
 of each are laid down by the author on a coloured portion of
 the Ordnance Map, to which a section is annexed.
    The Malm-rock of Western Sussex is identical with the stone
 of Merstham: it is characterized by constituting terraces which
 afford a rich soil favourable to wheat. It sometimes furnishes
 a building-stone, contains occasionally a calcareous blue chert,
 and abounds in organic remains.
    The Gault of this district has been cut through to the depth
 of 120 feet, at Alice Holt, and iridescent Ammonites and other
fossils are found in       This clay marked
                           it.                    is              by
                                                      fertile water
 meadows; and the timber, presenting green belt, clearly dis
tinguishes     from the rich wheat land

    Of this latter formation the upper beds consist             pure     of
white sand, and        some places compact ironstone and iron

    On the Changes that have taken place in some ancient
Alloys of Copper; in a letter from John Davy, M.D. F.R.S.,
to Sir Humphry Davy, Bart. Pres. R.S.–In this letter Dr.
Davy, who is pursuing a train of scientific researches in the
Mediterranean, describes the effects which time and the ele
ments have produced on various Grecian antiquities. The
first he examined was a helmet of the antique form found in a
shallow part of the sea between the citadel of Corfu and the
village of Castrades, which was partly covered with shells and
with an incrustation of carbonate of lime. Its entire surface,
as well where invested with these bodies as where they were
absent, presented a mottled appearance of green, white, and
red. The green portion consisted of the submuriate and the
                                                        carbonate

                           Magnetic Rotation.                                      73
carbonate of copper, the white chiefly of oxide of tin, and the
red of protoxide of copper in octahedral crystals, mingled with
octahedrons of pure metallic copper. Beneath these substances
the metal was quite bright, and it was found by analysis to
consist of copper and 18.5 per cent of tin. A nail of a simi
lar alloy from a tomb at Ithaca, and a mirror from a tomb at
Samos, in Cephalonia, presented the same appearances, but in
less distinct crystallization: the mirror was composed of cop
per alloyed with about six per cent of tin, and minute portions
of arsenic and zinc. A variety of ancient coins, from the ca
binet of a celebrated collector at Santa Maura, presented                          si
milar appearances, and afforded corresponding results; the
white incrustations being oxide of tin, the green consisting of
carbonate and submuriate of copper, and the red of the prot
oxide of the same metal; some having a dingy appearance ari
sing from the presence of black oxide of copper mingled with
portions of the protoxide.        Dr. Davy was unable to detect
any relation between the composition of the respective coins
and their state of preservation, the variation in this respect
which they presented appearing to arise rather from the cir
cumstances under which they had been exposed to the mine
ralizing agents.    In conclusion, Dr. Davy observed, that as
the substance from which these crystalline compounds had been
produced could not be imagined to have been in solution, their
formation must be referred to an intimate motion of       particles,its
effected
            by

s2     Mr. Ivory     on the Theory   of the Figure of the Planets
sure principles, by a process of reasoning not depending upon
       dubious or intricate point of analysis.
                                                       -
 an;n treating of the figure of the planets there are three dif
 ferent cases that principally engage attention. We may con
 sider the equilibrium of a fluid mass that is homogeneous; or
 of one composed of strata varying in density according to any
 law; or we may suppose a solid nucleus wholly or partially
 covered with a fluid. Although the principles on which              I
 proceed are equally applicable in every case, yet for the sake
 of brevity and simplicity I here confine myself to the first case
 only; namely, the equilibrium of a homogeneous mass of
 fluid.   Such is the intimate connexion which binds together
 the different parts of the same theory, that if we can fairly
 overcome the difficulties which obstruct our progress in one
 case, every other case will readily be brought within our
                                               -
 power.
    Now the principles by which Laplace has determined the
equilibrium of a homogeneous fluid mass are these two: first,
the direction of gravity must be every where perpendicular to
the outer surface; secondly, the radius r of the spheroid must
come under this formula, viz. r = a (1 + ay), y being a func
tion of the angles which determine the position of the radius,
and a a small coefficient of which the square and higher
                     #
powers are to be neglected.
equilibrium of a
                                    In the theory of Laplace, the
                           of uniform density is a necessary conse
quence of the two conditions mentioned. Of these the first is
entirely mathematical; the only purpose it can serve is to al
low the rejecting of certain quantities which would otherwise
embarrass calculation; but it can in no respect contribute to
make out the proof of the equilibrium, which must be deduced
from hydrostatical principles alone. Whether there be an
equilibrium or not must depend entirely on the first condition.
If  that is sufficient, Laplace's solution will be exact; otherwise
we must conclude that it is defective, and we can consider it
only as a method of calculation which accidentally leads to a
result that we know to be true from other considerations.
    We have now then to inquire what are the conditions ne
cessary to the equilibrium of a homogeneous fluid. The whole
received doctrine on this head is contained in the single pro
position following. Conceive a homogeneous fluid contained

86    Mr. Ivory            on the Theory         of the Figure of the Planets
pressures must be equable over the whole level surface, other
wise Clairaut’s reasoning will not apply; and as they are pro
duced by independent causes, they cannot possibly be included
in one and the same equation. In the case of a planet it there
fore becomes necessary to add to Clairaut's theory a new con
dition, which can only be derived from the figure of the stra
tum.       If we suppose that the stratum is possessed of such a
figure as to attract every particle in the inside with equal force
in opposite directions, it is manifest that the attraction of the
stratum will not disturb the equilibrium of the fluid below                                         it,
and consequently that the pressure upon the level surface
       be   equable. Every level stratum being subjected

that  of   the two    requisite   conditions,    the   second,      the one          or

without which the equilibrium cannot subsist; the other ascer
tains the proportion of the forces necessary to make that figure
possible.
   We can now likewise discover, d priori, why Laplace's
method, in the circumstances supposed, brings out a result
which is exact as a first approximation. It arises from this,-
that, when the fluid is a perfect sphere, the two conditions of
equilibrium coincide in one; for Newton has proved that a
spherical shell of homogeneous matter attracts a particle in
the inside equally in opposite directions.        What is exactly
true in the case of a sphere, must be nearly so when the fluid
approaches indefinitely to that figure; and in these circum
stances, the second condition being implied to a certain extent
in the first, we obtain an approximation by means of the lat
ter alone.    This, however, is true only of the first step in ap
proximating to the figure of a planet; in proceeding further it
becomes necessary to take in       the conditions        all
                                                     equilibrium.                               of

XIV.     Further Researches on the Preservation of Metals by Electro
    chemical Means.   By Sir HUMPHRY DAvy, Bart. Pres. R.S."
INscribed
    two papers read         before the Royal Society          have de                          I
          the effects       of small   quantities  of  electro-positive
 metals in preventing the corrosion or chemical changes of
 copper exposed to sea water, and have stated that the results     I
 appear to be of the same kind, whether the experiments are
 made upon a minute scale and in confined portions of water,
 or on large masses and in the ocean. .
    The first and preliminary experiments proved that the cop
 per sheeting of ships might be preserved by this method; but
 another and a no less important circumstance was to be at
 tended to, how far the eleanness of the bottom, or its freedom
from the adhesion of weeds or shell fish, would be influenced
                                                                        -
 by this preservation.
    The use of the copper sheathing on the bottom of ships is
twofold: First, to protect the wood                                É.
                                               destruction by worms:
    And  secondly,   to prevent   the adhesion of weeds, barnacles,
 and other shellfish.      No worms can penetrate the wood as
long as the surface of the copper remains perfect; but when
 copper has been applied to the bottom of a ship for a certain
         dº.
time, a green coating or rust, consisting of oxide, submuriate
and
upon         it,
                  of copper, and carbonate of magnesia, forms
                   to
             which weeds and shell fish adhere.
   As long              as
                the whole surface        the copper changes   of   cor                                   or
rodes,         no
           such adhesions can occur; but when this green rust
has partially formed, the copper below           protected by      and      is                           it,

in different seas and situations, being influenced by the degree
 of saltness, and the nature of the impregnations of the water,

    In examining sheets which had been defended by small
quantities of iron in proportions under 1-250 and above
 1-1000, whether they were exposed alone, or on the sides of
boats, there seemed to me no adhesions of Conferva, except
in cases where the oxide of iron covered the copper imme
diately round the protectors; and even in these instances such
adhesions were extremely trifling, and might be considered
rather as the vegetations caught by the rough surface of the
oxide of iron, than as actually growing upon                                 it.

     I used the very delicate balance belonging to the Royal So
ciety in these experiments; the sheets of copper weighed be
tween 7 and 8000 grains; and was fully enabled to ascertain     I
by means of this balance a diminution of weight upon so large
a quantity, equal to 1-100th of a grain, . It was evident from
a very minute inspection of the sheet with the largest quantity
of protecting metal, that there was not any adhesion of alka
line or earthy substances to                  surface.    its

hasty deposition of earthy and alkaline matter, and crystals of
carbonate of soda adhered to the copper at the surface where
it was clean and bright; but in the lower part it was coated
with revived metallic zinc. In the second glass the wire was
covered over with fine crystals of carbonate of lime; and the
same phaenomenon of the separation of carbonate of soda oc
curred, but in a less degree.     In the third glass the wire was
clean, but without depositions; and the presence of alkaline
matter could only be distinguished by chemical tests.          In the
fourth glass the copper was bright, evidently in consequence
of a   iš.   but general corrosion, but with a scarcely sensible
deposit; in the fifth, the deposit was very visible; and in the
seventh the wire was covered with green rust.
   These results, which showed that a very small quantity onl
of the imperfect or fluid conductor was sufficient to transmit
the electrical power, or to complete the chain, induced me to
try if copper nailed upon wood, and protected merely by zinc
or iron on the under surface, or that next the wood, would
not be defended from corrosion.         For this purpose covered     I
a piece of wood with small sheets of copper, a nail of zinc of
about the 1-200th part of the surface of the copper being pre
viously driven into the wood: the apparatus was plunged in
a large jar of sea water: it remained perfectly bright for many
weeks; and when examined, it was found that the zinc had
only suffered partial corrosion, that the wood was moist, and
that on the interior of the copper there was a considerable
portion of revived zinc, so that the negative electricity, by            its
operation, provided materials for           future and constant ex

metal.     I could not produce any protecting action of zinc or
iron upon copper through the thinnest stratum of air, or the
finest leaf of mica, or of dry paper; but the action of the me
tals did not seem to be much impaired by the ordinary coating
of oxide or rust; nor was it destroyed when the finest bibulous
or silver paper, as it is commonly called, was between them,
being moistened with sea water.                          I
                                           made an experiment with
different folds of this paper.      Pieces of copper were covered
with one, two, three, four, five and six folds; and over them
were placed pieces of zinc, which were fastened closely to them
by thread: each piece of copper so protected was exposed in a
vessel of sea water, so that the folds of paper were all moist.
   It was found, in the case in which a single leaf of paper was
between the zinc and the copper, there was no corrosion of
the copper; in the case in which there were two leaves, there
was a very slight effect; with three, the corrosion was distinct;
and it increased, till with the six folds the protecting power
appeared to be lost; and in the case of the single leaf there
was this difference from the result of immediate contact, that
there was no deposition of earthy matter:—showing that there
was no absolute minute contact of the metals through the
moist paper; which was likewise proved by other experiments:

highly satisfactory, though made under very unfavourable                  cir
cumstances.
     The only two   instances    of vessels which have been recently
coppered, and which have made voyages furnished with pro
tectors, that I have had an opportunity of examining, are the
 Elizabeth yacht, belonging to the Earl of Darnley, and the
 Carnebrea. Castle, an Indiaman, belonging to Messrs.                    Wig
ram. The yacht was protected by about 1-125th part of
malleable iron placed in two masses in the stern. She had
been occasionally employed in sailing, and had been some
times in harbour, during six months. When I saw her in
November she was perfectly clean, and the copper apparently
untouched.     Lord Darnley informed me that there never had
been the slightest adhesion of either weed or shell-fish to her
copper, but that a few small barnacles had once appeared on
the loose oxide of iron in the neighbourhood of the protectors,
which however were immediately and easily washed off. The
 Carnebrea Castle, a large vessel of upwards of 650 tons, was
furnished with four protectors, two on the stern and two on
the bow, equal together to about 1-104th of the surface of the
copper.     She had been protected more than twelve months,
and had made the voyage to Calcutta and back. She came
into the river perfectly bright; and when examined in the dry
dock was found entirely free from any adhesion, and offered
a beautiful and almost polished surface; and there seemed to
be no greater wear of copper than could be accounted      -      for
from mechanical causes.
    Had these vessels been at rest, I have no doubt there would
have been adhesions, at least in Portsmouth or Sheerness
harbours, where the water is constantly muddy, and where
the smallest irregularity or roughness of surface, from either
wear, or the deposition of calcareous matter, or the formation
of oxides or carbonates, enables the solid matter floating in the
water to rest. There is a ship, the Howe, one of the largest
in the navy, now lying at Sheerness, which was protected by
a quantity of cast iron judged sufficient to save             all
                                                       her copper,

with security, has, by the application of protectors of 1-70th,
made this voyage *, without apparently any wear of her sheet
ing; and that she is now preparing with the same protectors
to make another voyage.
    In cases when ships are to be newly sheathed, the experi
ments which have been detailed in the preceding pages render
it likely, that the most advantageous way of applying protection
will be under, and not over the copper: the electrical circuit
being made in the sea water passing through the places of
junction in the sheets; and in this way every sheet of copper
 may be provided with nails of iron or zinc, for protecting
 them to any extent required. . By driving the nail into the
 wood through paper wetted with brine above the tarred paper,
 or felt, or any other substance that may be employed, the                                    in

 vantage, that a considerable part of the metal will, if the pro                     6.
 tectors are placed in the centre of the sheet, be deposited and
 re-dissolved: so there is reason to believe that small masses
 of metal will act for a great length of time. Zinc, in conse

 XVI.    Notice     of a   Meteoric Stone which     fell at       Nanjemoy,    in
   Maryland, North America, on February 10, 1825.   By Dr.
   SAMUEL D. CARVER. In a Letter to Professor SILLIMAN".
 I* TAKE      the liberty of forwarding you a notice of a meteoric
     stone which fell in this town on the morning of Thursday,
  February 10, 1825.     The sky was rather hazy, and the wind
 south-west.    At about noon the people of the town and of the
 adjacent country were alarmed by an explosion of some body
 in the air, which was succeeded by a loud whizzing noise, like
 that of air rushing through a small aperture, passing rapidly
 in the course from north-west to south-east, nearly parallel
 with the river Potomac.      Shortly after, a spot of ground on
 the plantation of Capt. W. D. Harrison, surveyor of this port,
 was found to have been recently broken; and on examination
 a rough stone of an oblong shape, weighing sixteen pounds
and seven ounces, was found about eighteen inches under the
surface.    The stone, when taken from the ground, about half
an hour after it is supposed to have fallen, was sensibly warm,
and had a strong sulphureous smell.          It has a hard vitreous
surface, and when broken appears composed of an earthy or
siliceous matrix, of a light slate colour, containing numerous
globules of various sizes, very hard, and of a brown colour,
together with small portions of brownish yellow pyrites, which
become dark coloured on being reduced to powder.            I have
procured for you a fragment t of the stone, weighing four
pounds and ten ounces, which was all I could obtain. Various
notions were entertained by the people in the neighbourhood

perhaps fifty miles square; some heard the explosion, while
others heard only the subsequent whizzing noise          the air. All                   in
agree       stating that the noise appeared directly over their
              in
heads.    One gentleman, living about 25 miles from the place
where the stone fell, says, that      caused his whole plantation

over their heads.   There was no fire-ball seen by me or others
that   I
       have heard. There was but one report, and but one
stone fell, to my knowledge, and there was no peculiar smell
in the air. It fell on my plantation, within 250 yards of my
house, and within 100 of the habitation of the negroes.
   I have given this statement to Dr. Carver, at his request,
and which is as full as                I
                          could give at this distant day, from
having thought but little of it since.  Given this 28th day of
April      1825.                                              W. D. HARRIson,

  XVII.        Analysis of the Maryland Aérolite. By GEORGE
                  CHILTON, Lecturer on Chemistry, &c."
THE           piece of Maryland aerolite+ subjected to examination,
  weighed 228-30 grains in air, and lost 62°25 grains by im
mersion in water, at 60° temperature.  Its specific gravity is
therefore 3-66. The external crust was taken off, and the re
mainder powdered, not very finely, and separated into two
parts by the magnet; 40 grains were obedient to the magnet,
25 of which were taken for examination. The same quantity
was taken of the unmagnetical portion.
Examination             of   the unmagnetical Portion                     of   the    Maryland
                               Aérolite.
   Process 1.-The 25        grains were digested in dilute nitric
acid; an undissolved part floated, which, together with the
solution, was decanted from a heavier part, which remained
at the bottom of the flask. To this last, muriatic acid was
added, and digestion continued till every thing soluble was
taken up. The two insoluble parts, managed in the usual
way and carefully dried, weighed 15.87 grains.         During ex
posure to a red heat, in a crucible, sulphur burnt off with                                    its
usual blue flame, and left siliceous earth which weighed 14.6
grains.                      -
   Process 2-The acid solutions were mixed together and
evaporated slowly        dryness; during which, portions
                                 to                           mat                         of
ter fell down,   which,  together with portion left after treating
                                                         a
the dry mass with water, weighed 0-7 gr.         the common tem      at
perature. Qn further examination they proved                  silica                 to   be
and oxide       of
               iron.    By estimation, 0.3 silica, and 0.2 oxide                               of
iron,     the perfectly dried state.

    Process 3.—Bi-carbonate of potash was added to the solu
tion, which was heated a little.        The precipitate was separated
by the filter, washed and digested in pure potash. The caustic
liquor, drawn off by the syphon, super-saturated with muriatic
acid, and treated with carbonate of ammonia, yielded a pre
cipitate which after ignition weighed 0-1 gr. It appeared to
be alumina contaminated with oxide of iron.
    Process 4.—The filtered solution, from which the first pre
cipitate in the last process was separated, was boiled; a gray
earth fell down in flocks. The addition of potash occasioned
a further deposit. On heating, it changed to a cinnamon
brown colour; dilute sulphuric acid,

weighing 0-2 gr.
   Process 6.-The last watery solution was gently evaporated
        small compass; sulphate             lime fell down during the

    Process 7.—The precipitate (Process 3), which had been
digested         pure potassa, was redissolved
                   in                                      muriatic acid.  in

after ignition weighed 3-9 grains.
    Process 8.-The last ammoniacal solution, which had                                             a

pitate had been separated, had a wine-yellow colour, thereby
 affording a suspicion that it contained more metal.        Neutrali
 zation and heat were both tried without effecting a further se
 paration.     Hydro-sulphuret of ammonia threw down a black
 precipitate.    This precipitate heated, redissolved in nitric acid,
 and   precipitated  by potash, gave another apple-green preci
 pitate, which ignited, weighed 0-2 gr. The solution being              .
 still a little coloured, was again treated with hydrosulphuret
 of ammonia, redissolved in nitric acid, and precipitated by
potash.      By this treatment another precipitate was obtained,
 which    weighed  0.1 grain.
    Process   10-Twenty      grains of the same unmagnetical acro
lite were mixed with an equal weight of nitre, and heated in
 a bright red heat.     On dissolving out the matter of the cru
 cible and neutralizing the solution, it neither produced a yel
low with nitrate of lead, nor a red with nitrate of mercury—
hence it contained no chrome.                                         -

    It would seem     superfluous   to  remark, that the increase of
weight in this, and the following analysis, must be accounted
for from the change of condition of the iron with respect to
oxygen.

we may infer, that from every snow there is received twice as

  naturalists of Greece and
                                            the magnet was known to the
                                    Rome, but it is uncertain at
what time the    Europeans   became acquainted with that remark
able property of the magnet which we call Polarity; distinct
traces, however, of the use of the compass are found towards
the end of the twelfth century. There is no doubt that the
Chinese knew it long before, and it is very probable that the
Venetians obtained some information           respecting it while
trading on the Red Sea.
    Our Northern ancestors were in this respect not behind the
 inhabitants of Southern Europe, as may be seen in the Land
namabok, part i. chap. 2 and 7, where we are told that the
famous Viking Floke Vilgerdarson, the third discoverer of
Iceland, who sailed about the year 868 from Rogaland in
Norway, in order to seek for Gardarsholm (Iceland), took
three ravens with him, which were to serve him as guides.
For on letting birds          fly   as on
                                the open sea, and finding them                            to

further, that the deviation is different in various places, being
in some more westerly and others more easterly: at last, too,
it was found that the deviation differed at different times in the
same places. These phaenomena can only be explained by
the assumption that the magnetic poles do not correspond
with the geographical, and change their position from year to
year. As there are, however, natural magnets having four
poles, two and two of the same denomination, the earth itself
may possibly be such an anomalous magnet. Thus, then, the
two following questions are to be answered: Are two magnetic
poles sufficient to explain all the phaenomena of the declination,
or must we assume several of them 2 What is the position and

in the year 1769 it was found in fort Prince of Wales, on
the western coast of the bay, to have been only = 9°41'.                      If
we proceed on the continent, it disappears entirely, becomes
then easterly, and increases so rapidly towards the western
coast of America, that it was, according to the observation of
Cook in the year 1778, in Nootka Sound = 19° 51' E.; and in
the same year, in the northernmost part of Behring's Straits,
 = 35° 37' E. If we extend the arrows in Nootka Sound and in

    Among these observations the 7th can be most relied upon,
having been made on shore by the astronomer Wales, by
means of a large compass and an exact meridian, and being

over, from the reasons given above, we must consider the 7th
observation the most accurate,   thought that      I

rely on the mean obtained from the                    2–7 and
 1–7, by which we obtain the following for the determination
of the point of convergence in 1769:
       Distance from the pole . . . . . . = 19° 43'
       Longitude W. of London . . . . = 99 53%

     If
     in the North we follow the coast of Norway, the declina
tion decreases, and at last entirely disappears in the White
Sea. Thus Bohr found it in the year 1818, in Bergen = 24°
18' W.; Lieut. Christie, in Vadsøe in Varangerfiorden, the
28th of June of the same year,    7° 55'.      a

p. 148) as follows: Variation 24° 0'W., Long. 292°11'. Lat. 56°33'...The
point of convergence is calculated after this. On the otherhand, you will find
in my extracts from the Philosophical Transactions for 1775, the latitude
 = 56° 53, and the declination = 28° 0' W., which would remove the                  re

out where the error lies.”—On the Magnetism of the Earth, p. 90, note.
According to the Philosophical Transactions for 1775, p. 135, Lambert is cor
rect: Hutchins, however, adds: “These experiments were made in conjunc
tion with Capt. Richards, in the cabin of the Prince Rupert, whilst she lay
among the ice. The ship frequently varied the position of her head a point
of the compass; but by replacing the instrument as often as we found occa
          I

 nearly three hours) are pretty accurate.”     Under           all

 nation in some places between 11° and 12°, and in others
 about 20°. Capt. Buchan and Lieut. Franklin found the de
 clination in the discovery ships Dorothea and Trent, in the
 year 1818, in most places near Spitzbergen about 24°.                                  If
 we draw on these places in the chart arrows forming the
 above-mentioned angles with the meridian, their continuation
 will not go through the point which we found above at 19° 43'
 from the pole, and 25.9° 58' E. of Greenwich.                       The same will
 be the case with the extension of the arrows that may be drawn
 in the northernmost parts of Behring's Straits and in north
 eastern Siberia.            By this we are led to the supposition that
 there must be somewhere in the Siberian Ocean a magnetic
 pole which attracts the northern pole of the needle,                       in the sea
 between Spitzbergen and Norway, towards the east, and in
 eastern Siberia and Behring's Straits, towards the west.

verted into a liquid similar to an emulsion*.
   Treated with water it changes, without giving out heat,
into hydrochloric acid and a compound of the oxide and chlo
ride of antimony.    This white powder, which is precipitated
by mixing the chloride with water, is entirely volatilized when
heated by a blowpipe in a little matrass; it contains therefore,
neither antimonious acid nor antimonic acid: but as this chlo
ride of antimony is converted by water into hydrochloric acid
and oxide of antimony, it must correspond to them in compo
sition; and as oxide of antimony contains 3 atoms of oxygen,
the antimony must be combined with 3 atoms of chlorine in the

   Yet as Dr. John Davy's analysis of this solid chloride of an
timony gives a different result+, I analysed it in the followin
manner.     I poured water on a quantity of the chloride, an
added tartaric acid, until the liquid was perfectly clear and
ceased to become milky by adding afresh a large quantity of
water. . I then passed a current of sulphuretted hydrogen
through the liquid, till sulphuret of antimony was no longer

of sulphur : it was therefore the sulphuret of antimony con
taining 3 atoms of sulphur, or precisely what ought to be
         under these circumstances. As, however, it contained,
traces of an excess of sulphur, in consequence of the sulphu
retted hydrogen which had been passed for a very long time
through the liquid,      I
                        heated a part of this sulphuret in a bulb
blown in the middle of a glass tube, and passed over it a cur
rent of hydrogen dried by chloride of calcium. The sulphu
ret of antimony was decomposed; and there was obtained an
timony, sulphuretted hydrogen, and traces of sulphur.
   The liquor, separated from the sulphuret of antimony, was
slowly heated, to drive off the sulphuretted hydrogen, but not

the hydrochloric acid, which cannot be separated from water
by heat when it is mixed with it in small proportion.      The
hydrochloric acid was then precipitated by nitrate of silver.
  he chloride of silver obtained had notwithstanding a black
ish colour, from a slight mixture of sulphuret of silver. The
results of this analysis were: Antimony. 1937 gramme (29.9
grs.), and chloride of silver 6'886 grammes (106.3 grs.), equi
valent to 1-699 gramme (24.7 grs.) of chlorine. The chloride

   If  I had obtained the chloride of silver quite free from sul
 phuret of silver, this result would agree much more with the
 calculation.
   If  a current of dry chlorine is made to pass over heated
 metallic antimony, another chloride of antimony is ob
 tained. The antimony burns vividly in the gas, emitting
 sparks, whilst a very volatile liquid is formed. This liquid is
 white, or of a very light yellowish tint; it also contains chlo
ride of iron, if the antimony employed contained a portion of
 this metal.    The chloride nevertheless remains at the bottom
 of the vessel, and does not dissolve in the liquid. This resem

same manner as the solid chloride.   By sulphuretted hydro
É.  I obtained sulphuret of antimony; also orange-coloured,
  ut a little paler than the sulphuret obtained in analysing the
solid chloride.      It contained 5 atoms of sulphur to 1 of anti
mony. Treated with dry hydrogen, it is converted into me
tallic antimony and sulphur, and sulphuretted hydrogen is dis
engaged.          I
               obtained 1980 grammes (30:6 grs.) of metallic anti
mony; and the liquid, separated from the sulphuret and preci
pitated by nitrate of silver, gave 11-764 grammes (181-6 grs.)
of chloride of silver, equivalent to 2-902 grammes (44.8 grs.)
of chlorine. The chloride of silver, however, contained a                                                       #.

        I have            made many experiments on the sulphurets                                   of antimo
 ny, and only found three which correspond with the oxides of
 that metal.
    The sulphuret of antimony with 3 atoms of sulphur has dif
 ferent colours. That which is found native is of a lead-gray.
 Its composition has been made known by Berzelius.                     is                                         It
 analogous to the oxide of antimony, with 3 atoms of oxygen;
 for it dissolves without residuum in hydrochloric acid, disen
 gaging only sulphuretted hydrogen.
      he same sulphuret of                  is obtained by passing a
 current of sulphuretted hydrogen through a solution contain
 ing oxide of antimony; but it is of an orange colour, nearly
 similar to that of the golden sulphuret.         It becomes brownish
 by drying, and then takes an aspect more like kermes.             This
 same sulphuret is obtained by passing sulphuretted hydrogen
 through a solution of tartar emetic, or through a solution of
 butter of antimony in water and tartaric acid.

     In  the Pharmacopoeias, as is generally known, the names
of    crocus and nitrum antimonii are given to the compounds
in which sulphuret of antimony combined with oxide of                                                        an
timony in various proportions.          Kermes has also been taken
for such a compound.       M. Berzelius, however, has shown that
it does not differ in     composition from the sulphuret
                                        its                       anti                                 of

above given confirms this.
   There exists, however, combination             a sulphuret     anti    of                          of
mony with the oxide             definite proportion,

    Jan. 20.—A paper was read On the Geology of Jamaica,
 by H. T. De la Beche, Esq., F.R.S. &c.
    Mr. De la Beche's observations are confined to the eastern
half of Jamaica, which includes the whole range of the Blue
 Mountains, the highest eminences of the island, those of Port
 Royal, Spanish-Town, the Mocko Mountains, and other ridges
 of inferior elevation.    These heights often include or are con
 nected with extensive     plains,  the principal of which are those
 of Liguanea, Vere, and Lower Clarendon, Luidas Vale, and
 St. Thomas’s.     The rocks of oldest formation which presented
themselves to the author, within this district, he refers to the
submedial or transition series.          They compose the greater
part of the Blue Mountain range, and consist of 1. Gray-wacke,
both foliated and compact, coarse and fine; presenting in short
the usual variations common to this rock in Europe, and ap
pearing, on some points, to pass into old red sandstone: 2.
Transition limestone, apparently destitute of organic remains,
compact, of a dark blueish gray colour, and traversed by veins
of calcareous spar; occasionally associated with argillaceous
slate, and        its
                 upper beds much intermixed with sandstones.
These stratified rocks throughout the Blue Mountains gene
rally dip towards the N.E. and E.N.E.               considerable angle;

   These trap rocks are found, generally, supporting the great
white limestone formation, which occupies a very large portion
of the whole island. This formation, from the fossils it con
tains, is referred by Mr. De la Beche to the tertiary series. It
is principally composed of white limestone, most frequently
very compact, and then strongly resembling the compact va
rieties of Jura limestone. The strata are usually very thick,
varying from 3 to 20 feet in breadth.            In some districts, this
rock is interstratified with thick beds of red marle, and sand
stone, and white chalky marle. The compact limestone con
stitutes the middle part of the formation: the lower beds con
sist, chiefly, of sands and marles, sometimes associated with
blueish gray compact limestones, at others with beds of earthy
            white limestone, containing an abundance of organic
remains, viz. Echinites, Ostreat, and a particularly large species
of Cerithium. The upper beds of the formation are rather
chalky, sandy, and marly, and contain numerous remains of
the genera Conus, Cerithium, Astarte, Natica, &c.; and near
the sea coast a great quantity of corals, which, frequently, have
almost a recent appearance.                                             -
   Above the white limestone formation, beds of conglomerate
and sandstone are visible on many points, particularly on the
edges of the savannahs; whence the author calls them the
Savannah sandstones.
    The upper beds of         all
                                visible    the island, consist
                                           in                            of   Di

troductory paper on their construction and use, by the Presi
dent of this Society, will constitute an appendix to the second
volume of the Memoirs.
    “Amongst the numerous communications which have been
made from the Associates of this Society, the Council may
specify a very interesting and elaborate paper, forwarded to
the Foreign Secretary by M. Plana, on some important            in
quiries in physical Astronomy, which will be found in the se
cond part of the second volume. The President also has
received a letter from M. Bessel, requesting to know whether
the Astronomical Society would patronize and promote a plan,
which he had suggested, for making detached charts of the
heavens.    The President was requested by the Council to
assure M. Bessel that the Astronomical Society would doubt
less promote so laudable and useful a measure, as much as lay
in their power. That active and indefatigable astronomer,
pursuant to his general plan, now regularly observes all the
smaller stars in zones, agreeably to the method suggested, and
practised, by the late Rev. F. Wollaston. He has already com
pleted the zones within 15° on each side of the equator; and in
that space has observed upwards of 30,000 stars. The obser
vations are annually published by M. Bessel, with the other
observations made at the Royal Observatory at Konigsberg.
When they are reduced (as there is great reason to hope they
will be), they will constitute a most valuable accession to the
stores of Astronomy.
    “The instrument made use of in this survey of the heavens,
as well as that used by Mr. Wollaston, were both made by
the late Mr. Cary.
    “Others of #. Associates have especially distinguished
themselves, and have forwarded to this Society some very         in
 teresting communications, as the successive parts and volumes
of the Memoirs will evince. In alluding to these distinguished
 characters, your Council cannot avoid noticing the indefati
 gable labours of M. Schumacher, Professor of Astronomy at
 Copenhagen.      His Astronomische Nachrichten, or Astronomi
 cal Newspaper,   has considerably facilitated the intercourse be
 tween Astronomers in every part of the world; serving to re
 cord the observations of various interesting phaenomena, as
 well as to draw the attention of observers to other phaenomena
 about to appear. He has also published several compendious
 collections of tables of great practical utility.  Among these,
 your Council cannot omit a particular reference to the very
                                                                 .

the purpose of reducing the 50,000 stars contained in La
 lande's Histoire Céleste ; serving, indeed, to effect the reduc
 tion of any one of those stars in the short space of two or three
 minutes.
    “Thus,     whilst M. Schumacher has laid all Astronomers
 under considerable obligations by the publication of these
 tables, he has conferred a peculiar mark of his esteem upon
 the body now assembled, by dedicating this volume to the
 Astronomical Society; a distinction, which they, who know
 the talent and zeal of this our eminent Associate, will be able
 to appreciate in an adequate manner.
    “One of our Associates, M. Struve, has devoted himself
 with great perseverance and success to the observation, and
 classification, of double stars; an important department of
astronomical research, which was originally opened and pur
 sued with his wonted assiduity and accuracy by our late re
 vered president, Sir William Herschel.
    “This subject has been still more extensively pursued, and
with considerable ardour and zeal, by two of our Members,
 Messrs. Herschel and South; whose labours on this very        in
teresting branch of the science are contained in a paper read
before the Royal Society, and which in itself forms the third
part of the Philosophical Transactions for the Year 1824.
Whoever has read that paper with attention, must be struck
with the vast labour and perseverance, the great accuracy and
uniformity of result, with which those delicate observations
have been made.       Such an immense mass of interesting facts
cannot fail to open new views to the contemplative philosopher,
and extend our knowledge of the true system of the universe:
and Mr. Herschel himself has, in a communication about to
be laid before the Royal Society, made a happy application
thereof, as explanatory of some of the phaenomena connected
with parallax.     The indefatigable ardour of Mr. South in the
cause of Astronomy, induced him to follow up his researches
on the same subject whilst he was in France; and he has re
cently made a communication to the Royal Society, of some
new observations, of equal, if not superior, importance; and
which will appear in a subsequent volume of -the Philosophical-
Transactions.
    “For these laborious and valuable researches and observa
tions relative to double stars, the Council have awarded to
each of those distinguished Members and Associate, Mr. Her
schel, Mr. South, and M. Struve, the Gold Medal of the So
ciety, which will be presented to them at a General Meeting
expressly called for that purpose, as soon as the medals can

    “It  has frequently been a subject of regret with many
Members of this Society, that there are so few particulars
 known relative to the different public Observatories in various
parts of the world: such as the construction of the building,
and the instruments with which it is furnished.          The cele
brated John Bernouilli in his Lettres Astronomiques, published
 at Berlin in 1771, attempted a description of some of those,
 which he had visited : but so many alterations have taken place
since that period, not only in the Observatories themselves,
(some of which no longer exist,) but also in the instruments,
which are now of a totally new character, that but little infor
 mation as to the present state of those establishments can be
 obtained from that source.    The Council are of opinion that
it would tend materially to the advancement of Astronomy, if
an accurate description of every principal Observatory could
be obtained, accompanied with a ground plan and elevation of
 the building; together with a description of the instruments
employed, and drawings of such as are remarkable, either for
their novelty or peculiar interest. It is well known that there
are several instruments in constant use on the Continent, and
much approved by Astronomers, which have not yet been seen
in this country: and some in this country, which are not suf
ficiently known abroad; or even amongst ourselves.             The
 Council would encourage every attempt to promote this spe
 cies of information, by publishing in their Memoirs the ac
counts which they may from time to time receive on this sub
ject, and the drawings, with which they might be accom
 panied.

the Difference of Longitude between the National Observa
tories of Greenwich and Paris; by J. F. W. Herschel, Esq.
Sec. R.S.: communicated by the Board of Longitude.”
    In this paper, after stating the wish expressed by the French
Ministry of War, that the above determination should be made,
with the ready accession to their desire of our own Board of
Longitude, and describing the method resorted to, Mr. Her
schel gives the observations in detail. They were made by
himself and one French officer on this side of the Channel, and
by Capt. Sabine and another French officer on the coast of
 France.    Their general result is 92.11%" for the difference of
longitude between the two Observatories; and though many
of the observations had been rendered unavailable by un
toward circumstances which it was impossible to foresee or to
obviate, Mr. H. stated that this determination was not likely
to require a correction exceeding 1-10th of a second, and very
unlikely to want one of twice that amount.—Ann, of Phil.
         EARTHQUAKE FELT AT SEA, IN FEBRUARY 1825.
    There are few observations of greater importance, in refer
ence to the theory      of earthquakes, than    the determination of
the exact time when        they  are felt at sea. The place where
they have their origin,-the velocity with which they are pro
pagated,—and their probable depth beneath the surface, may
 beinferred from a series of accurate observations on the effects
 which they produce, and the time when they are felt at dif
 ferent points on the earth's surface.
    The earthquake which was experienced at Lisbon, on the
                    É.
 2d February 1816, at five minutes past midnight, was felt at
 sea by the Portuguese vessel, the Marquis de Angeja, bound
 from Bengal to                at the
                                   -  distance of 270 leagues from
                                                                that

that city; and it was also experienced by another vessel, bound,
from Brazil to Portugal, at the distance of 120 leagues,
   On the 4th of April 1812, the vessels on the coast of the
Caraccas trembled, during the heavy shock of an earthquake,
as if they had been on a reef of rocks.
   In the earthquake which took place at Chili, on the 19th of
November 1822, the effect on the ships in the bay was such,
as if the chain-cable had run out in an instant.                  -
   On the 10th of   February   1823,  the East India Company's
ship Winchelsea, in east long. 85° 33", and north lat. 52°, ex
perienced the effects of an earthquake.    When the vessel was
some hundred miles from land, and out of soundings, a tre
mulous motion was felt, as if it were passing over a coral rock,
and this was accompanied with a loud rumbling noise, both
of which continued for two or three minutes.                    -
   This effect bears a close resemblance to that which is de
scribed in the following extract of a letter from on board the
 Recovery, of       , in a voyage from Madeira to Honduras, in
February 1825.
    “In  running through among the islands, we were in dread
of every schooner-rigged vessel we saw, as these seas swarm
with pirates. However, nothing worthy of note occurred till
off the island of Ruatan.     Between seven and eight o'clock at
                                                                              by

longer crystals were formed towards the north than towards
the south, and yet every thing was the same in both legs of
the tube.      The solution of nitrate of silver in both legs of the
tube was in communication, while the mercury covered onl
 the bottom of the tube. The experiment was again
in presence of Hansteen, with two syphon-tubes, one parallel,
and the other at right angles to the magnetic meridian. . The
silver began to separate in the tube which was placed in the
north and south direction, and shot out into larger, more nu
merous, and more brilliant radiations in the leg towards the
north, than in that towards the south. In the syphon in the
east and west direction no change was observed until the ex
                                  º:
piry of twelve hours. Hansteen afterwards repeated the ex
periment several times, and                with the same result, and
deduced from his        experiments    the following inferences. 1.
 The arbor Dianae is more       strikingly  developed when the tube
is placed    in the magnetic   meridian,   than when in the east and
west direction. 2. When it remains in the magnetic meridian,
the silver tree rises higher in the northern than in the southern
leg. 3. The crystals are more acicular, and have a higher
metallic lustre, in the northern than in the southern leg of the
syphon.       The same experiment has been successfully repeated
 by Doebereiner and Schweigger, from whose Journal the above
details are extracted.—Edin. Phil. Journ.
Account of PRofessor BERzELIUS's METHOD of DETECTING
        ARSENIC IN THE BODIES OF PERSONS POISONED.
   Professor Berzelius has lately given some instructions for
the discovery of arsenic in persons that have been poisoned
with it. He considers the reduction of arsenic to the metallic
state as the only incontestible proof of the presence of this poison.
Arsenic may occur in two ways, viz., when it is found in sub
stance (in the state of arsenious acid) in the dead body, and
when it is not found in this state; though the intestines of
the dead body may contain it in the state of a solution.
   In the first of these cases, it is easy to determine the pre
sence of arsenic.      In order to do this, take a piece about three
inches long of an ordinary barometer tube, and having drawn
out one end of it into a much narrower tube, close the nar
rower end.       Let some of the arsenic found in the body be now
put in at the open wide end, so that it may fall down to
the narrow end. Any quantity of this arsenic of sufficient
volume to be taken from the body will suffice for this
           -

after it has been freed from                 moisture      allbringing              by                      it      to

ON THE     INVISIBILITY OF CERTAIN COLOURS TO CERTAIN EYES.
    A variety     cases have been recorded, where persons with

sound    eyes, capable     performing of  their ordinary functions,   all
were   incapable     distinguishing

    -      On the Figure of the Earth. By         WILLIAM GAL
                         BRAITH, Esq. M.A.
   To the Editor of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      Sir,
      some of the previous Numbers of your Journal I was
 INduced                                                       in
            to make a few remarks on several of the most       ac
curate systems of experiments by the pendulums hitherto exe
cuted for the purpose of determining the figure of the earth.
Since that time Captain Sabine's work on that subject has ap
peared, containing an extensive series of experiments in the
northern hemisphere, reaching from the equator to about 80°
north latitude, embracing the longest arc of the meridian yet
attempted; and executed, it is believed, with an accuracy which
cannot easily be surpassed.    Capt. Sabine has also reconsidered
some of the   experiments  of others, particularly those made by
the French mathematicians on the arc passing chiefly through
France; and, by applying corrections analogous to those em
ployed by himself, has by that means rendered them more
consistent, and comparable with each other, and with his own.
By the French experiments it appeared from the character of
the errors,    Phil. Mag. vol. lxiv. p. 167, but more especiall
from vol. lxv. p. 15,-that the gravitating force at about 45°  §
was less from experiment than theory required, so far as the
accuracy of these experiments could be depended upon; or in
other words, that the pendulum was more distant from the
centre of the earth than could have been anticipated: and this
conclusion seemed to derive some support from the compres
sion obtained from the measurement
                                 -
                                          of arcs near the mean
parallel.
   Whether this conclusion, which it must be admitted is not
very natural, is to be ranked among those views which the
early French mathematicians entertained, in opposition to
Newton, remains to be determined.       Perhaps the nature of the
ground over which the arc passed, when properly examined:

   would, in part at least, explain the irregularity in question;
   since at Formentera the pendulum was not much above the
   level of the sea, in the interior of France it was considerably
   elevated, and again at Dunkirk it descended nearly to the level
   of the ocean. Now it is obvious, that if the experimental re
   sults were not properly reduced to what they would have been
   at the level of the sea, the configuration of the country would
  have, generally speaking, produced the irregularity we have

                   Mr. Galbraith           on the Figure             of the Earth.                     163
principles, it may be supposed that the deviation from the truth
would be nearly insensible.
   But accurate observations on the length of the pendulum
at stations selected with judgement, are not of themselves
the only data necessary to determine the compression.                                                        If
there is any error in the fundamental formula employed for
this purpose, a corresponding error will be communicated to
the amount of compression. It is true that the deductions
hitherto given have the appearance of great accuracy; for
when expressed by a fraction of which the numerator is unit,
the denominator is frequently carried to one or two places
of decimals. This, however, is a mere deception, if it can
be shown that the denominator of that fraction is by the or
dinary formula erroneous to the amount of several units.
The formula first demonstrated by Clairaut has been ac
quiesced in by Laplace, Delambre, Borda and Biot in France,
and by Kater and Sabine in England.            Now it is well known
that it is but an approximation obtained in course of the ana
lysis by omitting the powers greater than the first. “At the
present time,” says Mr. Ivory (Phil. Mag. vol. lxvi. p. 432),
one of the ablest geometers of the age, “when so much has
been done, and is still doing, to determine the figure of the
earth experimentally, it seems proper likewise to reconsider
the theory.”     With these sentiments our opinion perfectly
coincides. The failure of Clairaut's first attempts to integrate
of the three
to geometers,   and
                    b.
a differential equation in the solution of the famous problem
                      in his theory of the moon, is well known
                    might    have suggested the propriety of ex
amining this celebrated theorem, and to determine the degree
of  its accuracy by taking             least another term compre

the influence of the iron on board the vessels, were all made
on shore, or on icebergs) it appears, that in Baffin's Bay and
near 64° of longitude the declination already amounts to 90°,

     From these observations it would appear, that the greatest
 dip was found by Captain Ross on the 20th of August 1818,
near the entrance of Sir James Lancaster's Sound, into which
 he did not venture to penetrate; but that Captain Parry, after
 having proceeded up that sound, found a regular increase of
 the dip, till on the 11th of September 1819 it had risen to
 88° 37', leaving the needle only 1° 23' from the vertical posi
tion.    We may then conclude from this increase of the dip,
that the expedition was about 3° north of the point where the
 dip is 90°, which also agrees pretty nearly with the point of
 convergence which we have deduced before from the observed
declinations.       Thus then, according to the indication of both
instruments a magnetic pole exists in that vicinity.
    If we consider the southern segment of the globe (Plate II.),
we see that between the meridians 50° and 140° all the ar
rows are directed to one point, which is about 20° distant
from the antarctic pole, and 137° east of Greenwich. To the
east of the meridian of 140°, and to the west of that of 40°, the
arrows begin to deviate from this point; and in the vicinity of
Terra del Fuego, between 240° and 300° of longitude, they
are again directed to another point, distant about 32° from
the pole, and situated in 237° longitude.                Thus the southern
hemisphere has, like the northern, two different points of

                  of the  Magnetic Poles    of the Earth.            173
   The distance     we found above      for the year 1773 was
            Distance from the pole                = 20° 33'
            E. longitude from Greenwich = 136 15
                                                         .
   It is possible that the determinations for the year 1642 may
not be quite correct, since at that period they had no means
of giving the exact longitude; nevertheless }                not believe
that the   uncertainty    with  respect  to the  longitude of this point
amounts to one degree.          Thus then this magnetic pole has
moved within 131 years, 10° 14'; or 4"69 per annum west
ward.      The situation of the other magnetic pole south of
the  continent,    I have fixed for the year 1670, from some ob
servations mentioned by Halley in his table of variations of
the magnetic needle (Philos. Trans. No. 148), as follows:
            Distance from the pole                 = 15° 53'
            E. longitude from Greenwich = 265 26#
  We have found         the situation of this pole for the year 1774:
            Distance from the pole                 = 12° 43'
            E. longitude from Greenwich = 236 43
Thus this pole has moved within 104 years 28° 43'4, or
16:57 annually, westward.
   Whence we see that the two magnetic poles in the northern
hemisphere move eastward, while those in the southern hemi-               .
sphere move westward.
   For the sake of abbreviation we          will designate   the south
eastern   pole below New Holland, by A; the south-western
below Terra del Fuego, by a ; the north-westerly in America,
by B; and the north-easterly in Siberia, by b. Thus A and
B are very nearly diametrically opposed to each other: for
the distance of both from the pole is about 20°; and A lies in
the meridian 136°, and B in that of 260° E, of Greenwich,
which makes a difference in longitude of about 125°.                The
case is  similar, although    with greater   deviations, with the points
a and b; the distance of the former from the antarctic pole
being 13°, and of the latter from the arctic pole a little above
4°; and the longitude of the former being = 237°, and that
of the latter 116°; thus giving a difference in longitude of
= 121°. Experience, however, teaches us that there are no
magnets with one or three poles, i. e. with any odd number
of poles; a result which might have been found- d priori,
as the magnetic force only arises from a destruction of the
equilibrium in the opposite powers; whilst one power prevails
in one part of the body, the other must be forced into the
opposite extremity.        Therefore a magnet of several poles must
be considered as an assemblage of magnets each of which has
                                                                      its

correct,       in
               which     theory    and experience agree.         The poles                                    A
and     B are     about the same distance from the terrestrial poles,

and therefore very nearly diametrically opposed: besides, they
are much stronger than the poles                  and       whence     a seems   b;                 it

centres of both lie much nearer the surface                   the South Sea,

 Jessor Hansteen.

     I   have     been         much pleased with several Numbers                                     of the
Magazin for Naturvidenskaberne, but particularly so by your
article on the magnetism of the earth. On reading Scoresby's
voyage for the re-discovery of the east coast of Greenland, I
thought to observe that neither he nor anybody else had
noticed the noise attending the motions of the northern lights.
I  believe, however, that                     f

space of several hours, when a boy of ten or eleven years old
(it was     the year 1766, 1767
            in                       1768);    was then crossing

a  meadow, near which was no forest,         winter, and saw for           in
the first time the sky over me glowing with the most brilliant
light playing     beautiful colours,

seen since.     The colours showed themselves very distinctly
on the plain, which was covered with snow         hoar-frost, and                    or
I  heard several times   quick  whispering
                                      a     sound simultaneously
with the motion       the rays over my head.

from the surface of the earth, in a direction inclining towards
the south (an inclination which with us forms an angle of
about 73°).           If
                   then this light occupies the whole northern
sky, rising more than 17° above the zenith, the rays must pro
ceed from under the feet of the observer, although they do not
receive their reflecting power till they have reached a consi
derable elevation, perhaps beyond our atmosphere. It is
therefore conceivable why we should frequently hear a noise
attending the northern lights, when the inhabitants of southern
countries, who see these phaenomena at a distance of several
 hundred miles, hear no report whatever.      Wargentin, in the
 15th volume of the Trans. of the Swed.     Acad., says that Dr.
 Gisler and Mr. Hellant, two scholars who had resided for some
time in the north of Sweden, having been so requested by
the Academy, made a report of their observations on - the
 aurora borealis.
   The following is an extract from Dr. Gisler's account:
   “The most remarkable circumstance attending the northern
lights is,that although they seem        very high   the air, per
                                                       to   be               in
 haps higher than our common clouds, there are yet convincing
proofs that they are connected with the atmosphere, and often
descend     so
            low
                       in
                       that
                        it,    times they seem
                                        at          touch the earth   to                   it
self, and     on
              the highest monntains they produce an effect like                             a
wind round the face                of
                            the traveller.”    He also says that he
                                      persons,
            of as
himself     well         as

rushing     them, just           strong wind had been blowing

                                       yet add,”   says  Gisler, “that
people who had travelled         Norway, informed me they had

                              to

        HE attention of the medical profession to comparative
      anatomy, and the interest which the naturalist feels in
 prosecuting this interesting study, are my inducements for of
 fering the following account of an animal which forms, in the
chain of created beings, the connecting link of brutes to man.
    Many have been disposed to doubt the existence of such an
animal as the Satyrus, and more have been incredulous of any
remarkable similarity in structure to man.            Such doubts,                            I
think, must be removed, by an examination of the anatomical
preparations I have been enabled to make of him +.
    This animal is a native of Borneo, an Asiatic island under
the equator, in longitude from 110° to 120° east. This indi
vidual was carried from Borneo to Batavia, and came into the
possession of Mr. Forrestier of that place, where he remained
some time.      By him he was sent, consigned to Mr. Charles
Thatcher, merchant, of this place, in the Octavia, Captain
Blanchard.      He died on the night of the second of June, the
first after his arrival; disappointing the sanguine expectations
of his owners of great pecuniary remuneration from his exhi
bition in public.
    In his external appearance, our subject resembled an Afri
can, with the neck somewhat shorter and the head projecting
more forward.      He was three feet and a half in height. He
was covered with hair, except his face, the palms of the hands
                                    all
and feet, which were          the colour
                                    of        the negro.    The hair

in the sockets.    His brow was prominent, to defend the eyes
from  injury in the woods. He had very little hair on the brow.
His   nose was flat.   His lips were very large and thick, more
so than those of   any negro I ever saw.    His chin was broad
and projecting, as was likewise the upper jaw.    His chest was
round, full, and prominent.     His shoulders were set well back.
His scapulae were flat and close behind. His waist was small.
His hips were flat and narrow. His arms were very long, the
fingers reaching to the ancles.      His lower extremities were
short and small in proportion to the rest of the animal.      He
had the spiral lines like human, on the tips of the fingers, and
the lines of palmistry on the hands, and also on the lower
limbs. He had the bend of the spine above the sacrum. There
was no projection of the coccyx.            His nates were small, as
were also the calves of his legs, which had however some
figure.    His mammae and umbilicus were distinct. The scro
tum was very small, being merely a little laxity of the skin at
this part.                                e
    The account which I have learned from Captain Blanchard
illustrates his habits and manners.
    He was put on board the Octavia, under the care of this
gentleman, and had a house fitted for him, and was provided
with poultry and rice sufficient for the voyage.       Captain Blan
chard first saw him at Mr. Forrestier’s house in Batavia.
    While sitting at breakfast, he heard some one enter a door
behind, and found a hand placed familiarly on his shoulder:
on turning round, he was not a little surprised to find a hairy
negro making such an unceremonious acquaintance.
    George, by which name he passed, seated himself at table
by direction of Mr. Forrestier, and after partaking of coffee,
&c. was dismissed.       He kept his house on ship-board clean,
and at of alltimes     good order;

    His mode of sitting was on an elevated seat, and not on the
floor.     He was free from some of the peculiar propensities of
monkeys. His bowels were in general regular.                       The direc
tions   given  by  Mr. Forrestier   were,    in case of     sickness,   to give
him castor oil.       It was administered to him once on the be
ginning of the passage, and produced full vomiting and free
catharsis with effectual relief.        He sickened a second time on
the latter part of the voyage, and resisted the attempts of the
captain and several strong men to get the oil into the stomach.
 He continued to fail gradually, losing his appetite and strength
until he died, much emaciated, soon after the ship anchored.
 Obstruction of the bowels was no doubt the source of his sick
 ness and cause of his death.          Captain Blanchard used to feel
 his pulse at the radial artery, and describes it to be like the
 human. It was probably quicker. His mode of walking was
 always erect, unless when tired; he would then move or rest
 on all fours”.

     the other viscera,         appeared exceedingly like the human.

     The gall-bladder was much longer and smaller round, and
    was found full          dark inspissated bile, which could with dif

                                          the human.       The kidneys did
   not present any difference, except that the renal capsules were
   larger. The bladder was small, containing when full, about
  two gills.        The urethra, prostate gland, vesiculae, &c. were
  situated like the human.            The prepuce, glans, &c. were like
  the human, but small.           The organs                   of

 lungs were not            distinctly divided into lobes; they were very
                               so
 sound and healthy             appearance. The heart was conical like

man's, and             every respect resembled the human.

                            the heart. The     right  subclavian,  right and
left carotid arteries, all arose from the arteria innominata;
the left subclavian rose separately, near the base                this. The            of
pericardium was connected extensively                       the diaphragm,

leading into the larynx and coming out at the base of this
cartilage. A valve played at the inferior opening, preventing
the passage of an instrument downward, but it passed easily
upwards into the pouch on the neck, which has been mentioned.
This pouch, the animal could inflate at pleasure; for what
               I
purpose do not know.         One use might be, when inflated, to
assist in supporting  him when swimming.
    The brain  weighed    nine ounces and three quarters. The
nerves arose from this in the same manner as the human, and
took their exit from the cranium in a similar way.     The po
sition of the brain differed by the anterior lobes being more
raised in consequence of the projecting plates of the orbits                                     in
ternally, and by the posterior lobes and cerebellum lying lower
than the human, according to the form of the base of the cra
nium. This organ was not dissected. The muscles and blood
vessels could not be so minutely examined, in consequence of
the warmth of the season, as to enable me to give a correct
account of them. The muscles were in general very distinct,
having their fasciculi of fibres remarkably strong. The blood
vessels were small.

    The nasal bones are wanting, giving him that flat or simous
 appearance, from which is derived the term simia, to distin
guish the ape species.
    The maxilla superior and inferior are very prominent, which
makes the facial angle more obtuse than the African.
    The frontis is somewhat high and projected.
    The inferior maxilla is closed at the mentum, which is a
little angular and projecting.
    The teeth consist in each jaw of two dentes incisivi; the
two middle of the upper jaw are very long and broad, mea
suring seven-eighths of an inch in length, and five-eighths in
breadth.     The two lateral have not yet fully grown; two cus
pidati, and four molar teeth; making in all, twenty-eight.
    The four incisores are new and permanent teeth; the cuspi
  º
dati had not been shed.
         first molar in each jaw was just giving place to thebi
cuspid.
    The last molar in each jaw are - permanent teeth, the others
were about being shed.
  I   should judge from the teeth, that this individual was about
five and a half years old.
    The spine consists of twenty-three vertebrae, viz. seven of
the neck, twelve of the back, and four of the loins.
    The neck is short, being but three and a quarter inches in
length. The vertebrae composing it are flatter before, and not
so round, having their spinous processes much longer and
rounder than in man.
    The first vertebra of the neck has no spinous process, being
in this respect unlike the human, which has a small one; but
anteriorly, it resembles man, and differs from the monkey, in
having an eminence rather than a fissure.
    The second vertebra has the processus dentatus long, and
partly cartilaginous; the transverse processes are so also.
    The vertebrae of the back are like those of man; they mea
sure eight inches and three quarters.
   The vertebrae of the loins are three inches in length. They
have their transverse and spinous processes short and thick,
like man's.                                -      -
   The ilea are    very flat, and are articulated to the sacrum
as in man.    The sacrum differs materially from the human,
being more flat and narrow; it consists of five bones, con
nected by cartilage. Indeed, the whole pelvis exhibits a more
striking difference from the human than any other part of the
skeleton.                                      -
   The ileum measures from the anterior    superior spinous pro
cess to itsjunction with the sacrum, three inches.

  The ilea, ischia, and pubes, are distinct bones, connected
by cartilage. The symphysis pubis is also cartilaginous.
  The lateral diameter of the pelvis is two and a half inches.
The longitudinal diameter is three and a quarter inches.
  The pelvis is so joined to the spine as to project backward,
and so flat, that a perpendicular line from the bodies of the
                                                                -
dorsal vertebrae falls upon the pubis.
    The coccyx is cartilaginous, and resembles the human; it
is not so long, and has no appearance of a tail.
    The ribs are twelve in number, articulated and curved as
much as the human, giving the animal a full chest.
    There were eight true ribs attached to the sternum by car
tilage, as in man, and four floating ribs.
    The sternum consists of four bones like man's, but more
cartilaginous; the ensiformis longer.
    The clavicle remarkably resembles the human; it is not
quite so much bent, and measures five and a half inches.
    The scapulae likewise resemble those of man; the base is
narrower and longer; the acromion and coracoid processes
are more cartilaginous than those of a child.
    The chest gives the animal the greatest resemblance to man;
the position of the shoulders, the articulations of the humerus,
clavicle, and scapula, the angle of the ribs, the prominent
thorax, the situation of the arms,                         all

    The articulation of the femur with the acetabulum is almost
exactly like man's; the neck of this bone forms about the same
angle.     In quadrupeds, this forms a distinguishing character
istic, being in them nearly a right angle; the inspection of this
joint is alone sufficient to satisfy the naturalist of at least the fa.
cility, if not the natural disposition of the Satyrus to walk erect.
    The femur is eight and a half inches in length and two
inches round; the trochanters and condyles are cartilaginous -
and prominent.
    The patella is one round piece like that of man; it is but
little ossified in this individual; the tendon connecting it to
 the tibia is strong. The knee joint has the semilunar carti
lages and is connected by the crucial and lateral ligaments as
in man. The tibia is seven and three quarters inches long,
 and two inches round at the upper part.
    The fibula is seven and a halfinches long, and an inch and
 a  quarter  round; the extremities of both bones of the leg are
 cartilaginous.
    The ankle joint is formed like man's.
                                                                        -
    The tarsus consists of seven bones like the human; these
 are mostly cartilaginous, and admit of free motion one upon
 another.
     The os calcis is broad, and sufficiently projects behind to
 support the erect posture. The metatarsus consists of four
 bones; for what answers to the great toe is a perfect thumb of
 two joints, but not on the range of the other toes; indeed the
 whole foot, except the os calcis, much more resembles a hand
 than a human foot, the phalanges being longer and consisting
  of bones similar to the hand.
    From the structure which has been thus cursorily described,
I  shall note those peculiarities which will enable us to form an
opinion of the natural mode of his walking.
    First. Going on      fours,all    he
                                  would find inconvenience from
the elbow   joint; for when the hand    placed upon the ground
                                             be is           qua
flat, the flexion    the joint would
                         of             contrary
                                                                  of of
                                                     that  to
drupeds,        by
               bending back towards the body instead           for
wards, which would rather impede, than assist progression.
It  isnot however       difficult for the Satyrus
                              as                    turn the joint
                                                          to
forwards,        would be for man, on account
                asit                                      of
                                                     the curvature
 of the bones of the fore arm, and the free motion which ex
isted    all the joints.

back, would make         difficult for him    bear weight upon his
                                                     to
hands; quadrupeds have the chest flat and the scapulac far
forward upon the ribs.

   The articulation of the hip would make it more easy for hin
to go erect, on account of the little angle made by the neck
with the body of the femur.
                                                         -
   Secondly.   In walking erect, he would derive advantage
from the extension of the os calcis and the length of the foot;
and also from the position of the arms so far back, and from
their length, which would enable him to balance the -
                                                       body by
them.
   Thirdly. From the structure of the viscera he seems to be
peculiarly formed for an erect posture.
   The pericardium being united extensively with the dia
phragm, would prevent it from being drawn down by the weight
of the liver and abdominal viscera. In quadrupeds this is not
necessary, for the pressure of the abdominal contents assists
expiration, and if the pericardium was attached to the dia
phragm as in the Satyrus and in man, inspiration would be
impeded.
   The exit of the spermatic cord is another difference from
quadrupeds.     It does not pass out directly from the abdomen,
as in the dog, but perforates the peritoneum and muscles
obliquely, as has been described, thereby giving that admira
ble structure to fortify the groin from rupture, which exists
in Inan.
  The viscera of the abdomen were suspended to bear weight
in the erect posture, particularly the liver, which had           its   liga
ments very strong.
  From these and other circumstances, apparent from                an    ex
amination         of
              the skeleton,  think we must conclude the erect

XXVIII.           Description of a nondescript Species of the Genus
                 Condylura.   By T. W. HARRIs, M.D.”
THE   genus Condylura was constructed by Illiger for the
  reception of the Sorea cristatus of Linnaeus, the Radiated
Mole of Pennant.
     This  name, derived from xovºvX0; a knot, and oven the tail,
 is essentially  bad, as it is founded on an exaggerated or cari
 catured    representation   of the tail of the animal, and on a
 structure which does not exist, in the slightest degree, in the
-species to be here described.        Desmarest, who has amended
 the characters of the     genus,    did not think it expedient to
 change the name, and thus embarrass nomenclature with a
 new synonym.
    Cuvier, in the Regne Animal, has suppressed the genus Con
 dylura, being confident, he says, from an inspection of the
 teeth, that the radiated mole is a Talpa and not a Sorer. Des
 marestt thinks that Cuvier must have examined, by mistake,
 the denuded head of a true Talpa, instead of that of the Con
 dylura.     He observes that a specimen of this animal, sent by
 Le Seuer from Philadelphia, presents characters peculiar to
 itself; that it cannot be united either with the Talpa or Sorices,
 but holds an intermediate rank between these two tribes or
 families. In           its
                     form and habits      has      affinity

 chias, in the state of Maine, which exbibits the characteristics
 of the genus Condylura, but which is evidently distinct from
 C. cristata, the type of that genus.     These animals both have
 in the  upper   jaw  six incisors implanted    in the praemaxillary
 bone, the two intermediate ones large, their cutting edge oblique;
 the adjoining incisors resembling long canine                 slightly
 triangular at the base, where are situated two minute tubercles;
each external incisor isolated, very small, conic, and pointing
 backwards.       Seven molares on each side; the three first re
 sembling canine teeth, and may be considered as false molares;
 they are smaller than the true molares, are isolated with two
minute lobes at the base. The four posterior molares large,
 formed of two layers of enamel, furrowed externally, and
tuberculated within.
    The palate has seven transverse ridges between the incisors
 and the first two molares.
    Lower jaw with four flattened and projecting incisors; five
false molares, separated from each other, the first the largest,

produced by volcanic power, into which the chloride of so
 dium has entered by sublimation.          L. de Buch proves this in
 a highly   convincing  manner. Guided by that fact, and sup
ported by other grounds, he further supposes that the rock
 salt formations in the floetz strata very probably have also a
 volcanic origin.                    -
     futi  had already ventured to propose the same theory of
rock-salt formations before the vein at Bex was known.                The
                          I
merit of this must indeed acknowledge is not great: having
the advantage of L. de Buch's work, it was easy for me to ad
vance one step further than he had gone; or perhaps, I only
expressed more definitely what L. de B. had long conceived,
and was a simple consequence of his comprehensive observa
tions. But since my theory has the concurrence of so valuable
                              º
an experience as that of M. de Charpentier, it will not be wholly
uninteresting to make my early expositions better known.

brought up from the eastward (part of it being a tunnel), and
thus laid the bog dry. This measure was attended with a
two-fold benefit to the tenantry, the provision of a valuable
combustible, and the discovery of an excellent manure in the
form of white marl beneath the peat.                 The latter extends
from a few feet to twenty feet in depth; and the subjacent
marl from one to three, four, and five feet in thickness. The
marl when fresh dug has partly a grayish tinge, but on losing
its moisture it becomes white.             -
   In  cutting down the     peat    to the bed of marl, the remains
of the   gigantic   elk have     frequently     been met with ; and                                in
variably, as           I
                am assured       by  the concurrent testimony of the
tenantry, placed between the peat and the marl; or merely
impressed in the latter.       It is stated that at least a dozen heads
with the branches, accompanied by other remains, have thus
been found from time to time: but being unfortunately deemed
of no value by the country-people, they have for the most part
been scattered and destroyed.             It is to be hoped, however,
that a sufficient inducement will lead them to bestow greater
care on the preservation of whatever remains may be hereafter
discovered.
   The marl, upon examination, appears in a great measure
composed of an earthy calcareous base, containing commi
nuted portions of shells; and that these are                 derived fromall
fresh-water species,        proved

XXXI.      On the Ebullition of Water at Specific Temperatures,
   as the Measure of Altitude.         By JoHN MURRAY, F.S.A.

ITofistheknown     that water boils in

                                         temperature, and that this
point and period of ebullition has some ratio comparatively
with the density of the incumbent air. Theodore de Saussure
found that water boiled on the summit of Mont Blanc at 187°
Fahr. It was Fahrenheit that first proposed this application
of the thermometric expression of boiling water as a measure
of altitude. In the Philosophical Transactions for 1817, the
Rev. Francis Wollaston has described an instrument for this
purpose, most ingeniously constructed, and no doubt accurate
enough for minor elevations.                                    -
   During last summer, on my excursion in Switzerland, Italy,
      I
&c., made several experiments on the ebullition of water at
different elevations. A few of these        I  beg leave to submit to
you. The thermometer was graduated by a diamond on the
stem; the bulb was small, and the divisions only indicated
the entire degree of Fahrenheit's scale.

tire provision of apparatus constructed by this philosopher,)
ruder apparatus subserving my purpose,_that a distant ap
proximation to the altitude, as indicated by the barometer at
three elevations, is only insured.
   In consequence of the capricious results indicated by my
experiments on the ebullition of water at the village of Sim
poln on the Simplon,      Imade a series of experiments with the

Trials, opposite De Witt's land, by 20° of south latitude and
 100° west longitude; M. Duperrey, who would have attached
a great value to the determination of their position, was not
able to find them.
    The archipelago of the Carolines was repeatedly sailed
through and minutely examined. M. Duperrey shows satisfac
torily that Hope island, Teyoa island, the groups of Satahual
and Lamurek, do not exist in the positions which are assigned
to them. Perhaps it may be sometimes difficult for him exactly
to apply these old names to the islands whose place he has
fixed.   Moreover, the inconvenience is not serious; all was so
inexact in the charts of this archipelago, that the labours of
the Coquille are equivalent to a first discovery.
                  Astronomical Observations.
     In a   voyage     like that of the Coquille, in which the periods
of lying-towere always necessarily very short, the astrono

 servations which there has not yet been time to discuss, belong
 to questions not less curious. It results, for example, from the
 operations of M. Freycinet, that there exists at the Isle of
 France a cause of local attraction so intense as to alter the
rate of a clock there 13 or 14 seconds a day. It may be con
ceived how interesting it becomes to investigate, in the obser
vations of M. Duperrey, if the accidental influence was also
manifest.—In a few days the results of this inquiry will be
presented to the Academy.

212                      Prof. Sedgwick on                some   Trap Dykes
newer strata, and distinctive characters have been pointed out
by which it has been attempted to separate the several forma
tions from each other. As observations have become more
widely extended, many of the conclusions founded on such
characters have proved to be fallacious; and it is now generally
admitted, that the mineralogical composition of any system of
trap rocks gives us little information respecting           antiquity            its                   or
probable associations. When strata rest conformably upon each
other,    in
          such    way    a            as   to
                             indicate continued succession a           de                         of
positions, we can immediately determine,              least, their rela    at
tive antiquity, and may often adopt some natural                artificial             or
arrangement which will greatly facilitate their description.
But formations, which appear          dykes and overlying masses,
                                                       as
afford no such facilities             .
                               correct classification; and the only
general conclusion which we can arrive            respecting them     at                               is,
that they are newer than the beds into which they have                                                 in
truded.           on this account that different observers have
                 It    is
formed   completely   different views respecting the classification
of certain formations      trap; each, of  ambiguous cases, having
                                                                in
adopted that opinion which happened              fall      with his fato        in
vourite theory.—In determining the origin             any one       these  of                of
formations,      seems essential
                      it             inquire, (1)     to  what manner           In
it   isassociated with other rocks.      (2) What minerals enter
into      its
           composition. (3) What effects are produced                                             by   its
presence.     Satisfactory answers      these questions have been

 bounds of the coal-fields, and traverse indifferently all the
 newer strata which cross their line of direction.            The facts
 presented by the north coast of Ireland afford several illustra
 tions of the truth of this assertion.
    Mr. Winch, in the fourth volume of the Geological Trans
actions, has given many interesting details respecting the dykes”
 which intersect the great coal basin of Northumberland and
Durham. They are in some instances filled with clay and
rounded pebbles or shattered fragments of sandstone, mixed
with other materials derived from the neighbouring rocks, and
their whole appearance plainly indicates the violent nature of
the forces by which the solid strata have been cleft asunder.
In other instances, the fissures are filled with a variety of ba
salt, which rises like a great partition wall through           the beds                        all
                                                                          iv.

opinion                 of
              Mr. Winch that these basaltic dykes never pass up
into the magnesian limestone which reposes immediately on
the coal strata.      Thus, for example, the cliff          Tynemouth                   of
castle     intersected
                   is           basaltic dykeby which does not pene

trate the capping                      of
                          magnesian limestone.
    Every one who          acquainted with the details
                                            is                   English                        of
geology must have remarked, that our newer strata, down                                                       to
the magnesian limestone inclusive, are generally unconform
able      all the older rocks. Thus
             to                                 numberless instances, in
more especially        the West    in England, we find someof        the                               of
newer strata filling up the inequalities,            resting on the        all                               in

   It  would certainly be very interesting to trace these dykes
as far as possible through the eastern moors, as there can be
little doubt of their connexion with some of those masses of
trap which traverse the great coal-field.       My own observa
tions were much too limited to   complete  this task.  I however
found on Woolly Hills, in the Woodland Fells, several quarries
opened in a dyke which, from           position     well                    its                      as             as   in       its

fore we admit the identity of the Cockfield Fell and Cleveland

Houghton-le-side and Coatham Stob, it is concealed by a thick
covering of diluvium: an opinion which no one will have much

it continues to thin off; but it may be traced, though not with
out some difficulty, as fari as a small rivulet about two miles

has perhaps not been ascertained; but there does not seem to
be any good reason for supposing that it is continued to the

the cliff where it might be expected to appear.

1. Singular Modification              of Temperature          by Copper and            Silver
          -                                 Leaf.                       -
     When we grasp in the hand a few foils of copper or silver
leaf, a peculiar glow of temperature is communicated and felt.
I found that a delicate thermometer placed in the hollow of
the hand, the ball completely enveloped, indicated 98° 5' F.;
with the ball wrapped round with loose copper leaf, the tem
perature shown was 101° F.; with silver leaf, 101°-H F.; with
mixed silver and copper foil, 99° 75'.          -
                2. Aphlogistic Phaenomena of Gum.
     Ifa portion  of powdered gum arabic be placed on a disc of
platinum and burnt to charcoal, it will, when ignited, continue
long to glow in that state: let fall on paper it ignites the
paper; and placed on the platinum wire of the “lamp with
out flame” it continues aphlogistic with the coils, and it will
ignite a sulphur match, &c.
   The platinum cage supplied with these aphlogistic live coals
produces a fine effect; and when even the platinum has become
extinct, they will continue to glow and give light, and the
reignition of the wick is more certainly secured.
   When the aphlogistic gum is introduced into a glass cylinder
containing a portion of ether, it will glow in the superior part
of the vessel; when immersed too low and brought near the
surface of the ether, it will be apparently extinguished; but
when raised to             its
                      former position         will    it           be
                                                        rekindled, and
continue       glow with additional brightness. There

3.   Liquid Aqueous Ammonia, burning with Flame                              in   Chlorine.
    It    is   well known that      if     two cylinders, the one containing
                                                                    chlorine

 ehlorine and the other ammoniacal gas, be brought in con
 tact, a flash of light pervades the interior. Professor Silliman
 has also stated that a large volume of ammoniacal gas may be
ignited and continue to burn; and Dr. Henry has adverted to
 a phaenomenon of the same description : indeed, the foreign
flame exhibited when a lighted taper is introduced into a small
cylinder of this gas, sufficiently proves that the gas is inflam
 mable in atmospheric air. I find, however, that if a slip of
paper be dipped in strong liquid ammonia, and immersed into
a cylinder of newly prepared chlorine, it will burn with a beau
 tiful flame, and the liquid ammonia will also burn with flame
when introduced in the deflagrating spoon.
                            FOSSIL REMAINS.
    Notwithstanding the confused and unscientific manner in
which this account is drawn up, we think there is reason to
 believe that some interesting fossil remains have been found;
and not wishing to assume any responsibility for the correct
ness   of the notice, we give it as originally published. It is to
be   hoped   that a more satisfactory description of these remains
will soon be received.
    Our enterprising fellow-citizen, Mr. Samuel Schofield, has
disinterred from the low prairie grounds between Placquemine
and the lakes, a number of remains of the most gigantic size.
 They evidently belong to some class of animals now no longer
in existence; whether antediluvian or not, we are unable to
say. The great Elephas mastodon, or American Mammoth,
described by Dr. Mitchill, is inferior in size to these bones we
have seen.       From the circumstance of ambergris being col
lected in some quantity from the inferior surface of the maxil
 lary bone, we are led to the conclusion that they are of marine
origin, but of what description we are unable to conjecture.
 Upon examining these remains, we are easily led to give cre
dit to the extraordinary relations given by Father Kircher, of
the Kraken and Norway sea snake.             This nondescript, when
alive, must have equalled either of them in bulk.                   -
    We will    attempt   a faint description of those which have al
 ready been brought up to this city, and are now on board the
steam-boat, Expedition.          They consist, first, of an enormous
 fragment of a cranium.        It is about twenty-two feet in length,
and its broadest      part  four feet high, and perhaps nine inches
 thick.    It is said to weigh   about twelve hundred pounds. On
the interior surface the vitreous table appears to be separated
from the cancelli for some way down; this table- is perfectly

 perfect.
   The foramina for the passage of the sensorial nerves are
very discernible.    A very large portion of the inner table of
the inside of the cranium is joined by a very singular squamous
suture. The inner surface appears in many places perma
mently discoloured by the bed of earth from whence it was
taken. In the interior part of the cranium the diploë presents
a very singular appearance, the cavities of which are very
large, in some cases presenting holes of nearly an inch in dia
meter, and generally very regular. Upon what we judge to
be the temporal portion, a most singular process or elongation
presents itself: it is eight feet in length, and of a triangular
form, and about six inches through, tapering gradually to the
point.   This singular appearance sets         our conjectures          all
defiance;           it        of

are also gone.    It is of a firmer consistence than any of the
other bones, with a singular irradiation of ossific appearance
on the outside surface.      These two - bones are probably the
leg of the animal.
   There are also lumbar, dorsal, and cervical vertebrae. The
cylindrical portions of those of the first class are fourteen
inches in diameter, with transverse processes, in every respect
like those of quadrupeds. One of them has the introvertebral
substance completely detached; it is about twelve inches in
diameter, and perhaps two inches thick in the centre, tapering
gradually to the extremities; this specimen is in a perfect state
of preservation. In the articulation of these bones there is

   Tojudge from the appearance of this portion of the cranium
which we have seen, if this monster was of the Balaena species,
his length could not be less than two hundred and fifty feet.
It is stated, that from this place, whence these remains were
disinterred, a large carnivorous tooth was found, and has been
carried away.     It is also related, that in the year 1799, many
remains of antediluvian creation were taken up near this same
place, and shipped to Europe.—Boston Journal of Philosophy,

                         VOLCANO IN OWHYHEE.
   Mr. William Ellis, a missionary, in his narrative of a tour
through the island so well known as the place where Captain
Cook was murdered, gives the description of a volcano of a
singular kind, of which we shall select for our readers some of
the most striking particulars.     Mr. Ellis passed over a large
tract of volcanic  country with burning   chasms and hills, which
had the appearance of having been craters. The plain over
which their way lay, was a vast waste of ancient lava, which
he thus describes:
   “This tract of lava resembled in appearance an inland sea,
bounded by distant mountains. Once it had certainly been in
a fluid state, but appeared as if it had become suddenly petri
fied, or turned into a glassy stone, while      its
                                                  agitated billows
were rolling      and fro. Not only were the large swells and
                    to
hollows distinctly marked, but        inmany places the surface   of
these billows was covered       bya smaller ripple, like that ob

   N. B. The barometer is hung up in the observatory 50 feet
above the low-water mark of Portsmouth Harbour; and the
self-registering horizontal day and night thermometer, and De
Luc's whalebone hygrometer, are placed in open-worked cases,
in a northern aspect, out of the rays of the sun, 10 feet above
the garden ground.       The pluviameter and evaporator have re
spectively the same square area: the former is emptied every
morning at 8 o'clock, after rain, into a cylindrical glass gauge
accurately graduated to 1-100th of an inch; and the quantity
lost by evaporation from the latter, is ascertained at least
every third day, and sometimes oftener, when great evapora
tions happen by means of a high temperature, and dry northerly
                           -
or easterly winds.
   BAROMETRICAL PREssurE.—Hin consequence of the high
pressure of the atmosphere during the first three months, also
in June and July, the mean height of the barometer is greater
this year by 79-1000th of an inch, than the mean of the last
eleven years.     This was the case in every part of the country
with some little differences.      The aggregate of the spaces de
scribed   by  the alternate  rising   and falling of the mercury is
15-89 inches less this  year  than  last,  and the number of changes
seven less, which indicate a     comparatively    uniform pressure.
    For 177 days in which the moon ranged in North declina
tion, the pressure was 3-200ths of an inch greater than that
in the 177 days in which she ranged in south declination.
   TEMPERATURE.-The annual mean temperature of the ex
ternal air is exactly one degree higher than that in 1824, and
1:39 degree higher than the mean of the last ten years. The
mean temperature of June, July, August and September was
high, and these months were dry, particularly July, when we
experienced oppressive heat for several days: but the spring
and autumn were rather cold, which in great measure equa
lized the annual average temperature of 1824 and 1825.
   The annual mean temperature of spring water at 8 o'clock
A.M. this year, is nearly a degree and a half lower than the
annual mean temperature of the external air.
   WIND.—The crossing and opposite winds, or upper cur
rents, have been found
                    -     to
                          -    prevail very much this year.

        Meteorological Summary                  for 1825.-Hampshire.                            237
     In comparing the Scale of the Winds in                                 1824 and 1825,
there appears    a near coincidence in their duration from six
out   of eight points of the compass; but there is  a great dif
ference in the North-east and South-west winds this year; the
former having prevailed longer by nearly one-third, and the
latter a less time by nearly one-fifth. The longer duration of
the North-east wind, with the additional mean temperature of
the atmosphere, seems to accord with the increased evapora
tion, which is nearly one-third more this year than last; and
the shorter duration of the South-west wind, was the means
of keeping back about one-fourth of the comparative depth of
rain: besides, the gales from the South-west have not been so
prevalent as they were last year. Such is the influence the winds
appear to have in drying and condensing the lower stratum of
air, in connexion with the temperature of the ground.
   The following is the number of strong gales of wind,
                                                     -    or days

238    Meteorological Summary for Feb. 1826.-Hampshire.
January, March, June, October, and November, were rather
windy months, the others comparatively calm.
   The spring and summer seasons were healthy, but the win
ter, and autumn were sickly, in consequence of the sudden
changes that occurred in the temperature and quality of the
air; as it must be acknowledged that health, or sickness, and
also the spirits of the human mind, are materially influenced
by the good or bad state of the air we inhale, and the means
employed to keep the body of an uniform temperature through
out the vicissitudes of the seasons in the variable climate of
England and her united kingdoms.

     This month  has been mild for the season, but generally
windy and wet, agreeing with the old proverb “February fill
dike.”   It has rained, more or less, on 20 days, and the ther-                       .
mometer a few feet from the ground did not recede once to
the freezing point.   In consequence of the constant humid air,
very little evaporation, and the quantity of rain, the ground
was saturated nearly the whole month, and is now in good
condition for an early produce of the approaching spring.

these two quantities approach nearer                     equality      the  to      an                       as

250              Prof. Sedgwick        on some            Trap Dykes
computation falls below the truth; in consequence of the pro
bable extension of the dyke to the N.W. through the Wood
land Fells and Egglestone Burn to the banks of the Tees.
Should this supposition be admitted, we shall have an unin
terrupted dyke extending from High Teesdale to the confines
of the eastern coast, a distance of more than sixty miles.
   The angle at which it cuts the strata is of course variable,
and in many places cannot possibly be ascertained.    At Bar
wick, near the Tees, its inclination to the horizontal beds of
sandstone is more than eighty degrees; and the angle at which
it intersects the beds of shale and sandstone in the eastern
moors is still, greater; occasioned, perhaps, by the south
eastern dip, which generally prevails among the strata in that
region *.
     econdary formations, when interrupted in the manner
above described, seldom preserve the same level on the oppo
site sides of their line of separation. Thus at Cockfield Fell,
the coal-beds on the north side of the dyke are eighteen feet
below the corresponding beds on the south side.          the ex
cavations at Preston and Barwick there is no indication of
                                                                               º
any great change having been produced in the relative level
of the beds of sandstone; nor can any conclusive evidence be
obtained on this subject from the obscure sections exhibited
by the quarries in the eastern moorlands.         Perhaps, as a
#.        rule, the greatest dislocations are produced by those
  ssures into which trap is not intruded: such at least appears
to be the case in the great coal-field of Northumberland and
Durham. The injected masses of trap may be supposed to
have acted as a kind of support, and to have partially hindered
the broken ends of the strata from sliding past each other.

 mistake not, pyroxene and felspar, in which respect it agrees
  with the greater number of trap dykes which have been care
 fully examined, as well as with a great many varieties of re
 cent lava.      The principal modifications, of course, arise from
 the variable proportions of these essential ingredients. Among
 the prevailing and nearly compact portions of the dyke, there
 are some larger crystals offelspar and carbonate of lime; very
 rarely, however, in such abundance or order of arrangement,
 as to give any decided appearance of porphyritic structure.
 Good specimens of amygdaloid are not common; where they
 do occur, the nodules are chiefly composed of carbonate of
 lime.    In one or two instances we found chalcedony filling the
hollows of an imperfect amygdaloid.              Iron pyrites may be

dyké. It is found disseminated through the substance of some
decomposing varieties in considerable abundance; and small
spangles of it may occasionally be seen in the sound
especially among the larger crystals of felspar before men
tioned. All the dark sonorous specimens act strongly on the
magnet; but some of the light-coloured varieties, which con
tain a great excess of decomposing felspar, do not sensibly
 affect it.
    The dyke is generally separated by a number of natural
partings into large blocks, which are amorphous, prismatic, or
globular.       Near the centre they are sometimes of such entire
irregularity as to defy             all

of impure coal or   carbonaceous shale, in the upper part of
which are found  shapeless masses in various states of indura
tion, mixed irregularly with angular pieces of trap, and an
earthy substance like soot or pounded charcoal. Where the
carbonaceous ingredients are most abundant, the parts of the
bed in immediate contact assume the appearance of coke de
rived from the artificial distillation of impure coal, and not
unfrequently separate into a number of minute prisms”.      An
impure carbonaceous powder is sometimes found in the crevices
between the basaltic columns, several feet above the beds on
which they rest.
   In addition to the substances above described, found be               I
neath the trap some thin white porcellanous fragments, which
appeared to be derived from an indurated bed of fire-clay—a
well-known associate of the great coal formation.

language which may be thought hypothetical by those who
deny the igneous origin of trap dykes.
   In Cockfield Fell the coal-works have been conducted on
both sides of the dyke, and the extraordinary changes pro
duced by      influence have been recorded by practical men

class of trap dykes seems to be established by evidence which
is almost irresistible.
   It is urged to no purpose, that Lydian stone and glance
coal occur in places which have never been influenced by vol
canic action. The assertion may be true, but is of no value
in determining the question; unless it can be shown, that sub
stances, similar to those derived from the sides of the dykes,
are found in other parts of the same district which are removed
from their influence. This, however, is not the case; for the
enormous excavations which have been carried on in the great
coal-basin of Northumberland and Durham have, with one
ambiguous exception*, made us acquainted with no similar
substances excepting those which appear to have been pro
duced by similar agents.

      The dyke appears to decrease in width as it rises to
       5.
 wards the surface.  Thus, in Crowtrees colliery, the width of
 the dyke, where it is cut through at the depth of fifteen fa
 thoms, is nearly twice as great as at the surface.
     6. It does not appear at Quarrington Hill to cut through
 a bed of sand and pebbles, which lies between the highest beds
 of the coal-formation and the magnesian limestone.
     The importance of these facts in confirming the theoretical
 views given in the preceding paper, is too obvious to need any
  explanation.
     Mr. Winch asserts (Geological Transactions, vol.                p.25),                   iv.
 “   that        he
               has never been able          trace   any   to these basaltic        of

 in   support      this opinion.

            to       that the Cockfield Fell dyke cannot pass out
 of the limits of the coal-formation.
   If   we adopt this latter opinion, we must admit that the dykes
 of   Cockfield Fell and Cleveland (notwithstanding the agree

nor am I aware that any method has been pointed out for the
determining u, in functions of z from such laws.          shall now      I

the general terms of such series, and of integrating the equa
tions to which they lead.      I shall not, however, commence
with the  general investigation  of the subject, but shall simply
point out the paths through which I was led to their solution,
conceiving this course to É. much more conducive to the pro
gress of analysis, although not so much in unison with the
taste which at present prevails in that science.

value of u, at the commencement of the series, and also that
whenever the same digit again occurs, there will, at that point,
commence a repetition of the same figures which have pre
ceded; consequently, the first difference at those two points
will be equal.

solely on that of the one which occupied the same place in the

appear in the course of ten terms at the utmost, since there

difference is equal to any multiple of the digits found in the

   The preceding figure      represents a balance employed in this
process.    It is in two   respects more convenient than a com
mon balance.       The moveable weight on one of the arms, ren
ders it easier to counterpoise bodies of various weights; and
the adjustment of the index (I) by the screw (S) to the beam,
saves the necessity of adjusting the beam to the index; the
accurate accomplishment of which, by varying the weights, is
usually a chief part of the trouble of weighing.
   One of the buckets, suspended from the beam, is five times
as far from the fulcrum as the other.
   A chyometer is employed in this process, of which the fol_
lowing figure will convey a correct idea.         B
   The rod of this instrument is not graduated, but is provided
with a band (B) which can be slipped along the rod, and fast

this further from or nearer to the fulcrum, so that the index
point (I) may be exactly opposite the point of the beam. Place
under the mineral a vessel of water, and add as much of this
fluid to the bucket, by means of the chyometer, as will cause
the immersion of the mineral. The band (B) which is made
to slip upon the rod, should be so fastened, by means of the
screw, as to mark the distance which the rod has entered, in
expelling the water, requisite to sink the mineral.           Having
removed the vessel of water and the mineral, ascertain how
many times the same quantity of water, which caused the im
mersion of the mineral, must be employed to compensate                                              its

sary to have recourse to water, excepting in the first adjust
ment of the scale.             The number of parts required to merge
the bulb in any fluid, will reach (at once or twice) the number

necessary to employ a smaller rod or a larger bulb.                       Instead
of effecting an immersion by one stroke of the rod, it may be
done by ten strokes, which will make each division of the sec

  ASthe
     several very interesting external characters peculiar to
        Condylura cristata have been entirely overlooked by
  those who have heretofore written on this subject, the object
  of this Note is to supply the deficiency as far as possible, es
 pecially as these characters may bevery serviceable in enabling
  us to compare the present genus with some others.

radial edge, it has one scale of considerable size on the pha
lanx, and four or five between this part and the carpus; the
two nearest the scale on the phalanx are largest.
    The surface of the palm of the hand is covered with small
circular scales, extending most numerously, and of a darker
colour, from opposite the root of the thumb obliquely outward                                          .

    On the inferior extremities, the whole of the superior sur
                                                                                  ji:
face of the foot is covered with minute, blackish, circular
scales, which increase slightly in size as they approach the
toes.    On the anterior part of the fourth toe is a large central
row of black scales, and on the fifth a rather                      one;
hence these toes have a      very  considerable resemblance to the
toes of a bird.     The other toes of the hind foot being applied
with their anterior surfaces to the ground, have the scales very
minute and almost colourless.
    The colour of the scales varies on different parts of the
hand. On so much of the back of the hand as is formed by
the fourth and little fingers, the scales are very dark blue,
approaching a black, in the living animal; thence to the large
scales of the thumb the colour changes to a faint purplish
blue, which is little more than distinguishable.
    Two other excellent characters belonging to the palm of the
hand have been neglected: the first is the enlargement of the
carpal edge of the palm by an elongation of the integuments;
this, in addition to the row of bristles that margins           the rest           all
of  the palm, has two distinct bristly hairs              superior and at   its
                                              it of

fourth toes.
   A very analogous arrangement may be observed in the sole
of the feet of the Sigmodon hispidum of Ord.
   By comparing the Condylura with the Scalops, we are led
to séveral interesting observations. We have seen that the
Condylura has a remarkable and large external ear, though it
is destitute of a projecting auricle.     The Scalops has neither
auricle nor meatus externus opening on the side of the head,
as the skin of the head extends over the cartilaginous tube,
which is small, and a simple funnel. The situation of the ear
is to be discovered externally only by a very small spot, not
larger than the circumference of an ordinary pin head.
    The hand of the Scalops is peculiar for             great breadth       its
and strength: the extraordinary breadth              produced          is                           by   an
additional metacarpal bone, inferior         external      the thumb,
                                                             or                   to

caudata is that given by Pennant, who describes it without
reference to the nasal rays.      It is on this indication that
Gmelin, Illiger, and Desmarest have allowed of the species,
the latter author with very strong doubts, which Ranzani re
peats.

   The Condylura cristata is subject at certain seasons to a
very, remarkable enlargement of the tail, varying from the
smallest or most ordinary size to the thickness of the little
finger. This circumstance was long since made known to
many of his friends by Mr. Titian Peale, who found one of
                                                I
the largest size: since then have found one, and examined
several others, and both Messrs. Say and Bonaparte confirm
this observation by other examinations: all the specimens yet
examined having the tail thus enlarged, were males ; and it is
most probable that the enlargement occurs only during the
rutting season.    Messrs. Say and Peale both suggested to me
a long time since, that the differences heretofore serving for
the establishment of the longicaudata as a distinct species,
were merely sexual. In                        all
                              other respects the species    Con                         of

In the recent English translation of Baron Cuvier's Régne

more incorrect and unnatural than it is in the original.
    Note.—In my Note on the genus Condylura recently pub
lished, it is stated that the Scalops has the integuments con
tinued over the cartilaginous tube leading to the internal ear.
I  lately had an opportunity of examining several fine speci
mens, and have found the very small meatus auditorius ex
ternus, which will admit a body of the size of a common pin.
It is by no means easily discovered, and is situated about
three-fourths of an inch behind the eye, nearly over the ante
rior part of the shoulder joint.

                                                    Magnetism.
 THE   phaenomena of terrestrial magnetism, in spite of more
   than a century of researches, are still enveloped in great
 obscurity.    M. Duperrey was occupied upon them, during
 the whole of his voyage, with the most persevering attention,
 both when at sea and when in various ports.                journals                    #.
 contain a multitude of observations of   declination,  inclination,
 intensity, and diurnal variations of the declination, made ac
 cording to the best methods. The Commission is of opinion
 that by here presenting a rapid sketch of the advancement
 which science may expect from this great work, it will fulfill
 the intentions of the Academy.
    There exists, as is well known, on the globe, a curve along
which the magnetic needlemaintains a horizontal position. This
curve, which has received the name of the magnetic equator,
has been lately the object of the investigations of MM. Hans
teen and Morlet.        Although these two philosophers have
used the same    data, yet  on some points they have arrived at
results slightly different. In the chart of the learned Norwe
gian, as well as in that of our countryman, the magnetic equa
tor     is,
       entirely,    the south    the terrestrial equator, between
                                to                       of
Africa and America. The         greatest  distance       these two                     of

   In the charts of MM. Hansteen and Morlet, the latitudes
are about one degree less. , Here the difference is in a con
trary direction to that which we found in the Atlantic Ocean:
towards the coasts of Peru, the magnetic equator seems then
to have become more distant from the terrestrial equator.
   Let us, lastly, proceed to the two points determined directly
during the circumnavigation of the Coquille, in the northern
part of the line of no dip. M. Duperrey has found for their
co-ordinates:
          Long. 170° 37' 24" E.                               Lat. O9 53' N.

    These latitudes are less on the charts which represent the
equator of 1780.       In the part of the equinoctial ocean corre
sponding to the Carolines and to the Mulgrave Islands, the
line of no dip seems now, notwithstanding, to remove from the

west as far as the Atlantic Ocean. The observation of which
we have been speaking was made at the Portuguese island of
St. Thomas.     Captain Sabine found indeed, in 1822, for the
value of the dip, 0° 4' S.         The magnetic equator then
actually passes by this island, the latitude of which is 24' N.,
or some minutes only more to the west. Its point of inter
section with the terrestrial equator is about 5° of east longi
tude, whilst, according to the observations of 1780, MM.
Morlet and Hansteen             ñº.
                              placed it at least 13° more to the
eaSt.
    According to these several approximations, the existence of a
 translatory movement in the magnetic equator is very probable.
  M. Morlet had already pointed it out, but with the proper doubt
 which measures of the dip obtained without change of the
 poles of the needle justly excited in his mind.           In this re
 spect we can now obtain complete certainty in investigating
 under the same point of view the whole of the observations on
the dip made in the open sea in the equinoctial regions. The
journals kept on board the Uranie and the Coquille include
all the elements of these researches, in our opinion one of the
most important that can now be undertaken on the phaeno
mena of terrestrial magnetism. It would appear, in short,
that it is the form and position of the line of no dip, which
determines from one pole to the other, in what direction, in
every place, the annual variations of the magnetic needle shall
manifest themselves.        This conjecture, inasmuch as there is
question of change of inclination, is to be found in the inter
esting memoir of M. Morlet, which the Academy some years
ago honoured with         its

the contrary, the second, which it will even reach in a few

increase there; and this is what the observations of Cook, of

286             Report   of the   Voyage   of   Discovery
tor; at the Isle of France, at St. Helena, at Ascension, be
tween the tropics; our navigators had the incredible patience
to observe the thermometer and the barometer at every quarter
of an hour, day and night, for whole weeks. So much pains,
will not be lost; observations so minutely exact, so detailed
will furnish valuable data on the law which connects cor
 responding atmospheric temperatures with the different hours
of the day; on the value of the diurnal and nocturnal baro
metric period; on the hours of the marima and the mi
mima, &c. Thanks to the extreme complaisance of M. Del
cros, (a very distinguished geographical engineer,) in going at
the request of one of us, to Toulon,-in order to compare the
instruments of the Coquille with a barometer which belongs
to him, and which has agreed for several years with that of the
Observatory,    we shall be able to decide that which indeed
is scarcely any longer a question, since the observations of
MM. Boussingault and Riviero have been received in Europe,
whether the mean pressure of the atmosphere
                                        -      be the same in
all climates.                                                    -
     Since the celebrated voyages of Cook, no one any longer
  doubts that the southern hemisphere is in mass decidedly
  colder than the northern ;—but at what distance from the
 equinoctial regions does the difference begin to be felt?                Ac
 cording to what law does it become greater in proportion as
 the latitude augments? When these questions shall have been
 completely resolved, the various causes to which this great
 phaenomenon has been attributed may be submitted to an ex
 act investigation. Already the stay of M. Duperrey at the
 Malouines, will show that by 51% of latitude, the difference
of climate is very great. We see, in effect, that at the anchor
age of the Baie Française, from the 19th to the 30th of No
vember 1822, the mean temperatures of the atmosphere and
of  the sea were respectively:
 -
                   + 8° 0 and + 8° 2 Cent.
The month following, from the 1st to the 18th, we found:
                   + 10° 0 and + 9° 4.         -
We can then adopt + 9° 0 Cent, for the mean temperature
of the Malouines, in the thirty days which precede the sum
mer solstice of these regions.     London is precisely under
the latitude of Baie Française. Then the mean tempera
ture of the twelve last days of May, and of the eighteen
first days of June, according to the tables published by the
Royal Society, is about 15° Cent. : that         is,   6°
                                               more than      the    at
Malouines.                                                  -

rents merits    in the highest  degree the attention     naviga

celerate the progress of this important branch of the nau

and which consists in comparing latitudes and longitudes as
tronomically determined, with the corresponding latitudes and
longitudes deduced from the observation of the compass and
the log.

       waters of a certain region, when they are transported
by a current into a region more or less approaching to the
equator, lose in the passage only a part of their former tem
perature.        ocean is thus furrowed by a great number of
                        The
streams of warm and cold water, whose existence the thermo
meter manifests, and points out in a certain degree their direc
tion.    Every one knows the researches of Franklin, of Blag
den, of Williams, and of Humboldt, on the equinoctial current,
which, after being turned back in the Gulf of Mexico, after
having issued out through the strait of Bahama, moves from
the south to the north, at a certain distance from the eastern
coast of America, and proceeds, under the name of the Gulf
Stream, to temper the climate of Ireland, of the Shetland
Isles, and of Norway. At the other extremity of this vast con
tinent, along the coasts of Chili and of Peru, a rapid current
from south to north carries on the other hand as far as Callao
the cold waters of Cape Horn and of the Straits of Magellan.
The anomalous temperature of the ocean, in the port of Lima,
was remarked as far back as the sixteenth century.             Acosta,

average     of ten days observations give very nearly the same
dº   he consideration of the absolute temperatures would fur
nish a proof not less certain of the existence of this current of
cold water. At the port of Callao, from the 26th of February
to the 4th of March, the mean temperatures of the air and of
the sea were respectively 21° 3 and 19° 1 Cent. At sea,
at 800 leagues from the coasts, under the same latitude,
as also under a higher latitude, they found, from the 7th to
the 10th of April, 25°.9 and 25°-6. At Payta, from the 10th
to the 22d of March, the mean temperatures of the air and
water which we deduce from the journals of the Coquille are
25° 1 and 20°-0.     Here the current no longer exercises, as it
appears, a very great influence on the temperature of the at
mosphere near the coast; but it is still 6 or 7 degrees colder
than the ocean at a similar latitude in       other parts     all

   April 4.—The following papers were read:—On dichoto
mous and quinary arrangements in Natural History; by Hen.
Thos. Colebrooke, Esq. F.R.S. F.L.S. &c.
   The learned author states that what has been called the
dichotomous arrangement of nature can only be represented
on a superficies: whereas the affinities of natural objects ramify
in every direction, and cannot therefore be correctly repre
sented on a plane surface.    He then shows that that distribu
tion which, taking one central or interior group, makes only
a few equidistant exterior ones, is necessarily quinary.      The
centres of the exterior groups will represent the solid angles
 of a tetrahedron within a sphere of which the centre is the
middle point in the interior group.–He finally observes, that
although the tendency to a quinary arrangement in natural
history has hitherto been chiefly developed in zoology, yet the
 same principle may be recognised in botany.
   Also a communication, by the same author, On Boswellia,
and certain Indian Terebinthaceae.      Mr. Colebrooke is of opi
nion that the three  genera  Amyris,   Icica, and Bursera require
to be thrown together and recast: the whole group com
prising nearly 40 species, several of which are unpublished.
Among those described are Boswellia serrata, Bursera serrata,
Chalcas mitida, Amyris heptaphylla, A. punctata, Bergera        in

   The same appearance, the Astronomer Royal remarks, is
observable in the trapezium, round the four stars of which the
light has also receded analogously, leaving them on a com
paratively dark ground.     He conjectures that the stars have
been the immediate cause of the disappearance of the light;
and therefore he wishes to draw the attention of astronomers
to the phaenomenon, as it seems to deserve a marked attention.
   The Astronomer Royal has noticed a similar appearance,
still more decidedly, in another part of the same nebula at some

  nomy.     It is true that our late illustrious President has drawn
  some important inferences from those remarkable appearances
  which he was the first to discover, and has advanced a theory
  relative to the system of the universe, which whether it be
  realized or not, (and centuries must elapse before we can even
 approximate towards the truth of it,) must ever show the vigour
                                                                -
  of his bold and comprehensive mind.
     The last production of this Great Man, relative to double
  stars, was communicated to this Society, in the year 1821; and
 is inserted in the first volume of our Memoirs.
     Such was the state of this interesting branch of the science
 at the time it was taken up by Messrs. Herschel and South.
 The singular and extraordinary changes that had been ob
 served by Sir William Herschel in his review of the heavens
 in 1802 and 1804, had determined Mr. Herschel to follow up
 the intentions of his father, by a review of                     all
                                                         the double stars
 inserted      his catalogues: and
              in                           early   as 1816   as had com     he
 menced this arduous undertaking. Mr. South also being dis
 posed      pursue the same enquiry, suggested the plan                car           of
 rying   on to
             their observations        concert; and, with the aid
                                              in                                              of
 two excellent achromatic telescopes, belonging                the latter,  to
 they employed the years 1821, 1822, and 1823                     this re    in
 search. The result         their labours was presented
                                  of                           the Royal    to
 Society, and published           the Philosophical Transactions for
                                        in
  1824  at the  expense            of
                              the Board        Longitude.

     The number         double stars observed jointly by these two
                        of
astronomers amounts             380: and we may judge
                                       to                             their         of
 value and importance when we learn that the authors were
more anxious           obtain accurate results, than
                        to                                    extend theto

                                        in                 But,  when we
 find that, even         obtain these results, many thousand mea
                         to
 surements        distance and position were made, we must justly
                 of
admire the patience and perseverance                         of
                                                     the authors       this          in
their laborious, but highly important pursuit. The remark
 able phaenomena, first brought             light  to        by
                                                      Sir William Her
 schel, have been abundantly confirmed; and many new ob
jects pointed out         worthy the attention
                             as                              of
                                                      future observers.
     Whilst these    important   inquiries were carrying             Eng       on   in
land, one        our Associates, Professor Struve, was engaged
                 of                                                                           in

coincidence in most of the measurements made by M. Struve,
and those made by Sir William Herschel and afterwards by
Messrs. Herschel and South (although with very different                                                          in
struments and micrometers), confirms the general accuracy of
the observations, and marks the degree of confidence that may
be placed in measurements of this kind.            Some slight discre
pancies have indeed been observed on a comparison of the
total results, and some singular anomalies have presented
themselves: but these, so far from invalidating their accuracy,
tend to give them greater confirmation, and may probably, at
some future period, lead to the detection of some hidden law
which regulates the motions of these remarkable bodies.
    It is for these important observations and discoveries, and
for the great zeal and talent displayed by these distinguished
astronomers, in the pursuit of this interesting subject, that your
 Council has resolved to bestow on each of them the Gold Medal
of the Society: and which I have now the honor of doing.

 miles  each, and there to settle a palaver with à.  king of that
 country, who is in constant communication with Nyffe and

  During the last summer and autumn, I repeated most of
my former experiments on the water in the old and relin
quished mines as before stated (vide Annals, vol. v. N.S.), and
almost precisely with the same results. Suffice it to say on
this head, that the greatest heat found in those cºllections of
water from the depth of 20 to 170 fathoms from the surface,
was 55° Fahr. in Relistian mine, in the parish of Gwinear,
while the coldest temperature found was 52° at 134 fathoms
in Huel Ann, in Wendron.
     I conceived        that by selecting a stagnant collection                     of water
in a deep part of a mine at work, the temperature of which
spot while it was occupied by the workmen was known, might
more effectually give us the true temperature of the surround
ing strata, than by any other means. I, therefore, selected a
winze” at the 110 fathom level, in Huel Trumpet tin mine, in
 the parish of Wendron. This winze was sunk between four
 and five fathoms, when it was found necessary to relinquish it
 from the water being too quick; and until the 120 fathom level
 was driven far enough under it to drain it of               water.    its

304                Baron Cuvier on the Physiological Labours
 attention of naturalists, to determine the true nature of the
 different tubercles which compose the brain of fishes.
    We have given an account more than once, and especially
 in 1820, of #. doubts which exist with respect to those two
 tubercles which are interior to the cerebellum, and are generally
 hollow, containing in the interior one or two pair of smaller
 tubercles. These have long been considered to be the true
 brain, the tubercles which they cover, to be the tubercula
 quadrigemina, and those placed anterior to them the olfactory
 tubercles, analogous to those which we find in front of the
 cerebrum in the rat, mole, and other mammalia.
    For some years M. Arasky, and subsequently M. Serres,
 have come to the conclusion, but from anatomical comparison
 only, that the anterior tubercles constitute the cerebrum, and
 that the large hollow pair correspond to the tubercula quadri
 gemina. It follows from the experiments of M. Flourens made
 on carps, that irritation of the anterior tubercles, or of the su
 perior part of the hollow tubercles, produces no convulsions,
 but if the base of the last be pricked, violent spasms are                               in
 duced; which would also lead us to consider the lesser internal
 tubercles to be tubercula quadrigemina, as well as the hollow
 tubercle which incloses them.         The removal of the anterior
 tubercles does not at first perceptibly change the animal’s con
 dition or manner; but it appears to move less frequently and
 not voluntarily; it even appeared to the author, as well as he
 could judge from the state of restraint in which he was obliged
 to keep the fish thus mutilated, that it could neither hear nor
See.   #.     removal of the hollow tubercles produces a much
more decisive effect on the oeconomy of the animal; it moves
                                                            it its

veloped to a true lobe, while in other animals it is scarcely

 M. Flourens accounts for by the more laborious respiration                                           of
aquatic animals, who act on the air through the intervention

 tion a rupture of one of the crura cerebri was discovered.
  M. Majendie has not confined his observations to the centre
 of the nervous system, he has made some very curious obser
 vations respecting the nerves distributed to the organs of
 sense.    Hitherto the first pair of nerves or olfactory has been
 considered as dedicated to the organ of smell.           M. Majendie,
 wishing to make an experiment which appeared to him a
 work of supererogation, to prove the correctness of an opinion
 doubted by none, cut the olfactory nerves of a young dog.
 What was his surprise the following day to find the animal
 sensible to strong odours! The experiment repeated on other
 animals afforded similar results.        The author suspected that
 this  sensibility  was to be attributed to the branches of the fifth
pair distributed to the nostril; he accomplished the division
 of these nerves on either side, notwithstanding their depth,
in dogs, cats, and Guinea pigs, and thus destroyed all sensibi
 lity in the nostril. Animals which sneezed, rubbed the nose,
and turned away the head when compelled to inhale the va
pour of ammonia or acetic acid, remained passive when the
fifth pair was divided, or at least manifested only the effects
resulting from stimulation of the larynx.         This effect of strong
odours remained even in hens, from whose heads the whole
cerebral hemispheres and olfactory nerves had been removed.
 We might certainly suspect that the volatile alkali acted only
 chemically on the pituitary membrane, and attribute the effects
more to pain than smell; in that case the pain alone would de
pend upon the fifth pair: but M. Majendie, who saw the force
 of this objection, observes, that it is much weaker with re
ference to the animal               oil
                                 Dippel   of             or
                                              essential oil     almonds,      of
which affected the      organ  before the fifth  pair  was  divided,  and
lost      all
          effect when      was cut, although the first pair remained
                             it
untouched. What would still better rebut the objection, would
    be  prove that animals which have had the olfactory nerve
         to
divided, still continued         seek and distinguish their food
                                          to                                                  by

The dissections           Dr. Ramond, reported            M. Majendie,   by

       Mr. Dalton    on the Constitution       of the   Atmosphere.         311
of  the Newtonian hypothesis, Mr. D. puts a case which he
thinks has not before been considered, and which may assist
us materially in forming a correct notion of such mixed at
mospheres.
   Two equal cylindrical pipes are conceived to be placed per
pendicular to the horizon, in contact, and of indefinite length,
close at the bottom, and open at the top. These are supposed
to be filled with two gases of different kinds, the one with car
bonic acid, and the other with hydrogen, in order to show the
contrast more strikingly.        The columns of gases are assumed
each to be of the    weight   of 30 inches of mercury, and conse
quently will represent vertical columns of atmospheres of the
respective gases equal in weight to like columns of the earth's
atmosphere.      Mr. D. calculates from known principles that
the column of carbonic acid gas will terminate at 30 or 40
miles of elevation, or at least will become of such tenuity as
that it may be disregarded.         In like manner that of hydrogen
will be found to become       insignificant  above 1200 miles of al
titude. The author then supposes that horizontal air-tight
partitions are made across both tubes at any given intervals of
distance, and that openings are made, so that the gases in the
corresponding horizontal cells may communicate with each
other; in which case each gas, as is well known, would divide
itself equally between the two cells.        For 30 or 40 miles both
gases would be found in each cell; but for the rest of the co
lumn, namely, for 1000 miles or upwards, there would be no
thing but hydrogen in both cells.
   In the next place, Mr. D. conceives the horizontal partitions
to be withdrawn, and considers what change would ensue.
There would have been many cells about the summit of the
carbonic acid atmosphere which, when opened for the purpose
of communication, would part with half their contents to the
collateral cells, but half the contents would not be able to fill
the whole space of the cell, by reason that the gas was at                   its
minimum density before.          Hence the gas would              be
                                                               confined
to  the lower half   of  the cells, and there would be no carbonic
acid in   the upper parts.     Of course when the partitions were
removed, the carbonic acid         in each cell would descend till           it
came   in   contact with the like    gas     of
                                             the inferior cell.   Thus
there would
               be
               a     slight descent     ofthe upper regions         carof
bonic acid gas. The same also would happen                 the hydro
                                                             to

considerable descent would take place. Mr.              D.
                                                        seems     thinkto

                                              in          atmospheres
afterwards. Thus the two mixed atmospheres would exhibit
equal volumes   of  each gas  in   the lowest cells,

commotion, greater or less, still there will be a constant ten
dency towards that state of equilibrium which is above de

    A paper was lately read before the Royal Society, On the
expression of the parts of machinery by signs; by C. Babbage,
Esq. F.R.S. of which the following is a notice.
    In contriving his calculating engine *, Mr. Babbage found
  reat difficulty from not having any regular method, by which
#. could find, at an instant's notice, the precise time at which
any given piece began to move, and also the state of motion or
rest, at the same instant, of all the other parts. He therefore
devised a method of expressing              the motions             all
                                                                any machine,                         of

3.16      Results   of our  Meteorological Tables    for 1825.
    In order to obtain the correct       mean annual results      of the
barometers, thermometers, and depths of rain at Gosport, in
London, and at Boston for this table, I recalculated the tables
at the end of the Numbers of the Philosophical Magazine and
Journal for 1825.
    I shall here notice by the way of Errata, that Mr. Veall's
barometer appears too low by 45-100dths of an inch on the
 11th of May, and on the 16th of that month 5-10ths of an inch
too low *. Again, on the 26th of November, Mr.                J.  Cary’s
barometer is too high by 6-10ths of an inch.              These errors
I  have corrected in the monthly mean pressures in the table,
as on comparison it will be readily discovered that they are
errors by some means or other.
    The mean annual heights of the barometers in the table at
the different stations this year, will be found much higher
than they were last year, particularly at Gosport and in Lon
don: and the mean annual temperatures of the external air
are more than a degree higher.           The aggregate depth of rain
at each   place  is nearly  one-third less this year than last.     I am
much disappointed at the discontinuation of the use of the
pluviameter in London; but by the way of making the table
             I
complete, have substituted the depth of rain that fell there
in November and December by approximation.                   As the va
rieties of  weather,    and the    heights  of barometers very much
depend on the position of the prevailing winds, as well as on
the vicissitudes of the seasons,       I think it necessary to notice
some peculiarities in their position at Boston and Gosport.
   The winds from the North-east and East frequently travel
over the Russian empire, Denmark, &c., and those from the
South-east over part of Asia, Turkey, Hungary, and Germany
before they arrive at Boston; and in these directions overland
they become drier than the opposite winds which travel over
a great extent of sea: hence it is that the pressure at Boston
is comparatively greater with these winds than with those from
        ºff
opposite points of the compass.                           -
   In                the position of the winds as registered at these
places, they will seldom be found to blow simultaneously from
the same point, and their directions are very often four, some
times eight points different, and not unfrequently in opposite
directions.     The difference in their directions at #. same time
of registering, no doubt arises chiefly from the different lati
tudes of these places, as it respects a tract of land upwards of           .
two degrees in extent between them; and the South-west and
West winds, which are so prevalent here from the Atlantic
   * We have just learnt, however, that Mr.Veall finds these heights to be
correct, according to his journal.—EDIT.

 Ocean, either often die away, or change their direction, before
 they arrive at Boston, from their meeting with other currents
over the land; consequently, a less quantity of rain falls an
nually at Boston than at Gosport.

    Sig. Bizio considers the black matter of the ink of the cuttles
fish as a substance sui generis, which he calls Melaina, from
 uéA2; and &si.   It is obtained by digesting the ink with ver
dilute nitric acid until it become yellowish, washing it well,
and separating it by the filter; it is then to be frequently boiled
                             -
in water, one of the washings to be a little alkalized, and finally
with distilled water.
    The melaina is a tasteless black powder, insoluble in alco
hol, aether, and water while cold, but soluble in hot water;
the solution is black.      Caustic alkalies form with it a solu
tion even in the  cold,  from which the mineral acids precipitate
it unchanged. It contains much azote. It dissolves in and
decomposes sulphuric acid.        It easily kindles at the flame of
a candle. It has been found to succeed as a pigment, in some
respects better than China ink.-(Giornale di Fisica.)        Dublin

                       General Observations.
    The first part of this month was alternately wet and dry,
but mild for March; the latter part -was dry, windy, and very
cold.                                                         º
    From the vernal    equinox to the end of the   month,  with the
exception of one day, the temperature of the air decreased
considerably, with smart frosty nights; and a heavy equinoc
tial gale blew seven days and nights from the North and North
 east.   The 23d was a cold winter-like day, with snow from
 9 till 11 A.M.;

adhesive to the trees or to the ground, and was the                                  first we
had had here during the past winter; it again snowed               in the
night, and by the morning it had covered Portsdown Hill.
Snow also fell here on the 26th, which was the coldest day
and night since the 28th of last January. , Heavy snow-showers
and boisterous winds were also experienced in other parts
of the country, particularly to the northward. Early in the
morning of the 27th, the ice was one-third of an inch thick,
and in the mornings of the 30th and 31st, it was one-eighth of
an inch thick.      This ungenial weather was a seasonable check
upon the budding of the fruit-trees, and has therefore made
the spring rather backward; but this will no doubt be bene
ficial in the end. An early spring, with variable weather, is
much dreaded in this latitude, as the frosty nights which                                      al
most invariably ensue, have a destructive effect upon the youn
fruit, and vegetation.       The mean temperature of the extern
air this month, is one-third of a degree less than that of last
month ! The maximum temperature occurred in the night of
the 6th, instead of in the day. Spring water seems to have
arrived at    its minimum temperature,               now  as

XLIX.      On  Mr. DALtoN's Speculations respecting the    Mir
   ture  of Gases, the Constitution of the Atmosphere, &c.   By
   THoMAs TREDGoLD, Esq.”
ITmixture
      appears that Mr. Dalton's speculations respecting the
              of gases and vapours, and the nature of the atmo
sphere, have been very generally received as true explanations
of the phaenomena of the one and of the nature of the other;
and by those who are considered of high authority in science.
   Under these circumstances, it becomes the duty of those who
reject these speculations as erroneous, to exhibit the grounds
on which they do object to them, in the hope that the true
explanation of these important points of physical science may
be established.
   We    owe much to Mr. Dalton, even in cases where he has
not been successful, and his name will always be respected by
.
those who feel any interest in the progress of knowledge; and
I am sorry that    I  have to oppose as inaccurate one of those
bold speculations on which much of his fame has been raised.
   If  his had been merely speculations, and without influence
on the progress of other branches of physical inquiry, they
        have remained unopposed; but when formulae for the
reduction of chemical experiments to a common standard are
founded on them, and they are made the basis of other theories,
and are used in the correction of barometrical measurements,
and in various meteorological inquiries, it becomes a work of
necessity to examine how far these doctrines are founded in
truth.
   When Mr. Dalton's opinions first appeared, they were op
posed by Mr. Gough, and with sufficient force to have called
for more accurate investigation before they were acceded to.
Mr. Gough's paper was however not satisfactory to me; and
as far as I can recollect, it was very diffuse.
   The whole of Mr. Dalton's theory rests upon a very im

to the elastic force of the mixture, and therefore

     Cor.—When V = v, and              F = p,  we have
 Yºfa =             the volume after mixture.
 This condition, viz. that V = v, seems to apply with accuracy
 to the combination of air with the vapour of water, when the
 air is saturated.        Mr. Dalton arrives at the formula
                                                                  #+ f
                       f
 the volume; and to put the two to the test, let an experiment
 be made when            is equal to #p.
     By Mr. Dalton's formula, the volume of the mixture of air
     .
 and vapour would be three times the volume of the dry air.
          my formula the volume of the mixture of air and vapour
 would be only 1% of the volume of the dry air.
     I                                           I
        did intend to conclude here; but cannot resist the temp
 tation to ask Mr. Dalton, or M. Gay-Lussac, how in a mix
 ture of one
                   º:    of dry air of an elastic force of 30 inches of
  mercury with 2 parts of vapour of the elastic force of only
  20 inches, the whole mixture should possess an elastic force
  of 30 inches?        If   they can answer this question satisfactorily,
  we need not altogether despair of a perpetual motion bein
  discovered.        But to be once again serious:        I shall be very
  happy to have any error in my train of reasoning or results
  pointed out, should such be detected by any of your learned
  contributors.

                  habitudes with     sulphuric   acid. Mr. Brande,

sulphuric acid “in considerable abundance, forming                 deep                      a

out decomposition. The alkalies produce                 this solution        in                     a
white flaky precipitate, and          diluted the mixture becomes

one of the salts to be hereafter described.
   Dr. Kidd observes       that “it blackens sulphuric acid when

                       dilute  the  colour,  neither   does any preci
pitation take place upon saturating the acid with ammonia.”

composes naphthaline, for that         holds but very small quan

330        Mr. Faraday             on the mutual Action                      of Sulphuric Acid
    A portion of the impure acid in solution was evaporated at
a moderate temperature; when concentrated, it gradually
assumed a light brown tint. In this state it became solid on
cooling, of the hardness of cheese, and was very deliquescent.
By further heat it melted, then fumed, charred, &c. and gave
evidence of the abundant presence of carbonaceous matter.
   Some of the impure acid in solution was neutralized by
potash, during which no naphthaline or other substance se
parated. The solution being concentrated until ready to yield
a film on         its
               surface, was set aside whilst hot   crystallize:                     to
after some hours the solution was filled with minute silky cry
stals,    tufts, which gave the whole, when stirred, not the

baryta was separated, no excess of sulphuric acid being per
mitted. Being filtered, a pure aqueous solution of the peculiar
acid was obtained. It powerfully reddened litmus paper, and
had a bitter acid taste. Being evaporated to a certain degree,
a portion of it was subjected to the continued action of heat;
when very concentrated it began to assume a brown colour,
and on cooling became thick, and ultimately solid, and was
very deliquescent.       By renewed heat it melted, then began to
fume, charred, but did not flame; and ultimately gave sul
phuric and sulphurous acid vapours, and left charcoal.
    Another portion of the unchanged strong acid solution was
placed over sulphuric acid in an exhausted receiver.                 In some
hours it had by concentration become a soft white solid, ap
parently dry; and after a longer period was hard and brittle.
In this state it was deliquescent in the air, but in close vessels
underwent no change in several months.                     taste was bitter, Its
acid, and accompanied by              after metallic flavour, like that

power of an individual in a vessel, to obtain, by his own ex
ertions alone, that portion of the materials towards the evidence
of currents, which depends on her real change of position;
but the completion of the evidence by a sufficiently correct
reckoning must be the result of an interest participated in by
all the executive officers of a ship; or by the establishment of
such habits of accuracy, under the authority of her com

cessary for the general purposes of navigation; the employ

334             Capt. Sabine on the Presence of the Water
 land to Madeira, were observed to differ from each other half
 a point in one direction when on south-westerly courses, and
 less than half a point in the opposite direction when on easterly
 courses, the indications of the compasses having crossed each
 other, and agreed at some intermediate point; it was requisite,
 therefore, that the correction to be allowed on every course
 by each of the two compasses should be ascertained, and that
 the compass by which each course was directed should be
 specially recorded, in order that the true course should be
 known.
    The most obvious mode of preventing so much inconve
nience and trouble, as well as the more correct practice, is to
direct and note the ship's course by one compass only, sta
tioned permanently in some convenient situation, without re
ference to the helmsmen, and to use the binnacle compasses
 solely to steer by, on the point which may be noticed at the
 time to agree with the magnetic course of the standard com
pass; and by employing an azimuth compass for the latter
purpose, the advantage is gained of enabling the variation to
be observed directly with the compass by which the course is
               º:
governed, and thus of avoiding intermediate comparisons, in
which time is occupied, and errors frequently introduced.
 This arrangement of a standard compass was adopted by
 Captain                in the Pheasant, and subsequently in the
 Griper, and was found to answer                    its
                                            purpose perfectly, and                                to

exceeding 70 miles, from the mouths of the Senegal and Gam

is probable that the water of both these rivers is always colder
at their entrance into the sea, than the ocean temperature of
the parallel; that of the Gambia certainly was so at that sea
son, but it was not so cold as the sea in the vicinity of Cape
Verd, as on approaching the entrance of the Gambia, the tem
perature of the surface rose to 67°5, and varied in the river
itself at different hours from 66° to 67°5; and at the depth
of 36 feet, being within six feet of the bottom, a self-registering
thermometer indicated at high water less than a degree colder
than the surface.       The coast in the neighbourhood of Cape
Verd is   every  where low and sandy, and is covered with trees
to the water's   edge.    Such, indeed, is the general character of
the shores of western Africa, with the exception of Cape Sierra
Leone; but at no other part of the coast was the diminution
of the temperature of the water, on approaching the land, so
great, as in the instance which has been mentioned.            Between
the Gambia and Sierra Leone are a succession of rivers, ori
ginating in land of less elevation than the Senegal and Gambia,
and much exceeding them in the temperature of the waters
which they convey into the ocean; in the mid-channel of the
 Rio Grande, at a few miles from its mouth, the surface was
never less than 74°, and occasionally as high as 77°5, and at
the depth of 30 or 40 feet was less than a degree colder than
the surface. At the entrance of the River Noonez the surface
water was 77°5, and at that of the Rokelle 80°.           To the south
of the Rokelle, and from thence to the extremity of the Gulf
of Guinea, the coast is swept by a current of considerable ra
pidity, which renders the cooling effect of the land less appa
rent; but in the bays of the coast, where the current sweeps
from point to point, and leaves still water in the inside, a diffe
rence is commonly
               -      found amounting to three and four degrees”.

And, by passing from the expression of the sine to that of the
arc itself,      I   have found,
        2   =y        VT-Fºcosºl                            +     “Hºº-º-sin'y.                                            (E)
If we       compare this expression                              with the formula                         (D')         we shall
readily deduce

                                                                 gº sin’<U+017F>.                                                 (F)
Hence, in measurements to a certain extent, a and y may be
regarded as equal; and either of them will give the amplitude
of the length measured.     It is easy to substitute y for r in the
expression of the geodetical line already given.
   It is requisite to observe that in low latitudes the value of
                  tan w
sin y       (=       tan   l   ) is the quotient of two                                 small quantities;                        and
that an error in w will be greatly augmented in y. It is there
fore only in considerable latitudes that z can be safely deter
mined by means of the azimuth.                             .
   The foregoing analysis will enable us to deduce the diffe
rence of longitude directly from the variation in azimuth. We
have already found,

As   uis here the result of an exact calculation and not affected
with errors of observation, the value of z now found must be
accurate as far as the tables usually employed will allow. But
if u were determined by observation, we may reasonably sup
pose an error of 1" in defect; then
                                          2   =    3° 35' 54".8,
so that an error of 1" in u has produced one of near 16" in z.
   Next computing by the difference of longitude, we have
                    tan p cos   = tan                   l              ar,

                              r           =   3°
then,    by
         the formula (D),
                  z     =    ºr   x       l'OO1631            =   8° 35'       38'20.
  Lastly,         to   determine          z   by    means         of   the variation    in   azimuth,
we have
                        w    =    90°         —    w        =    3°   34' 51".54
                                                        tan w
                                  sin
                                              = =
                                          y
                                                        tan  l
                                          y             3°    35' 16"     78:
then,    by   the formula              (E)
         2    =    y   x        0.11
                             1:001625       35' 37".88.
                                                   +                  =   8°
  The    values      deduced from the difference of longitude
                        of   z
and the variation            of
                      azimuth are not exactly equal, the former
exceeding the latter                  by

 always agreed in direction with the nucleus. And lastly, that
at the apex of the nucleus the radicle of the future Embryo
would constantly be found.                           -
    On these   grounds     my opinion     respecting     the Embryo of Ce
phalotus was formed. In describing the Ovulum in this genus,
I  employed indeed, the less correct term “sacculus,” which,
however, sufficiently expressed the appearance of the included
body in the specimens examined, and served to denote my un
certainty in this case as to the presence of the inner membrane.
     Iwas at that time also aware of the existence, in several
plants, of a foramen in the coats of the Ovulum, always distinct
from, and in some cases diametrically opposite                  the external             to,
umbilicus, and which          had    I                    of no

pregnated vegetable Ovulum.            It is not, however, probable
that these authors had      really  seen this aperture in the early
state of the Ovulum in         any  case, but rather that they had
 merely advanced from the observation of Grew, and the con
jecture founded on it by Morland, whose hypothesis they adopt
 without acknowledgment, to the unqualified assertion of                                                             its

360          Mr. Robert Brown                            on the Structure                   of the
  lays great erudition in every branch of his subject, can hardly,
            be considered an original observer in this part. He
describes the unimpregnated Ovulum as a pulpy homogeneous
globule, whose epidermis, then scarcely distinguishable, sepa
rates in a more advanced stage, and becomes the testa of the
seed, the inner membrane of which is entirely the product of
fecundation*.      He asserts also that the Embryo constantly
appears at that point of the ovulum where the ultimate branches
of the umbilical vessels perforate the inner membrane; and
therefore mistakes the apex for the base of the nucleus.
    In 1806, Mons. Turpint published a memoir on the organ,
                                                                                                               .

                           Geological Collection*.
   This collection we owe to the care and researches of M.
Lesson.   It is composed of only 330 specimens; but these
specimens have been collected with judgement, and from all
the countries which the corvette visited. They are besides
of a fine size, and perfectly characterized.        -
   Twelve of these specimens collected in the neighbourhood
of Saint Catherine, on the coast of Brazil, show that this part
of the American continent belongs to the ordinary granite
formations.    Thirty-three specimens from the Malouine Isles
show that these isles belong to the oldest intermediate forma
tions. M. Lesson found there only phyllades, quartzose sand
stones, and grau-wackés, rarely furnishing some organic im
pressions similar to those known elsewhere.               Twenty speci
                                                                   '...".
mens were collected in the environs of Conception, on the
coast of Chili. Some of them, from the peninsula of Talcagu
ana, are of phylladiform talcose rocks, and
long to the most recent primordial districts. The others, col
lected on the continent, present ordinary granitic rocks, and
besides, true stratiform lignite, which at first sight might be
taken for pit-coal.

   The environs of Port Praslin, in New-Ireland, have fur
nished seven specimens of a recent madreporitic calcareous
rock, similar to that which appears in the formation of nearly
all the isles of the Pacific.
 At the island of Waigiou, near the land of the Papous,
M. Lesson collected twenty-one varieties of serpentine rocks
which abound on this spot.
   At the Moluccas, the island of Borou furnished six specimens
of phylladiform talcite, both carboniferous and quartziferous;
and the island of Amboyna afforded four of recent madreporitic
calcareous specimens.      The specimens collected as well in the
countries near Port Jackson as in the Blue Mountains, very
much increase our knowledge respecting these parts of New
Holland. The specimens, to the number of seventy, offer us:
1. the granites, the quartziferous syenites, and the pegmatites,
which form the second plane of the Blue Mountains; 2.
the ferruginous freestones, containing abundant laminae of
specular iron, which cover not only a vast extent of country
near the coasts, but also the first plane of the Blue Mountains;
and, 3dly, the stratiform lignite which is worked at Mount
York, at 1000 feet above the level of the sea, and the presence
of which adds to the reasons, which lead us to think that the
ferruginous freestones of these countries belong to the tertiary
formation. . .
    Twenty-five specimens collected in Van Diemen's Land, in
the neighbourhood of Port Dalrymple, and near to Cape
 Barren, indicate : 1st, pegmatitic and serpentine districts;
2nd, intermediary shelly formatious, formed of the schis
toid grau-wacké, and of calcareous stone; 3rd, very recent
districts, composed of sandy and ferruginous clay, with geodes
of hydrated iron, and fossil wood in different states. There
are also fine white and blueish topazes amongst the quartzose
pebbles collected at Cape Barren.            Eight specimens from

 worthy of the name would have so little delicacy as to publish
 anything before them, or without their consent. To the spe

of their collection, on their names in the idioms of various na

journals many observations on the habits of the animals; in

 short, with a talent that Peron himself found only in the pro
 fessional artists who were associated with him, they have made
 finished figures, coloured after the life, or immediately after
 death: this last attention is of immense advantage with regard
 to the fishes, mollusca, and zoophytes, the first of which soon
 lose their colours, and the others change even their form so
 much as to be altogether undistinguishable; and indeed, it
 will be only from the time of Peron, that the mollusca and
 zoophytes of the torrid zone will have begun to be really
 known.      The Russian naturalists of MM.                      and

 larged this new domain of science.          But we must not limit
  ourselves to this general view; and it is necessary, in order
  fully to do justice to our zoologists, to enter into the detail of
  the materials which they have procured for natural history.
     All which concerns vertebrated animals has been principall
  collected by MM. Lesson and Garnot; they also gave
  attention to shells, the mollusca, and madrepores; but M. Dur
  ville was principally engaged in attending to insects and other
  small articulated            •
     The history of the human species occupied their first atten
  tion: they procured the skulls of various races, as far as the
  duty of not wounding the respect of these people for the tombs
  of their fathers permitted them. Amongst others they have
  brought those of a people little known of the interior of New
   Guinea, named Alfourous.
     The class of quadrupeds could not furnish them with many
  large species, since they did not stay long on extensive lands.
   They have brought but twelve; but in this number there is
  one, the black rabbit of the Malouine Islands, which appears
  new to science; another, the great speckled Phalangista, which
   was not in the Museum of Natural History, and two or three
   which are found there only in bad condition.        Two skulls of
   the species of dolphin d scapulaire blanc, which Peron de
  scribed, but brought no specimen     of,   are also  an interesting
   acquisition for our anatomical collections.
      The birds are much more numerous. There are 254 species,
   andof  several, four, six,or  eight specimens. Of the 254 species,
 46    seemto   be new  to   the science; that

voyage in the Black Sea with Captain Gauttier, he studied the
interests of the Museum; but in this voyage he has proved still
further his zeal and disinterestedness.              The insects which he
has   deposited    there amount to         nearly   1,200,   forming nearly
 1,100 species: viz. 361 coleoptera, 428 lepidoptera, and the
 rest included in the other orders. M. Latreille is of opinion
 that, of this number, 450 species at least were wanting in the
 Museum of Natural History, and that nearly 300 are not yet
 described in published works. They come from Chili, from
 Lima and Payta in Peru, and more especially from Port
 Praslin in New-Ireland, from Oflak in the land of Papous,
 from Dory in New-Guinea, from Bourou in the Moluccas, from
 Otaheite and from the Malouines. Although the Museum                                          al
 ready possessed a great number of these animals from New
 Holland and Brazil, it will yet acquire by this voyage several
 species in which it was deficient, and which inhabit exclusively
 these countries.                                                           -

  The lime, under this treatment, when the experiment is made in
 the most perfect manner, emits a light 83 times as intense as
 that given out by the brightest part of the flame of an Argand
 lamp; and this, concentrated and reflected by the mirror, has
 enabled the officers employed in the survey, to connect very   di
 stant stations in the night-time, in the most satisfactory manner.

we would mention a recommendation from Mr. Greenough,

Botanists; as it seemed to be considered neutral ground be

 which have been traced in Germany, Scotland, &c. This enor
 mous lake, or rather insulated portion of the ocean, must have
 extended in the north, from Hudson's Bay to below Quebec:
 the eastern boundary being the Allighany range: the western
 the diluvial hills near the Rivers St. Peter,    #. and Missouri:
 whilst the waters contained therein must have stood at 1000
                                                       -
 feet above the level of the sea.
    That the fluid of this great reservoir was saline, is inferred
 from many genera of fish, of marine origin, being now the        in
 habitants of the lakes; which latter are presumed to have been
 converted into fresh-water by various operations of drainage,
 &c. Large fresh-water deposits are instanced, as occurring on
 Lakes Huron and Simcoe, extending to Ontario and Erie.
  Some of the higher beds of these, in the interior, contain
  Uniones, like those of the present lakes: they are never in a
 fossil state, and are associated with Planorbes, Physae, Lymneae,
jº
 Melaniae, &c. The banks of the lakes are usually constituted
 of several steps or terraces, which the author attributes to the
 various depressions of the waters, occasioned by excessive
 injuries to the embankments; but with respect to the great
            lake, he inclines to the belief of its reduction to a
 group by one great disruption.         The chaudieres, or pot-like
 cavities, are described in many situations, and the fluted
 channellings of various rocks are further adduced, as exhibit
 ing the abrasive power of water.
    The 3d class, or the alluvial depositions, offer nothing
remarkable.—The 4th class, or the native debris, is derived
                    #.
from the disintegration of the subjacent, or primitive rocks.
The Nipissing,              Huron, &c. offer many examples, the
materials composing which appear never to have travelled far,
but always to have been derived from the contiguous rocks,       -
              in their outline and angles.
    The paper concludes by the description of a limestone cave
near New Lanark, in Upper Canada, containing bones of va
rious quadrupeds, the larger of which are supposed to have
been carried in by a smaller animal, and of the effects of whose
teeth there are evident marks.

ject of  acquiring knowledge          practice  by the newly proposed
                                                                   of

the satisfactory instances, from experience, being              that pe                at
riod extremely limited.
    Subscriptions                        about 200l. per annum were
                                                     of

    Although the great object                   of

carefully the effects of the vaccine contagion, yet a register
has been kept reporting the history of nearly 15,000 patients
attending at this institution,--a record, it is believed, far ex
ceeding in observations that of the practice of any other so
ciety in existence.
    But this institution has been still more extensively useful
by the diffusion of the practice through other channels. From
this source many thousand vaccinators have received matter
for inoculation. It has been the appointed office exclusively
for the supply of the army, navy, and ordnance departments;
and at a very early period, with the approval of the English
minister of state, Paris first experienced the benefit of the
new practice, by the communication with this institution; as
well as, it is believed, Vienna and other parts of Germany,
Russia, Portugal, the East and West Indies, America, and
New South Wales.
    Further, the institution has promoted the practice by afford
ing instructions and showing the mode of inoculation to a
number of students and inexperienced vaccinators.
    As evidence of the labour of investigation, the Medical Board
have issued several publications to promulgate facts and de
termine doubtful points in practice, and information has been
transmitted to several medical and philosophical journals.
    Communications have been received and registered of ex
traordinary occurrences in the new practice; by these means
materials have been gradually accumulated in the journals of
the institution, which may prove beneficial to mankind by a
history of the vaccine inoculation.
    On the subject of the maintenance of this institution it will
 create surprise, and perhaps be found unexampled, that a
small body, chiefly of medical men, should be enabled, with
the assistance of their friends, to pay the cost of a house, se
cretary, medicine, printing, postages, advertisements, &c. &c.
and even defray the expense of carriage-hire to procure the
 attendance of extraordinary cases, without incurring debt,
 during more than twenty-six years.
    The number of patients applying for vaccination has been
 progressively and rapidly increasing, especially during the last
 three years, as the records of the institution accurately de
 monstrate, and thereby prove the great advantage the public
 were weekly deriving from the gratuitous services of the mem
 bers of this establishment.
    It is grievous, however, to state, that owing to deaths of
 most of the original friends, and defalcations of others by va
 rious accidents, and perhaps also by the failure of the institu
 tion to solicit the public for contributions, the funds are ex

pours at the time, but by strong emanations from the densest-
part of the aurora.
    The difference in the intensity of light of the aurora and
the luminous arch, may arise from a difference in the density
of the atmosphere through which these electrical emanations
have to pass: and as the height of the electrical streams has
often been found by trigonometrical measurement considerably
above the allowed height of the earth's atmosphere,                    when
formed into a luminous arch; it may therefore appear to                                                          di

                       General Observations.
   This month has been very dry and fine for the season. Na
ture has been and is still clad in her richest blooming robes,
and the beautifully varied tints of the blossoms of the fruit and
other trees, with the verdure of the fields, have not been sur
passed in appearance since the year 1822. . No disagreeable
weather has occurred to prevent agricultural operations, and
every advantage has been taken of it in this quarter. On the
18th instant, at midday, a pair of swallows passed by from the
S.W., being the first that have appeared here this year.
   During the latter part of the month very considerable changes
occurred in the temperature of the air, as induced by cold
northerly gales and showers of hail; several frosty mornings
followed, and the 28th was the coldest day and night since the
30th of March: on that morning, between 5 and 6 o'clock,
there was a slight shower of snow, and early in the mornings
of the 29th and 30th, a thick hoar-frost appeared on the tops
of the houses and in the fields, and ice in the ponds and
ditches as thick as a half-crown piece.
   The destructive effects of these late frosts on the bloom, and
on the young fruit in open situations, after the uniformly mild
weather to the 22d, are already perceptible. In consequence of
this transition in the weather, the temperature of spring water,
from the 20th to the morning of the 27th,- decreased 15-100ths
                                                     "    ..
of a degree.
   Between the 24th and 28th there was a range in the ex
ternal thermometer of 35 degrees       so that the chilly air fell
like the setting in of a second winter. The mean tempera
ture of the external air this month, is three-tenths of a de
gree less than that of last April; but it is two degrees higher
than the mean of that month for the last ten years.
   The atmospheric and meteoric phaenomena that have come
within our observations this month, are two paraselenae be
tween 8 and 9 P.M. on the 21st; two coloured parhelia at
5 P.M. on the 25th; one anthelion at 3 P.M. on the 28th; one
lunar and four solar halos, eight meteors, lightning from the
passing clouds in the evening of the 21st; and six gales of
wind, or days on which they have prevailed; namely, one from
the North, three from the South-west, and two from the North
west.

    Sciences, &c. &c.
                         [Concluded   from p. 332.]
         2. Salts formed by the peculiar        Acid with Bases.
         compounds may be formed, either by acting on
THESE
  the bases or their carbonates by the pure acid, obtained
as already described; or the impure acid in solution may be
used, the salts resulting being afterwards freed from sulphates,
by solution in alcohol.    It is however proper to mention that
another  acid,  composed   of the same elements, is at the same
time formed with the acid in question, in small, but variable
proportions.    The impure acid used, therefore, should be ex
amined as to the presence of this body, in the way to be           di
rected when speaking of the barytic salts; and such specimens
as contain very little  or none of it should be selected.
    Potash forms with the acid a neutral salt, soluble in water
and alcohol, forming colourless solutions. . These yield either
transparent or white pearly crystals, which are soft, slightly
fragile, feel slippery between the fingers, do not alter by ex
posure to air, and are bitter and saline to the taste. They are
not very soluble in water; but they undergo no change by re
     ted solutions and crystallizations, or by long continued
ebullition.    The solutions frequently yield the salt in acicular
tufts, and they often vegetate, as it were, by spontaneous eva
                                      *
poration, the salt creeping over the sides of the vessel, and
running to a great distance in         beautiful forms. The solid
salt heated in a tube gave off a little water, then some naph
thaline; after that a little carbonic and sulphurous acid gases
arose, and a black ash remained, containing carbon, sulphate
of potash, and sulphuret of potassium. When the salt was
heated on platinum foil, in the air, it burnt with a dense flame,
leaving a slightly alkaline sulphate of potash.
    Soda yields a salt, in most properties resembling that of
potash; crystalline, white, pearly, and unaltered in the air.
I   thought that, in       the metallic taste which frequently oc
                         it,
curred with this acid and           its
                                    compounds was very decided.
 The action of heat was the same as before.
    Ammonia formed       a neutral salt imperfectly crystalline, not
 deliquescent, but drying       the atmosphere.
                               in                   Its taste was sa
 line and  cooling.     It
                         was readily  soluble    water and alcohol.

 When heated      on platinum foil fused, blackened, burnt with

some sulphurous acid was evolved, and the whole would ulti
mately have become black and charred, had it not been cooled
before it had proceeded thus far, and immediately dissolved in

yielded, when rubbed with carbonate of baryta, colourless
liquids; and these when evaporated furnished a barytic salt,

   Strontia.   The compound of this earth with the acid                        al
ready described very much resembled the flaming salt of

red tinge, and left a result of the usual kind.        -
   Lime   gave a white salt of a bitter taste, slightly  soluble in

those of the former salts.

exposure to air slowly acquired oxygen, and a portion of per
salt was found.
   Zinc was readily acted upon by the acid, hydrogen evolved,
and a salt formed. The same salt resulted from the action of
the acid upon the moist oxide. It was moderately soluble in

acid, and a solution, almost neutral, was quickly obtained. It
was of a brown colour, and a powerful metallic taste.           By
evaporation it gave a splendent, white, crystalline salt; not
changing in the air except when heated; but then, burning
with flame, and ultimately leaving pure silver. When the so
lution of the salt was boiled for some time, a black insoluble
matter was thrown down, and a solution obtained, which by
evaporation gave abundance of a yellow crystalline salt. The

   When solution of the pure acid was subjected to the voltaic
battery, oxygen and hydrogen gases were evolved in their
pure state: no solid matter separated, but the solution became
of a deep yellow colour at the positive pole, occasioned by the
evolution of free sulphuric acid, which re-acted upon the
hydro-carbon.     A solution of the barytic salts gave similar
results.                                                  º

acid and       its

402       Mr. Faraday               on the mutual Action           of Sulphuric Acid
   A    portion of the pure salt was prepared and dried for some
hours on the sand bath, at a temperature about 212°. Known
 weights were then heated in a platinum crucible to dissipate
 and burn off the combustible matter; and the residuum being
 moistened with sulphuric acid to decompose any sulphuret of
 barium formed, was heated to convert it into a pure sulphate
of baryta. The results obtained were very constant, and
amounted to 41.714 of sulphate of baryta per cent of salt used,
 equivalent to 27°57 baryta per cent.
    Other portions of the salt were decomposed by being heated
in a flask with strong nitro-muriatic acid, so as to liberate the
sulphuric acid from the carbon and hydrogen present, and yet
retain it in the state of acid. Muriate of baryta was then
added, the whole evaporated to dryness, heated red-hot, washed
with dilute muriatic acid to remove the baryta uncombined
with sulphuric acid, and the sulphate collected, dried, and
weighed. The results were inconstant; but the sulphate of
 baryta obtained, always much surpassed that furnished by the
former method. Judging from this circumstance that the sul
phuric acid in the salt was more than an equivalent for the
baryta present, many processes were devised for the determina
tion of         its
               quantity, but were rejected         consequencein      diffi              of
 culties and     imperfections,  arising,   principally,   from the pre
 sence and action of so much carbonaceous matter.                The fol

         and Naphthaline, and on a new Acid produced.        403
 was used in the former experiment; and the washings and
 other operations being repeated exactly in the same way, the
 quantity of sulphate of baryta occasioned by the presence of
sulphuric acid in the oxide, acids, &c. was determined. This
deducted from the weight afforded in the first experiments,
gave the quantity produced from the sulphuric acid actually
existing in the salt.    Experiments so conducted gave very
uniform results.    The mean of many indicated 8-9 grains of
sulphate of baryta for 10 grains of salt used, or 89 grains per
cent, equivalent to 30-17 of sulphuric acid for every 100 of
                                                -
salt decomposed.
   In the analytical experiments, relative to the quantity of
carbon and hydrogen contained in the salt, a given weight of
the substance being mixed with per-oxide of copper, was
heated in a green glass tube.     The apparatus used consisted
of Mr.   Cooper's   lamp  furnace,  with Dr. Prout's mercurial
trough; and all the precautions that could be taken, and
which are now well known, were adopted for the purpose of
obtaining accurate results. . When operated upon in this way,
the only substances evolved from the salt, were carbonic acid
and water.    As an instance of the results, 3.5 grains of the
salt afforded 11-74 cubic inches of carbonic acid gas, and 0-9
of a grain of water. The mean of several experiments gave
32-93 cubic inches of carbonic acid gas, and 2.589 grains of
water, for every 10 grains of salt decomposed.
   On these data, 100 grains of the salt would yield 329-3
cubic inches of carbonic acid, or 153:46 grains, equivalent to
41.9 grains of carbon, and 25.89 grains of water, equivalent
to 2-877 grains of hydrogen.      Hence 100 grains of the salt
yielded      Baryta . . . . . . 27°57 . . . . 78

In the second numerical column the experimental results are
repeated, but increased, that baryta might be taken in the
quantity representing one proportional, hydrogen being unity:
and it will be seen that they do not differ far from the follow
ing theoretical statement.

  the sulphuric acid obtained, above two proportionals.
       The glowing salt              of        baryta was now analysed      process          by   a
 similar        to   that adopted               for the flaming salt. The specimen
                                                                          operated

        and Naphthaline, and on a new Acid produced.          405
operated upon was pure, and in a distinctly crystalline state.
It had been heated to about 440°F. for three hours in a me
tallic bath. Ten grains of this salt exposed to air for forty
hours increased only 0.08 of a grain in weight. These when
converted into sulphate of baryta by heat and sulphuric acid,
gave 4-24 grains. Seven grains by carbonate of baryta, oxide
of copper, heat, &c. gave 6-02 grains of sulphate of baryta:
hence 10 grains of the salt would have afforded 8-6 grains of
the sulphate equivalent to 2-915 grains of sulphuric acid. Five
grains when heated with oxide of copper gave 16-68 cubic
inches of carbonic acid gas, equal to 7-772 grains, and equiva
lent to 2-12 grains of carbon. The water formed amounted
to 1-2 grains, equivalent to 0-133 of a grain of hydrogen.
    From these data, - 100 grains of the salt would appear to
 furnish                                             -

results not far different from those obtained with the former
salt.
   Ihave not yet obtained sufficient quantities of this salt in a
decidedly crystalline state to enable me satisfactorily to ac
count for the difference between it and the flaming salt.
   Attempts were made to form similar compounds with other
acids than the sulphuric.   Glacial phosphoric acid was heated
and shaken in naphthaline, but without any particular results.
A little water was then used with another portion of the ma
terials, to bring the phosphoric acid into solution, but no de
cided combination could be obtained. Muriatic acid gas was
brought into contact with naphthaline in various states, and
at various temperatures, but no union could be effected either
of the substances or their elements.
   Very strong solution of potash was also heated with naph
thaline, and then neutralized by sulphuric acid; nothing more

called, though merely the termination of the raphe, affords a
less certain character, for in many plants it is hardly visible
on the inner surface of the testa, but is intimately united with
the areola of insertion of the inner membrane or of the nu
cleus, to one or other of which it then seems entirely to belong.
 In those cases where the testa agrees in direction with the
nucleus, I am not acquainted with any character by which it
 can be absolutely distinguished from the inner membrane in
 the ripe seed; but as a                 #.

most coat of the seed. But in a few plants an additional coat,
apparently originating in the inner membrane of Grew, the
vesicula colliquamenti or amnios of Malpighi also exists.
    In general the amnios, after fecundation, gradually en
larges, till at length it displaces or absorbs the whole substance
of the nucleus, containing in the ripe seed both the embryo
and albumen, where the latter continues to exist. In such

changes consequent to real, or even to spurious fecundation,
must take place within the nucleus; and that the albumen,
properly so called, may be formed either, by a deposition or
secretion of granular matter in the utriculi of the amnios, or
in those of the nucleus itself; or lastly, that two substances
having these distinct origins, and very different textures, may
co-exist in the ripe seed, as is probably the case in Scitamineae.
   On the subject of the ovulum, as contained in an ovarium,
I shall at present make but one other remark, which forms a
necessary introduction to the observations that follow.

   That the apex of the nucleus is the point of the ovulum
where impregnation takes place, is at least highly probable,
both from the constancy in the appearance of the embryo at
that point, and from the very general inversion of the nucleus;

     which the outer scale is the style.        But this, according to Sir
     James Smith      *,  was also Linnaeus's opinion; and it is the
    view   adopted   in Mr. Lambert's splendid monograph of the
    genus published in 1803.
        In the same year in which Mr. Lambert's work appeared,
    Schkuhrf describes, and very distinctly figures, the female
    flower of Pinus, exactly as it was understood by Trew, whose
    opinion was probably unknown to him.

    published f, in which an account of structure is given, in no
    important particular different from that of Trew and Schkuhr,
    with whose observations he appears to have been unacquainted.
        M. Mirbel, in 1809 $, held the same opinion both with re
    spect to Pinus and to the whole natural family. But in 1812,

4.18              Mr. Robert Brown                     on the Structure                    of the
   To   the earliest of the opinions here quoted, that which con
siders the female flower of Coniferae and Cycadeae as a naked
pistillum, there are two principal objections. The first of these
arises from the perforation of the pistillum, and the exposure
of that point of the ovulum where the embryo is formed to the
direct action of the pollen; the second, from the too great
simplicity of structure of the supposed ovulum, which,          have                                     I
 shown, accords better with that of the nucleus as existing in
ordinary cases.
    To the opinions of MM. Richard and Mirbel, the first ob
jection does not apply; but the second requires such additional
 weight, as to render those opinions much less probable, it
 seems to me, than that which I have endeavoured to support.
    In supposing the correctness of this opinion to be admitted,
 a question connected with        and            it,
                                           some importance, wouldof
still remain, namely, whether         Cycadeae and Coniferae the

  mia, the resemblance between the male and female spadices is
  so great, that if the female be analogous to an ovarium, the
 partial male spadix must be considered as a single anthera,
 producing on              its
                       surface either naked grains           pollen,      pol          of                  or

               The observations in the passage from Trinidad to Jamaica,
            indicate a general set of the surface-water across the Caribbean.
            sea towards the Gulf of Mexico, averaging about sixteen miles
            in each twenty-four hours. The northerly inflexion, on ap--
            proaching Jamaica, was occasioned by the indraft between
                                                        -

               From Jamaica to the Havannah the Pheasant was engaged
            in conducting a convoy, which obliged a suspension of the
            observations.                                                  -
               In crossing the Caribbean sea from Trinidad to Jamaica, be-,
            tween the 9th and 17th of October, the temperature of the sur
            face-water, observed always at 8 A.M., and occasionally at other
            hours, was never less than 82°8, nor more than 83°; between
            Jamaica and Grand Cayman, on the 10th and 11th of No
            vember, the minimum was 83°, and the maximum at 3 P.M.,
            83°-8; from the Cayman Islands to the entrance into the Gulf
            of Mexico, between Yucatan and Cuba, and in the open part
            of the Gulf itself, the surface varied from 82° to 82°5 *; but
                                                                          On

            on each day; no effect of the river, however, on the state of the aqueous
            vapour was perceptible; the point of deposition varied only between 72°5
            and 74°, and the air between 79° and 82°, the higher temperatures of
            both taking place when we had arrived abreast of Surinam, and the sur
            face water had increased to 83°.     In the Gulf of Paria, where the general
            temperature of the surface is raised to 84°5, by the admixture of the heated
            water from the smaller branches of the Orinoco, the air was further aug
            mented to 849, and the point of deposition to 75°.5       Between Point Ga
            leotta and Port Spain, we crossed the stream of one of the branches of
            the Orinoco, the temperature of which was 85°-5, and the specific gravity
            not more than 1:0064; the general surface of the Gulf being 1-0204.
               * The particular observations were as follows, and are accompanied by
            the temperatures of the air, and of the point of deposition, observed at the

                 Havannah, on the morning of the 18th, we
were apprised, by the colder temperature of 80°-5, that during
the preceding night we had entered the current, which de
scends from the northern shores of the Gülf of Mexico along
the coast of Florida; and forms the head of the gulf-stream.
In the subsequent passage from Havannah to the Straits of
Bahama, on the 27th, 28th, and 29th of November, we crossed
                                                                                                                             485
the narrow sea formed by the northern shore of Cuba and
the Florida reefs, in which the waters of the stream are com
prised, previously to their discharge into the Atlantic: the
surface-water in this passage varied from 80°-5 to 80°-7, which
may therefore be considered as the initial temperature of the
gulf-stream towards the end of November. The strait be
tween the Bahamas and the eastern side of Florida, which
forms the outlet of the stream, is rather less than 200 miles
in length, and from 33 miles at the narrowest part of the
water-way, to 50 miles at the widest, in breadth. The Phea
sant was at the southern extremity of the strait at noon on the
29th, and at the northern extremity at noon on the 30th, with
    The light rain which fell on the afternoon of the 14th of November, in
the passage between Jamaica and Havannah, was a precipitation from an

4.38                 Capt. Sabine on the Gulf-stream, &c.
the Pheasant's gangway, where the height of the eye was 15
feet 3 inches above the sea, was 4'56"-6, being an excess of
1' 05".6 above the usual computed and tabular depression.
   On repeating the observations at noon, it was found that a
change of great magnitude had taken place intermediately;
  the horizon, viewed from the same height, making an angle
 on the second occasion, of only 3' 36"-6 with the horizontal
  line passing through the eye. As the ship was in both                                in
  stances very steady, and the horizons perfectly clear, the ob
  servations were decided and certain; and the utmost error of
  which either might be suspected could not be more than 5".
  So great an alteration in the refractive quality of the atmo
  sphere led to the immediate suspicion, that the temperature
  of the surface-water of the sea must also have greatly altered,
  and that we must have passed from the warm water of the
 stream into the colder surface of the general ocean. This
  suspicion was confirmed on trial, the temperature having fallen
  from 74° at 10 A.M. to 62°4 at noon, being a difference of
  11°-6.     As a measure of precaution on such a sudden and
  great decrease, Captain Clavering immediately sounded, but
  had no bottom with 120 fathoms: the temperature at 110 fa
...thoms, indicated by a register-thermometer attached to the
  line above the lead, was 51°5.        The distance from the nearest
  banks noticed in the charts was       sixty-five  miles.
     The northern boundary of the stream, where we had thus
  quitted     it,was between the latitudes         36° 26' and 36° 38',

                                          to                 the averageat

sultante de toutes les forces qui animent chaque molécule de la

Cél. Liv. 3". No. 22. Having now described accurately the
received theory of the equilibrium of a homogeneous fluid,                                                     I
have next to add, that I found it defective and insufficient.
The defect arises from neglecting to consider the level strata
in the interior of the mass. These strata are derived from
the equation of the outer surface in the same manner in a
homogeneous fluid as in one of variable density. . Their ma
thematical definition is the same in both cases, although the
physical distinction arising from difference of density which
obtains in one case is lost in the other. They are not more
arbitrary when the fluid is homogeneous than when            density                               its
varies from one stratum          another. Viewing the matter
                                              to                                                               in
this light,  supplied the defect
             I                          the received theory  of two                                      in
different  ways:  First,    the      by
                                 principle that every level stratum
attracts    particle
             a           the inside with equal force
                                in                         opposite                           in
directions: Secondly,                  by
                              this other principle      theorem,                         or                   If
a   homogeneous  fluid body revolving about       aris,        equili          an             be   in
brio    bythe attraction        particles
                                     of      its
                                            the inverse proportion in
of the square      of
                   the distance; any other mass         the same fluid              of
having   a  similar figure and revolving with the same rotatory
velocity about      aris similarly placed, will likewise
                     an                                         equi                           be    in
librio, supposing that               its
                             particles attract one another         the                                   by
same law.
    The second principle         susceptible
                                       is             very clear demon of  a
 stration,    which
             to            objection
                             no       can      made.        we take any
                                                                  be                If
 two  particles placed   alike     the two  bodies,
                                             in       the attractive and
 centrifugal forces will have the same invariable proportion;
 namely, that      of
                   the linear dimensions                           of
                                                 the bodies. Thus the
forces that act upon the particles             one body, are  of    aug                              all
 mented,      all diminished,
             or                       the same constant ratio
                                                   in                 the                                in
other body; wherefore           therean if

there must likewise             be

                                                                   in

                                       of the Equilibrium of Fluids.                                            44.1
is the attraction of the stratum upon the interior matter.           Now
it is a mathematical property of the level surfaces, that the
gravitation at any such surface causes an exterior level stra
tum in contact with it to press perpendicularly upon the in
terior fluid; whence it follows that the attraction of the ex
terior matter upon the interior fluid must likewise cause a
pressure perpendicular to the separating surface. The interior
fluid must therefore be in equilibrio by the attraction of the
exterior stratum; which can happen only because every par
ticle of the interior fluid is urged equally in opposite directions
by the attraction of the stratum.         It will be allowed that the
equilibrium in question is a necessary consequence of the
cause assigned; and when we consider that any particle within
the stratum, is on every side urged outward by the attraction,
it seems impossible not to admit the soundness of the principle.
It must be recollected that, in this, we are here speaking    all
only         homogeneous fluid; and we may even confine our

nounce positively, that the above distinction is universally true.
Possibly there may exist certain equations, perhaps partially
indefinite, which may contain in their solutions functions par
tially arbitrary, or arbitrary between certain limits; but I con
fess   Ido not know of any such.
    Though Mr. Babbage and others have solved several equa
tions, both simple and porismatic, I do not know that this
essential line of distinction has occurred to any of them.     As
a proof, however, of the importance of well understanding the
difference between these two species of equations, I may ob
serve, that notwithstanding their solutions are obtained by
means so very similar, yet the solution of neither species, as
 it appears to me, contains nor is contained in that of the other.
 For example (2), which is the solution of (1) when        far are                                      fr,
indefinite, neither contains nor is contained in the solution of
the same (1), when this equation is limited to the conditions
of possibility, namely fr..fx w = 1 and far = —                                                       fr.faa.

  P.   S. Since writing the above, I have turned my attention
to the solutions of non periodical functional equations and
other subjects connected with them; in which, with the help
of an improved notation,         I
                               have met with a degree of success
beyond what my most sanguine expectations could have an
ticipated.   Indeed, if the views which have opened to me,
should turn out as prolific as they seem to promise to be, they
will entirely new face most of the instruments of analysis, and
will leave but little to desire except the perfection of common
algebra.

     Sir,                                                                       -

   is generally admitted, that the present
           to the               of electricity
                        phaenomena
                                                     state of knowledge
                                                        is enveloped in
much obscurity; and perhaps no instance of electrical action
manifests our ignorance of this branch of science more, than
that of igniting gunpowder.         Yet, so little notice is taken of
this isolated  fact, that no   satisfactory  attempt at explanation,
 º
that   I am aware of has ever appeared in the pages of any
writer on this subject.
    That gunpowder has frequently, by various individuals, been
          by the electric fluid, is a truth that cannot be denied.
   ut why those experimenters happened to succeed, and why
others so frequently and still more constantly fail, are cir
cumstances the cause of which has hitherto been left unex
plained,—perhaps not understood.            I am well convinced that
no individual    experimenter    has been more embarrassed than
myself, by fruitless attempts to ignite gunpowder by the elec
tric fluid; and although I have varied the experiment accord
ing to      all
             the directions     could either read
                                I                       or

 candidly confess that    I never succeeded        by

    Fruitless    these experiments were with respect

446              Mr. Sturgeon          on the Ignition        of Gunpowder
 is very trifling, when compared to that which is heard by a
 similar discharge through metal.          Convinced by this circum
 stance that the nature of the discharge is modified in a pecu
 liar manner by passing the fluid through water; yet, as I had
 never succeeded in igniting gunpowder by a discharge through
 the aqueous medium, it appeared evident that
 than this fact was      necessary    to be understood.
                                                                     more
                                                                therefore
                                                                           ºff.
                                                                             I
became desirous to ascertain, if possible, the real cause why
 other experimenters succeeded, and why every attempt that                                        I
 had made proved unsuccessful.
    It is well known, that if a red-hot iron be applied to gun
 powder, the latter does not immediately ignite, but that some
 interval of time (however small) does certainly elapse before
 one single grain is on fire: and that it is possible for a red
 hot iron to be passed over the hand with such velocity, as to
 produce scarcely any sensation of heat.            Hence my first ob
ject, now, was to devise some means of retarding the velocity
 of the electric fluid : for I considered that if this could be ac
 complished, more time would be afforded for the fluid and
 gunpowder to be in contact, and the latter, in consequence,
 more likely to be ignited.
   I  likewise supposed that if the electric fluid be retarded by
 being transmitted through water, it was likely that a jar would
 not be quite discharged by a very sudden contact; as it was
probable that if the discharging rod was quickly withdrawn
 from the knob of the jar, that the whole of the fluid would
 not have time to make            escape.   its
                                             But several trials        this              in
 way, through       large tub
                      a              water, seemed
                                             of           discharge theto
jar effectually
       as                  as
                          the whole circuit had been
                                if                           metal.         of
    Although these experiments were                       by     no
                                                     means satisfactory,
 yet
   I     always observed that the report was much feebler, and
 that   gunpowder     placed      the circuit was not blown
                                            in                       scat               or
 tered      to   so
                great     distance, when the discharge was made

                                        a
 through metal.       Hence      was obvious, that the force had by
                                        it
                                                     of by

 change       the
             in    physical   character       the electric fluid,      was              I
 at that time unable             to
                            determine.
    Some time afterwards,

                                   idea suggested, that       the electric  if
fluid       be
            retarded            at    all
                                    passing through water, perhaps
 the water possesses this property          consequence

 conductors; and         so, the velocity

4.48              Mr. Sturgeon        on the     Ignition          of Gunpowder
jars, which for distinction we will call A and B. I charged
 A positively, and B negatively; and connected their outsides
 by water.    On exploding A into B, through water, both jars
 became neutralized.      A was again charged positively, and af
 terwards   partly discharged    through water into B. On dis
 charging both jars separately, there appeared no difference in
 the explosions.     A was once more charged positively, and
 again partly discharged through water into B. On discharging
 B through a moistened thread, gunpowder was ignited in the
 circuit. These experiments were reversed, by charging the
jar A with negative instead of positive electricity, and the re
 sults were similar. , Hence I concluded, that the ignition of
gunpowder by the electric fluid depends on the time occupied
by the latter in passing through           and not         it,

to be useful; for it may be administered to any particular part
of the body without affecting any other part.      It may be ap
plied to the skin of the most delicate patient;   and without the
least danger of giving a shock, a most powerful stream of
electricity may be poured on the part affected.
   It has been also ascertained, that the force of an electric dis
charge through metal, is always proportioned to the thickness
of the wire through which it is transmitted; or, that                                the same
quantity and intensity of electric fluid acts with a greater force
when transmitted through a thick, than through a thin wire.
                                                                            iº,
    This law of course has a limit; for if the conducting wire
be sufficiently stout or capacious to transmit the fluid without
interruption, a wire of larger dimensions can give no more
facility to the transmission.         I am of opinion,                  that
thick wire facilitates the transmission of the electric fluid to a
greater degree than is generally suspected.                    -
    Now it is evident, that as thin wire has the property of                                       di
minishing the intensity of an electrical discharge, the fluid
during    its
            transmission through such             wire must necessarily

and stouter wire, and a smaller charge, the ignition might
not take place); but because, if it could be proved by experi
ment that the electric fluid would, by intervening capacious
 good conductors, ignite gunpowder at the negative, and not
 at the positive side of the moistened thread, such experiment
 would prove to demonstration the truth     -      of the Franklinian
 hypothesis.
     I  am well convinced that if the electric fluid ever passed
 the    gunpowder     without interruption, the latter could not be
 ignited by any recoil of the fluid into the jar from the inter
 rupting moistened thread; because, if ever it passed through
 the gunpowder with violence, it would scatter, or blow the
 latter substance away, so that none would remain in the cir
 cuit to be ignited at the time of the fluid's return.
     Several experiments on the ignition of gunpowder by the
 electric fluid were exhibited, and demonstrated on the fore
 going principles, in a lecture which         I had the honour to de
 liver before the members of the Western Literary and Scien
 tific Institution, on Monday evening last (May 8th) in the
 Concert Room, King's Theatre, Haymarket.                In one experi
 ment the gunpowder was ignited at one extremity of the moist
 ened thread; and in another experiment four guns were fired
 in the same circuit.        I have frequently fired six guns by one
  discharge of a jar; and so instantaneous is the ignition at the
  several guns, that their united reports appear like the report
  of one gun only.                     -                               -
     I  am at present engaged in other experiments on this branch
  of electricity, and shall not fail to communicate to the public
  the results of such as appear worthy of notice.

    Read also, a paper by the Secretary, J. E. Bicheno, Esq., On
Methods and Systems in Natural History; wherein the author
endeavoured to show the different uses to which they should
respectively be applied.       The chief object of the Artificial
system, he insisted, was to analyse; that of the Natural system,
to synthesise.      The business of the one is to enable us to as
certain particulars; and of the other, to combine those parti
culars so as to assist the mind to reason generally.      Systema
tists in general, he contended, have confounded these two        di
stinct objects, and have attempted to employ their natural
systems equally with a view to determine species as to com
bine them, while their chief object should have been to find
resemblances and common characters. The state of science
seems to require that the work of combination should be more
studied; and that instead of breaking down the productions
of nature into the smallest particulars, we should act more
philosophically if we endeavoured to discover the common
characters of her groups, and to unite species; and thus
furnish the ordinary reader with materials of knowledge,
relieve his memory, and abridge his labour. This seems to
be the more necessary in the present day, when the num
ber of birds amounts to 5000, of insects to 100,000, and of
flowering plants to 50,000.

   May     12.-A paper, by the Astronomer Royal, was read,
containing an explanation of the method of observing with the
two mural circles, as practised at present at the Royal Obser
vatory.     The principal object of the method explained in this

paper is to diminish as much as possible the inaccuracies                                          oc
casioned, even in the most perfect instrument, by rapid and
partial changes of temperature. In the Greenwich system of
observations, assistance from the spirit-level or plumb-line, or
indeed from any previous verification, is rejected altogether.
Two circles are employed simultaneously, each of which is
 furnished with six microscopes, which it is desirable should be
placed at nearly equal distances on the limb; and previously
to observation each circle is placed nearly in the plane of the
meridian, and nearly perpendicular to the horizon.              Each cir
cle is provided with an artificial horizon of mercury, so as to
 command the greatest possible portion of the reflected meridian.
    The first part of the process consists in observing a num
ber of stars simultaneously with each instrument, either by
direct, or by reflected vision; the object of this is to determine
 the exact quantity that one instrument marks more or less
 than the other, when both are directed to the same object.
 This is determined not by a single observation, but by a great
 variety; thus obtaining the quantity denominated the mean
 difference for every 24 hours.
     In the second part of the process, a series of stars is ob
                                                                                        of is by

  There were next read Extracts of three letters addressed
by M. Gambart, Director of the Observatory of Marseilles, to
James South, Esq. respecting the discovery and elements of
the orbit of a comet, supposed to be the same with that, or
those, of 1772 and 1805. M. Gambart first presents the sum
mary of his observations of this comet from the 9th to the
21st (inclusively) of March this year.  He then exhibits the
elements as computed from these observations upon the para
bolic hypothesis: viz.

from midnight.

usual signals.
   Even as a temporary expedient, and under a rude form, viz.
that of placing tin plates at the station to be observed in such
a manner that the sun's reflection should be thrown towards
the observer at a particular time, the most essential service
was derived from            its
                            use; and the consequence was, the inven

Results   of  a Meteorological Journal for    May 1826,     kept at
     the Observatory of the IRoyal Academy,    Gosport, Hants.
                        General Observations.
    This month     has been fine and generally dry, with a long
continuance of     North and North-east winds, which brought
on hoar-frost before sunrise almost every morning till the
middle of the month. Till the 18th instant the air was re
markably dry, and for the preceding three weeks scarcel
enough rain fell to moisten the ground. This dry period,
                                                               i;
unobstructed sunshine, was the means of dust accumulating so
much on the main roads, as to render travelling uncomfortable
at this pleasant season.
    The warm showers of rain since the 18th have changed the
 appearance of the parched grass-lands to a fine green: the
 corn blades, however, retained their verdant colour through
 out the month, and look promising.        The effects of the frosts
 the latter end of last month and the first part of this, are
 visible both on the wall-fruit and other trees, and also in the
 appearance of the potato-tops in many districts, although they
 are now recoVerling.
    The mean temperature of the external air this month, is
 one degree and a half under the mean of last May, and nearly
 half a degree under the mean of that month for the last ten
 years.    But during the last few days summer appears to have
 suddenly opened upon us by an increased temperature, with
 mild and refreshing showers.
    The temperature of spring-water has increased about one
 degree this month.
      n the evening of the 21st, the Chaffers were on the wing,
 being the first time they had been seen this spring.    The same
 evening the full moon rose in a striking manner behind pur
 ple surmounted by red haze (or descending mist so tinged by
 the horizontal rays of the sun and spreading a blush on the
 twilight), which gave to her large disc a blood-red colour.
    The atmospheric and meteoric phaenomena that have come
 within our observations this month, are one anthelion at
  2 o'clock in the afternoon of the 12th, two parhelia in the
 morning of the 9th; three solar halos, five meteors, one rain
 bow, lightning in the evenings of the 1st and 10th, distant
 thunder in the afternoon of the 24th; and two gales of wind,
  one from the North, the other from North-east.
