I.  An Attempt to determine the definite and simple Propor
   tions, in which the constituent Parts of anorganic Sub
   stances are linked with each other.            By Jacob Bkrze-

£From Gilbert-s Journal, 1811, iii. . . . Translated from a copy corrected
                by the Author expressly for this Work. J
                          PART FIRST.
M k. Berthollet,          one   of the most celebrated chemists
of our times,    has endeavoured           to demonstrate, in his in
genious   researches   respecting        the  Jaws of chemical affini
ties, that  elementary   substances        may unite with each orher
in an infinite number of progressive proportions.                     Mr.
Proust, however, another great master of the science, has
shown, in opposition to him, that no such infinite variety
of progressions is to be found in nature: but that all com
pound and precisely characterized bodies exhibit only a
single and invariable proportion between their component
parts; and that. when a protoxide, for example, is con
verted by an additional portion of one of its component
parts, that is of oxygen, into an oxide, this happens per
saltum, proceeding at once to another precisely determined
proportion, so that any continued series of combinations
between these limits is out of the question.              The truth of
Proust's remark     cannot   htve     escaped any experienced che
mist : but it has not hitherto been ascertained whether
these distinct steps or stages of combination follow one
and the same law for substances of all kinds, or whether
the proportions are indeterminate, and different for different

4                     On definite Proportions.
substances.       The experiments,       which   I   shall here relate,
will prove that certain fixed laws prevail in all such cases.
   I have been ied to this investigation by attempting to de
duce from calculation the quantity of oxygen contained in
ammonia; on this occasion I discovered that the quantity
of any base, by which a certain quantity of the muriatic
acid is saturated, contains always the same quantity of
oxygen : ahhouch in reality the merit of this discovery is
due to Richter, who has endeavoured to demonstrate the
principle, in the sixth part of his Essays, by some well
imagined, though not fully satisfactory experiments, which,
have led him to adopt a series of numbers agreeing tolerably
well with each other, but by no means perfectly accurate.
The same law was observable in the sulphates, when Bu-
cholz's analysis of the sulphate of baryta was made the
basis of the calculation.       There was however some dis
agreement   in the two series ;  nor were the results consistent
•with other experiments ; and it w as necessary to take for
granted thri truth of the analysis of the muriate of silver
instituted by Hucholz and Rose.       I also found that, in the
submuriates of lead and copper, the acid is combined with
four times as much of the. base as in the neutral salts.
   I was in hopes of being able to discover the general prin•
ciple   of   these remarkable         by a correct investiga
                                relations
tion of the combinations of      variety of other similar sub
                                     a
stances.    In the mean time I received a copy of Nicholson's
Journal for November 1808, which contained an account
of Wollaston-s experiments on acid salts or supersalts,
which had been suggested by the hypothesis of Dalton,
that whm bodies are capable of being combined in different
proportions, these proportions may always be expressed by
multiply ing tlie weight of one of the bodies by 1,2, 3, 4, and
so forth: and Wollaston's experiments seemed to confirm
the hvpothesis . This view of the combinations of bodies
appeared capable of illustrating so greatly the doctrine of
affinity, that the confirmation of Dahon-s hypothesis
seemed to be the greatest step that chemistry, as a science,
would have made during the whole time of its existence,
On what experiments Dalton had founded his proposition,
and in wb^t manner he had extended its application, I am
wholly ignorant ; I cannot therefore determine whether
jny experiments simoly confirm this hypothesis in its whole
extent, or whether they have any tendency to modify it               in,
any of its parts.
   It will be proved       by   the following experiments, that
zfhen two bodies, A and         B, combine with each other in dif
                                                                ferent

    It     will further be shown, that when two bodies,                    A   and
B, have both affinities with two others,                 C    and D, the quan

                                                              are precisely in-
the same proportion         thf quantities
                                 as                      which are saturated
 by   B.ThusT-since     100  parts of lead are capable of com
bining     the first degree with 15
               in                         of sulphur and 7-8 of

oxygen,  and   100  parts   of  iron, according to the analysis
which will hereafter be related, combine in the first degree
with 58"8 of sulphur, the composition of the protoxide of
iron may he computed                       by
                                   the simple proportion 15-6:
7-8 = 58,8 29-4, so that 100 parts of iron require to be
                    :
combined with 29-4 of oxygen.           This    confirmed is  the          by
experiments   which       am   about
                               I      to communicate,     and  all
binary combinations      may   be  determined  in the  same man
ner.      has been ably demonstrated
            It                                           by
                                              Richter, that                a       si
milar principle      applicable to the combinations of salts.
                          is
    It obvious that the result of these calculations, sup
         is
posing them to be well founded, must be susceptible of
much greater accuracy and certainty than the common,
analysis.     have endeavoured to give the greatest possible
                    I
precision  to  the analyses which    shall here relate, and
                                                    I                           I
have repeated the most important of them more than once,
before    allowed myself to depend on them.
           I                                       These are
certainly free from errors of more than one or two parts in
a thousand, and the others are within at most one half per
cent, of the truth, but still only accurate enough to give
approximations in computation. Perhaps we shall never
succeed in analysing substances so accurately, as to obtain,
results agreeing with the proportions of the component
parts to the last place of decimals      on the other hand,
                                                    :                              it
will not be impossible, when we have          number of very
accurate analyses, to Correct them so                     a by a
                                              calculation, that
all the elements of the computation of combination may
afford precisely the same result.
    Ishall arrange my experiments       the order which seems
                                                    in
most convenient for the illustration of the subject, and                           I
shall totally refrain from all theorizing. How far the results
of the experiments confirm the theory, will be obvious with
out particular comment, and the ideas to which they lead
                                            A   3                               will

  will naturally occur to every attentive reader without my
  assistance.
                      I. Lead and Oxygen.
      Lead,  as is well known, affords three oxides.     In order
  to   ascertain the proportion of oxygen contained in them,,
  I  employed lead which was obtained by the reduction of
  the crystallized nitrate, and which was consequently free
  from any mixture -of copper or silver.
                      A.  Ye llow  Oxide of Lead.
      1. ) Ten grammes of lead were dissolved in pure nitric
 acid, and in order to avoid loss, the process was performed
  in a flask or receiver of glass held in an inclined position.
 The solution was poured into a weighed dish of platina,
 carefully evaporated, and exposed to a red heat. It afforded
  J.0-77 gram.mes of oxide.
     2. ) The experiment was repeated, but the evaporation
 and ignition were performed in the same vessel which
 served for the solution.        The result was 10-775 grammes
 of oxide    of lead.                                             "
     3. ) In a third experiment a flask with a long neck was
 employed.       When the salt began to be decomposed, a
 small quantity of a mealy sublimate attached itsejf for an
 instant to the neck of the vessel, and the vapours had not
 the smell of a perfectly pure nitric acid.      When the flask
had been      heated  throughout   its whole  length, the weight
of the oxidated lead amounted to 1078 grammes, or a liule
more than in the former experiments; and at the same
time an appearance had taken place in this experiment,
which showed that a small portion of the oxide of lead was
carried off- with the vapour of the acid which was expelled.
     4. ) Ten grammes of lead were dissolved in nitric acid,
and precipitated by carbonated ammonia : the precipitate
was placed on a weighed filter and well washed.                It
amounted to 12-0025 grammes of carbonated lead.               Of
this 12-77 grammes were ignited in a dish of platina; the
residuum was 10-64 gr. of yellow oxide of lead, giving
10-75 for the whole quantity; so that 100 parts of lead
had taken up 10-75 of oxygen. I conceived a suspicion
that the carbonated ammonia might not have thrown down
the whole quantity of lead ; I therefore passed sulphurated
hydrogen through the liquor of precipitation, and through
the water with which the precipitate had been washed ; but
they were not rendered turbid by it in the slightest degree.
                                                         5.) The

                     On definite Proportions..                  t
    5.) The experiment was repeated with 8 grammes of
lead, which afforded 10-32 of carbonate and 8-8 of yellow
oxide of lead ; so that 100 parts of lead had again taken up
7{   of oxygen.
    Bucholz obtained from 300 grains of lead, which were
dissolved in nitric acid, and precipitated by carbonated
alkali, 320 grains of yellow oxide of lead ; besides 4\ grains
of carbonated lead, which remained on the filter.. This last
is taken by Bucholz, as equivalent to 4 grains of the yellow
oxide: this however is an error; the carbonate of lead
loses £ of its weight, not ^ only, by ignition ; for 10
grammes of pure carbonate of lead, dried in a strong heat,
afforded me, in three different experiments, 8-35 gr. of yel
low oxide, so that we must allow only 3j grains for the
4f , and the lead in Bucholz-s experiment cannot have taken,
up more than 7-92 per cent, of oxygen.
    From these experiments I think myself authorised to
conclude, that those are the most accurate which give the
proportion of oxygen from 7-75 to 7-8 for 100 of lead.
Consequently the yellow oxide or protoxide of lead consists
of                Lead      92-764    or 100-0
                  Oxygen 7-236                 7-8
                            100-000        107-8
             B.  Red Oxide   of Lead.    Red Lead.
    Red lead, as it occurs in commerce, I have found con*
taminated with sulphate and submuriate of lead, oxide of
copper, and silica : so that little dependence can be placed
on its analysis.    It also contains much of the yellow oxide,
which gives it a brighter colour than properly belongs to
lead in this stage of oxidation.
                                                  I
    In order to get rid of the yellow oxide, digested some
levigated red lead with weak distilled vinegar, at a tempera
ture of 68°, as long as the vinegar continued to saturate
itself: by these means the yellow oxide was dissolved, while
the red remained unaltered, the colour only becoming deeper.
After washing and drying in a very strong heat, 10 grammes
of this red lead were ignited in a weighed platinadish; they
lost -29 gr.    The oxide, which had become yellow, was
now dissolved in vinegar; the sulphate of lead and silica
which were left in this process, weighed when ignited -135
gr.    To the solution in vinegar nitrate of silver was added,
and -01 gr. of muriate of silvej was precipitated, which
answers to -03 gr. of submuriate of lead; so,. that in the
whole there was -165 of foreign matter.             Consequently
                              A4                        9-835 gr.

6                 Derivation      of one of the Equations in
9-835 gr.       of red   lead had afforded -29     of oxygen and g"545
of yellow       oxide,    or 8-855 of lead, which had          been united
with -98 of oxygen.  Now 8-855 : -98 == 100 : 1 1-07 ; con
sequently 100 parts of lead, in becoming red lead, take up
11-07 of oxygen, and this oxide consists of 90 parts of lead
and 10 of oxygen.
                         C. Brown Oxide of Lead.
    Itis well known that red lead, digested with nitric acid,
affords a brown oxide of lead.     While the nitric acid dis
solves the yellow oxide and reduces a part of the red to
yellow, it leaves the brown oxide undissolved, together
with a quantity of impurities, especially sulphate of lead
and silica.
   Five grammes of brown oxide of lead, freed by washing
from all the nitrate which had adhered to       and dried in
                                                        it,
a  sand-bath,   with    heat capable of melting tin, were
                              a
ignited in   weighed dish of platina, and lost -325 gr. of
                a
oxygen.   The  remaining 4-675 gr. of yellow oxide, dis
solved in vinegar, left behind some sulphate of lead and
silica, which when ignited weighed together -13 gr.
Th» remaining 4-545 gr. of yellow oxide contain "33 gr.
of oxygen,     quantity differing only
                   a                        -005 gr. from
                                                    by by

  Dear Sir, — In  the Mecanique Celeste, vol. i. page 138,
Laplace has given an equation marked (B) which is of
great use in the theory of the figure of the celestial bodies.
To the young reader of that profound work the derivation
of the above equation may be acceptable; and) if you think
that Mr. Tilloch will allow it a place in his Magazine, it is
at his service.

  III.   Description   of a Mercurial Voltaic Conductor.          By
                    W. H. Pepys, Esq. F.R.S.*
The        advantages obtained by perfect contact in Voltaic
conductors is well known to the experimentalist,              particu
larly when the combinations or series of plates are but few.
Hence the slightest oxidation or corrosion of the wires de
stroys more than half the effect.
    Having with others noticed the complete contact which
quicksilver gives, I had an apparatus so constructed as to
unite this advantage with the facility of using the wires or
conductors in almost all the modifications that are required
in the valuable and interesting experiments of Sir H. Davy
on the electrical laws of chemical decomposition.
    This apparatus has also another claim to notice, from
the operator not being so likely to receive the charge, when
the combinations are extensive, the adjusting-sliders being
non-conductors of electricity.
    With this apparatus and a series of six troughs of ten
four-inch plates, I have decompounded              solutions of the
neutral and several of the more solid salts, such as gypsum,
chalk, and fluor spar; deflagrated charcoal, phosphorus, and
the metals ; and formed the alloys of sodium, potassium,
and ammonium with mercury.

       bent at the other may be adjusted to any heights in the

   my direction by Mr. Bate, philosophical instrument-maker,
   Poultry, London.
  IV.   On the Difference letween the Hydro- carbonated Gases
     extricated from Mineral and Animal Substances re-t
     spectively*.
  IVIessrs. Thenard          and Duptjytren, within these two
  or three years, made an experiment which has thrown
  considerable light on the existence of miasmata.                 They
  agitated distilled water with hydro-carbonated gas extri
  cated from mineral substances.            This water, exposed to
  the air and allowed to stand, was not disturbed, and gra
  dually got rid of its hydrogen gas without being corrupted.
 The same experiment made with hydro-carbonated gas
 coming from animal putrefaction presented another result.
 The water became turbid, it contained flakes of a substance
 truly animal, which was precipitated on being allowed to
 rest, and the liquid was putrefied.         Thus, although the gas
 was the same to the eyes of the experimenter, the latter
 contained manifestly miasmata which gave rise to the flakes
 observed, and to the putrefaction of the water.
    M. Mos-cati, an eminent Italian physician, has made
similar and equally interesting experiments.                Having ob
 served that the cultivation of rice in the humid rice grounds
of Tuscany was annually attended with epidemic diseases
and adynamic fevers, he conceived the idea of ascertaining
the nature of the vapours which rose from the ground where
rice was cultivated : with this view he suspended at some
distance from the ground hollow spheres filled with ice.
The vapours were condensed on the spheres in the form of
hoar frost. He collected this substance in flasks, in which
it melted and at first presented a clear liquid. Speedily it
was filled with small flakes, which when collected and ana-.

The liquid in     a short
                        time putrefied.  M. Moscati made
the same experiment in an hospital, by suspending the
glass spheres over several sick persons : it was attended
with the same phaenomena and the same results.       These
experiments ought to be repeated and followed up : they
might be varied, multiplied, and compared, with a view to
elucidate the theory of contagion which takes place without
immediate contact.     In this way we might also examine
the alteration which miasmata undergo, when the nitric or
muriatic fumigations are resorted to*

yet, so far as I know, been examined by any person.
    Nevertheless,    if we admit that comparative anatomy on
the one hand has greatly contributed      to the advancement
of physiology, we shall perhaps also ascertain that com
parative chemistry may, on the other hand, be made con
ducive to this science.
    Already has the urine of birds furnished results suffi
ciently interesting and unexpected to induce chemists to
prosecute their experiments among all classes of animals
which furnish this liquid, that they may not in future en
tirely rely on analogy.      With this view I have analysed
the urine of the royal tiger, the lion, and the beaver; the
 results of which I subjoin, intending to extend my experi
ments to other animals.
    The urines of the lion and tiger are perfectly similar:
 they have also some resemblance to that of man, but they
 differ in some essential points.
     First difference: they are alkaline, even at the instant of
 being voided ; the urine of a man in health                 is,
                                                    on the con
 trary, always acid.
     It    to the presence of the ammonia developed
          is                                               these   in
 urines that we ought to ascribe the strong and disagreeable
 •mell which they diffuse, even when in the act of issuing
 from the bladder of this class of animals.

 T8 Comparative       Analysis of the Urine    of various Animals.
,   Second difference : they do not contain any uric acid,
  nor any combination of this acid with the alkalis. At least,
  there was no sensible trace when the experiment was Jour
  times repeated.
     The defect of uric acid in these urines was the more re
  markable, as I used to ascribe its formation to animal food.
     The third difference exhibited by the urine of the lion
  and the royal tiger from that of man, was the almost total
  absence of phosphate of lime.
     This is what might be naturally expected, since this salt
  cannot be dissolved in water except by means of a super
  abundance of acid, and the urine in question is on the
  contrary alkaline.
     It would nevertheless      seem that the kidneys of these
  animals     separate a certain quantity of this salt from the
  blood; fori found slight traces of it in these urines ;
  and ammonia is formed in the bladder only, where pro-
  bablv it precipitates phosphate of lime: and this is without
  doubt the reason that the urine of these animals issues
  from the bladder almost always in a turbrd state.
     If according to this we ever find calculi in the bladders
  of these animals, they can be formed of phosphate of lime
  only, since this is the only insoluble substance they contain.
     Fourth difference : the urines of the lion and the tiger
  contain but an infinitely small quantity of muriate of soda ;
  whereas that of men generally exhibits a great deal.
     We find in these urines a great quantity of urea very
  much disposed to crystallization, and in general a little co
  loured ; phosphates of soda and ammonia, sulphate of
  potash, a mucous matter, and a trace of iron.
     The above are the points in which the urines of the lion
  and royal tiger resemble that of man ; but they differ, as has
  been shown, in a sufficient number of points to warrant us
  in forming    a particular species.   It is composed   as follows  :
           l/Urea.
           2. Animal mucus.
           3. Phosphate of soda.
           4. Phosphate of ammonia.
         . .5. Muriate of ammonia.
           6. A trace of phosphate of lime.
           7. Sulphate ot potash in a large quantity.
           8. An atom of muriate of soda.
                         Urine of the  Beaver.
     A  careful analysis several   times repeated   of the urine of
                                                                  the

    Comparative         Analysis   of the Urine of various Animals.                       19
the beaver, proved that it lias a great resemblance to the
urine of the common herbivorous animals.
   In fact, we there find carbonate of lime kept in solution,
by a superabundance of carbonic acid: benzoic and acetic
acids, urea, muriate of soda and sulphate of potash; and
we meet with no uric acid in                it,
                                    or phosphoric salts.
   Nevertheless    differs in so far as    contains no muriate
-
                         it                               it
of ammonia, and as possessing          considerable quantity of
                                                  a
carbonate and acetate of magnesia, which          not found, at    is
least in   agreat quantity, in the urine of    herbivorous ani
mals.
I    discovered the carbonate of magnesia in the following
manner    :
   After" having concentrated                   by
                                           gentle heata    certain           a
quantity   of this   urine,   decanted
                                   I     the  liquor,  and washed
with distilled water the vessel to the sides of which the
carbonate of lime adhered.          afterwards passed sulphuric
                                        I
acid into     diluted with water, which produced
              it                                            frothy               a
effervescence on account of       mucous matter which carries
                                        a
off with    the carbonate of lime.
              it
   Perceiving that the sulphuric acid had acquired           bitter              a
taste from this combination,      dried I and   calcined the mix
ture, then    washed
               ]          with little water, and obtained
                              it        a                               I                   by
the evaporation of the latter,       salt which had all the pro
                                            a
perties of sulphate of magnesia.
   Wishing to ascertain bv another experiment,    there was                 if
muriate of ammonia in the urine of the beaver, as well as
in that of other herbivorous animals,    put into   portion
                                                          I                  a
of this thickened liquor piece of caustic potash and as
                                    a                                            ;
the odour of the ammonia was not perceived even with
the aid of heat,       concluded that
                          I                did not contain any
                                                      it
muriate of ammonia but         :  phaenomenon was exhibited
                                        a
which astonished me, and which excited              desire to ex    a
amine the cause of it. The liquor went into           gelatincuis-      a
like mass suspecting that this effect was produced
               :                                               the                   by
precipitation of some earthy substance,       treated the wholeI
of the thickened urine which            possessed with caustic
                                                I
 potash   ;I filtered the liquor in order to obtain the matter
in  question     and after having washed and calcined
                   ;                                                                  it, I
combined         with sulphuric acid diluted with water, and
                   it
obtained sulphate of magnesia mixed with          little sulphate  a
of lime.
   Although    have announced that the urine of the beaver
                   I
contains acetate of magnesia, yet am not perfectly cerI
tain of     in fact,
              it
               :       may be possible that during the eva

                                                      a                          a

20              Olservations on the Measurement          of
quantity of acetic acid may         be formed, and the latter may
have acted on the carbonate of magnesia left in the liquor,
on account of its solubility being greater than that of the
carbonate of lime.
   We generally ascertain by the colour, smell and taste,
and above all by the property which the urine of the beaver
possesses of staining alumed cloths, the kind of vegetables
on which the animal feeds.
   In the urine of the animal which I made the subject of
my experiment, I distinguished evident marks of the co
louring matter of willow bark, and its keeper confirmed
the observation.
   There seem to be cases, therefore, in which certain vege
table substances may pass through the digestive organs,
and the circulation, without entirely losing the properties
which distinguish them in their natural state.
    I also found in the urine of the beaver a quantity of
iron, which at first astonished me ; but having reflected
that it had been collected in a tinned iron vessel, and that
it contained carbonic acid, I thought that the greater quan
tity of this metal proceeded from the vessel.
   The urine of the beaver is therefore composed of,
       1. Urea.
       2.  Animal mucus.
       3. Benzoate      of potash.
       4.  Carbonate of lime and magnesia.
       5.  Acetate of magnesia (doubtful).                             •
       6.  Sulphate of potash.
       7.  Muriate of potash or of soda.
       8. Vegetable colouring matter.
       9. Lastly, a little iron.
VI.    Observations on the Measurement            of three Degrees of
    the Meridian conducted in England by Lieut. -Colonel

    F.R.S.*
The       determination of the figure and magnitude of the
 earth  has   at all times excited the curiosity of mankind, and
 the history of the several attempts made by astronomers to
 solve this problem might be traced to the most remote an
tiquity.     But the details of the methods pursued by the
ancients on this subject being extremely vague, and their
           * From the Philosophical Transactions for 1812, part ii.
                                                                    results

                  three Degrees of the Meridian.             21
results expressed in measures of which we do not know
the relation to our own, in fact give us very little assistance
in learning either the figure or dimensions of our globe.
    It was not till the revival of science in Europe that the
two great philosophers Huyghens and Newton first en
gaged in the consideration of this question, and reduced to
the known laws of mechanics the principles on which the
figure of the earth should be determined.
    They demonstrated that the rotatory motion should oc
casion differences in the force of gravity in different lati
tudes, and consequently that parts of the earth in the neigh
bourhood of the equator should be more elevated than
those near the poles.
    The most, simple hypothesis, which first presented itself
to their imagination, was that which supposed" the earth
to be throughout composed of the same kind of matter,
and its surface that of a spheroid generated by revolution
round its axis.      This hypothesis, adapted by Newton only
as an approximation to the truth, is, in fact, perfectly con
sistent with the equilibrium to which particles in a state of
paste, or of tardy fluidity, would arrive in a short time
after their present motion was impressed; and the eccen
tricity derived from this hypothesis is at least not very
 remote from that which actually obtains in the present state
of consistence and stability which the earth has since ac
 quired.
    But the homogeneity of the matter of which the earth
 consists, is at variance with all geological observations,
 which prove evidently that at least 5000 toises of the ex
 terior crust is formed of an immense mass of heterogeneous
 matters varying in density from each other; and upon the
 supposition of a state of fluidity of the whole, it should
 follow that the strata should successively increase in den
 sity from the surface towards the centre, that the more
 dense would accordingly be subjected to less of centrifugal
 force, and consequently that the spheroidical form resulting
 from this cause would be less eccentric than would arise
 from a state of perfect homogeneity.
     The most simple as well as the most effectual means of
 verifying the hypothesis respecting the figure of the earth,
 is to measure in the two hemispheres several arcs of its
 meridians in different latitudes, at some distance from each
 other.    On this subject it must be allowed, that the Aca
 demy of Sciences at Paris set the example, in giving the
 original impulse to the undertaking, and not only com-
                               B  3                    menced.

22          Observations    on the Measurement  of
menced, but put in execution, those parts of the plan which
were most difficult and most decisive.
   The results of the first measurements made of different
arcs on the meridian of different parts of the world, Were
found to be perfectly conformable to the expectations of
Huyghens and of Newton, and also with experiments made
on the vibration of the pendulum in different latitudes;
and they left no doubt that the earth was in fact flattened
at the poles ; establishing thereby one point extremely in
teresting in natural philosophy.
   These results, however, did not correspond with suffi
cient accuracy for ascertaining with precision the degree
of eccentricitv, or even the general dimensions of the earth,
as might naturally be expected when we consider the ne
cessary imperfection of the means then employed in these
operations, and the great difficulties that are to be encoun
tered*
   For the purpose of making a nearer approximation to
the true dimensions of the earth, and of verifying former
measurements, it is necessary iti some instances to repeat
them, arid also to make others in different situations, which
may he expected to be improved in proportion to the pro
gress that is made in the means of perfecting the several
departments of science.
   At the commencement of the French revolution, men of
science took advantage of the general impulse which the
human mind received in favour of every species of inno
vation, or change, and they proposed making a new mea
surement of an arc of lite meridian in France, for the pur
pose of establishing a new svstem of weights and measures,
which should be permanent., as being founded on the na
ture of things.
   A commission, composed of some of the most distin
guished members of the Academy of Sciences, was charged
to form the plan of these operations, which were to serve
as the basis of the new system.        They invented new in
struments, riew meth      .ds, new formulae, and in shott al
most thi whole of this important" undertaking consisted of
something new in science.              ,
   Two celebrated astronomers, Delamhre and Mechain,
were engaged to perform the astronomical and geodetical
observations, and these thev continued as far as Barcelona
jn Spain.    The details of their operations, observations,
and calculations, were subsequently examined by a com
mittee   of men of science, many of whom were foreigners
                                                      collected'

                 three Degrees  of the Meridian.              2*
 collected at Paris, who confirmed their results, and, by the
 sanction of such an union of talents, gave such a degree;
 of credit and authenticity to their conclusions as could
 scarcely be ac quired by other mean*.
    Since that time, in the year 1806, Messrs. Biot and Arago,
members of the National Institute, were sent into Spain for
 the express purpose of carrying on the same course of ope
 rations still further southward, from Barcelona as far a«
Formentera, the southernmost of the Balearic islands. Fori
 tunately this last undertaking, which forms a most satis-
factory supplement to the former, was completed by the
month of May 1808, at a period when political circum
 stances would not admit of any further operations being
 pursued, as a means of verifying the results, by measuring
 a base which should bs independent of those formerly ob
tained in France.
    In the year 1801, the Swedish Academy of Sciences,
encouraged by the success of the operations conducted in
France, sent also three, of its members into Lapland, to
verify their former measurement taken in 1736, by new
 methods, and bv the use of new instruments siniilar tq
 those   which had recently been used in France, and of
 which the National Institute made a handsome present to
 the Swedish Academy.        The results of this new imdet>
 taking, which terminated in 1803, were drawn up by M.
 Svanberg, and are highly interesting, by their exactness,
 by the perspicuity   of the details, and even  a certain degree
 of noveltv given to   the subject by the arrangement    adopted
 by the learned author    M. Svanberg.
    These new measures were found to confirm, in a remark
 able manner, the general results of those which had pre
 ceded, and gave very nearly the same proportion for the
 eccentricity and other dimensions of the globe, so that
 there would not have remained the smallest doubt respect
 ing the figure of the earth being flattened at the poles, had
  there not been a fourth measurement performed in England
 at the same time as that undertaken in Lapland, the results
 of which were entirely the reverse. This measurement)
 which comprised an arc of 2° 50', was undertaken by Lieut.
 Col. Mudge, Fellow of the Royal Society, with instruments
<U+2666>of the most perfect construction that had ever yet been
 finished by any artist, contrived and executed for that ex
 press purpose by the celebrated Ramsden.         The detads of
 the observations and other operations of Lieut. Col, Mudge
 may beseen in the volume of the Philosophical Transactions
  for the year 1S03 ; and one cannot but .admire the beauty
                                B  4                         and

24           Observations on ike Measurement       of
and perfection of the instruments employed by that skilful
observer, as well as the scrupulous care bestowed on every
part of the service in which he was engaged.               Bengal
lights  were   employed      on this occasion   as objects  at the
several stations, and their position appears to have been de
termined with the utmost precision by the theodolite of
Ramstfen, which reduces all angles to the plane of the
horizon, and with such a degree of correctness, that the
error in the sum of the three angles of any triangle is
scarcelv, in any instance, found to exceed three seconds of
a degree, and in general not more than a small fraction of
a second.
   Accordingly the geodetical observations were conducted
with a degree of exactness which hardly can be exceeded ;
and even if we suppose for a moment, that the chains made
use of in the measurement of the bases may not admit of
equal precision with the rods of platina employed in France ;
nevertheless, the degree of care employed in their construc
tion, in the mode of using them, and the pains taken to
verify their measures, was such, that no error that can have
occurred in the length of the base could make any per
ceptible difference in the sides of the series of triangles, of
.which the whole extent does not amount to so much as
three degrees.
   Nevertheless, the results deduced by the author, from
this measure alone, would lead to the supposition that the
earth, instead of being flattened at the poles, is in fact more
elevated at that part than at, the equator, or at least that its
surface is not that of a regular solid.         For the measures
of different degrees on the meridian, as reduced by Lieut.
 Col. Mudge, increase progressively toward the equator.
   The following table of the different measures of a degree
in fathoms is given by the author in his memoir.

   The singularity of these results excites a suspicion of
 some incorrectness in the observations themselves, or in
the method of calculating from them.          The author has not
informed    us in his  memoir,    what  were  the formulae which
                                                                he

he employed in the computations of the meridian ; but one
sees, by the arrangement of his materials, that he made use
of the method of the perpendiculars without regard to the
convergence of the meridians ; and although this method
is not rigorously exact, it can make but a very few fathoms
more in the total arc, and will have very little effect on the
magnitude of each degree.        It is therefore a more probable
supposition, that, if any errors exist, they have occurred in
the astronomical observations.        But it is scarcely possible
to determine the amoupt of the errors, or in what part of
the arc they may have occurred, excepting by direct and
rigorous computation of the geodetical measurement.               I
have therefore been obliged to have recourse to calculations,
which I have conducted according to the method and for
mulas invented and published by M. Delambre.
   The means generally emploved for finding the extent of
a degree of the meridian, consists in dividing the length of
the total arc in fathoms, by the number of degrees and
parts of a degree deduced from observations of the stars:
but if these observations are affected by any error, arising
from unsteadiness of the instrument, from partial attrac
tions, or from any other accidental causes, then the degrees
 of the meridian will be affected, without a possibility of
discovering such an error in this mode of operating.          It is
 consequently necessary,      in  such   a case, to employ some
 other method, which may serve as a means of verifying the
observations themselves, of detecting their errors, if there
 be any, or at least of showing their probable limits.
    My object therefore is to communicate the result of cal
 culations that I have made, from the data published by
 Lieut. Col. Mudge in the Philosophical Transactions ; and
 I hope to make it appear, that the magnitude of a degree
 of the meridian, corresponding to the mean latitude of the
Vrc measured by this skilful observer, corresponds very ex
 actly with the results of those other measurements that
 have been above noticed.
    In M. Delambre-s method nothing is wanting but the
 spherical angles, that is to say, the horizontal angles ob
 served, corrected for spherical error.         Moreover, for our
 purpose, we have no occasion for the numerical value of the
 sides of the series of triangles, but only for their logarithms.
 Thus the logarithm of the base measured at Clifton, as an
 arc, gives us that of its sine in feet or in fathoms, so that
 by means of this latter logarithm, and the spherical angles
 of the .series of triangles, we obtain at once, and as easily as

  26            Observations on the Measurement      of
  in plane trigonometry, the logarithms of the sines of all
  their sides in fathoms;
     After this, it is extremely easv to convert them into lo
  garithms of chords or of arcs, for the purpose of applying
  them to the. computation of the arcs on the meridian or
 azimuths.       I give the preference to taking the logarithms
 of the sides     as arcs-, because the computations     become in
 that case much more simple and expedition*.
     Near to Clifton, which is the northern extremity of the
 arc, in a situation elevated 35 feet above the level of the
 sea, a base was measured of 26342,7 feet in length, the
 chains being supposed at the temperature of 62° Fahrenheit,
 or   13-i-0 Reaumur.
     For reducing this base to toises, we have the proportion
 of the English foot to that of France, a3 4 : 4,26-3, so that
 if p be taken to express the fractional- part of the French
 foot, corresponding        to English measure, then log. p =
 ©,97234,46587,                     and then log. of 26,342,7 =
 4,42066,02860; and hence the log. of the base in toises
 will be found equal to 3,61485,36943, and the number of
 toises corresponding is 4110,5 taken at the same tempera
 ture, which corresponds to 16-*.° of the centigrade thermo
meter.
     This base we must consider        as an arc of a circle, and it
 is  easy to reduce    it to the sine of the same arc, according
 to the method given in a note at the end of this memoir.
The logarithm of the sine of the base in toises is found to
be 3,61485,35800.
     With this quantity as base, and by means of the spherical
triangles given by Lieut. Col. Mudge in his paper, I have
found the logarithmic sines in toises of all the sides of his
series of triangles, and have subsequentlv reduced them to
logarithmic arcs of the same, which enable me to complete
the rest of the calculation.         With these we may compute
any portions of the meridian, or successive intervals of
tlifferent stations expressed in toises, and in parts of the
circle, or their respective azimuths, having regard always
to the relative convergence of different meridians.
     The author has made observations for determining the
latitude of the two extremities of his are, and has also de
termined the azimuths of the exterior sides in his series of
triangles by means of the greatest elongation of the pole
star.
    In  the calculations    that T have made,   I began at  Clifton
in Yorkshire, the nolhern extremity of the arc, and for this
                                                           purpose

   Azimuth of Heathersedge, seen from Clifton, and reck
oned in the same direction, 118° 8' 8",81.
   Witli these data, and the two tables of spherical triangles,
and the logarithms of their sides expressed in arcs, the in
tervals between Clifton and the two stations Gringley and
Heathersedge      were found in toises and in seconds of a
degree, as well as all the corrections to be made on the first
azimuths increased bv 180°, as azimuths of Clifton seen
on the horizon at these latter places.
   The same process was continued for the following sta
tions in succession, all the way to Duunose in the Isle of
Wight,     which is the southernmost             extremity of the
series.
   In this manner we have the latitudes and azimuths of
each station, by means of two or three preceding stations,
and consequently we have a verification of all the calcula
tions that have been before made by Lieut. Col. Mudge.
   The results of my calculations are contained in the two

    Now if we take the arithmetic mean of the sums con
 tained in the two tables, we have for measures of the entire
 arc, comprised between the stations of Clifton and Dun-
 nose,    the following quantities            162057,32     toises,    and
  10221,972 seconds of a degree, or 2° 50' 2l",972.                     By
 dividing the former of these "by the second, we get the
 measure of a degree, corresponding to the mean latitude
 of the whole arc, equal to 57073,74 toises, or 60826,34
 fathoms, at the temperature of 16^-° of the centigrade ther
 mometer, the latitude being 52° 2' 20".
    The station at Arbgry Hill happens to be very nearly in
 the meridian of Clifton and Dunnose, and divides the in
 terval between them into nearly equal parts. The measures
 of that part of the arc which lies between Arbury and
Dunnose, is by the lables 91679,47 toises, and 9783",34
 seconds, or 1° 36' 23",34 of the common division of the
circle. The mean latitude of the arc is 51° 25' 2l". And
the measure of one degree corresponding to it is 57068,41
toises.
    In the same manner the measure of the arc comprised
between Arbury Hill and the northern extremity at Clifton
is 70377,85 toises, and 4438,63 seconds, or 1° 13' 58",63.
Its mean latitude is 52° 50' 32". And we have for one
degree of the meridian, corresponding to this latitude,
57080,70 toises.
    Hence, if we divide the entire arc into two equal parts,
we deduce the following values of a degree corresponding
to the middle of the whole and of its parts.
                                                                 Latitudes.

                    52 50 30                 57081
    These values are, as appears, perfectly in conformity
with the theory, and with the results of other measures
that have been taken in different parts of the northern
hemisphere : but, in order to place that agreement in a
more distinct point of view, I shall show how nearly these
estimates agree with the elliptic hypothesis, by comparing
them with those measures of a degree on which we can
place the greatest reliance for exactness.
    Now, if we compare the results of these calculations
with those deduced by Lieut. Col. Mudge from his obser
vations, we shall see the probable source of those errors,
which it appears to me have led him to false conclusions.
It has already been observed, that the station at Arbury
 Hill divides the whole arc into two parts nearly equal, and
 that it is also nearly in the meridian of the two extremities
 at Dunnose and Clifton.             It was, in all probability, this
 circumstance which determined the author to observe the
 latitude of Arbury Hill, as he would then have two partial
 arcs independent of the whole and of each other.
    For determining the angular extent of these arcs, Lieut.
 Col. Mudge observed the zenith distances of several stars
 on the meridian above the pole, by means of a large zenith
 sector constructed by Ramsden with the same pains that
 he had bestowed upon the theodolite.             Lieut. Col. Mudge
 paid   all possible  attention,   and  took  all such   precautions as
 might naturally be expected from an observer of his ex
 perience and address.          Nevertheless the results of his ob
 servations made on different stars, differ no less than four
  seconds from each other.          But, by taking a mean of all,
 the dimensions of the three arcs reduced to the centre at
  each station are as follows :
          Between Clifton and Dunnose             2° 50' 23",35

     The extent of the first arc, in linear measure, is 1036339f
  feet English, and when this is reduced to toises, we have
  for the lengths of the three arcs from Lieut. Col. Mudge-s
  measures,

  .30 On the Measurement        of three   Degrees   of the Mei idlan.
      These last values exceed those resulting from my com-
                the first by 10 toises, the second by 2, the third
   Eutations,
    y 8 toises ; and these differences arise from the conver
  gence of the meridians, which the author thought might
  safely be neglected, and in fact it does not make a difference
  that is perceptible in the value of a degree upon the meri
  dian. For the difference of 8 toises, in the distance be
  tween Dunnose and Arbury, makes but 5 toises difference
  in the value of a degree upon that arc, and the difference
  of 10 in the whole distance from Dunnose to Clifton,
  makes 3f in the measure of each degree on that arc.                 So
  that, as far as this source of disagreement is concerned, the
  author-s results and mine would not be found to differ
  materially from each other.
      But, if we attend to the angular dimensions of the Se
  veral arcs, as deduced from observation and from calcula
  tion, these will not he found to agree so nearly.
      The following table will show the differences in each in

 These differences are really considerable, and are capable of
 producing important errors in the results dependent on them.
     In the first place we see, that the southernmost arc be
 tween Dunnose and Arbury is smaller than it would ap
 pear by computation, by as much as 3",4 ; and w hen this
deficiency is combined with an excess of 8 toises in the
linear dimensions of the same arc, it nyikes as much as 40
toises difference in the estimated length of a degree.             The
reverse of this occurs in the northern portion of the arc
comprised between Clifton and Arbury Hill.                     This is
larger than it ought to be by 4",77, and hence the value of
a degree on the. meridian turns out too small by about 62
toises in its linear dimensions.          Fortunately, however,- the
                            .                                    excess

                  On   the Differential Thermometer.                  31
 excess of the total arc is extremely small, as it does not
exceed l",38, so as to make but five or six toises difference
 in the length of a degree observed on the meridian, and
 corresponding to the mean latitude of the arc examined.

              VII.   On the Differential         Thermometer.
                              To  Mr. Tilloch.
 Sir, The        simplest mode of settling the point in dispute
 between Professor Leslie and Sir H. Davy, with regard to
 the invention of the differential thermometer,               is to give
 exact representations of Mr. Leslie-s instrument, of Van
 Helmont-s, and of the figures Sir Humphry has given df
 them.
     Fig.  1.   (Plate   II.)   is the differential    thermometer     of
 Mr. Leslie      copied    from the figure he gives of it in his
work on Heat. Fig. 2. is the instrument of Van Helm on t
 copied from the edition of his works 1648, and of which
 the figure in the edition 1652 is the same.              Fig. 3. is the
 representation Sir H. gives of Van Helmont's instrument;
and fig. 4. is that which he gives of Mr. Leslie's.              No one
 I suppose can look at these figures without perceiving that;
 they are not correct representations either of the one or of
 the other, but that both are essentially altered.           The simple
 question, and which one would imagine might be easily
 answered, is, Why were these alterations made ?
    Instead of explaining this, a correspondent A. B. in your
 journal for November has said, as affording a ground of
justification of Sir Humphry, that in the figure of Van
 Helmont "there is no aperture delineated, and it might
 be conceived hermetically sealed."                He adds, that in the
 representation Mr. Leslie gave of this instrument in your
journal, he introduced a cork, and his figure differs from                -
 those in the two editions of Van Helmont, which are found
in the library of the College of Edinburgh, and which are
 perfectly alike.
    To judge of the validity of this defence, it is only neces
sary to read Van Helmont-s description of the instrument.
" A et    D    sunt dus» spheres repletae aere. A autem et su
 perior   est  exterius undequaque clausa, D veto est globus
inferior apertus iu fine canalis F. Sunt autem A et D ex
tinico vitro connexa per canalem BCE."                   He afterwards
adds,       Liquor BC non potest se movere per tempera-
                                                                nientum

                  On the Differential  Thermometer.
 mentura ambientis in canali, nisi unus globorum sit apef-
 tus, alter vero clausus."     And further: "Sine apertura in
 F liquor BC non fuisset motus e loco."
     It thus appears that Van Helmont-s thermometer is de
 scribed by him as open, in the most explicit terms.           But
 to prevent the speedy dissipation of the liquor, the aper
 ture or canal F is partly closed by a stopper, as appears
 from some other sentences in the description.         This is not
 very well represented in the engraving, which is only a
 rude outline, and advantage is taken of this by A. B. to say
 that " there is no aperture delineated, and it might be con
 ceived to be hermetically sealed."       It is true that, from a
 view of the figure alone, it might not be evident what is
 meant to be represented at F.        But a reference to the de
 scription which is immediately adjoining, the figure itself
•being in the text, points out by the most explicit statement
 that it is " a canal open at its extremity."        This defence
 then by A. B. is merely a subterfuge. And it does not after
 all. justify Sir Humphry's representation ; for, in the figure
 he gives, there is no part corresponding to the canal F, and
 the instrument is represented hermetically sealed, without
 the possibility of inferring that it might be open.         Why
 was this alteration made ?     The effect of it is to render the
 thermometer of Van Helmont essentially the same with
 Mr. Leslie-s. But it would be hard to say that this had
 been the intention, and we must therefore suppose that
 some other adequate cause can be assigned.
     The remarkv by your correspondent, that Mr. Leslie has
 introduced a cork, is rather frivolous ; for whether a cork or
 a stopper is put into the canal F is of no importance ; the
 important point which Van Helmont is so careful to state
 is, that there shall be an opening there. Mr. Leslie says
 nothing of a cork ; and the error in the delineation of the
 instrument, alluded to by A. B. is so trivial that it does not
 deserve notice.
     Wijh regard to the form which Van Helmont gives to
 the instrument, and from which he calls it           " suum or-
 ganum," it is merely turning up the common air ther
 mometer at the bottom, and giving it a ball, so as to form
 a bason, in which the liquor when depressed in the stem
 might be contained ; a variation introducing no essential
 difference into the instrument : and it may be remarked,
 that nothing was more common than to vary the form of
 the air thermometer, as may be seen by a reference to the
 works of that period.      Fig. 5. for example is the form of
 one given by Sanctprio in his    " Commentarv on Avicenna."
                                                               The

               On      the   Differential   Thermonieter         .   33
The syphon barometer was one of the first variations of the
common barometer, it being more convenient to have the
bason forming part of the tube than detached.     Van Hel-
mont-s variation with regard to the air thermometer is just
the same ; its under ball is open, and it could not be other
wise indeed, from the purpose to which he describes it as
applicable, that of showing the temperature of the surround
ing medium.          Hence he loads Heer with reproaches for his
stupidity     in  supposing it to be dosed.        If Heer however
is to be ranked as an idiot, as Van Helmont says, (Heer1
autem apud idiotas ostendebat,) for this mistake, it would
be still worse if the same mistake were now made after the
very ample exposure of it by Van Helmont himself.               It is
indeed impossible that it could be made bv any one who
had read any part of the passage in which the instrument
is described.       It would be worse than a mistake.       The only*'
possible defence for Sir Humphry is, that he had never read
the description ; and the same defence, whatever stretch of
candour it may require, must be extended to A, B.
    To the remark by your correspondent, that Mr Leslie-
has not quoted the sentence from Van Helmont in which
the principle of the differential thermometer          is described,
and to the insinuation conveyed in the additional observa
tion, that he " shall not pretend to determine whether Mr.
Leslie has not read this passage, or whether he has read it
and has not thought proper to quote it," it is sufficient to
 reply, that Mr. Leslie, in complaining of the injustice that
 had been done him, confined himself to the subject of his
 complaint,- which he stated as briefly as possible.         He was
 not called on to quote this passage more than some others ;
 but that he did not seek to conceal          as A. B. would insi
                                                 it,
 nuate, is   evident -from this, that he admits all that can be"
 inferred from   it»   — that the statement of Val Helmont "in
 cidentally    involved   the principle of the differential thermo
 meter." This     is   the precise statement of the fact, and        it
 does not invalidate Mr. Leslie's claim to the invention.          A-
 train of reasoning involving the principle of an instrument,
 or stating incidentally that principle,         very different from
                                                       is
 the actual construction and application to use of the instru
 ment itself.      Had the thermonieter of Van Helmont been
 such as Sir H. Davy has figured            ithad     been true that
                                                            it

 of heated upon cold air,"          would have been an anticipa

merit without displaying its advantages, and pointing ont
some use to which it was to be applied.           He does no such
thing. He      is merely led,  in the course  of his illustration of
his own instrument, to introduce an observation; in which
observation, we, now that we are acquainted with the dif
ferential thermometer,       perceive its principle.        But he
thought of no such instrument; nor did the state of know
ledge at that time furnish any object of experiment to
.which it could have been applied.          Mr. Leslie-s invention
originated   from  different views  ;  it arose from the necessity
 of obviating the inconveniences of the common air ther
mometer to admit of its being applied to a particular sub-
ject of experiment ; and it is injustice to him to represent
 the observation of Van Helmont as an anticipation of hi*
invention.
•  If Sir H. Davy had remarked, that in the course of a dis
pute on a form of the air thermometer Ven Helmont had.
incidentally stated the principle of the differential thermo
meter, Mr. Leslie could not have complained.         And had
Sir H. been eager to make this known to the world, he might
without impropriety have quoted the passage as it stood*.
But why say that Van Helmont figured an instrument
very similar to the differential    thermometer,     when he
figured   no such instrument            ?   Why alter the figure of the
instrument which Van Helmont does give? Why alter it
in such a manner as to bring it to resemble Mr. Leslie-s ?
And why alter Mr. Leslie-s so as to bring     on the other     it,
hand, to resemble more nearly the one said to be Van Hel-
mont-s    ? These are the true points of discussion                  ;   it   is
needless to wander from them and        ;   Sir Humphry, or his
                                                 if
friends, g,ire satisfactory answers with regard to them, he
will then stand exculpated from the charges which at pre
sent lie against him.
   Some of your readers may think that more attention
has been bestowed on this subject than          deserves.

VIII.    Dissertation on the Paintings of the middle Age, and
     those calledGothic. Extracted from an unpublished Work
     on Painting, by M. Paillot de Montabert *.
The     finest models of antiquity will always attract the at
tention of every philosophical artist; but the distance which
separates us from the schools of antiquity, the influence
of the manners and arts of the modems, render these studies
extremely difficult, and limit such subjects to minds of a
peculiar description. If great efforts are therefore required,
in defect of these dispositions, before we can even compre
hend the theory of the ancients ; and                    if,
                                           besides all this, we
must shake oft our tastes and habitudes, and many of our
doctrines, —     itbevond all doubt, that every thing which
                      is
can contribute to facilitate this great study ought to be
carefully inquired into, and nothing which can assist us to
attain the first sources ought to be neglected.
  It   has been remarked, that several chefs-d'oeuvre of an
cient sculpture have regained in the present aera that esti
mation which the observations of many years had not suc
ceeded      procuring for them. Hence may we not conclude,
            in
that the opinions of many observers remain still in sus
pense with respect to numerous valuable productions which
we do not yet comprehend       And  ?   not astonishing, when
                                               it   is
so many ancient sculptures and paintings appear to us to
be weak and without substance, that the works of more
degraded ages are treated with contempt.           Nevertheless,
although    we ought  to dwell upon  works   of excellence only,
we ought to despise such only as are of          vitiated or de a
graded taste, and we ought to cherish some regard for
works which, however humble, are the valuable propaga
tors of the soundest principles.
   Thus, therefore, as the object of every person who ex
ercises and professes the arts,     very different, from that of
                                          is
the person for whose gratification these arts are cultivated                    ;

   characters wherever he meets with them, and to refer to
   first principles on every occasion when secondary principles
   are displaced, and perverted from their true destination, by
   prejudices.
        I shall consequently endeavour, in the present disserta
   tion, to call the attention of my readers in the first place
  to the condition of the arts among those of the modern
  nations who have respected and followed the doctrines of
  their precursors.      I shall point out at the same time the
  ingratitude of these nations for their fir;t masters, and the
  fate of these same arts among those who have despised
  and neglected these doctrines. I shall" afterwards proceed to
  the examination of the history and styles of painting of the
  middle age, and of those which are called Gothic. Finally,
  I   shall conclude my dissertation by the analysis of certain
  qualities of these paintings, and their parallel with those of
 Kaphael, and even of some paintings of the present day.
       I do not pretend, in this essay, to represent as excellent
 the paintings of the middle age : this would not be serving
 the cause of the arts : but I shall endeavour to substitute
 for the affected disdain of some writers, the just degree of
 consideration which they merit. .
      If   my zeal for the arts causes occasional repetitions,     I
 hope that my motives will plead my justification.
 Causes      of the Respect or Neglect for ancient Monuments,
           among the Nations who have cultivated the Arts.
      If   we consider the progress of the arts among nations,
 and     if we follow their successive transmissions, we must be
 surprised       at the disdain which is gradually       developed
among nations recently civilized, and at the ungrateful
national pride which banishes the remembrance of the first
masters of their arts.
     The ancient people of Egypt, who inculcated with so
much vigilance a respect for their mysteries, their arts and
sciences, announced themselves as the fathers of miracles,
and designated their country as the legitimate cradle of the
sciences : but if our imagination, excited by these pre
sumptuous pretensions, goes back for a moment to anterirr
aeras, and seizes the first ages of the world; if we endea
vour to collect the fragments of human knowledge whkh
escaped the great catastrophe of the Deluge, we shall find
even beyond that period traditional         dates, and still more
ancient cultivators of the arts, and the pretensions of these
soi-disant inventors will vanish.        What will become also
of the claims of the Egyptians, if we reflect upon their in
                                                         tercourse

        Dissertation  on the Paintings of the middle Age.    37
tercourse    by the medium    of the Red Sea with Persia and
India   ?
    The Egyptians    seem therefore to have been   indebted for
 their arts to more ancient nations,      and they profited by
 them to a certain degree : perhaps, if they had not studied
so much to exalt themselves, they would have carried the
arts thus acquired much further; and in spite of their cli
mate, their manners, their religion, and many other causes
which might be advanced to justify their neglect, they
w ould have produced chefs-d-oeuvre, if they had been better
able to take advantage of the doctrines of the ancients.
   If we pass on to Greece, we shall find that her inhabi
tants were indebted to Egypt for the rudiments of the arts.
If  their admirers are unwilling to admit this, it cannot be
denied that they derived ereat advantage from their first
masters, and among all the favours which Heaven bestowed
upon them, that conferred by the Egyptians was the greatest.
The Greeks seem to have been fired with the same ambi
tion as the Egyptians. Sculpture and painting, accord
ing to some of their historians, originated among them.
The historians cited, without regard to method, in Pliny-s
works, announced the origin, progress, and perfection of
the arts in Greece.      If we can believe them, nothing was
borrowed ; all was created, even to the first elements, and
from the fabulous effort of Dibutades down to the miracles
of Apclles every thing belongs to them.           Sycione and
Corinth in particular disputed the glory of having invented
painting. Even the authors of the inventions are named :
it was, according to them, Cleanthes of Corinth who in
vented the art of drawing (pictura linearis).     Thelephanes
of Sycione added the perfection of shading.         Ardices of
Corinth shared this merit with him. It was Cleophanes
of the same city, as it is said, who invented monochromous
paintings, or the art of filling up the various contours with
one and the same colour. Dinias, Carrnidas, and Eumarus,
were also inventors.      Cimon of Cleona was the first who
traced the muscles and blood-vessels,       despised the rou
tine of profile drawings called catagrapha, and first de
scribed the folds in draperies:      At this aera we begin to
believe the written authorities ; and when afterwards bio
graphers make us acquainted with the Barlarchi, the Polig-
noti, and other subsequent painters, we participate in thtir
admiration of the efforts and genius of the Greeks : but if
the latter were surpassed by any other nation, they were
dissatisfied, and accused Minerva of having bestowed the
arts upon others in preference to her legitimate worshippers'.

  38     Dissertation  on the  Paintings of  the   middle Agt.
  If it  be true that   the goddess did not give birth to the arts
  among      them in a state of perfection, and armed at all
  points as she came herself from Jupiter-s brain, it is
  nevertheless certain that she initiated them in the primitive
  mysteries of their predecessors, and kindly showed them
  the efforts of nations who had previouslv cultivated them.
      The Egyptians had therefore naturally a first acquaintance
  with the arts, and devoted themselves to studies which the
  Greeks afterwards followed with improved success. The
  latter had for a salient point, data sufficiently determinate;
  and the models which they afterwards brought from Asia,
   and from Etruria, contributed to accelerate their progress.
       We now reject entirely the opinion of all those writers
   who have incessantly repeated that the arts in Greece were
   in a barbarous state ; and if there are still some persons
   who do not acknowledge the influence of the arts in Egypt
   over those of Greece, the superb works which have recently
   appeared in France will remove ail doubts on the subject.
       Let us now descend to the times of the Romans. These
   victorious soldiers at first despised the arts, which their in
   creasing luxury nevertheless attracted towards Rome, and
   this capital of the world saw the aeras revived of Pericles
   and Alexander : from being pupils of the Greeks, they be-
,  came their rivals. But this very disdainful spirit, that vanity
    which regarded nothing as perfect which they had not pro
   duced themselves, induced them to prefer their national
    and composite taste to the pure and simple Attic graces :
    their manners, corrupted by the conquest of Asia, were vi
    sible in their arts : the pride of the Romans dictated the
    laws to sculpture and painting; and instead of the philoso
   phers and learned men going to study at Athens, as the
    Athenians formerly studied at Memphis and Thebes, a
    fastidious taste triumphed over the simplicity of nature,
    and the style of the ancient schools began to disappear.
    From this moment the gods and heroes of Homer, figured
    by the arts, had no longer die same majesty ; and when
    Pliny informs us that in his day there were still some
    artists equally expert with the ancients,        we are inclined
    to  believe that this  opinion savoured  of  the influence of the
    age ; an influence    to which the wisest  men   are subject. But
    without seeking for its effects among the many celebrated
    men of that age, I shall merely quote the words of"Quinc-
    tilian, the pupil of the Greeks : he informs us, that he
    was acquainted with nothing more majestic or magnificent
    than the robes and insignia of the triumphant generals of
    that peried.     The natural and affecting simplicity of the
                                                               Greeks^

        Dissertation on the Paintings     of the middle Age.    39
Greeki was therefore gradually abandoned for the richness
and magnificence of combinations ; and the arts assumed
a character of degradation.        Nevertheless, while we must
admire the imposing aspect of the works of the best days
of Rome, under theAntonini, we must repeat that the Greek
models of the age of Pericles always shine with new lustre,
and that the study of the medals of Sicily alone, or of the
bas-reliefs from Athens, will always delight the artist of
genuine taste and talents.
     If we now turn our attention to the middle ages, when,
the southern parts of Europe groaned under barbarism, we
must also ascribe the new calamities which befel painting
to pride and disdain.     National vanity had no longer any
control : at these unfortunate aeras the learned were more
employed in collecting the fragments of the arts than in
adding to their perfection ; aud this respectful modesty,
which was not without its good effects, since it recalled
the ages of simplicity, paved the way for the glory of Da,
Vinci and Raphael. In those days antiquity was again
honoured, and simple nature was once more loved and re
spected.     The influence of the events of the time was the
only obstacle : the sciences were not studied, it is true,
but the minds of men were purer ; they were less cultivated,
but good sense prevailed,      in a word, this state of the arts
afforded extensive grounds for indulging in hope, and no
thing to fear for their advancement.          It was in those days
of comparative languor that the consolations of painting
softened the bitterness of individual and national sufferings ;
its mild and beneficent fruits were cultivated 5 and Religion,
freed from the .persecutions of the Heathens, employed it to
 record her triumphs.      The temples, the receptacles of the
dead, and the monasteries opened their sacred asylums, and
the art of painting portable portraits was universally cul
 tivated.   From Constantinople to Rome, and from Rome
 to Siberia, we find representations of the saints, the apo
 stles, and the divine mysteries.       So many efforts, seconded
 by the protection of the ecclesiastical councils, produced

    Almost at the same instant there appeared another writer
fired with the same ardour.      In work entitled " Cowsi-

His work contains an account of upwards of 150 pictures
anterior to Perugino, and several of which are works of the
twelfth century.
   M. Denon, whose indefatigable zeal and enlightened
taste are so well known, has recently enriched our public                            ,
collections at Paris with pictures of the above period col

            himself. These pictures cannot fail to fix the

 I  shall mention three causes of their destruction.          Their
 most ancient enemies were the Iconoclasts, or breakers of
 images, whose ravages spread far and wide : the second
 cause was the cupiditv oi persons, who destroyed them
 for the sake of the ornaments in gold and precious stones
 which surrounded them : and the third cause of their-
 destruction, of all others the most afflicting, was that
jealousy of their plagiarists, who not only annihilated them,
 but endeavoured to propagate a contempt for images which
 they nevertheless did not cease to consult, to imitate, ana
 to lay under daily contribution.         Finally, such was the
 influence     of these disdainful enemies, that under Pope
Julius they tore down without remorse from the walls of
 the Vatican a fresco by Perugino, to make room for one
 which Raphael was to execute,- — although the latter, equally-
commendable for a great and enlightened mind, nobly op
 posed it.     We may conceive therefore that these paintings
 are very rare in Italy, and even throughout Europe.

an artist may have yiews and comparisons                which may
escape     the  observation   of the mere   virtuoso  or antiquary,
 I have undertaken the task of making some classifications."
     I am aware that it is of very little consequence to artists
to know precisely at what time, and in what places, certain
parts of the art of painting were abandoned, resumed, and
lost again : but they will confess, I trust, that there are in
direct ways of advancing the arts, and that none can be
blamed in particular; and they must also admit that, al
though these views may not be new to every person, they
may nevertheless possess some interest, since they bring
t,o light the causes of the progress as well        as those of the
decline of the grand art of painting-.
    By the term middle age, I mean the aera which embraces
the first period of the decline of the empire under Con-
stantine the Great, and which coming down in the first
place to the ninth century, which terminated the persecu
tions against the Iconoclasts, embraces the period of the
revival of the arts in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries,

may nevertheless be traced.       It is true that we are ignorant
of the causes which prolonged the intervals of sleep, or
lethargy, of all the fine arts, and there will perhaps be a per
petual oblivion both of the names of the principal artists
who continued to cultivate the arts at certain periods, and
of the aeras at which these artists flourished. But as the art
of painting comprehends only a determinate number of
constituent parts, it is not impossible to ascertain the
various influences which, invited to the study of these va
rious parts artists of every age and country ; and the ana
lysis alone of these same parts ought to be sufficient with
us for fixing the degree of interest, or of esteem, which we
ought to bestow on these different productions :. thus we
shall be able to distinguish the various schools from which
they emanated.
    Before entering upon this analysis, it is proper to refer
 to the opinion of Winckelman, Meugs, Webbs, Milizia, and
 some other modern writers, who have recognised the merit
 of the productions of the old schools. The period at which
 these authors wrote did not permit them to publish, with
 out restriction, all the new ideas, the strength and truth of
which should gradually lessen the veneration improperly
 paid by certain didactic writers to the idols of former cen
 turies: but the same thoughts animated better artists; our,
 pictures, statues, and in short all our arts have felt the
 happy effects, and we may explain ourselves without con
 straint now that persons are disposed to receive the truth.
     The .art of painting as practiced by -the ancients, al
 though depressed, despised, and persecuted, nevertheless
 preserved its essential character.     If the paintings executed
 at Rome under the emperors were not to be compared to
 the chefs-d'oeuvre of Parrhasius and Zeuxis, .tbey did not
 exhibit a corrupted taste, or encourage pernicious doctrines.
 The most humble productions of these times are not beyond
 the rules of art ; nor do they present those fantasies since
 authorised    by irresolute minds, or those wild ideas which
 ignorance may at all times regard as an intrepid and novel
 species of enthusiasm.      It was when painting was almost
  entirely neglected, and languished without notice, that the
 Tuscans, wishing to become more civilized, laid the arte
 tinder contribution : but from what point did those artiats
 set out, who wished to unite their celebrity to that of their
  country ? and what were the rules and maxims of those
^painters, who from that aera filled all Italy with their names
  gnd their new manner-?       Did they con-fine themselves to
  uking no the art where the ancients had left it       i  Did they
                                                          endeavour

         Dissertation  on the Paintings   of the middle Age.     43
endeavour to restore to it the perfection of which it had
been so long deprived ? and were these ilew artists sufficiently
enlightened to recognise the indestructible solidity of the
 foundations of the art among the ancients, thinking that
 they could build only            such bases, and forsaking their
 new ideas and deceitful independence ? Who can answer
 all these questions ? Such observers and artists alone as are
 destitute of prejudices : those only clearly perceive the
 barrier which insulated the arts of Florence from antiquity.
 All the genius, all the merits
 are within this barrier.      It is true that the art was partially
 revived ; but it was no longer that of antiquity ; i. e. it
 was no longer directed, guided, and characterized by those
 documents which are adapted to it at all times and seasons.
 In pictures, the drawing department gained in perspective
  correctness, and lost in naivete: it gained in intrepidity
 and energy, and lost in truth and proportion.            Anatomy
  became a study of ostentation : the magnificence of form
  was factitious ; the artist appeared greater than the work,
  and celebrity was confounded with perfection. The com
  position was abandoned to the caprice of the artist, and
  was only kept within bounds, when the recollections of the
  order and symmetry of the ancients occurred by chance to
  determine their wavering resolutions. The essential cha
  racters of nature being once misunderstood, those of art
  were abandoned, and became a subject of disputation in
  the schools.     The artists, freed from the yoke of ancient
  doctrines, prolonged for some time their doubts as to the
  essentials of painting and sculpture ; and at length they at
  tained that which was inevitable, i. e. the celebrity of the
  most eminent dragged the rest along with them.             It was
  no longer    the  science   of  Phidias,  Praxiteles, Protogenes,
  which was to be recovered : the fiery and imposing sketches
   of Michael Angelo were alone to be imitated : it was no
   longer from nature that ideas were to be drawn and re-
, newed, but rather from the academies already famous, pro
    tected by princes, and become the glory of the country and
   of all Italy.    The modesty of a small number of philoso
   phical artists, and their praiseworthy attempts, scorned all
    exaggerations ; but their pictures were nevertheless praised,
   because nature was exhibited in the in : but vanity con
   tinuing its progress, all succeeding men of genius, one after
    another, worshipped the mysteries of these new schools of
   superstition.     The efforts made to shake off this propen
    sity for the natural tastes of each, absorbed the faculties,
    and there remained -no longer any moral method by which
                                                                   to

  honour to the art. This state of -things continued tn the
  present day, and the conventions            of the mannerists had
  all the force of law in the workshops.           All the talents of
  an infinite number of painters, very justly admired, do not
  destroy their" opinion.        It was reserved to our aera, and
  our schools, to abandon and annihilate prejudices so long
 combated without success. Painting and sculpture, alarmed
 and ashamed at so many humiliating degradations, finally
 threw themselves into the arms of nature: artists again re
 sumed the route which she pointed out.

 Sir," In the vicinity of Reading, within a circumference
 of three miles, there are four brick manufactories. The pits
 which have been dug for the purpose of procuring materials
for the formation of bricks, afford an opportunity of ex
amining the strata of earth in this vicinity; and of how
 ever small importance individual observations of themselves
may be — still, in a collective point of view, they may add ti»
a mass of evidence which may eventually lead to the most
 interesting inductions in the science of mineralogy.
     The celebrated Cuvier, in his la e publication on Organic
Remains in the vicinity of Paris, has by patient investiga
tion and indefatigable industry thrown considerable light
on this subject. Disclaiming all speculative opinions, he has
continued by unwearied application to examine nature her
self; and has described the appearances which presented
themselves, in plain and perspicuous language, avoiding as
much as possible those technical terms which may have a
reference to former and probably erroneous systems ; for
the knowledge         of the constitution of the earth is still
in its infancy, and it is only to be forwarded by the means
which he has pursued.           In reference to this opinion, I
transmit to you for insertion in the Philosophical Maga
zine, the following appearances from actual observation of
the pits above described. The greatest in depth does not-ex-
ceed eighty feet from the surface to the bottom ; and as they
all coincide pretty exactly in the nature of their stratifica
tion, I shall select that one which has been longest opened,
                                                                 and

                   in the Vicinity of Reading.   ,             45
 and in which the greatest number of teeth and shells has
 been discovered, for description.     The layers are all hori
 zontal, and the section is vertical.      The first laver, and.
 which is the foundation, is chalk.       In this formation no
 otganic remains have been discovered ; ii contains nodules
 of flints, w hich are usually in beds and adhering to the
 chalk. Immediately above is the stratum of sand, con
 taining the remains of marine animals. Its thickness varies
 from two feet and a half to less than a foot. The bed con
 taining these remains is not entirely of sand, as some clay
 may be distinguished among it. The oysters are commonly
 entire ; one valve being connerted with another, although
 the adhesion has become so slight that they may without
 difficulty be separated, and the laminae of each valve may
 likewise be very easily divided.   On separating the valves,
 I found that the place which had been occupied by the
oyster was filled by an unctuous earth exactly of the same
shape wiih the oyster.
    The external appearance of these shells is in some in
stances entire ; but they generally have the appearance of
those oyster shells which have been exposed to heat, and
when piaced rn a fire they do not crepitate.       The outer sur
faces are rough ; the inner smooth.           They differ very
much in size.      The largest which    I  have  observed is six
inches in length and four in breadth.        That they exist in
very considerable quantity is proved from the circumstance
of their having been discovered for upwards of a century,
since which time the workmen have beeu in the daily
custom of finding them.       Dr. Brewer, in the Philosophical
Transactions for 1700, mentions them without adverting
to the teeth which are found in the same formation. These
teeth are of a triangular shape, a little bent, of a dark-
leaden colour, and having their surfaces polished.          They
are very small, the longest not much exceeding an inch in
length, with the interior surface in some longitudinally sul-
cated.     They are found in considerable quantities, but no
vertebrae or any other remains of marine animals have been
discovered along with them.       The land in which they are
imbedded is coarser and of a darker-colour than that which is
superincumbent, containing a little clay and gravel ; which
I remark, because, in order to obtain any useful knowledge
on these subjects, it is necessary that the examination of
these bodies should be connected with that of the strata in:
which they are found. The next stratum is a thin one of
blue-coloured earth, above which, is a layer of sand with
out any adhesion of extraneous substances, and extending

46                  Notices respecting New Books.
 to the thickness of seven feet. The next in succession is
the formation of red clay, which is commonly the greatest
 in thickness of the formations. The last and uppermost
is the alluvial earth, which does not exceed the thickness
of two feet. In the three other pits, the difference consists
in the relative thickness of the different strata.    In the one
which is most advanced in a northern direction, the shells
are wanting; hut teeth, similar to the others, are discovered.
    I may likewise mention that a vertical section, made
within the extent of a mile from this northernmost pit, af
 fords a quite different appearance of the stratification, as
immediately under a thin covering of alluvial earth is chalk,
 which presents a singular appearance, the layers of chalk
and of flints being alternate through the whole depth, and
 observing great regularity of distance.     The Thames divides
these two pits.
    Many parts in this island afford opportunities of de
scribing differences in stratification ; and when many such
surveys are made in parts of the globe separated from each
other, and these appearances accurately compared, there is
no doubt but that a true theory of the mineral kingdom
will   be the result.

work, for fiis attempt to place arithmetic in that rank
which    ought to hold as one! of the two great branches
           it
of mathematics. If we admit with Mr. Locke, that " num
ber   isthat which the mind makes use of, in measuring all
 things that      us are measurable," Arithmetic certainly
                   by
 ought, as the author contends, to take precedence of Geome
 try, with which has more necessary connection than
                          it       a
 gome are willing to allow.
    In the first chapter, Mr. Walker, after noticing that we
 are indebted to the Arabs for our present method of nu
 meral notation, remarks that                 "
                                    we may be impressed with
a  conviction of its ingenious simplicity,    we reflect on the

  and distinctness ; and this, in a form which subjects them
  most conveniently to arithmetical computation. The im
  portant utility of the contrivance it may be sufficient for
  the present to illustrate by the following remark.                 Most
  children of a very young age can with ease multiply or di
 vide the number 67,4s9 by the number 508.                    But let the
  same   numbers    be  expressed by      the   Roman     method   of no
 tation, which prevailed        in   Europe     before   the introduction
  of the Arabic, thus — Ixvii.cccclxxxix and dviii ; — a man
  will be puzzled to perform either operation.                The Greeks
  employed     a numeral notation        similar to the Roman:         and
 it is truly wonderful how their mathematicians (even with
  the aid of some mechanical contrivances) surmounted the
 difficulties    which they had to encounter in their arithme
 tical calculations ; while we know that they were engaged
 in some of a very long and complicated nature.
     " Yet when we examine the fundamental principle of
 the Arabic notation, it becomes a matter of surprise that
 the invention was not of earlier discovery: for it proceeds
 on a principle extremely simple, and one that must have
 been employed in all ages, whenever there was a practical
 occasion of counting any very large number. We may
 illustrate the principle by supposing that we had to count
 a great heap of guineas.          It is plain that unless we employ
 some check on our numeration, -we shall be very apt to
 lose our reckoning, and get astray as we advance.                  What
 then is the most obvious method of securing accuracy in
 bur reckoning?         Is it not to count by tens, or some fixed
number beyond which we never shall proceed ? Thus,
 when we have reckoned ten guineas, we may lay .them
aside in one parcel, and proceed to count another parcel
often. But to prevent the number of these parcels from
 accumulating so as to lead us astray, whenever we have
counted ten such parcels we may make them up into a
rouleau, containing therefore ten times ten guineas, or one
hundred : and whenever we have ten such rouleaus, we
may combine them into one set, consisting of ten hun
dred, or a thousand, guineas : and so on.                   And by this,
simple     contrivance    it  would     never   be  necessary   to reckon
beyond      the   number     ten.     Now    it  is  precisely upon this
principle     that we  proceed     in  designating numbers by the
Arabic notation. The several columns of figures, from
the right hand column, are the compartments in which we
dispose the several combinations of ten. The first column
on the right hand is the place for all odd units, below ten :
the next to it on the left hand, or second column, is. the.

                   Notices respecting New Books.           J   49
place for all parcels of ten, below ten such parcels: the
 third column, for all parcels of a hundred (or ten times
 ten) below ten : the fourth, for all parcels of a thousand
 (or ten hundred) below ten : the fifth, for all parcels of
 ten thousaud below ten : the sixth, for all parcels of a
 hundred thousand (or ten times ten thousand) below ten :
 the seventh, for all parcels of ten hundred thousand (or a
 million) below ten, &c.
      "Thus by the help of the nine significant figures and
 the cypher we are able to designate all numbers however
 great; and this, while each of the figures (called the ten
 digits, from the Latin word signifying a finger) always re
 tains the same numeral significancy.       For example, in the
 two numbers 57 and 5 70, the character 5 denotes in each
 the number five, and the character 7 the number seven :
 but in the former the 5 standing in the second column
 designates five parcels often each, or fifty ; but in the latter,
 where it stands in the third column, it designates five par
 cels of a hundred each, or five hundred : and"in the former,
 the 7 standing in the right hand column designates seven
 units; but in the latter, standing in the second column,
 designates seven tens, or seventy.       And thus we see that
  the cypher, though it denote that there is no number be
  longing to its column, yet must be written ; in order to
  bring the significant figures into their proper places.
      " To facilitate numeration, we commonly mark off by
  a cbmma every period of six figures, commencing from
  the right hand, and often semi-periods of three figures.
  And as the name of a million is given to ten hundred thou
  sand, so ten hundred thousand millions are called a billion;
  the place of which therefore commences at the thirteenth
   column.     In like manner. the names of a trillion, quadril
   lion, &c. are given to ten hundred thousand billions, tril
  lions, &c.
       " But here it is to be observed, that the facility with
   which we can designate the highest numbers, and perform
   every arithmetical calculation on them, has occasioned an
   insensibility to the enormous magnitude of the numbers of
   which we speak.      One billion is very easily mentioned, and
   easily designated by a unit followed by twelve cyphers :
   thus — 1,000000,000000.       A child also can multiply or di
   vide that number.      But perhaps the reader will be sur
   prised at the statement that there is not one billion of se
   conds in thirty thousand years; though there be 60 seconds
   in every minute, 60 minutes in every hour, 24 hours in
   every day, and in a solar year 365 days 5 hours 48 minutes

and   about 48 seconds.    At that calculation, the precise
number of seconds in 30,000 years is only 946707,840000 ;
or above 30 thousand millions less than one billion. So
that the number of seconds, which have passed since the
creation of the world, is considerably less than the fifth
part of one billion. In fact, it is only by some such con
siderations that we can form Any conception of numbers so
immense.
     "From the view we have taken of the Arabic notation,
it is plain that a cypher, wherever it occurs, increases ten
fold the value of every figure standing on its left hand ; but
does not affect the value of the figures standing on its right
hand. It appears also that the several columns may be con
ceived to be headed with their respective titles, as parcels
of a thousand each, of a hundred, of tens, &c."
   To the preceding extract, which may serve as a specimen
of the author's stvle, it is only necessary to add, that one
great merit of the work      the lucid and full, yet perspi
                                   is,
cuous!, explanation of elementary principles, which        ex      it
hibit!, without departing from the rigidness of demonstra
tion. In the detail the author has been happy in the
adaptation of examples to the doctrines they are proposed
 to illustrate, and they are so contrived as to interest the
juvenile mind in the attainment of the results.
    To those who make themselves acquainted with the
 scientific principles of common arithmetic, the Elements
 of Algebra offer no serious difficulty. Of these elements
the author has given such         view as may introduce the
                                         a
student into that field of science, and enable him to make

William Lainbe, M.D. was read.
  In this paper Dr. Lambe has continued his observations
pn arsenic.          He has related the effects of potash, of am
monia, and of lime, upon this metal, each of which sub
stances has furnished new observations.
   By heating white oxide of arsenic with sub-carbonate of
potash, the oxide    divided into two parts
                         is                 one portion
                                                      :                 is

part is reduced, a quantity of regulus being always found in
the neck of the retort.     Dr. Lambe found that this com
pound both absorbed and gave out atmospheric air. When
the heat was very low, a large portion of the air of the ves
sels disappeared ; when a brisk heat was used, the air of the
vessels had received an augmentation,     consisting of a mix
ture of oxygen and azote.
   The action of ammonia was examined by uniting the
alkali with arsenic acid, and decomposing the salt by heat.
To succeed in this process, it is necessary to mix the salt
previously with iron filings, otherwise the glass of the
retort is dissolved.  The gas which came, over was received
in three successive portions. The first was not examined,
as consisting principally of the air contained in the retort ;
the second portion appeared to be pure azote ; the third and
last portion proved to be principally a new and peculiar
gas, similar to that described in Dr. Lambe's former
paper: it yields, by being inflamed with oxygen gas, both
carbonic and nitrous acids j and Dr. L. has called it there
fore nitro- carbonic oxide.                                .
   The effect of lime has led to the most unexpected results.
It appears that when white oxide of arsenic and lime are
heated together, a portion of the arsenic disappears, and in
its place water and carbonic acid are found ; nor does there
appear (as far at least as has been hitherto examined) any
other product. In some cases a large quantity of carbonic
acid was evolved, independent of the portion absorbed by
the lime; in other cases the whole, or nearly so, was ab
sorbed by the lime. From these facts Dr. Lambe concludes
that oxide of arsenic is in this experiment decompounded,
and that it is composed of the substances which form the
common elements of animal and vegetable matter j name
ly, carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.
   Jan. 21. A letter to the President, from the American
Col. Humphries, on a. new species of Sheep was read.
This peculiar breed, it appears, originated from some un
known cause (probably a species of disease) in the state-
of Massachussetts in 1791. It was produced by a ewe-
which fed on the banks of a river much frequented by
etter3, and the shortness of this animal-s legs suggested
the idea that it must have been occasioned either by the
imagination of the mother, or more substantial communi
cation. What contributed to sanction this wild conjecture
was the disappearance of the otters (a very natural circum-
ttpqce in the life of this nomade race) from that part of
                               D2                           the

the river.    The chief peculiarities of this otter-sheep, as
vulgarly  denominated,     are very short, crooked legs ; very
relaxed and feeble joints; a slow walk, a sickly constitution,
and a generally meagre body, — owing, probably, to the dif
ficulty and pain it must undergo in procuring its food.
The reason for propagating this apparently diseased race
was the want of quickset fences, and the general adoption
of low stone walls, which were unequal to prevent the
common breed of sheep from trespassing on corn or mea
dow lands. Its body usually weighs about 45lbs. ; its wool is
rather long and fine, and when crossed with the Merino
breed yielded a fine long silky staple, and weighing from
 3 to 4 lbs. each fleece.    It is difficult to fatten, but propa
gates its species like the common sheep.               Sometimes,
however, where the common ewe had twins by a ram of
this kind, the female lamb was like the mother, and the
male like the father, and the contrast between two such
Iambs sucking the same ewe was striking.            The defects, it
 appears, of this breed overbalance its advantages, as it is
becoming extinct, and it was with difficulty that Colonel
Humphries could procure one to dissect, and send the
 skeleton to the Royal Society. If it could not leap ditches,
 it was equally incapable of being driven to market, and the
 duration of its life was consequently uncertain, and rather
 limited. A physician who dissected one at Boston, called
 it by a more characteristic appellation, Agkon, from dyxwv,
 an elbow.
    A paper by Sir Everard Home was read on the coagu
 lating glands in the stomachs of some animals and fowls.
This short paper contained an account of some experiments
 made by the late Mr. Hunter, to ascertain the coagulating
 power of the different parts of the stomach of calves and
 fowls ; from which it appeared that the cardiac portion
 yields the strongest runnet, and-that the gastric juice is the
 chief liquid that effects coagulation or becomes runnet.

 Mr. Wright's      Lectures on the Passions — (Forming the
    second   Course of his Elucidation          of the Oratorical
     Character) .
    Mr. Wright has during the present and last months re
  sumed his labours in this department of science before a
  numerous audience.

                    Philosophical Society    of London.                 53
       In   recapitulating    the leading features of his theory
    (maintained in the course delivered last spring*) the lec
    turer concluded his reference by the following concentration
    of its principle.
        " The muscles and nerves constituting the animal
    frame are fitted to act in unison with each other, and thus
    the organs of sound in all animals produce uniform expres
    sion : that the sound expressive of tranquillity answers to
    musical phaenomena ; and that the sounds expressive of
    all the modifications of feeling correspond,             also, with
    musical phaenomena, and all the varieties of concord and
    discord ; and these are subservient to the complexity of
    passion, emotion and sentiment.         Laughing and crying are
    the simple signs by which man expresses pleasure or pain ;
    and as all his passions are modifications of love and hatred,
    it follows that these simple expressions of look must also
,   be modified to correspond with the diversity.          And further,
    by analogv,     as  the simple signs  of  desire  and  aversion  may
     be produced by physical as well as mental causes, and by a
     mere effort of the will as easily as by either, it follows
    that all the other passions may be produced in the same
    way."
        From the paramount influence of passion over reason in
    the mass    of mankind, " the orator, (said Mr. W.) by a
   judicious exertion of that art which enables him to counter
    feit its external signs, will secure the sympathy and admi
    ration of his auditory ; — persuade while he endeavours to
    convince, and soften the heart while he improves and
    heightens the energies of the mind." Proceeding to enforce
    in strong language the necessity of this sympathy, and de
     scanting on the requisites essential to its promotion,
     Mr. W. slightly touched on points he had before discus
     sed.   " If the orator (he observed) would arrest the hearts
     of an audience in his favour, his truth or belie/ in what he
     proposes to them must not, for a moment, be disputed :
     and that, as the expression of voice and gesture is the
     outward attribute of this accurate disposition of mind, the
     want of earnestness in an orator demonstrates either hy
     pocrisy or imbecility."
        " As no person can be called an orator, unless he possess
     oratorical feeling, and is enabled to depict any modification
     of the mind at will, — an arrangement of the passions,
     enumerating their never-erring outward effects upon the
 ,   human character, cannot fail of proving extremely in-

teresting to students.    I shall however at present only ob-r
 serve, that sympathy in the breast of an auditor will operate
 in proportion to the accuracy of the outward signs exem
plified in the voice, look, and gesture of the orator."
   The obstacles that commonly prevent the excitement of
this indispensable sympathy formed the next consideration
of the lecturer, all of which he traced to two distinguished
causes, — carelessness and affectation.     '' They may (said
he) be construed into either impudence or self-conceit, or
wickedness and imbecility of mind, and total disregard to
the interests of others.   The one, by an overacted sensibi
lity, renders calamity and misfortune ridiculous ; the other,
by an opposite temperament^ represents virtue and sincer
rity under many of the disadvantages of vice and falsehood."
Men, indeed, naturally treat with disdain or ridicule all
bare and inefficient attempts to excite their attention. Self-
love too, often takes the alarm at the implied imputation of
being easily biassed. All incongruous associations natu
rally excite displeasure; and it is the discrepancy between
appearance
whether allied to pity or     abhorrence.    This principle, as
far as respects affectation,   was very appositely maintained
by a quotation from the       discriminating pen of Fielding,
which concluded with the      following observation : " Great
vices are the proper objects of onr detestation, smaller
faults of our pity ; but affectation is the only true source of
 the ridiculous *."— Pprsuing the subject,       we noticed a
remark, the truth of which every one must frequently have
felt in his commerce with the world.             " tt is pos
sible (says Mr. W.) to be very careless and extremely af
fected/-
   The lecturer then enlarged on the media by which thfr
rninds of an auditory are engaged and impressed, in lan
guage to the following effect :
                                     " The organs of vision
and sound are the instrument* of communication and ora
tory. First, the mind, through the medium of the visual
organs, is sensible of the various alterations of the mus
cular forms of the face, of fhe attitudes of the body and
the motions of its limbs : and as particular alterations of
appearance are known to indicate distinct operations of
mind, man is in some sort provided intuitivelv with sen
sible feelings of what passes in the breast of his friend or
his enemy.     2dly, Through the auricular organ, the mind

aotone, elevation or depression ; it judges also of suspen
sions and pauses. Now these several qualities may cha-
syllable,       or   a   single letter.   And again,   these varieties,    as
far as sounds go, may be rendered correspondent to all the
modifications of oratorical expression, the complexity of
passion, emotion and sentiment : by the intervention       of
pauses  and  suspensions, by the adaptation of long and short
syllables, of sharp and flat tones, and the greater or less
inflexions of voice, the spirits may be either dilated with
the sensations of joy, or depressed by those of sadness and
melancholy. Having reduced the . types of our feeling to
motion and sound, it remains to distinguish their oratorical
qualities. The first comprises looks and gestures j the
latter, the tones and tunes in which words are delivered,
and the rests, pauses and respirations necessarily inter
vening."
    " According to the modern definitions of the words
look and gesture, we understand an appropriate attitude
of the body and cast of the eye to the nature and import
t»f the sounds we are pronouncing;             but, united, their
genuine meanings appear         to   be  (as guilt will frequently
betray   itself  notwithstanding every attempt made to con
ceal it)   aprobable picture of what passes in the soul.        We
may also define look and gesture to be natural systems of
expression, which by all nations and degrees of men are
most readily understood." As an apt corollary to this last
position, the learned lecturer turned to the animated page of
Sterne, and enriched his discourse          the description of Cor
                                                 by
poral  Trim's    pathetic appeal  to  ordinary feeling on the news
of master Bobby-s death.
   "This excellent picture exhibits to the student the plain      '

action      by  curved lines,' he would have appeared affected,
                '

seen in     person who pretends to mimicry, or to courtly
            a

 the same words, would have been tinctured with the exist
 ing passion, and his oratory have suffered from the alloy,
 and so passed by unheeded.        But if all the common and
 necessary movements for the purposes of life are performed
 by men in ' straight or plain lines,' all the polished feel
 ings, all the brilliant energies of the soul, are represented
 by them in the graceful and ornamental movements of

 never     suit   "the unconstrained      view" of Akenside
 " through      mountains, plains, through empires black with
,shade."
     Notwithstanding the celebrated dictum of Pope, that
 "   those move easiest who have learnt to dance," Mr.
 Wright gives a decided preference to the use of the foil.
 Though we presume he will not, with Sir Joshua Reynolds,
 say that "all awkwardness           comes from the dancing-
 master," yet he maintained that, though the limbs might
 attain suppleness in the school of Terpsichore, more grace
 and elegance, more ease combined with energv, are dif
  fused over the frame from the practice of fencing.       " The
  reason (he says) is obvious: all the intellectual functions are
  in action before an adversary in a fencing assault, and this
 is discoverable from the expression of the intellectual mus
  cles.— In dancing, we have only to take notice of the
  vacant stare of the minuet-dancer, to convince us all is
  inanity, and ' not a breath of thought is seen to move.'

       In prefacing his observations on the pronuncia
  tion of some simple sounds of our tongue, the lecturer
  took occasion to express an elegant and respectful tribute
  to the character and attainments of Mr. Walker; for whose
  indefatigable   industry and nice discernment he professed,
  notwithstanding his dissent in some fundamentals of the
  science, the highest estimation.
      " Words (continued Mr. Wrigbt) may be divided into
  simple, compound, and imitative: the first and second,
  connected together in discourse, belong peculiarly to ihe
  .elements of elocution, the third to the philosophy of feel
  ing. But as the three classes of words, taken individually,
  suffer from affected or negligent articulation and inflexion,
  .— as the intended      passion cannot easily arise by mincing
  or confining the vowel sounds, by accentuating the sylla
   bles contrary to the best usage and authority, injudiciously
  vocalizing or aspirating the consonants ; a few remarks on
   some particular sounds, and on the disputed modes of pro
   nouncing certain words, cannot be considered^ irrelative to
  jny present object,,

     "  It would be difficult to decide which is the greater
enemy to language, ignorance, or affectation usurping the
power of shortening, lengthening, adding syllables, altering
accents, and contracting the sounds of vowels.             Ignorance
would persuade us that the sound of our first letter is con
fined to the broad all ; while affectation, mincing out aye
upon all occasions, would deprive us of an easy use of the
under jaw.         And so strictly do they adhere to this perver
sion, that when the letter precedes the consonant r, as in
march, and consequentlv rendered thereby broad, hesitation
is not made in pronouncing it almost match.                 But these
enemies to pronunciation would feel themselves surprised,
 were they informed that the letter is liable to six modifi
 cations;— -fate, fat, Jar, fall, fare, and the unaccentmted
 sound when it stands for an article, as, a paper ; or in the
 word particular, &c. It is the manner in which the second
 sound is pronounced in certain words, which marks, as
 far as this letter is concerned, the affectation or vulgarity of
 the speaker.        Many provincial dialects do not admit the
 second sound, and consequently pronounce words of three
  letters, where the vowel is placed between two consonants,
 as had, can, hat, — as bard (without the roughness of the r)
 or bod, &c. — But as we ought not to be supposed able to
 discover the birth-place of a gentleman by his pronuncia
  tion, his mode of delivery should be accommodated to the
  best usage.       Although cast, pass, plant, &c. are precisely
  of the analogy of bad, can, hat, &c. yet adhering too rigid
  ly to the correctness of analogy is the symbol of affec
  tation : on the other hand, pronouncing them broadly, as if
  modified by r without its roughness, (as parss, &c.) is a
  symbol of vulgarity. Now, as we may suppose every public
   assembly to be composed of persons whose ears have been
   habituated to particular modes,            the speaker's first care
   should    be  to  utter the  vowel   so  that, if possible, he may
   not offend the ear of either party.         It should then be his
   aim to adopt a middle articulation, and this can easily be
   accomplished by dwelling on the second vowel's sound,
   viz. pa-ass, pla ant, Sec. ; or by contracting horizontally,
   a little, the mouth from the third sound.         If this be admit
   ted as useful in oratory, then there are seven sounds of the
   first letter.    Sheridan has given three sounds, Walker four,
   and Perry six.'-

            In commencing his    sixth lecture, Mr. Wright particu
        larised the most prominent defects and difficulties             of-
                                                                     speech
         which strike us in others, or affect ourselves.        He seemed
        decidedly of opinion, that none of these arise (with certain
        individual exceptions) from natural malconformation, but
        are the result of the bad example which persons may have
       had in their early childhood.          "Children receive the first
       impressions of language      by   imitation, and are sure to copy
       articulate defects ot mothers, nurses, and any who may be

       sons concerned in the management of children."
           Precise directions for the obviating these faults of articu
       lation followed, of somewhat too diffuse            nature for our

       recollection but from the attention the learned gentleman
-
                   ;
       appears to have devoted to the physiological branch of his
      profession, we readily confide in their efficacy.        After citing
      the well-known and illustrious example of Demosthenes,
      whose ardent and unwearied genius surmounted every im
      pediment of nature or habit, Mr. Wright delivered             strong
                                                                        a
      exhortation to the student to persevere in his arduous task.
           Having dismissed the topic of impediments in articula
      tion, the lecturer proceeded to give an important view of
      the necessity of  a    due adjustment of accentuation, which
      he pronounced inseparable from the art of persuasion. —
     "    Accentuation has been defined            bygrammarians to bear
      the same relation to words as emphases do to sentences;
     but, as there are many words in sentences unaccentuated,
      and whole sentences unmarked                by
                                                  emphases, our gram
     matical definition of accentuation            therefore imperfect —
                                                  is                           -
    *
         Exercise and temperance strengthen the constitution.'
     'And- and 'the- are words without accents and as there    ;
    is    no opposition in the sentence, (emphasis suggesting the
     idea of contradistinction,) neither of the words           emphatic.
                                                                   is

    and   '|  the constitution!- another rhetorical word, we perceive
    the propriety of calling accentuation             sudden upward or
                                                       a
    downward percussion        of  the  voice, distinguishable not in all
    words, but- in those classes above denominated simple and
    rhetorical. The term simple seems properly to apply to
    such words as are pronounced with established accentua
    tion, while the latter suitably adheres to certain principle
                                                           a

words, independently of each other, is determined by cus
tom and authority ; but the compass and accentuation of
words connected or joined together, are discovered by the
natural powers of sensation, which reason corrects, im
proves, and methodizes.
    « The study of rhetorical accentuation would assist in
protecting the student against the appearance of coldness
and intellectual imbecility ; of being 4 uniformly slow and
regularly dull.'"
    Concluding his observations on accent, Mr.            W. remark
ed    ''  that rhetorical accentuation is of the greatest conse
quence to the expression of passion : a very short time
devoted to the acquirement of its theory, would render the
avenues of sympathy more attainable than whole years of
desultory practice without it.           Its judicious exercise would
assist, from time to time,         in  giving new stimulus to the
listening powers of       an  auditory."
    His next consideration was on "certain individual arti- •
culations, which are so constructed as to be sufficient of
themselves to excite peculiar sensations. — Whenever we
are under the immediate influence of passion, we na
turally make use of such words as seem best calculated to
imitate our feelings ; and these words, without any re
flection, are spoken with more expression and significancy
than the rest : by dwelling plaintively upon their syllables,
if the passion be grief — by gliding slowly and monotonous
ly over them, if the passion be melancholy — and hurrying
precipitately over them, if it be anger."
    In some striking poetical illustrations then adduced by
the lecturer, a single word, significantly echoing the sense,
 seemed, by a peculiar emphasis, almost to outrapture the
 meanings conveyed by the rest of the language.
                                                              " It is the
appropriate use of such words which gives to every passion
 characteristic variety.      At the instant of pronouncing them,
the    whole   soul  seems  to  be in action, and the tones and
tunes of voice, echoing        its  feelings, immediately check the
 common current of uniform cadence.
     "   In pronouncing words peculiarly imitative of sound
and motion, the voice may enter into the full spirit of the
imitation.        Yet must the admonition of our immortal bard
be duly considered — 1       If  this he over done,- or 'come tardy
 off",-  while  it makes  the  unskilful    laugh, it cannot but make
 the judicious grieve."
     Our limits will not admit the notes we made on the re
 mainder of this interesting discourse : we defer them,
 therefore, together with those we were enabled to collect on
 the seventh, eighth, and ninth lectures,                till our next
 number.                                                   Edinburgh

                .  EDINBURGH INSTITUTE.
   A general meeting of the members of this institute was
held in Mary's Chapel, on Tuesday the 22d of December,
for the purpose of receiving communications on subjects
connected with science, literature, and the arts. Dr. Millar
in the chair.
   Among other communications the following were re
ceived :
    1. Account of a fact in meteorology,       lately discovered
by Mr. John Hutton.        In certain states of the atmosphere
a succession    of small clouds appear over the summit of
Arthur-s Seat. Each of these clouds forms on the wind
ward side of the hill, apparently about one hundred feet
above the level of the summit, a line drawn perpendicularly
from the centre of the summit forming an angle of about
80 degrees, with a line drawn from the same point to the
place where the cloud begins to form on the windward
side    and an angle of about 60 degrees- with a line drawn
from that point to the place where the cloud disappears on
the leeward side.     The cloud passes right over the summit.
After an interval of two or three minutes another is formed
and disappears in the same way, and this continues. Mr.
Hutton first observed this phaenomenon in the end of July
last, about ten o'clock in the evening, the wind blowing
moderately from W. by S. Barometer 30, 11. He has ob
 served it since in August and September, at different times
of the day, and from different positions.
    2. Account of a portable printing press, invented by Mr.
John Ruth ven, Edinburgh. In this contrivance the pressure
is produced by a wheel and pinion acting on the end of a
 small lever.   It has apartments for holding ink, balls, and
every other article necessary, and prints off a form not exr
ceeding the size of a duodecimo page with the greatest
 correctness and celerity.    The press exhibited was about
 21 inches long, 6 broad, and 10 high, weighing about 22lbs.
 including the page of types, chase, balls, ink, &c. and was
 worked with great ease. An extract from the minutes of
 the night-s proceedings was printed off by it in the presence
 pf the meeting, and distributed among the members.
    3. An account of an improved syphon, by Mr. ArchU
 bald Kerr, mathematical instrument-maker.          This instru
 ment consists of a syphon with a stopcock j and a pump-
barrel with a piston, valve, &c.      The bottom of the barrel
 communicates with the inside, immediately above the stop-
 pock, at the end of the lower leg, for the purpose of exr
                                                         trading

trading the air and filling the syphon. The syphon is
filled in an instant by one or two strokss of the pump with
the hand, and the communication between the pump and
the syphon can be cut off at pleasure by a stop-cock.   The
principle is applicable to all sizes of syphons, and almost
every kind of liquor may be drawn off with the utmost fa
cility.   Mr. Kerr has already made many syphons on this
plan, and they are found to save considerablyboth liquor
and time.     When constructed in this way, the difficulties
attending the use of the common syphon are completely
removed, and the instrument is rendered so perfect that it
will probably be found incapable of any further improve
ment. A s-mall one was exhibited and worked in presence
of the meeting.
    4. Account    of another improved syphon by Mr. John
Hutton.      This syphon is extremely simple, and has been
used by  Mr. Hutton with much advantage in his chemical
manufactory.      It has a stopper at the extremity of the
longer leg, and    a valve opening inwards at the extremity
of the other.    It     is,
                       filled in the usual way       inverting it,
                                                         by
and pouring in the liquor at one end.        After this, the stop
cock being shut, the syphon         placed in its proper position,
                                           is
with the end of the short leg immersed in the liquor. The
stop-cock      then opened, and the liquor, forcing up the
              is
valve at the short end, flows out. When the quantify re
quired  isdrawn off, the stop-cock         shut, the valve at the
                                                is
other end falls down, and the syphon remaining full can be
kid aside and when            to be used again, nothing more
                                  is                                is

          ;
necessary than to put        into the liquor and turn the stop
cock.   A   syphon of this description, which Mr. Mutton
has employed for some time, was exhibited and used in
presence of the meeting.
   At the close of the proceedings the President observed,
that the regulations direct meetings of this kind to be held
occasionally     the course of each session
                   in                       and that,;  con   if
ducted as the meeting had been that night, they would
be productive of the greatest advantage in bringing into
notice many useful inventions, and giving publicity to im
provements,        by
                  which society at large might be benefited         ;
and he recommended to those (strangers as well as mem
bers) who might have          in their power to make such
                                      it
communications, to bring them forward at future meetings.

    Andrew Carmichael, e*q. read part of a paper of con
siderable length, jn which he adduced many reasons in
support of a new hypothesis of the nature of electricity,
viz. That the sun is the source of that principle, as well as
of light and heat ; and that the deoxygenating ray is the
base of the two electric fluids. — The facts he has collected
tend to demonstrate, that, in combination with the colorific
ray, it forms positive electricity ; and, in combination with
the calorific ray, negative electricity. — A more copious abs
tract of the theory will be given, after Mr. Carmichael has
read the remainder     of his paper.               v

.   It does not become us to hazard an opinion, when
botanists so eminent are at issue ; but their discussion has
at all events procured this incontestable advantage to science,
namely, that each of them, endeavouring to support his
opinion upon facts, has discovered and explained the internal
structure of the seed, and the mode of germination of many
plants which had been scantily or badly observed in this
respect. As a general thes-13, however, we shall venture to
say, that we never can be sure of the constancy of a. cha
racter, so long as its importance is not demonstrated by the
kind of influence which it exercises ; for every thing which
 rests only on simple, empirical observations, however nu
merous they may be, may be overturned by a single observa
tion of a contrary tendency. Now the influence of th«
 number and of the various forms of parts in vegetables, is
still too little known to entitle us to hope, for a long time,
to give to botanical characters that degree of rational cer
tainty which those of zoology have obtained.

    We ought also to observe, that the detailed description of
the family of the hydrocharideae, which M. Richard has
given in the course of this discussion, has a merit inde
pendent of the object in dispute ; namely, that of deter
mining more precisely the genera of which this family is
composed, and the number of which M. Richard has raised
to ten, because he has added five new ones to those with
which we were already acquainted.
    M. Lechenault de la Tour, one of the naturalists who
mailed with Captain Baudin, has given us some details upon
the trees with the juice of which the natives of Java,
Borneo, and Macassar poison their arrows, and which, by
 the name of the upas, has made so much noise.          Of these
poisons there are two kinds, the upas anthiara and the upas
 thieute.    Both kill in a few minutes by the slightest punc
 ture, but the latter is most violent : it is extracted from the
 root of a kind of strychnos, or nux vomica, which creeps
 up the branches of the tallest trees. The experiments made
 by Messrs. Delille and Majendie prove that it acts upon
 the spinal marrow, and causes tetanus and asphixia.        The
 former oozes out from a large tree, which M. Lechenault
 calls anthiara toxicaria, and which belongs to the family of
 the nettles.   Those who are wounded with an instrument,
 poisoned   in  this manner, evacuate copiously green and
 frothy matter, and die in violent convulsions. The natives
 eat the flesh of animals which die from similar effects, after
 merely cutting out the wounded part.
     M. Decandolle, the professor of botany at Montpelier,
 has promised to publish the new or little known plants of
  the excellent garden of which he has the charge, giving
  occasionally observations upon the genera to which these
  plants belong; and he has presented to the Class specimens
  which promise favourably of his future labours. The
  hundred plates which this work will contain are already
  designed.
     Our associate M. de Beauvois still continues his Flora
  of Opara and Benin, of which he has this year published
  the 12th and 13th numbers.       He announces for the 14th a

     Since the days of Black, it has been known that bodies
  are not vaporized   without absorbing a great quantity of heat,
  and that every evaporation cools the body from which it
                                                        emanates,

emanates, the more it is accelerated : on the other hand, we"
know that atmospherical pressure retards evaporation, and
 that this change of state takes place in vacuo the more
speedily, the more perfect the vacuum is.
    Mr. Leslie, fellow of the Royal Society of London, ha*
thought to increase still more this effect, by placing under
the recipient of the air pump bodies which are greedy of
moisture, and which, seizing the vapour as fast as it is
formed, multiplies indefinitelv its production ; and he ob
tained in this way a cold so rapid and violent, that water
froze in a few minutes. This is a method of always having
ice at command, almost without any other expense than the
fire necessary for once more drying the body greedy of
humidity which had been employed.
    Highly concentrated vitriolic acid and the muriate of
lime are the most convenient absorbents for this purpose.
    Two young chemists, Messrs. Clement and Desormes,
have been occupied with determining the limits of this
process, and the degree of ceconomy to which it can be
carried ; both from a calculation of the quantity of caloric
contained in the vapour of the water, and from the quantity
of charcoal necessary to produce a given quantity of vapour s
they ascertained that it requires but little more than one
part of charcoal to restore to its pristine state the absorbent
which served to freeze 100 parts of water. Thus 100
pounds of ice will only require a pound and a few ounces
of charcoal.
    We may increase the effect, by preventing any caloric
from getting     access externally ; and it is sufficient for this
           to render the recipient less of a conductor of he3t,
  y making it for instance of two plates of polished metal
Eurpose
    We derive also from this acceleration of the evaporation
in vacuo, increased by the presence of absorbents, a more
evident advantage, when it is required merely to dry humid
substances, because we then avoid making them undergo
the action of the fire, which always alters them more or less.
    Our associate the late M. Montgolfier had already con
ceived the idea of drying completely the sap of plants, and
particularly the juice of raisins, by the pneumatic pump; and
he ascertained that, by diluting the latter juice in water, after
it had been dried, it might still be fermented, and good wine
obtained from it ; but it cost him too much labour.
    It is nevertheless necessary to prevent their juices from
freezing, an inconvenience which would not be less trouble •
some than that which results from the effects of fire.— •.

                   Imperial Institute   of France.               65
Messrs. Clement and Desormes have invented a very sim
ple method of avoiding it. They surround the vessel which
contains thejuice to be evaporated with the absorbing matter }
and in this way the caloric which is liberated from the
vapour at the moment of absorption returns to the juice
which we are evaporating, and this circulation furnishes
what the new vapour requires.
    We may employ this process with considerable ceconomy,
if we begin by reducing the juice to the state of syrup by
means of a ventilator, which is also the invention of
Montgolfier, and which Messrs. Clement and Desormes have
described in the Annales de Chimie for October 1810.
The air pump is applied only when the ventilator no longer
produces any effect.
     It is easy to see how useful for domestic purposes, and
particularly for the navy and army, is this new art of pre
serving entire alimentary substances, by diminishing their
weight, and transporting in a small compass to great di
stances the fermentable matter which ought to furnish wine
and alcohol.
     The same chemists purpose to apply the evaporation in
vacuo to the drying of gunpowder, which will be less dan
gerous than the common method in which fire is employed.
     They have also devoted their attention to the common
 process of evaporation by means of fire, and have discovered
 a method of doubling the effects of a given quantity of
 combustibles over a liquid, e. g. a saline solution.          It is
 only necessary    to  collect the vapour of  a first portion of the
 liquid,   and  to  force it to pass through a second portion.
This vapour, when very much heated, gives off a great
 portion of its caloric to the new liquid which it passes
  through.
     But of all the arts, that which has reaped the most
 astonishing advantages from modern discoveries upon heat
 and vaporization, has been that of the distiller of spirits :
 the process which we are about to describe, is merely an
 imitation of those which have been attended with a small
  portion only of these advantages.
      This revolution, which already exercises a great influence
  over the prosperity of our Southern departments, originated
 with the late Edward Adam, a distiller of Montpelier.
      The basis of his process consists in heating a great part
  of the wash to be distilled by the vapour of spirits which
  rises from the cauldron, and in passing this vapour through
  a series of vessels partly immersed       in cold water, which
   make it deposit its aqueous particles, so that the spirit

of wine alone, very pure, is condensed iu the last refri
gerant.
   In this wav, instead   of heating at first in order to obtain
spirits of 19 degrees,   from   which we afterwards produced
by successive heats spirits of different strengths, we have
all at once any degree of strength we please.        Besides, the
old-fashioned alembic only received two charges per diem,/
whereas that of Adam receives eight, and it extracts a sixth
part more spirit from the same quantity of wine: it saves
two fifths of the combustibles        and three- fourths of the
manipulation,   and  finally  the  spirit which it furnishes has
never an empyreumatic       smell,
   With such advantages, it is not to be wondered that the
process in question has been so speedily and generally
adopted.    M. Duportal, a chemist of Montpelier, has
presented  to the Institute a very accurate description of                 it,
which has been printed, and            which he also points out
                                                   in
certain improvements        which have been suggested                      by
JM. Isaac Berard.
     It essential to notice, that the primitive idea of heating
          is
by vapour belongs to Count Rumford, who published              -in    it
London in 1798..            thus that

and without any useful application, may enrich whole pro

   Count Rumford, who has made so many. useful disco
veries, and who has made the ceconomizinsi        of heat so
peculiarly his  study,  has this year presented  tq the Class
several useful memoirs upon lights.
   After describing various new forms of lamps, adapted for
decorating apartments and serving for chambers, lanterns,
&c. without anv of the inconveniences generally complained
of, he endeavours to- resolve the great question which has
divided natural philosophers for upwards of     century, viz.     a

    On the contrary, if light is only a motion impressed on
iur, by the vibrations of the bodies which burn, its quantity
will be in proportion not to the quantity of this body which
shall have been burned, hut to the vivacity with which the
combustion shall have been effected, and particularly at the
time that each of its particles shall remain heated at the de
gree proper for giving an impulse to those of air.
    Having founded his experiments upon these ideas, with
lamps as well as candles, he found that the heat emitted in a
given time was always in proportion to the quantity of oil
or wax burnt, while the quantity of light furnished at the
same time varied in an astonishing degree, and depended
particularly on the size of the flame, a size which retards
its cooling: a small rush- light, for instance, gives sixteen.
times less light than a common taper, although burning as
much wax and heating the same quantity of water to the
lame degree.
         ©         »
    Thus every thing which supports the heat of the flame
contributes to increase the light, and we may attain some
most astonishing results.
    Count Rumford, who had ascertained by previous experi
ments that every flame is transparent with respect to another
flame, has combined his two discoveries ; and having con
structed lamps in which several flat wicks placed parallel lo
each other, mutually preserved each other from cooling, he
made them produce a light equal to fortv tapers; and he
thinks the intensity which we may reach has no bounds:
formerly it was considered impossible to carry the effect of
light beyond a certain length, because, by enlarging too
much the wicks with a double current of air, their light
diminished iti virtue of the causes to be accounted for by
the following experiments : —
    What we have said above of the cooling of bodies by eva
 poration, is a particular case of the law according to which
 every body which is dilated absorbs heat, whereas it is li
 berated by condensing.      This law is nevertheless subject
 to some exceptions, and some of them have been long since
 known and explained; such as those of nitre, which pie-
 serves on many occasions, in condensing, a great proportion
 of heat, the effects of which are sufficiently perceptible at
 the moment of the combustion of gunpowder ; but there
 are also some of these exceptions which depend upon more
 obscure causes, such as that which has been made known
 by M. Thillaye, professor in the Imperial School.
    The mixture of alcohol w ith water is always accompanied
 hy a rise in the temperature, and there is in general a
                               E  2                   stronger

 stronger   condensation    effected, tban there would be ac
 cording   to  the  proportional densities of the two fluids, a
 condensation      according to which we can account for this
heat.
    But M. Thillaye has found, that when the alcohol is
weak, so far from the mixture condensing, it is rarefied,
and nevertheless the heat is manifested in the usual man
ner.    He has constructed tables of his experiments, from
which we see that alcohol at 0-9544 of density begins to
exhibit rarefaction.      The maximum of the -effect is shown
when the alcohol is at 0-9688, and when we mix it with
one and a half its weight of water, and the elevation of
temperature is still two degrees.
    The contrary case, that of condensation of heat, produces
detonating substances, the best known of which is gun
powder.       One of the most dreadful is that kind of powder
in which we substitute instead of the nitre the oxygenated
muriate of potash ; but it is also one of the most dan
gerous, for it detonates on simple percussion; and even by
friction.     It has nevertheless been considered as calculated
for the priming of fire-arms, because, as it needs no spark
of fire, it never fails.
    Messrs. Bottee and Gengembre have contrived a powder,
which preserves the property of detonating by a shock,
without being liable to the danger of a spontaneous ex
plosion.      It is composed of 44 parts in the 100 of hyper-
oxygenated       muriate, 21 of common nitre, or nitrat of
          18   of sulphur, and seven of powder of lycopodium.

  t requires the shock of the hardest bodies, and, what is
more singular, the part only which sustains the blow de
tonates: the adjoining parts are only inflamed by com
munication, but they produce no explosion, so that this
 powder is absolutely harmless.       It is important therefore,
since it renders easy the use of a process which it has of
itself.
    The inquiries of chemists to discover substitutes for co
lonial produce continue to be carried on with great zeal.
    Our associate M. Deyeux has published a string of in
 structions on the culture of beet- root, with a view to render
 it more productive     of saccharine matter. M. Zanette has
 presented some experiments on the saccharine quality of
 the juice of maize.       M. Des-longchamps, a physician of
 Paris, has made some experiments on the effects of the
juice of garden poppy compared with the opium of the
 East.    He has found them similar, so far as regards the
juice obtained by the incision of the capsules, but twice as
                                                           weak

weak with respect to the juice obtained by expression, and
four times weaker in the extract from the leaves and stalks :
the first only has the peculiar odour on which the bad
effects of opium are thought to depend.
     M. Chevreul, assistant at the M/aseuin of NaturalHistory,
has made experiments upon pastil, with a view to illustrate
its effects as a substitute for indigo ; or rather, he has made
this interesting plant the object of researches still more
general, and better adapted for perfecting all the methods of
Vegetable analysis.      He has shown that the feculum of the
pastil is composed of wax, and of a combination of green
resin, of a vegeto-animal matter, and of an indigo in the
state of deoxidation, but which may easily again take back
its oxygen.      The filtered juice has also furnished him with
substances the number and variety of which are astonish
ing, and from which we may conclude, that some of those
which we have hitherto regarded as the immediate princi
ples of vegetables, may be divided without decomposition
into more simple principles.
    The same chemist has presented a similar series of ex
periments on Campeachy wood. He has discovered in it
-fifteen different principles, the most remarkable of which
 is that which he has called campechium, and to which this
 wood owes its dyeing properties.       This principle is a red
dish brown, without taste or smell ; it crystallizes ; gives
 out upon being distilled the same elements with ani
 mal substances ; is combined with all the acids and all the
Salifiable bases; and forms with the1 first of these substances
 red or yellow -combinations,     according to the quantity of
 a«id employed, and with the others violet blue combina
 tions ; and that with the more facility, as we may employ
it with more safety than the syrup of violets, in order to
 find out the alkalis; but the oxide of tin at the maximum
 forms an exception to this rule. It acts upon campechium
 like an acid, and reddens it; whereas the sulphuretted hy
 drogen, which under other circumstances            acts like the
  acids, takes the colour from campechium.
     Hitherto the theory of affinities had been applied only
 to the reciprocal decomposition of the soluble salts : it re
 mained to be seen, if the insoluble salts were also suscepti
 ble of changing principles with certain soluble salts.
     M. Duiong has examined this question in a general
 manner, in a memoir presented to the Class, and which is
 the first production or this young chemist. He first treats
 in particular of the action of the carbonates and of the sub-
 carbonates of potash and soda on all the insoluble salts,

and be attains this remarkable result : viz. that all the in
soluble salts are decomposed by the alcove two carbonates ;
but that the mutual change of their principles cannot be
completely effected in any case ; and reciprocally, that all
the soluble salts from which the acid may form an inso
luble salt with the base of the insoluble carbonates, are de
composed by the latter, until the decomposition has at
tained a certain limit, which cannot be exceeded ; so that,
in identical circumstances, combinations are produced ab
solutely opposite in their natures.       M. Dulong observes,
that there is perhaps no fact more evidently contradictory
 to Bergman-s theory of affinities.     He founds the explana
 tion which he gives of these phaenomena, in appearance
 contradictory, upon the changes which take place during
 decomposition ; in the degree of saturation of the alkali,
 which is always in excess, and forms a new application
 of the principle so well established by M. Berthollet,
 upon the influence of the mass in chemical phaenomena.
 Finally, he deduces from this theory a method of foreseeing
 what are the soluble salts susceptible of decomposing any
 given insoluble salt.
      The celebrated Schecle discovered in 1780, that Prussian,
 blue is only a combination of iron with a particular acid
 .which the chemists have since called Prussian acid. It had
  not hitherto been obtained mixed with abundance of water.
 M. Gay Lussac in decomposing the prussiate of mercury
  with the muriaiic acid by the aid of heat, by rectifying the
  product in flasks immersed in ice, and by rectifying it ovef
  carbonate and muriate of lime, succeeded in giving to the
  prussic acid the highest degree of concentration.       In this
  state, this  acid possesses remarkable properties.   Its smell
  is almost insupportable; and, what is more singular, it boils
  at a heat of 23 degrees and freezes at 15 ; an interval so
  inconsiderable, that when we place a drop upon a sheet of
  paper, the evaporation of part produces a sufficiency of
   cold to freeze the remainder.
      M. Boullay, a chemist residing at Paris, -to whom we are,
   indebted for the discovery of a phosphoiic ether, has also
  formed one with alcohol and arsenic acid : but for this
   purpose abundance of these substances must be employed.
  The properties of this ether are similar to those of sulphuric
   or common ether, and the theory of its formation is the same.

perties of several of the combinations of gold are very

    M. Oberkampf* jun. has presented, this year to the Class
a maiden performance on a chemical subject, in which he
has dispelled some errors.           He has produced sulphurcts
and pbpsphnrets of gold, and shows that the astonishing
differences, observed in the action of the alkalis on the so
lutions of gold, depend on the proportion of the alkali: if

true oxide of gold     :   there        not enough, the precipitate
                                         is
is  yellow, and    it      ismuriate with excess of oxide

difference of proportion of the acid does not produce less
varied effects.    Finally,         in
                                   the precipitation       bythe oxide
of tin, the results differ still more, according to the propor
tion of the oxide.        M. Oberkampfs has determined the
quantity of oxygen contained                the oxide of gold, and
                                              in
which    is such, that in 100 parts there are 909 of gold and
 9-i of oxygen.

 In    our xxxixfh volume, p. 152, we called the attention
 of our readers to     a melancholy histprv of the ravages of
  the small-pox in Norwich, as recorded in an Address to
  the Corporation of Guardians of the Poor of that city, deli
 vered Jan. 6, 1812, by Mr. Rigby; from which it appeared
 that at the close of the year 1807, a poor woman in the
 eruptive stage of the disease, having been brought to the
 city in the London waggon, and the judicious means pro
 posed by him for preventing its spread being neglected
 by those who had authority to carry them into effect, a
 great number of persons, probably more than twelve hun
 dred, caught the infection, of whom two hundred and three
 died. Notwithstanding the temporary failure of the endea
 vours of this benevolent and patriotic magistrate to per
 suade the corporation to adopt such necessary measures,
 we have great pleasure in finding from the following Nar
rative *, that they have been at length induced, on a re
appearance of the disease, to carry them into effect with
 complete success.                                                            i
    I  have much satisfaction in annexing the following ac
 count of the successful issue of my last application to the
 Court of Guardians, on the subject of small-pox f, and in
recording the extensive benefit which has already resulted
 to the city from the adoption of the simple and obvious
measures suggested by me ; and which, whether considered
with regard to the quantum of human life, in the first in
stance, unquestionably saved by             it,
                                       or as having established
a   practical fact, of no small importance, as    bears relation
                                                       it
both to the healing art and to the useful science of political
ceconomy    ;   or, further, as   may excite others to have re
                                      it
course to similar means of security against      loathsome and
                                                      a
destructive disease, cannot be uninteresting to humanity.
     Having learned in July last (1812), that the small-pox
had, in the preceding Whitsun week, been introduced into
Acle,   a   small town about eleven miles from Norwich, be
ing brought thither by        young man from London, who
                              a
had been incautiously discharged from the Small-pox Hos-

discouraging opposition.
                                                                    pital,

 clothes, the means of infection ; and that it had found its
 way to the several villages of Blofield,           Strumpshaw,
 Plumpstead, &c. more nearly in the vinicity of Norwich;
 I attended the monthly meeting of the Guardians on Tues
 day, August 4, 1812, for the purpose of making this fact
 known to them, and of representing the danger of receiving
 the infection, to which the poorer inhabitants of the city
 would, probably, be exposed.         The number of gentlemen
 present was not sufficient to constitute a court.      The ma
jority  however    concurred   in the  propriety of directing the
 attention of the public to the subject, and the following
 paper was ordered to be circulated :
                           " Small-Pox.
    " The   corporation of Guardians of the Poor, in this city»
 having    received   information that the small-pox prevails
 much in the neighbourhood of Norwich, and that there
is every reason to fear that it may soon find its way into the
 city, and great numbers of the children of the poorer
inhabitants being liable to take the infection, the court
 earnestly recommends that all such children should be im
mediately vaccinated, and for this purpose the city sur
geons have received directions to vaccinate all who may
 apply to them, without any expense.           And to induce the
 parents of such children to comply with this recommenda
 tion, the court thinks it right to state, that when the small
 pox last visited the city, about three years ago, more than
two hundred individuals were sacrificed to it; which ca
 lamity might have been averted, had a similar measure to
 that now recommended taken place at that time.
   " Norwich, August 4, 1812."
    This made a considerable impression on the inhabitants,
and the early efforts of two gentlemen, who merit, on this
occasion, the most respectful notice, contributed much to
 forward its important object. Mr. Deacon, one of the
city surgeons, on seeing the paper, thought it right imme
diately to go round his district, with the hope of inducing
the poor families to consent to vaccination, and he had
soon the satisfaction of reporting to me more than forty in
dividuals who were ready to undergo it ; and the Rev. Mr.
Talbot, minister of St. Mary-s, also visited the poor in
his parish ; in doing which he found a case of small
pox, which he reported to me ; and being convinced of
the fact,     I  requested the governor to call a special
court of guardians, for further discussing the subject, and
adopting such means of securing the city from the disease,
as the urgency of the circumstances        seemed to demand.
                                                             The

?4                              On Vaccination.
    The court met on the 13lh of August 18t2, and was.
well -attended. I stated the fact of the small-pox being in
the city— that I was convinced there were more than a
thousand poor children in it liable to take the infection —
that vaccination was Che most obvious, practicable,     and
efficacious means of securing them — that I had reason to
believe the prejudices of the poor against it had much sub
sided*; which belief, derived, in some degree, from my
own intercourse with them, had been much strengthened,
by Mr. Deacon-s recent report ; and wishing this favoura
ble disposition of the poor to be taken advantage of, I sug
gested the policy of increasing the motive to their consent
to vaccination, by a small pecuniary gratification ; and as
a further means of preventing     the more immediate com
munication of the disease from those who might then la
bour under           it,
                    recommended that the regulations sug

                                      a

in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and

   " Resolved — That the following Regulations to prevent
                                 ;
the spread of the small-pox be printed and circulated, to
gether with the last Report of the National Vaccine Esta

                           in
reception of any person who may be infected with the small
pox, and who may be consenting to be removed thither.
   " First. — Suffer no person who has not had the small
pox or cow-pox to come into the infectious house.            No
visitor, who has any communication with persons liable to
the distemper, should touch or ait down on any thing                        in
fectious.
 *   I  have ever been convinced, when time and repeated experiment had.
Unequivocally established the efficacy of vaccination,   and the poorer classes
had fairly witnessed the security     itgives against the^smali-pox, that theii-
prejudices respecting      would cease, and"thcy would as readily ^vail them

    "  Second. —No patient, after the pox have appeared, must
be suffered to        into the street or other frequented place.
    " Third. — 1gohe utmost attention to cleanliness is abso
lutely necessary.       During and after the distemper, no per
son-s clothes, food, furniture, dog, cat, money, medicines,
or any other thing that is known or suspected to be daubed
with matter, spittle, or other infectious discharges of the
patient, should go out of the house till they be washed, and
till they have been sufficiently exposed to the fresh air.
No foul linen, or any thing else that can retain the poison,
should be folded up and put into drawers, boxes, or be
otherwise shut up from the air, but immediately thrown
into water and kept there till washed.             No attendant*
should touch what is going into another -family tili their
hands are washed.           When a patient dies of the small-pox,
particular care should be taken that nothing infectious be
taken out of the house so as to do mischief.
    '' Fourth. — The patient must not be allowed to approach
 any person liable to the distemper till every scab is dropt
 off ; till all the clothes, furniture, food, and all other things
 touched by the patient during the distemper, till the floor
 of the sick chamber, arid till his hair, face, and hands have
 been carefully washed.        After every thing lias been made
 perfectly clean, the doors, windows, drawers, boxes,- and
 all other places that can retain infectious air, should be
    "
 kept open till it be cleared out of the housed
        Resolved —That a reward of half-a-crown be giveh td^.
 every poor person resident within the city of Norwich, who
 shall be vaccinated by the city surgeons, at the Norwich
 dispensary, or in any other way, .provided they produce to
 the committees a satisfactory proof of the fact.
     " Resolved —That the thanks of this court be given to
 Edward R:gby,Esq. for his unremitting attention to the
 important subject of the small-pox — for the measures now
 proposed by him, and adopted by this court, in consequence
 of the disease being at this time in Norwich ; and particu
 larly for the able manner in which he has advocated the
  practice of vaccination, /aid so satisfactorily obviated the
  popular objections to it.         By the court,     Simpson."
      The report of the N:il'ona' Vaccine Establishment be
  ing, in so many hands, and being moreover a parliamentary-
  record, it has not been thought necessary to reprint it.
      The vaccination began immediately, and the readiness
  with which the poor submitted to it is proved by the fol
  lowing returns, which appeared -in the Norwich papers :

1 24i. 5s. having been paid by the court to this day, Oct. 26,
1812. 361 of these belonged to the country; for it was the
liberal policy of the court to make no distinction between
aliens and those belonging to Norwich : it was, indeed, ob
viously requisite to vaccinate all, for the security of all.
   Means having been taken to prevent communication
.with the child who brought the disease from the country,
no one caught it from this source ; and if the same measures
be persevered in, we may confidently calculate upon a per
manent security from it. Compared with the population
of the place, I believe in no instance, in this country at
least, have «o many individuals been vaccinated in so short
a period;    and the immediate      consequent exclusion of
small-pox when more than 1300 individuals were pre
viously liable to      it,
                        at once an irrefragrable proof of the
                             is
protecting power   of vaccination,   and of the magnitude of

                           Providence in its discovery.

     Four females each had umbilical and double femorat
hernia, five females each had umbilical and single femoral
hernia.
     Four males each had left femoral and right inguinal-
hernia, one male had left inguinal and left femoral hernia,
one male had left inguinal and right femoral hernia, one
male had right inguinal and left femoral hernia, one male
had double inguinal and right femoral hernia, one male had
double inguinal and double femoral hernia, two males had
ventral and right inguinal hernia, one male had umbilical
and left inguinal hernia, and four males each had umbilical
and double inguinal hernia; 315 patients had congenital
hernia.
     From the most accurate estimation, it appears that this
malady exists in one person in eight through the whole
male population of this kingdom, and even in a much
greater proportion among the, labouring classes of the com
munity, in manufacturing districts, particularly in those
              who are employed in weaving, or on the water -as
   oatmen.

 XIII.   An Attempt   to determine the definite and simple   Pro
   portions, in which the constituent Parts of unorganic Sub
   stances are united with each other.   By Jacob Berze-
   lius, Professor of Medicine and Pharmacy, and M.R.A.
   Stockholm.
                      [Continued from page 8.]
                  II. Lead      and Sulphur.
     1. )Ten    grammes of very pure lead were melted, in a
  small glass retort, with ten grammes of pure lemon-coloured
 sulphur, which had heen carefully sublimed and melted in
 a strong heat, in order to expel the moisture.    The opening
 of the retort was connected with a small pneumatic appa
 ratus, but no perceptible quantity of gas was emitted, ex
 cept a little sulphurous acid gas, which had occupied the
 place of the oxygen that had disappeared.       The mass was
 ignited until the yellow colour, produced in the retort by
 the sulphurqus acid fumes, was no longer visible: and
 while the apparatus cooled, some water was absorbed in
 the place of the air that had been forced out.    I cut off the
body of the retort, and found the weight of       the sulphuret
 11-55 gr.
    2. ) A repetition of the experiment gave 11-555 grammes
of the sulphuret.
    3. ) The experiment was repeated with the additional pre
caution of burning a little sulphur in the receiver cemented
to the retort, and strongly heating       it,
                                           before the retort it
self was warmed, so as to deprive the air in the receiver of
its oxygen.     The retort was heated till     began to bend.
                                                 it
The sulphuret     weighed n-56 grammes.        Consequently
100 parts of pure lead take up 15-6 of sulphur, or exactly
twice as much as of oxygen.      I have not been able to dis
cover any other sulphuret of lead than this.       We have
therefore for the sulphuret of lead,
                Lead 86-51               100-0
                        13-49             15-6
  Wenzel, on Affinities, gives 86-8 and 13-2 for the pro
portion of the lead to the sulphur.
                III. Sulphur     and Oxygen.
   Klaproth, Bucholz, and Richter have very accurately ex
amined the proportion of oxygen in the sulphuric acid, and
their experiments agree extremely well with each other.
But it  became so much the more necessary to repeat these

experiments, as Davy had conjectured that sulphur and
phosphorus contained unknown metallic bodies, united
with small portions of hydrogen and oxygen, and bore
nearly the same relations to these bases as the resins do to
carbon. He has indeed advanced so many ingenious ar
guments in favour of this hypothesis, that it can scarcely be
called altogether void of probability : at the same time I
cannot consider it as perfectly consistent with my experi
ments : for, when I have used sulphur that was perfectly
dry, and had been enough melted, I have never been able to
discover any trace of sulphureted hydrogen, or of aqueous
vapour, emitted during the combination of metals with sul
phur. But I have often observed, that when I have em
ployed washed and apparently well dried or rapidly melted
flowers of sulphur, no moisture made its appearance while
the sulphur remained melted over the metal ; but when, at
the moment of combination, the heat became more intense,
a small quantity of sulphureted hydrogen has been evolved,
and aqueous vapour has been deposited on the gltss, a little
 sooner than the sulphur which was sublimed at the same
 time.      Consequently, either the oxvgen and hydrogen
found by Davy depended only on the accidental presence of
moisture, or they enter, together with the unknown basis,
 into combination with the metals; which is much more
 contrary to analogy than the parallel, between sulphur and
 the resins is supported by analogy.      We shall also see that
 these substances, if they are present in sulphur, must be
 retained when it combines with oxygen to form an acid.
 Sulphur and phosphorus, and, as I suspect, boraciuin,
 fluorium, and carbon, give, with the metals, combinations
 of a very different character from those of the metals with
 each other.     They cannot be alloyed in all possible pro
 portions with metals, but are limited either to a single
  proportion, or to a few definite degrees, between which
  there are no intermediate steps.
                       A.   Sulphuric- Acid.
      In order to avoid all mechanical adherence of moisture,
  I  employed in this investigation the sulphuret of lead.
      1.) Ten grammes of finely powdered -sulphuret of lead
  were digested with aqua regia in a weighed glass flask, as
  long as any( oxygenization was perceptible ; and the mass
  was then dried and ignited : it weighed 12-65gr.        It was
  afterwards digested with water, to which a little     concen
   trated vinegar had been added ; but the liquid acquired no
  sweet taste, and contained no lead.     Consequently the sul
                                                             phur

                       On definite Proportions.                  83
phur of the sulphuret had been sufficient to form so much
sulphuric acid, as was necessary for neutralising, the oxide
of lead.
  2. ) In      a second experiment   the residuum   weighed 12-64
  3. )       The experiment wasa^ain repeated in a glass retort
with     receiver, and the acid which passed over was poured
         a
back and distilled once more from the mass in the retort.
The last part of the product was kept separate, but it af
forded no perceptible trace of sulphuric acid ; consequently
the oxide of lead was sufficient to saturate all the acid
which was formed from the sulphur of the sulphuret.
    Hence I conclude, that since the sulphuret of lead con
tains its constituent     parts precisely in the proportion,
which is necessary for the formation of the sulphate, the
oxide of lead must contain exactly half as much oxygen
as the sulphuric acid contains sulphur.      Probably the same
rule holds good for the combination of sulphur with other
combustible bodies : hence it will follow of necessity, that
the quantity of any oxide required for saturating a given
portion of sulphuric acid must contain half as much oxy
gen as there is sulphur in the acid ; that is, if my experi
ments on the oxide and the sulphuret of lead have not
been completely erroneous.
    The quantity of sulphur in the sulphuric acid may be
easily determined from these experiments.        Ten grammes
of the sulphuret of lead having; taken up 2-65 of oxygen,
•675 of this belongs to the S 651 of lead, the remaining
 T975 formed, together with 1-349 of sulphur, 3-324 of sul
phuric acid. Consequently 100 parts of sulphuric acid
consist of .40-58 sulphur and 59 -42 oxygen.         The second
experiment gives    40- 7 and 59-3  : and 100  parts of the acid
would require for     their  saturation, according to the first
experiment, 280-5, and according to the second, 281 of
the oxide of lead ; a degree of coincidence          which can,
scarcely be exceeded.
    In order to ascertain what dependence can be placed on
these results, it was necessary to examine the composition
of the sulphate of lead.
    a.) The 10-77 grammes of oxide of lead, obtained in the
first of my experiments on the yellow-oxide, were dissolved,
in the same dish, in nitric acid, and then mixed with sul
phuric acid as long as any precipitate could be observed;
and afterwards dried and ignited. They afforded 14-62 gr.
of sulphate of lead ; consequently 100 parts of sulphuric
acid had combined with 280 of the oxide.
                                  F2                      I.)   Ten

  84                  On definite Proportions.
     I.)  Ten grammes of lead were dissolved in nitric acid
  mixed with sulphuric, dried by evaporation, and ignited in
  the flask.   The sulphate weighed 14 635, and 100 parts of
  the acid had combined with 2S0 of the oxide.
     c.) Ten grammes of oxide of lead were dissolved in nitric
  acid, in a dish of platina, sulphuric aoid was added, the
  mixture was then dried and ignited. I obtained 13-575 gr.
  of sulphate of lead, which gives the same proportion as
 before.
     These three experiments, agreeing so perfectly with each
 other, indicate a small inaccuracy in the analysis of the
 Sulphuric acid. This depends on the sublimation of a little
 of the sulphur of the sulphuret of lead employed, leaving
 the base of the salt somewhat redundant ; the muriatic acid,
 which combines with this redundant portion, being ex
 pelled by ignition.    Hence it is probable that the quantity
 of sulphur ought not to be made greater than 40-52 for
 loo of sulphuric acid: but in order to avoid any hypo
 thetical corrections, we may safely employ the first experi
ment as a basis for calculation, and consider sulphuric acid
 as  consisting of
              Sulphur   4058       .       lOO-OOO

    I  must here remark, that Bucholz and Klaproth have
 founded their determinations on the quantitv of sulphate
 of baryta afforded by a given quantity of sulphur : and as
 there is some difference in the results of their experiments,
1 have thought it right to repeat them.
    In the carbonate of baryta, Klaproth and Rose found
 22 parts of acid and "8 of earth ; Bucholz, on the contrary,
never obtained more than 21 per cent, of carbonic acid.
The greatest difficulty is to obtain the carbonate quite pure,
 since it is so often contaminated with iron, alkali, or sul
 phuric acid. I have only been able to procure it by precipi
 tation from the pure uncrystallized nitrate of baryta with
 carbonate of ammonia.        I washed the precipitate with
boiling water until it no longer indicated the presence of
baryta upon the addition of sulphuric acid ; for the car
bonate of ammonia does not completely precipitate the
whole of the baryta, even when it is employed in excess.
The washed powder was strongly ignited in a dish of pla
tina.
    a.) Ten grammes of this carbonate were dissolved in di
luted sulphuric acid, the apparatus being weighed, and thfe
gas caused to pass through a tube filled with muriate of
lime, which was also w eighed. The solution was pro
                                                         moted

                         On definite Proportions.                      89
moted by the heat of a small lamp : but the fluid was not
sufficient for the solution of the salt that, was formed.
After twelve hours, when no more bubbles were extricated,
2-1 1 grammes had been lost.       I took the solution with the
salt out of the flask, and mixed       in it,
                                            dish of platina, with
                                                   a
sulphuric acid,  when    slight
                              a effervescence   again took place.
The mass was then dried in          gentle
                                      a    heat,  and afterwards
ignited.      afforded 11-866 gr. of the sulphate.

for 100 parts of the carbonate, we have 21 -6 of carbonic
acid, and 118-4 of the sulphate.
   c. ) Ten grammes of carbonate of baryta were dissolved,
in the same apparatus, in diluted muriatic acid, and the
solution assisted        by
                      such   degree of heat, as the hand could

                           it                      They afforded
2-165 gr. of carbonic acid, and 11-82 of sulphate of baryta.

thing more from this compound.        The acids which      haveI
employed were always so pure as to leave no spot on                    a
watch glass from which they were made to evaporate.
   In these experiments, therefore, 100 parts of carbonate
of baryta had afforded at least 216 of carbonic acid; ten
thousandths can never be appreciated in experiments of
this kind.   We may therefore assume, for the carbonate,
              Carbonic acid 21-6              100
              Baryta           78         4   363
   Since 100 parts of the carbonate of baryta, which con
tain nearly 78-4 of the base, give from 118          to llo of
                                                           6
sulphate of baryta,    this compound   must  consist   of 33-g6
to 34-1 of acid, with 66-04 to 65-9 of base, and 100 pans
of the acid must require 193-0 to 194       of baryta. Since
                                                       5

 is of little consequence, I have assumed throughout this
 Essay, for the component parts of the sulphate of baryta,
               Sulphuric acid 34                    100
               Baryta              66               194
     If we took a mean of the six experiments which have
 been related, giving 1 18-627 of sulphate of baryta for 100
 of carbonate, the proportion would become
               Sulphuric acid 33-9                  100
               Baryta               66-1            195
    Klaproth obtained, from     1 00  grains of carbonate of baryta,
  120 of dry sulphate, and Bucholz 119|, which were re
 duced by ignition to 117.        Hence Klaproth calculated that
 the salt consisted of 33 acid and 67 base, Bucholz 32-48
 and 67-52.      They both employed precipitation and filtra-
-tion. In the process of filtration it is scarcely possible to
 avoid loss, and the different degrees of moisture in the
 filler cause great uncertainties in its weight, since it cannot
 be weighed hot in a good balance, without giving a result
 considerably too small.       I have therefore avoided this pro
 cess as much as possible ; but where it was indispensable,
 I  have employed English copying paper, made for Watt-s
 patent machines, which I have previously washed, and
 dried in as strong a heat as it could support without burn
 ing. The largest filters that I have used weighed less
 than -75 gramme, and their weight has never varied more
 than -006 gr., nor even so much, unless they were left
 very long in the scale.       The smaller ones, which weighed
 from "1 to -25 gr. have never varied perceptibly.             I have
 removed the mass lying on the filter, without sen ping off"
 the small quantity which was firmly attached to it ; and
 having weighed and ignited that which l had removed, I
 have computed the diminution of the whole quantity by
 the operation.
     Bucholz (Scher. X, 385,) boiled 100 grains of sulphur
 with aqua regia, until it was converted into sulphuric acid,
 from which he obtained 724 gr. of sulphate of baryta;
 and hence, according to his determination of the compo
  sition of this salt, it follows that 100 parts of sulphuric
 acid contain 42-5 of sulphur.          According to my analysis,
 these   724 grains contain 246      16 of the acid; giving 146M6
 of oxygen to too of sulphur;           and,  for 100 of the acid,
 40 624^ of sulphur and 5^-376 of oxygen.                  Bucholz-s
  experiment    therefore   agrees    with   mine,  within   -00044.
 Bucholz employed         sulphur    which    had  been   kept   long
 melted in   a strong heat ; mine was ignited        in combination
                                                                 with

                     On definite Proportions.                  87
with     a metal ; whence it follows that sulphur is easily-
freed by melting from the moisture which adheres to it.
     With respect to Klaproth-s analysis, it is not so accurate
as that of Buchclz.        He treated 200 grains of pure sulphur
with nitric acid ; 4S| grains remained unaltered, the 151f,
which were oxygenized, afforded 1082 of sulphate of
baryta, so that 100 parts of sulphur gave 15 less of the
sulphate than in Bucholz-s experiment : and yet the ex
periment was not repeated.          At the same time it happens,
from the different estimates which these chemists have
formed of the composition of the sulphate of baryta, that
they agree in their determinations        of the quantity of sul
phur in the sulphuric acid.
     Richter-s experiment (Richter v. 125) was performed in
a different manner.        He converted 222 grains of flowers of
sulphur, by means of the smoking nitric acid, into sul
 phuric acid. The acid liquor was saturated with carbonate
of lime, then dried and washed with alcohol and a little
 nitric acid, to separate from it the nitrate and carbonate of
lime.      The gypsum, when ignited, weighed 947 grains.
Now, if 100 parts of this salt contain 58 of the acid, 947
 must contain 549| ; so that 222 grains of sulphur must
 have taken up 327| of oxygen, and 100,147]-: hence 100
 parts of ihe acid must contain 40-44 of sulphur, which
 agrees again very nearly with my experiments alreadv re
 lated.    But if the proportion of acid in gypsum has been
 taken a little too great, Richter-s experiment approaches
 still nearer to mine. Bucholz obtained, in an analysis of
 300 grains of gypsum, 63 grains of water of crystallization,
 99 grains of lime, and .402 of ignited sulphate of baryta,
 from which the presence of 136-7 gr. of sulphuric acid
 may be inferred.        These quantities, added together, make
 298-7 gr. and the loss is onlv 13, while, if we reckon
 according to Bucholz-s proportions, it becomes a little more
 than 6 gr.      Bucholz, finding this loss pretty constant in
 several experiments, inferred from it that a, part of the wa
  ter adhered to the gypsum,, notwithstanding the ignition.
 The component parts of gypsum, according to the propor
  tions here assigned, are 58 of acid, and 42 of lime; but
  it is probable, that in the analvsis performed by Bucholz,
  a loss of lime also took place, by which the proportion of
  the acid to the base becomes too great.         Klaproth found
 in ignited gypsum 57-63 of acid, and 42-37 of base.
                      ..  B. Sulphurous Acid.
     To determine the composition of the sulphurous acid by
                                    F4                      direct

8S                    On definite Proportions.
  direct experiments with burning sulphur, is a task of in
  superable difficulty.    I therefore chose rather to convert a
  sulphite into a sulphate by means of the nitric acid.
     Neutral muriate of baryta was mixed with a solution of
  crystallized sulphite of ammonia, the precipitate was placed
  on a filter, and washed with boiling water till the water had
  no effect on a solution of silver; the mass was then dried
 by pressure between the folds of some thick blotting paper,
  quickly spread in a saucer, and dried in a warm stove.
 When I dissolved a little of this salt in muriatic acid, the
 fluid was not perceptibly turbid, so that scarcely any sul
 phate of baryta was contained in it.
     1. ) Three grammes of this sulphite of baryta were put
 into a flask; nitric acid was poured on them, and they were
  digested with it as long as any nitrous gas was evolved, and
 then dried and ignited in the flask.         The mass weighed
 only 3- 17 gr., it showed not the slightest trace of an excess
 of baryta. But 3- 1 7 gr. of the sulphate of baryta contain
 •66x3-17 = 2-0922 of the earth.
     2. ) Three grammes of the same salt were mixed with
 30 of ignited yellow oxide of lead, and the whole was
 heated in a-- small glass retort, furnished with a long and
 well corked neck.       The neck, in which the water of cry
 stallization of the salt was collected, was cut off and
 weighed.       By the evaporation of the water it lost -0425 in
 weight. The water was entirely without taste.
     The sulphite of baryta consisted therefore of
             Baryta             209-22             69-74
             Sulphurous acid      86 53            28-84
             Water           ,     4-25             1-42
     3. ) I again dissolved three grammes of the same salt in
 nitric acid, and when the effervescence was ended, added
 some nitrate of baryta, as a test of sulphuric acid, to the
filtered solution; it did not become turbid, any more than
 another portion into which sulphuric acid was dropped;
 consequently the baryta is united with the same quantity
 of sulphur in the sulphite as in the sulphate, that     is,   with
 20-9    for  every 100 parts   of  the  earth; and   we shall  see
 hereafter,    that
                 if    there actually existsa    combination be
 tween the base of baryta and sulphur, the proportion of
 this base, and of sulphur   in   it,  must be the same as  in  the
 sulphate and the sulphite; and also, at least as    I   presume,
in the.sulphuret, and in the hydrosulphuret, or hydrotheate
 of baryta, although the experiments which        I    have made
 with these last combinations- have not afforded me very sa
 tisfactory results..
                                                               Now,

                   On definite Proportions.                    89
  Now, if three grammes of sulphite of baryta contain
•8653 of sulphurous acid, and 3-17 gr. of the sulphate,
into which they are changed by oxygenization, implv the
presence of -4374 gr of sulphur, the remaining .4279 gr.
of the acid must be oxygen.    Consequently 100 parts of
sulphur take up 97 83 of oxygen, in order to form sul
phurous acid ; and this acid consists of
             Sulphur 50-55               100-00
             Oxygen   49-45             97 83
  If  we took for the sulphate 33-9 of acid and 66-1 of
earth, the 3 grammes of sulphite would appear to contain
•8621 of acid, and -4361 of sulphur; whence the propor
tions would become
             Sulphur 50-59             100-00
               Oxygen     49-41     -          97-69
    [The  author  seems  to have  omitted   to notice some other
determinations,     as having been deduced from inaccurate
Suppositions respecting the component parts of the sulphate
of baryta. Mr. Chenevix converted 14-4 parts of sulphur,
by means of nitric acid, into 100 parts of sulphate of
baryta, to which he attributed only 23-55 of sulphuric acid,
and hence concluded that the acid consisted of 6 1 -5 of sul
phur, and 38-5 of oxygen.       But, if we employ Mr. Berze-
lius's determination of the proportions of the sulphate of
baryta, it will appear that 14-4 sulphur must have afforded
at least 34 parts of sulphuric acid ; whence the sulphuric
acid should consist of 42-4 of sulphur, and 5 7-6 of oxygen.
But these experiments by no means agree with each other
so well as those of Mr. Berzelius:         Mr. Berthollet's ana
lysis, in  the Memoirs   of the Institute  for 1806, which gives
"5385 of sulphur, and -4615 of oxygen, led Mr. Gay-Lussac,
in his interesting investigations respecting the decomposi
tion of the sulphuric compounds by heat, to the erroneous
conclusion, that the sulphurous acid contains only 50"6l
of oxygen to 100 of sulphur, instead of at least 95-86,
which is the proportion determined by Berzelius. The
Same chemist, in his remarkable essay on the combinations
of gases, has assigned to the sulphuric acid 42-016 of sul
phur, and 57-984 of oxygen, and to the sulphurous,
52-083 of sulphur, and 47912 of oxygen; but his data re
quire some very considerable corrections. — Gilbert.]
   Since 100 parts of sulphur are combined in the sul
phurous acid with 97-83 of oxygen, and in the sulphuric
with H6-427, the latter number being very nearly half as
much more as the former, since 97-83+48-96= 146-74, it
follows that the same quantity     oj:  sulphur takes up  in  the

  90           Observations on the Measurement           of
  sulphuric acid half as much more oxygen as in the sul
  phurous.    IF we compare with this result the proportions
 of the combinations of lead, it mav be proposed as a ques
 tion for future examination, whether sulphur may not be
 capable of a lower degree of oxygenization than it exhibits
 in the sulphurous acid, or of a higher than in the sul
 phuric.                    [To  be continued.]
 XIV.    Observations on the Measurement         of three Degrees of
     the Meridian conducted in England            by   Lieut. -Colonel
     William Mudge.             By Don Joseph Rodriguez.
     Communicated     by  Joseph de Mkndoza Rios, Esq.
     F.R.S.
                        [Concluded from p. 30.]
 From      what has been above stated, it seems almost beyond
 a doubt that it is to errors    in the observations of latitude,
 that the appearance of progressive augmentation of degrees
 towards the equator, as represented by Lieut. Col. Mudge
 in his paper, are to be ascribed, and that it is especially at
 the intermediate station at Arbury Hill, that the observa
 tions of the stars are erroneous nearly five seconds, not
 withstanding the goodness of the instruments, and the skill
 and care of the observer.        But, before I insist further on
 this head, I will answer one objection that may be made to
 the principles of the method that I have pursued in this
 memoir.
    Those astronomers,      who have hitherto undertaken the
measurement of degrees of the meridian, have deduced
 their measures by simply dividing the linear extent by the
 number of degrees and minutes found by observation of
the fixed stars taken at the two extremities of the arc. This
is indeed the most simple that can be adopted ; arid it has
the advantage of being independent of the elliptic figure of
the earth, especially in arcs of small extent.          The elements
dependent    on this figure,   are  too  uncertain   to  be employed
in calculating the angular       intervals  in  the   short distances
between successive stations, even as a means of verification,
without risk of committing greater errors than those to
which astronomical observations can be liable. Accordingly
one cannot safely make any use of it in cases where great
accuracy is required.
    I must admit the justness of this objection, and must
therefore show the extent to which it really applies to the
present subject.
                        I
   In the first place, may suppose, tjiat in consequence of
                                                                some

                   three Degrees  of the Mei-idian.             91
Some fault in the instrument, with respect to vertical posi
tion, construction, or some accidental derangement, there
is an error of some seconds in the observations of the fixed
stars.   How is this to be discovered ? This is not to be
done by comparing the value of a degree on the meridian,
as deduced from these observations, with the results of other
measurements in distant parts of the globe.         For if we find
that these degrees so taken do not agree in giving the same
ellipsoid, we are not to attribute all the differences to irre^
gularities of the earth, without supposing any error on the
part of the observer, of his instrument, or of other means
employed in his survey.
    But this, in fact, is what has generally been done.          It
must, however, be acknowledged, that the majority of ob
servers have not been in fault, as they could do nothing
better ; but too much reliance has been placed on the good
ness of their instruments, their means, and other circum
stances.     It is true that irregularities of the earth and local
attractions may occasion considerable discrepancies which
are even inevitable ; but before we decide that these are
the real source of disagreement, we ought carefully to as
certain that there are no others.
    But to return to our subject, of the English measure
ment.     If the uncertainty which yet subsists, with respect
to the exact figure of the earth and its dimensions, occa
sions some small errors in the calculation of the series of
triangles, the sum of these errors will be found in the esti
mate of the entire arc, and will increase in proportion to
the extent of the arc measured.            Now, in the English
measurement, we find exactly the reverse of this.          For the
difference between the results of calculation and observation
is only l",38 on the whole arc j but is even as high as
4",77 on one of the smaller arcs. , So that, whatever error
we may suppose to have been introduced into the calcula
tion by assuming a false estimate of the spheroidity of the
 earth, or of other elements employed in the calculation, it
is very evident that the zenith distances of stars taken at
Arbury Hill are affected by some considerable error, wholly
independent of these elements.
    It was not till the date of the measurement of the me
 ridian in France, that M. Delambre published and ex
plained, with admirable perspicuity and elegance, all the
formulae and methods relative to the calculation of sphe
roids, and put it in the power of astronomers in general to
make use of the elliptic elements in verifying the results of
their observations.      In the present state of science these
                                                          elements

   92                Observations on the Measurement        of
   elerrfents      are well known, and the errors that can arise
   from any uncertainty in them, are not so considerable as is
   generally supposed.           The oblateness and the diameter at
   the equator are the only elements wanting in the calculation :
   for the purpose of seeing what effect our present uncertainty
   respecting them can have on the subject in question, I have
   employed three different estimates of the oblateness -j-^-,
   Ti7,   and ^5-5-^. With respect to the radius of the equator,
   that is ascertained with sufficient precision by the mean of
   the arc extending from Greenwich to Formentera, corre
   sponding to latitude 45° 4' 18". The value of the degree
   in toises is 57010,5, and it is highly probable that in this
   estimate the error does not amount to so much as half a
   toise, as it is deduced from an entire arc of 12° 48' between
   the two extremities, the latitudes of which have been de
  termined with extreme care, and by a great number of ob
  servations.
      The following are the logarithms of radius at the equator,
  which I have employed as adapted to each degree of oblate
  ness, and opposite to them are placed the corresponding
  computed estimates of the entire arc between Clifton and
  Dunnose.

  so that     the greatest difference is but 0",38.           Let us sup
  pose   it o",4,      or  even  0",5, for   the second   calculation was
  made only by means           of the  western series of triangles, and
  the third only with the eastern ; but even then the error
 arising from uncertainty in the elements is not half the
 difference we find between the results of computation and
 of observations of the fixed stars. It appears therefore,
 that these elements are bv no means to be neglected as a
 method of verification 5 and in fact the quantity of l",38
 is so small, that it is extremely difficult to ascertain this
 quantiiy with the very best instruments. Of this we shall
 find further proof hereafter ; but as this discussion is not
 without its use, I shall enter into some details on this sub
ject.
     The measurement           in Lapland was performed by means
of a double           metre,  and  with a repeating circle of Borda,
sent by the National Institute of France.                In order to see
 to what degree of accuracy the arc computed would agree
with that obtained by observations of the pole star above
and below the pole, I assumed an oblateness of T^T, and as
logarithm of radius 1 had 6,5147500 expressed in toises
                                                                      and

                 three Degrees      of the Meridian.              §3
and in round numbers.              With these elements, and with
the data to be    found    in  the work of M. Svanberg, we have
by the western series of triangles 5S4o",196 and 5840",138
by the eastern.        So that the mean calculated arc is 1° 37'
£0",l67, while the arc observed was 1° 37' 19",566. The
difference then is o",6 for the total arc, and 0",37 for the
mean degree, or 5,86 toises excess in the linear extent.
One can never depend upon quantities so small as this ;
so that the agreement between the, results of computation
and actual observation, proves not only the skill of the ob
servers and the accuracy of which their instruments admit,
but also that the elliptic elements employed in the calcula
tion are a sufficiently near approximation to the truth to
be deserving of confidence.
    In the yiiith volume of the Asiatic Researches, published
by the Society at Calcutta, are contained the details of an
other measurement performed in 1802, by Major William
Lambton in Bengal, on the Coromandel coast.                   In this
undertaking, which was executed with great skill and at
 tention, Major Lambton employed Bengal lights as signals,
chains for the linear measures, and a theodolite, and a
 zenith-sector made by Ramsden.             The base measured was
 6667,740 fathoms reduced to the level of the sea, and to
 the temperature of 62° Fahrenheit ; and the stations were
 so chosen, that four of the sides of the triangles were al
 most in the same line, and nearly parallel to the meridian
 at the southern extremity of the arc, so that their sum but
 little exceeds its whole extent. The lengths of these arcs
 in fathoms reduced to the meridian are thus given in the
 memoir of Major Lambton.
        AB 20758,13 north latitude of        A   11° 44' 52",59
        BC   17481,245
        CD   22237,04 north latitude of E 13° 19' 49",018
        DE 35246,43
     From these data Major Lambton deduces the degree of
  the meridian.to be 60435 fathoms, or 56762,3 toises.             By
  applying to this the same elements as we did to the mea
  surement by Svanberg, we have the entire arc measured
  equal to 1° 34' 55",896 ; so that the difference between the
  results of calculation and of the observations, is only o",532
  for the whole arc, or 0",337 for the mean degree. The
  elliptic hypothesis and observation agree more correctly in
  this instance, for the difference is rather less than in that
  of Lapland, although the two arcs are very nearly of the
  same extent.      Thus the degree on the meridian measured
  in Bengal, in    the  latitude of 12° 32' "21" north, cannot be
                                                            supposed

94             Olservaiions   on the Measurement    of"
supposed to exceed Major Lambton's estimate by more
than 5,22 toises ; and it is extremely difficult to speak with
certainty to quantities so small as this.
   The same nbserver also measured one deeree perpendi
cular to the meridian, by means of a large aide of one of
his triangles cutting the meridian nearly at right angles,
and of which he observed the azimuth at the two ex
tremities. The data from which his results may be verified
are these :
   Length of the chord of the long side in English feet
AB=29i 197,20.
   Azimuth of the eastern extremity A equal to 87° 0' 7"»54
NW.
     Azimuth of the western extremity B equal to 267° 10'
44",07   NW.
               North latitude of A    12° 32' 12",27      -
               North latitude" of B  12° 34' 38",&6.
     With these data in the triangle formed by the long side,
the meridian at B, and the perpendicular from B on the
meridian at A, we have the chord of this last arc equal to
290845,8 feet, and the arc itself $00848,03 feet.         By ap
plying the method of M. Delambre, we find the azimuth
of the extremity B less by £" than it was observed to be;
so that we have no reason to suppose a greater error than
one second in the observation of each azimuth, and it
seems next to impossible to arrive at greater exactness.
   The difference of longitude between the points A and B
is 46' 57", 36.    With this angle and the co-latitude at A,
we have in the spherical triangle light angled at the point A,
the extent of the normal arc equal to 2867,330 seconds, and
dividing its length in feet by this number, we bsve for the
degree perpendicular to the meridian, at the extremity A,
60861,20 fathoms, or 57106.5 toises.           Now these values
are precisely  what  we find  on  the  elliptic hypothesis, with
an oblateness of           or •y-j-^-and in short, the corre
spondence between the hypothesis and the measures of
Major Lambton is as complete as can be wished.             Major
Lambton, indeed, finds the degree on the perpendicular
too great by 200 fathoms, but this arises from a mistake
in his calculation.
   Lastly, I shall apply the same method, and see how
nearly the elliptic hypothesis agrees with the last measures-
taken in Fiance, which merit the highest degree of con
fidence both with respect to the observers who have ex
ecuted   it,and the means which they had       it    their power
                                                    in
to employ.     I have taken only the arc between Dunkirk

                  three Degrees  of the Meridian.              95
and the Pantheon at Paris, from the data published by the
Chevalier Delambre in the third volume of the Measure
ment of the Meridian.        I employed the same elements and
similar calculations to those made on the English arc.
The oblateness of -j-J-j- gives the difference between the pa
rallels equal to 7883,615 seconds by the eastern series of
triangles, and 7883,617 seconds bv the western series. The
mean of these 7883,616 may be taken as the true extent of
the total arc.
    The two other elements give for this quantity 7883",62l
and 7~8S3",493,      or 2° 1 l' 23",6 and 23",49, as the cal
culated extent of the arc.          But the arc observed was
2° 1 1' 19",83, according to M. Delambre, and 2° 1 l' sio",85
according to M. Mechain ; so that the least difference be
tween the calculation and the observations will be 2",64.
M. Delambre is of opinion, that the latitude of Dunkirk,
which is supposed to be 51° 2' 9", 20, should be dimi
nished ; and in" fact the distance between the parallels of
Dunkirk and Greenwich, which is 25241,9 toises, gives
by the mean of the three assumed ellipticities 26' 32",3
for the difference of latitude. After deducting this quantity
from 51° 28' 40", the supposed latitude of Greenwich,
there remains 51° 2' 7",7 or 8", for that of the tower at
 Dunkirk. If from this again we deduct the calculated arc
 2° 1 1' 23",5, we have 48~ 50' 44",5 for the latitude of the
 Pantheon, while, according to the observations of M. De
 lambre, it is 49",37, or 4S",35 by those of M. Mechain.
 If  various circumstances,      with regard to unfavourable
 weather, and also others of a different kind connected with
 the revolution, and of which M. Delambre complains with,
 much reason, have occasioned         some uncertainty with re
 spect to the observations at Dunkirk, still the numerous
 observations made at Paris, both by him and by M. Mechain,
 at a more favourable season, and in times of perfect tran
 quillity, render the supposition of an error of four seconds
 in the latitude of the Pantheon wholly inadmissible.        It is
 however too true, that such errors- are possible, and it is only
 by careful perseverance, and by repeated verification, that
  they are to be discovered and removed, as we have seen to
 be highly probable with respect to the station at Arbury
  Hill.
     But the same celebrated observer, M. Mechain, who
  handled instruments with great delicacy, and was possessed
  of peculiar talents for this species of observation, has given
  us an instance of singular irregularity in the observations
  made at Montjui and at Barcelona.
                                                              The

 06           Observations on the Measurement           of
    The latitude of Montjui, determined by a very long and
 regular series of zenith distances, is full 3",2l less than
 that deduced from a similar series of observations made at
 Barcelona, with the very same instruments, and with equal
 care.   Moreover, there is reason to think, from other ob
 servations, tnat the latitude of Barcelona (which is sup
 posed to be 45") ought to be diminished still one second,
 so that the difference between the observations at Montjui
 and at Barcelona will probably amount to as much as 4".
 Local attractions are supposed to have been the cause of this
 irregularity; but then the latitude, as deduced from ob
 servations made at. Barcelona, should have been less than
it appeared by those made at Montjui itself ; for the devia
 tion of the plumb-line (or of the spirit contained in a level)
could only be occasioned by the little chain of land elevated
to 120 or 130 toises, which passes to the north of Barce
lona in a north-easterly direction. Now since the devia
tions arising from this source would be northward, the
zenith distance of circumpolar stars would be augmented
by that deviation, and consequently the latitude deduced
therefrom would be diminished by just so much. But here
the contrary occurs ; for the latitude of Montjui deduced
from the observations at Barcelona is 48",23, whilst that
obtained by direct observations at Montjui is only 45".
Hence it seems probable, that the cause of this irregularity
must be sought elsewhere, and that it is not likely to be
discovered without repeating over again the same obser
vations.
    Moreover it does net follow that the latitudes of two
 places are correct, because the declinations of the stars de
duced from them correspond ; for the deviations caused            by-
local attractions,    or from any other source, are made to
disappear   in correcting the declination, but remain uncor
rected in the latitude of each.
    Lieut. Col. Mudge   is  also of opinion, that the irregularis
in the value of his degree may be ascribed to deviation of
the plumb-line, occasioned         local attractions. This
                                  by                         iscer
                                                if by
tainly very possible, and may be decided           an examination
of all circumstances on the spot. But              there be really
an   error of  V   in  the extent  of the  whole   arc, this should
rather be ascribed to some defect      in
                                       the observations them
selves, than to any extraneous source      for the observations
                                            ;
of different stars give results that-differ more than four se
conds from each other.
I    shall now conclude this memoir, by expressing        wish,

power than any others to gratify ; I mean hy making new
measurements in the southern hemisphere.           Those which
have been made hitherto in the northern hemisphere arc
extremely satisfactory by their agreement, and give us great
reason to presume that the general level of the earth-s sur
face is elliptical, and very regularly so; and hence we
might expect the opposite hemisphere to be equally so,
and to be a portion of the same curve.         Nevertheless the
degree    measured  at the  Cape  of Good    Hope   by Lacaille,.
in latitude 33° 18', appears to indicate an ellipse of less
eccentricity, or of greater axis ; for the linear extent of
57037 toises corresponds to the measure of a degree in
latitude 47° 47' in the northern hemisphere.          If now we
calculate the arc as before, with an oblateness of 3-£0,
and with the sides of Lacaille's triangles reduced to the
meridian, we find it greater by 10" than it was found to
be by observations of the stars.      An error of ten seconds,
by an astronomer so skilful and scrupulous as Lacaille, is
too extraordinary to be admitted as probable.          It is true,
that there was a greater error well ascertained to have oc
curred in the measurement in Lapland, amounting to thir
teen seconds ; but the academicians engaged in this under
taking were by no means equally conversant with observa
tions as Lacaille.
    There remains therefore but one method       of removing all
 doubt on this subject, and this is to repeat and verify the
measurement at the Cape, and, if possible, to extend-it still
 further to the north. The same Major Lambton who has
succeeded so well in Asia, and is in possession of such per
fect instruments for the purpose, would be singularly quali
fied for a similar undertaking in Africa, and would furnish
us with a measurement in the other hemisphere, as much
to be relied upon as the former.      He would have the glory
of deciding two important questions by his own observa-.
tions ; first, the similarity and magnitude of the two hemi
spheres ; and, secondly, the degree of reliance to be placed
 on the elliptic hypothesis.
    It might be still further desirable, if other measurements
 could also be undertaken, either in New Holland, or in
 Brazil ; for though neither of these countries differs much
 in latitude from tbe Cape of Good Hope, they are so re
 mote in longitude, that a correspondence       of measures so
taken would nearly establish the similarity of all meridians.
                              Note,
    I  shall now explain the formulae    employed    in deducing

the results to which I have come in the foregoing lVfeosair.
Tiie demonstration of them is to be found in the work of
M. Delamhre on the Meridian.
   In the first place, let a be the radius of the equator, e the

arc, in any series of triangles, and 9 the azimuth of that
side. The radius of curvature of this arc will be expressed by

            see that R is the radius of the arc at right an
     Hence we
gles    the meridian.
          to             One may in general neglect the
azimuth, and take the last radius tor the radius Rl. Now,
in computing the arc between Clifton and Dunnose, I have
supposed the oblateness to be                              or    r=              and log. a =
6,5147200 expressed in toises.
  The latitude of the southern extremity of the base is the
same as that of Clifton, and its azimuth, if we choose tq
attend to           it,   is   nearly 335° 23'.  This base,                  considered as,
an arc of           a     circle,      reduced to its sine
                                       is                                   by the formula
e   = log. s—                  ,   (K being     the modules             of the table of             lo

  Bv means of the logarithmic sine of the base, and the
angles of the triangles, considered as spherical, the                                               lo
garithmic sines of the sides in the series were next com
puted, and then reduced to logarithms of the arcs them
selves         by   the formula log.        e   ±=   log. sin.      e   -f K-^"     2'.
   For the purpose of making this last reduction,       suffi                      it     is
cient to take   single value of R, corresponding to the mean
                          a

                                            was thus that the       It
table was formed of logarithmic sides considered a? arcs.
   Let m be one of these arcs, and let us represent                                            by

     The arc of the meridian, between Greenwich and For-
mentera, is so fortunately situated, that its middle point is
in latitude 45°/ Its whole extent measures 12° 48' 44", and
 the distance between the parallels, in linear measure, was
 found to be 730430,7 toises.                         Hence the mean degree,                *
 corresponding to the latitude of 45° 4' 18", is 57010,5
 toises; and if we multiply this number by 90°, we get
 one-fourth part of the meridian of the earth.
      The correction to be deduced for oblateness is 58, 59, or
 61 toises, according as it is assumed to be                                            or
 -g-i-jr,  and    if we    take   the   mean   of    these,   we  have      the   fourth
 part of the meridian Q = 51308S6 toises; and hence the
 metre =44330867 lines; so that the value of the metre
 turns out to be almost entirely independent of the elliptical
  form of the earth.
      The radius of the equator is derived from the expression
 log. a = log.                     +    K. (f . *  +           »>-      . e'),      being

       In order to compare any degrees measured with those
  obtained on the elliptic hypothesis, we have a very simple
  formula.           Let m and m' be the values of two degrees on
   the meridian, of which the mean latitudes are                               and ^2 ;

100       Measurement    of three Degrees of the Meridian.
    I  shall here subjoin one reflection more, which appears
of importance.        The oblatt ness of the earth is a quantity
which" vanes considerably, bv the least difference in fhe ele-
merus on which it depends.           Accordingly it is not sur
prising, that its value fluctuates between two proportions
whxh differ sensiblv from each other. To illustrate this,
let p be the lunction which serves to determine the oblate
ness of the earth, so that     ~ = p.     When thjs equation,
varies —     8e = £*.
    fsiow the coefficient e* being very great, we see why the
least variation in the elements of the function- p occasions
so considerable a variation in the denominator of the oblate-
ness.     This is precisely what happens in the lunar equa
tions dependent on the figure of the earth, and which,
M. Laplace has deduced from his beautiful theory. Thus,
for example, in the inequality that depends on the longi
tude of the moon-s node, which he has determined analy
ticallv with so much precision, the numerical coefficient
found by Burg gives -j-Lj- for the oblateness ; but if this co
efficient be diminished by o",665, then the oblateness be
comes 3-^, so that a variation even to this small amount
in the coefficient augments the denominator of the oblate
ness nearly        part.
   The same happens with regard to the pendulum vibrating
seconds; for, supposing its length at 45° to have been cor
rectly ascertained by MM. Biot and Mathieu, if we wish
to know the length of a second-s pendulum at the equator,
corresponding to an oblateness of -5-^-5-, we find it to be
439,1810 lines. Now this length differs from that deter
mined by Bouguer only by 0,029 or a mie> a"d M. La
place even thinks that the result of Bouguer should be di
minished by about double this quantity. We see from
hence how much these little differences, whether produced
by errors of observation, or irregularities in the earth itself,
are liable to affect the denominator of the fraction express
ing the oblateness.
    fortunately, it seems probable, that the utmost latitude
of our present uncertainty is between the limits of 330 and
310, and the mean of these may be considered as a very
near approximation to the truth.

 XV.   On the Formation   of Sulphur in India.        By Benjamin
    Heyne, M.D. Botanist and Naturalist            to the Hon. East
    India Company, and Surgeon in the Madras Army*.
Sulphur      ha-i been considered to be indigenous on!v where
deep seated mines of inetals are found, or where Volcanoes
 or earthquakes have ravaged the bowels and surface of a
 country. Nothing therefore is known of its formation,
hor have analytical experiments afforded any other than."
distant hints, and these so very indistinct that our modern
chemists have ranked it among simple substances.
    Circumstances requisite for the production of ahy par
ticular substance sometimes, however, unite at accessible
places, and it then becomes possible for an attentive ob
server to penetrate into such mysteries, and to develop
them where of when least expected.               I will not say that
this is preciselv the case here, but I trust that what I have
observed on this subject will riot be thought altogether un
worthy of notice.
    I must premise, that I have no where found brimstone
on the peninsula of India, though always travelling and
inquiritig into subjects of natural production and curiosity;
Dor has it been discovered, as far as \ know, by any other
person, LMiher in a simple state or in combination.            Once
indeed I understand, from very respectable authority, that
a large lump of very fine brimstone was found ai Condapitty
in the Masuiipatam circar, in the trunk of a Margosa tree,
{Melia azedarachta} torn up, and (as was supposed) shat
tered to pieces by lightning ; I was therefore not a little
astonished when a substance in powder or small pieces
evidentlv brimstone was shown me in the Northern circars,
with the intimation that it had been collected On the banks
of the Godavery.
   The place to which I was directed is not far from Mad-
depollam and Ammalapore, places situated about half
way between Coringa and Masuiipatam, arrd between the
branches of the river Godavery, known for the manufac
ture of fine long cloth, \vhich is tarried on to a great ex
tent in this part of the country; but, even there, this cir
cumstance was unknown to all with whom I conversed.
My guide however convinced me soon of the truth of this
assertion, by conducting me to a small village about twelve
miles east of Ammalapore, called Soora-Sauny-Yanam,
belonging to the Bommadauram              Mootak, one of the Ped-
                   * Communicated   by the author.

102          On the Formation     of Sulphur in India.
datore rajah's districts.       Hard by is a lake in which       I
found the confirmation of my researches.           It is a narrow
lake extending several miles in the direction from south to
north along the village, and seems to be every where very
shallow. At its southern extremity it communicates with
a branch of the Godavery and a salt-water creek, from
which it receives its water in the rainy monsoon.
    In the hot season it is nearly dry, and the mud then ex
posed to the sun exhales a disagreeable smell, which at
some places I thought was like that of a sulphuret.
    The first excursion I made with my guides was to a
place due west of the village, where they went trampling up
and down in the water, and at times taking up a handful
of mud, which, on examination, certainly had a faint smell
of brimstone, but did not at all resemble the substance
which had been shown to me some time ago, and which
had induced me to make this expensive excursion.
                                                     I
    Under the full impression of disappointment, was sitting
after my fruitless return to the village in mv palanquin,
scarcely observing that it was surrounded by a number of
inquisitive visitors, when on a sudden my attention was at
 tracted by the clamorous vociferations of a woman in the
pursuit of all my palanquin bearers, who had robbed her
little garden of a pumpkin.         She appealed to the renter
for protection ; but he, like many in his situation in abso
lute power, magnanimously made a present of it to the
 strangers, who were carrying their booty off in great tri
umph.      Unluckily for them, however,       I  interfered,   and
ordered    them  to   restore the stolen goods,  which    brought
 on a slight but friendly altercation between me and the
 renter; and this ended in the payment for the pumpkin, and
 an offer of all the bystanders to conduct me to the place
from which they collected brimstone.
    I then followed a man whom they procured/immediately
 to the northern extremity of the lake, where we found
without much searching brimstone in small heaps and in
 abundance.         .
    I was told that this substance was to be found further
north in the same lake, and in small quantities only to the
 southward, where the lake gets soonest dry. There it is
 collected in a loose soft form, or in semi-indtrated nodules
of a grayish yellow colour after it is dry ; and never deeper
than a foot from the very surface of the ground on which
the water stands.
    This salt lake, I learnt, was but of recent formation.
 Only fifty years ago, the spot where it is now found was
                                                             under

              Oil the Formation of Sulphur in India.             103
under cultivation.     The Country for a great number of                  .
miles in all directions is quite plain ; nav, I may add that
not a hillock is to be seen within fifty miles
   Stones of all kinds are nearly as scarce, except some in
durated marl which I found in the stratum below the su
perficial     one.
   The soil all over this part of the cotmtry is either a rich
red earth mixed with vegetable mould, which renders it
very productive ; dr it is the black vegetable cotton soil,
which is always" accompanied with a stratum of marl.
This is also the soil which I observed on the spot where
    the lake is.
       Earthquakes are entirely unknown here, and volcanic
    substances are not to be found.
        It might be supposed that the brimstone found here was
    deposited by the water of the Godavery, as the lake is in
    conjunction with one of its smaller branches ; or that it had
    been thrown up from the sea, with which it is also con
    nected.      Again3t the former supposition may be adduced,
    that it is found in none of the manifold beds of that river,
    or in its vicinity; and against the second, that it is not ob
    served in any other creek or inlet, and here only where it
    is remotest from the sea.
          Against the existence of extinguished volcanoes, or
    earthquakes,        may     I
                                think most strongly be urged the
    confined       compass of the spot where this substance is
    found ; besides what has been observed before of the
    appearance of the country in general, and its minerals.
    The only way to account for its existence in the humid
     way therefore        is,
                            in my opinion, the supposition of its
     having     been   formed  here.   The substances we have then
    to consider aTe sea water, lime, and vegetable mould.
     I     filled some bottles with the water of this lake, and
     having carried them along with me for further examination,
    1    found that neither the nitric nor sulphuric acids had
     any visible effect on it.
        Soda precipitated immediately    a    plentiful white sediment.
     Oxalic acid produced           acopious sediment.       Muriate of
     barytes caused also       plentiful precipitate.
                                a
         All wished to ascertain was, whether this water con
          I
     tained alkaline or calcareous sulphurets, or the sulphuric
,    acid ina     free state.
         From the few experiments above noted,       it    appears how
     ever that  it   is not impregnated    with  sulphurets of any de
     scription^ as these would have been precipitated both by
     the sulphuric and nitric acids; but that> like most sea waters,
                                        G4                             it

it contains some sulphates;      and probably the sulphate of
lime, as the latter basis was indicated by the oxalic acid, and
the former by the sulphuric acid and the muriate of barytes.
I will not enter upon any theoretical disquisitions ; but                                                      I
cannot help observing, that the presence of brimstone in
substances which not only can but actually do produce
hydrogen gas in such abundance, has suggested to my
mind that sulphur itself may be a product of them, and
possibly only            a   modification of hydrogen.

measure of its attraction. There is yet     another  problem   ;
viz. to find the nature of the curve bounding        the  base,
when the attraction of the cylindric portion itself is an
algebraic quantity.   It is scarcely necessary to observe that

                                                Definition.
      Let (A) and (B)                      be    portions, intercepted            within the
hemisphere (H), of different cylinders ;                                   ifthe attraction of
(A) be equal to the attraction of (H)

cylinders reciprocal as to attraction.
                                                Problem.
   To find any numler of reciprocal cylinders such that the
attraction of (A), or its equal (H) — (B), shall be an alge
braic expression.
   This will be effected, if the curves bounding the bases
of (A) and (B) be of such a nature, that the radii vec-
tores, drawn from the attracted point, are,
               for   (A),          r=2Rcos.9{l-(l-                         cos.3n9)t}

and n be taken any odd whole positive number : for, by what
has been shown, in this and the former paper, we have
      Attraction of (A) = Attraction of (H) —            =                                         (B)

   We may find cylinders whose portions, intercepted by
the hemisphere, have algebraic expressions for their at
traction, by making r = 2R cos. 9 (1 — m cos. ^S), or
r = 2R cos. 9 (I — m sin. 2" 9), and determining m in such
a manner as to eliminate the arcs from the expression of
the attraction.  But this will not be so neat as the former
method, because there will be radicals employed.       shall                                        I

                                and the
               from    Count     Rumford-s Eighteenth Essay.
The    author remarks that, "among the numerous luxuries
of the table, unknown to our forefathers, coffee may be
considered as one of the most valuable.   Its taste is very
 agreeable, and its flavour uncommonly so ; but its prin
 cipal excellence depends on its salubrity, and on its ex
 hilarating quality. It excites cheerfulness, without intoxi
 cation; and the pleasing flow of spirits which it occasions,
 lasts many hours, and is never followed by sadness, languor,
 or debility.    It diffuses over the whole frame a glow of
 health, and a sense of ease and well being which is ex
 tremely delightful : existence is felt to be a positive enjoy
ment, and the mental powers are awakened, and rendered
 uncommonly active."         After some other judicious obser
vations on the valuable properties of coffee, and the uri-
certainty-of the result in the common methods of preparing
it,  the Count proceeds with his subject.-
      "Different methods have been employed in making
coffee; but the preparation of the grain        nearly the same

  "   In some parts of Italy, coffee is roasted in a thin Flo
rence flask slightly closed by means of a loose cork      This
is held over a clear fire of burning coals, and continually
agitated.   As no visible vapour ever makes its appearance
within the flask, the colour of the coffee mav be distinctly
seen through the glass, and the proper moment seized for
removing the coffee from the fire.
   " have endeavoured to improve this Italian method, by
      I
using a thin globular glass vessel with a long narrow cy
lindrical neck. This globular vessel is six inches in dia
meter, and its cylindrical neck is one inch in diameter and
 18 inches long. It is laid down horizontally, and supported
in such a manner on a wooden stand as to be easily turned
round its axis     The globular vessel projects beyond the
stand, and is placed, at a proper height, immediately over
a chafing-dish of live coals.   When this globular vessel is
blown sufficiently thin ; and when care is taken to keep it
constantly turning round, when it is over the fire, there is
                                                                    -
not the smallest danger of its being injured by the heat,
however near it may be to the burning coals.
      In order that coffee may be perfectly good, and very
high flavoured, not more than half a pound of the grain
should be roasted at once ; for, when the quantity is
greater, it becomes impossible to regulate the heat in such
a manner as to be quite certain of a good result.
  "   The end of the cylindrical neck of "the globular vessel
thould be closed by a fit cork, having a small slit in one
side of it to permit the escape of the vapour out of the
.vessel.  This cork should project about an inch beyond the
extremity of the neck of the vessel, in order that it may be
used as a handle in turning the vessel round its axis, to
wards the end of the process,- when the neck of the vessel
becomes very hot. The progress of the operation, and the
moment most proper to put an end to               it,
                                              may be judged
and determined      with great certainty, not only by the
changes which take place in the colour of the grain, but
also      by
         the peculiar fragrance which will first begin to be
                                                           This
               is by
diffused         when  it     nearly roasted enough.

                                                          a
aromatic substance, which did not originally exist, as
suck, in the grain, but which       formed
                                        is      the process of
                                                   in
roasting it. By keeping the neck of the globular vessel
cold,     by
          means of wet cloths,       found means to condense

this aromatic substance, together with a large portion of
aqueous vapour with which it was mixed.
  "  The liquor which resulted from this condensation,
which had an acid taste, was very high flavoured, and as
colourless as the purest vvaler ; but it stained the skin of a
deep yellow colour, which could not be removed by wash
ing with soap and water; and this stain retained a strong
smell of coffee several days.
  "  I have made several unsuccessful attempts to preserve
the fragrant aromatic matter which escapes from coffee
when it is roasting, by transferring it to other substances.
Perhaps others may be more fortunate.          But I must not
suffer myself to be enticed away from my subject by these
interesting speculations.
   *' If the coffee in
                       powder is not well defended from the
air, it soon loses its flavour, and becomes of little value;
and the liquor is never in so high perfection as when the
coffee is made immediately after the grain has been roasted.
   " This is a fact well known to those who are accustomed
to drinking coffee, in countries where the use of it is not
controled by the laws ; and if a government is seriously
disposed to encourage the general use of coffee, individuals
must be permitted to roast it in their own houses.
   '' As the roasting and grinding of coffee take up some
considerable time, and cannot always be done without in
convenience at the moment when the coffee is wanted ; I
contrived a box for keeping the ground coffee, which I have
found, by several years- experience, to preserve the coffee
much better than any of the vessels commonly used for
that purpose.    It is a cylindrical box made of strong tin,
four inches and a quarter in diameter, and five inches in
height, formed as accurately as possible within, to which
a piston is so adapted as to close it very exactly ; and, when
                       in it,
pressed down into       to remain in the place where           it   is
left, without being      danger of being pushed upwards by
the elasticity   of the ground coffee which      destined to
                                                 it

     " Boiling hot water extracts from coffee, which has been
properly roasted and ground, an aromatic substance of an
exquisite flavour, together with a considerable quantity of
 astringent matter, of a bitter but very agreeable taste; but
 this aromatic substance, which is supposed to be an oil, is
 extnmely volatile, and is so feebly united to the water
 that it escapes from it into the air with great facility.       If a
 cup   ot   the  very  best coffee, prepared  in the highest perfec
 tion, and boiling hot, be placed on a table, in the middle
 pf a laige room, and suffered to cool, it will in coolina; fill
 the room with its fragrance ; but the coffee, after having
 become cold, will be found to have lost a great deal of its
 flavour.       If it be again heated, its taste and flavour will be
  still further impaired ; and after it has been heated and
 cooled two or three times, it will be found to be quite vapid
  and disgusting. The fragrance diffused through the air is
  a sure indication that the coffee has lost some of its most
  volatile parts ; and as that liquor is found to have lost its
  peculiar flavour, and also its exhilarating quality, there can
  be no doubt but that both these depend on the preservation
  pf those volatile particles which escape into the air with
  such.   facility."
      "  In  order that coffee may retain all those aromatic par
  ticles    which give to that beverage its excellent qualities,
  nothing more is necessary than to prevent all internal mo
  tions among the particles of that liquid; by preventing its
  being exposed to any change of temperature, either during
  the time employed in preparing it j or afterwards, till it is
  served up.
      "This may be done by pouring boiling water on the coffee
  in powder; and surrounding the machine in which the
  coffee is made, by boiling water; or by the steam of boiling
  water: for the temperature of boiling water is invariable,
   (while the pressure of the atmosphere remains the same,)
   and the temperature of steam is the same as that of the
   boiling water from which it escapes.

   its constancy, but also on account of its being              most

     " One pound averdupois, of good Mocha coffee, which,
when properly roasted and ground, weighs only fourteen
ounces, serves for making fifty-six full cups of the very best
coffee, in my opinion, that can be made.
    " The quantity of ground coffee which I"ttse for one
full clip,    is 108 grains troy, which           rather less than
                                                     is                                a

the name of coffee."
    "   As a gill is a measure well known in England,        shall   I
adopt    it as  a standard measure  for a cup of coffee  ; and as
it is inconvenient to fill coffee-cups quite full to the brim,
I   shall propose coffee-cups to be made of the form and di
mensions they now commonly have, or of a size proper
for containing 8-£ cubic inches of liquor, when filled quite
full to the brim.      I have found by the results of a great
 number of experiments, that one quarter of an ounce aver-
dupois of ground coffee is quite sufficient to make a gill of
 most excellent coffee, of the highest possible flavour, and
quite strong enough to be agreeable."
     " Formerly, the ground coffee being put into ,a coffee
 pot, with a sufficient quantity of water, the coffee-pot was
 put over the fire, and after the water had been made to
boil a certain time, the coffee-pot was removed from the
 fire, and the grounds having had time to settle, or having
 been fined down with isinglass, the clear liquor was poured
 off, and immediately served up in cups.
     " From the results of several experiments wbich made            I
 with great care, in order to ascertain what proportion of
 the aromatic and volatile particles in the coffee escape, and
 are left in this process, I found reason to conclude, that it
 amounts to considerably more than half."
     " When coffee is made in the most advantageous man
 ner, the ground coffee is pressed down in a cylindrical ves
 sel,' which has its bottom pierced with many small holes,
 so as to form a strainer ; and a proper quantity of boiling
 hot water being poured cautiously on this layer of coffee in
 powder, the water penetrates it by degrees, and after a cer
 tain time begins to filter through it.       This gradual per
 colation brings continually a succession of fresh particle*
 of pure water into contact with the ground coffee ; and
 when the last portion of the water has passed through                     it,
 every thing capable of being dissolved             by

pressed together   with   a certain dearee of force.    ff it be
too thin, or not sufficiently pressed together, the water wilt
pass through it too rapidly ; and if the layer of ground
coffee be too thick, or if it lie too much pressed together, the
water will be too long in passing through it, and the taste
of the coffee will be injured."
   The author recommends as of importance that the sur
face of the coffee be rendered quite level after it is put into
the strainer, before any attempt is made to press it together,
that the water in percolating may act equally on every
part.      For this purpose he uses the following contrivance :

     The circular plate of tin, with a rod fastened to its cen
tre, which serves as a rammer for pressing down the ground
coffee, has four small projecting square bars, of about one-
tenth of an inch in width, fastened to the under side of                                                                 it,

    As   these heights are nearly equal, the Count recommends
that    the strainers be all made of the height of 5f inches,
and suspended in their reservoir at such a height that their
bottoms be above the percolated fluid when all has passed
through.
    '' The reservoir and its boiler must be soldered together
above, at their brims; and the reservoir must be suspended
in its boiler, in such a manner that its bottom may be
about a quarter of an inch above the bottom of the boiler.
    " The small quantity of water which it will be necessary
to put into the boiler, in order that the reservoir for the
coffee may be surrounded by steam, may te introduced by-
means of a small opening on one side of the boiler^ situated
above, and near the upper part of its handle.
    " The spout through which the coffee is poured out
passes through the side of the boiler, and is fixed to it by
soldering. The cover of the boiler serves at the same time
as a cover for the reservoir, and for the cylindrical strainer;
and it is made double, in order more effectually to confine
the heat.
    "  The boiler is fixed below to a hoop, made of sheet-
brass, which is pierced with many holes.            This hoop,
which is one inch in width, and which is firmly fixed to
the boiler, serves as a foot tb it when it is set down on a
table, and it supports it in snch a manner that the bottom
 of the boiler is elevated to the height of half an inch above
 the table.
     "  When the boiler is heated over a spirit lamp, or over a
 small portable furnace in which charcoal is burnt, as the
 vapour from the fire will pass off through the holes made
in the sides of the hoop, the bottom of the hoop will al
ways remain quite clean, and the table-cloth will not be in
 danger of being soiled when this coffee-pot is set down on
.the table.
     " As the hoop is in contact with the boiler, in which
 there will always be some water, it will be so cooled by
 this water as never to become hot enough to bum the table
 cloth.
     " The bottom of the boiler may be cleaned occasionally,
 on the underside, with a brush or a towel ; but it should not
 be made bright ; for when it is bright it will be more dif
 ficult to heat the water in it than when it is tarnished and
 of a dark-brown colour.
     " But the sides of the boiler should be kept as bright as
   ossible ; for, when its external surface is kept clean and
   right, tlie boiler will be less cooled by the surrounding

cold bodies,   than w hen its metallic splendour is impaired
 by neglecting to clean it*.
     " As the small quantity of water which is put into the
boiler serves merely for generating the steam which is ne
cessary in order to keep the reservoir and its contents con
stantly boiling-hot ; if the reservoir be made of silver, or
even of common tin, the boiler may, without the smallest
danger, be made of coppefr j or of copper plated with silver,
which will give to the boiler 3n elegant appearance, and at
the same time render it easy to keep it clean on the out
 side.
     " The boiler may likewise be made of tin, and neatly
japanned on the outside, provided the hoop to which it is
fixed below be made of copper ; but this hocp must never
be japanned nor painted ; and it must always be made of
sheet-copper    or silver ; and the boiler must always be
heated over a small portable fire-place or lamp, somewhat i
less in diameter above, than the hoop on which the boiler
is placed.
     '' In
         order that the flat bottom of the boiler may not
 smother and put out the fire, the brim of the small fur-
riace or chafing-dish, which is used, must have six pro
jecting knobs at the upper part of                   it,
                                         each about one quarter
 of an inch in height, on which the bottom of the boiler
may rest.
     "If these knobs (which may be the large heads of six
 nails) be placed at equal distances, from each other, thte
boiler will be well supported; and as the hot vapour frbm
the fire will pass off freely between them, the fire will bunt
well. As very small fire

     "The whole of this apparatus consists of           coffee-cup,    in
which should hold about three quarters of              pint and a      it a a         ;

the strainer having both been previously heated,             dipping                 by
them into boiling water.
   'f When all the coffee has passed info the lower part of
the cup the strainer may be taken away, and the cup may
be covered with the cover of the strainer.            do not think      I

      "  As many persons may prefer coffee-pots made entirely
  of Staffordshire-ware, porcelain, or other pottery, to those
  made of the metals, not only on account of the low prices
  at which they may be afforded, but also on account of their
  superior neatness and cleanliness, I have added the figure 5,
  which, on a scale of half the full size, represents a coffee
  pot made of pottery, of a size proper for making five or
  six cups of coffee at once, or three, four, five, six, seven, of
  eight   cups,   if  two strainers are used, one after the other.
  When this coffee pot is used, it will be necessary to place
  it in boiling water to keep it hot, and it will be useful to
  cover the whole with a cylindrical vessel turned upside
  down ; bv which means both the strainer and the coffee
  pot will be surrounded by hot steam, which will contribute
  very essentially to the goodness of the coffee.     As soon as
 the coffee has passed into the coffee-pot, the strainer may
 be taken awav ; and the coffee-pot covered with the cover
 which is common to it, and to the, strainer.
     "  I shall conclude by a few observations on the means
 that may be used for preserving ready made coffee, good
.for a considerable time, in bottles.          ,

                                            ,
.       The- bottles having been made very clean, must be put
 into clean cold water, in a large kettle, and the water must
 be heated gradually, and made to boil, in order that -the
 bottles may be heated boiling hot. "The coffee, fresh pre
 pared and still boiling hot, must be put into these heated
 bottles, which must be immediately well closed with good
 sound corks.        The bottles must then be removed into a
 cool cellar, where they must be kept well covered up in dry
 sand, in order to preserve them from the light.          By this
means ready-made coffee may be preserved good for a long
time; but great care must be taken not to let it be exposed
to the light, otherwise it will soon be spoiled.           When
wanted for use, the coffee must be. heated in the. bottle and
before the cork is drawn ; otherwise a great deal of the
aromatic flavour of the coffee will be lost in heating it.
And in order that it may be heated in the bottle, without
danger, the bottle must be put into cold water, and this
water must be gradually heated till the coffee has acquired
the degree of heat » hich is wanted.          The cork may then
be drawn, and the coffee poured out, and served up.
    "  As good coffee is very far from being disagreeable
w hen taken cold, and as there is no doubt but it must be

-
   this poison, a test which I pointed out to him, and which,
   from a variety of experiments which we tried together,
   with a view to ascertain its comparative merits, we were
   induced to consider as the most effectual of all the tests
   hiLherto used for that purpose.             .The method censists sim
   ply   in adding    in succession,      to  the  fluid suspected to eon-
   tain arsenic, minute quantities of solutions of ammonia and
   of hitrat of silver; by which means, if the smallest quan
   tity of arsenic be present, a dense yellow precipitate will he

    U2                         On    Nitrat of Silver,
     All the particulars respecting this mode of detection
  having been fully stated by Dr. Roget, with such references
. to former writers  on the subject as the case required, it
  would be quite superfluous to enter into any further detail
  on this head.     My object in resuming the subject, the
  practical importance of which need not be pointed out, is
  to communicate     to the Society the result of an inquiry
  which I have made on the nature of the yellow precipitate,
  the appearance of which is assumed as denoting the pre
  sence of arsenic, and to answer some objections which have
  been made against this test by MV. Sylvester, of Derby, in
  a paper on metallic poisons, recently published in Nichol
    son-s Journal* .
      The yellow compound in question                         has the following
    properties :
      -If, alter being well washed with distilled water, it be
    suffered to stand for some time in an open vessel, it gra
    dually passes to a brown colour ; but it does not, like ni
    trat of silver, become black on continuing this exposure.
       It is readily soluble in dilute nitric acid. It also dissolves
    on adding an excess of ammonia at the moment of its
    formation; but after it has been separated and dried, it is
    no longer sensibly soluble in ammonia.
        If a small quantity of this precipitate be exposed to the
    heat of a lamp on a slip of laminated platina, a white smoke
    arises from   it, and metallic silver remains attached to the
    platina. The reduction of the silver,         the form of glo
                                                         in                      a
    bule,  is still more distinct and striking,       little carbona

    ceous matter be mixed with the precipitate, and the blow
    pipe applied.1
        When the yellow precipitate, inclosed           lube,    in
                                                                  ex  a          is

    ammonia     is necessary, because arsenic acid alone cannot

decompose nitrat of silver; but in Fowler's solution, in.
which the arsenic is already combined with an alkali, the
decomposition takes place at once, without any addition
of ammonia. The fixed alkalies, therefore, can answer a
similar purpose ; but ammonia has this advantage, that it
does not, when added singly, decompose nitrat or silver, — a
circumstance which, in using the fixed alkalies, might oc
casion some confusion*.

viously to my offering any remarks upon           state       it,

  This danger of ambiguity, however, though applying in

to be noticed, will be found to have been greatly overrated;

   By this method, I believe that every objection to the test
will be removed ; and in order to anticipate all ambiguity,
and to avoid any complication or practical difficulty in its
application, I would propose to modify the process in the
following           manner:
  , To the suspected fluid, previously filtered, add, first, a
little dilute nitric acid, and, afterwards, nitrat of silver, till
it shall cease to produce any precipitate.        The muriatie
acid being thus removed, whilst the arsenious acid        any,                     (if
and     whatever state,) remains in the fluid, the addition of
         in
ammonia will instantly produce the yellow precipitate in
its characteristic form.        hardly necessary to add, that
                                       It   is
the quantity of ammonia must be sufficient to saturate any
excess of nitric acid which the solution may contain.

 opportunity to describe an improvement in the construction,
 of the simple microscope, which rnayalso be termed peri-
 scopic, as the object of it is to gain an extension of the
field of view, upon the same principles as in the preceding
instances, namely, by occasioning all pencils to pass as nearly
 as may be at right angles to the surfaces of the lens. "The
mode, however, in which this is effected is apparently
somewhat different in the practical execution.
    Tn the common camera olscura, where the images of
 distant objects are formed on a plane surface to which the
lens is parallel, if the surfaces of the lens be both convex,
 and equally curved (as in fig. l. Plate IV) ; and if the distance
of the lens be such, that the images formed in the direction
 of its axis CF be most distinct, then the images of lateral ob
jects are indistinct in a greater or less degree, accordingly
 as they are more or less remote from the axis.        The causes
of this indistinctness may be considered as twofold ; for, in
the first place, all parts of the plane, excepting the central
point, are at a greater distance from the centre of the lens
than its principal focus ; and secondly, the point f} to
.which any pencil of parallel rays passing obliquely through
 the lens are made to converge, is less distant than the -prin
cipal focus.    On this account, it is in general best to place
the lens at a distance somewhat less than that which would
give most distinctness to the central images, because in that
case a certain moderate extension is given to the field of
View, from an adjustment better adapted to lateral objects,
 without materially impairing the brightness of those in the
 centre.    The want of distinctness, however, is even then
 only diminished in degree, but is not remedied.
    The construction by which I propose to obviate this de
 fect is represented in the second figure, in which are seen,
the essential parts of a periscopic camera in their due pro
portion to each other. The lens is a meniscus, with the
 curvatures of its surfaces about in the proportion of two to
one. so placed that its concavity is presented to the objects,
 and its convexity toward the plane on which the images
are formed.      The aperture of the lens is four inches, its
focus about twenty-two.       There -is also a circular opening,
two inches in diameter, placed at about one-eighth of the
focal length of the lens from its concave side, as the means
of determining the quantity and direction of rays that are
to be transmitted.
    The advantage of this construction over the common ca
mera obscura is such, that no one who makes the com
parison can doubt of its superiority ; but the causes of this
                                                               may

126              On a periscoplc Camera Obscurit
 may require some explanation.           It has been already ob
 served, that by the common lens, any oblique pencil of ray*
 is brought to a focus at a distance less than that of the
principal focus.       But in. the construction above described,
 the focal   distance   of oblique pencils is not merely as great,
but is greater than that of a direct pencil. For since the
 effect of the first surface is to occasion divergence of parallel
 rays, and thereby to elongate the focus ultimately produced
 by the second surface, and since the degree of that diver
 gence is increased by obliquity of incidence, the focal
 length resulting from the combined action of both surfaces
 will be greater than in the centre, if the incidence on the
 second surface be not so oblique as to increase the conver
         "
gence.      On this account, the opening E is placed so much
 nearer to the lens than the centre of its second surface, that
oblique rays Kf, after being refracted at the first surface^
are transmitted through the lens nearly in the direction of
its shorter radin3 ; and hence are made to converge to a
 point so distant that the image (at     J)    falls very nearly in
the same plane with that of an object centrally placed.
    In the use of spectacles by long-sighted persons, the
course of the rays in the opposite direction is so precisely
similar, that the same figure might serve to illustrate the
advantages of the periscopic construction.           For the pur
pose of seeing the extended page of a book (as at AB) with
least fatigue to the eye, that form of lens will be most be
neficial, which renders the rays received from each part of
its surface parallel ; and this is efl-eeted by the exact coun
terpart to the preceding arrangement; for in this case the
opening. E represents the place of the eye receiving parallel
rays from the lens in each direction, instead of transmitting
them from a distance towards it.
    There  is,  however, this difference between the two cases,
that  in  the  camera   obscura  a   much larger portion of the
lens  is   required to conspire in giving     a  distinct image of
any one object       so that the conformation best adapted for
                     ;
lateral objects would not be consistent with distinctness
at the centre    ; and hence arises  a limit to the application of
the principle.      On the common construction, the whole
lens  is so formed as to give brilliancy and distinctness at
the centre alone, without regard to lateral objects.             In
adopiing such        adeviation from the customary form, as    I
propose,   in  favour of      more extended view, some diminu
tion of the aperture      is a
                              required in order to preserve the
desired distinctness at the centre.         In my endeavours to
ascertain the most eligible form of meniscus for this pur

  posq, I have assumed sixty degrees to be the field of view
 required.      But when so large a field is not wanted, then
 a lens that is less curved will be preferable;         and the pro
  portion of the radii must be varied according to the angular
  extent intended to he included.
      For the purpose of estimating by what combination of
  radii any required focal length may be given to a meniscus,
  I have contrived a diagram by which very much labour of
  computation may be saved, as a very near result may be
 obtained by mere inspection.            This contrivance is founded
  on the well known formula for the focal length of any
  lens    F=   j^-jr; :       being a certain   multiple obtained   by
  dividing the sine of refraction by the difference of the sines
  of incidence and refraction. Hence, in applying this for-
   mula-to the meniscus, F : R : : rnr : R— r. In fig. 3, line*
  expressive of these quantities are so arranged, that by as
  suming anv point F corresponding to the focal length de
  sired, and drawing a line FR through a point R indicating
  any supposed length of the greater radius, the correspond
  ing length of the other radius wijl be found where the line
   drawn intersects the middle line in the diagram.
       In layinsc down these lines, the length and position of
   AF and AR were assumed at pleasure ; and they were di
   vided into anv number of equal parts.              But the position
   and length of the middle line Ax was adapted with care to
   the refractive power of plate glass in the following manner.

   the point 10 in the line AR, parallel to AF, and equal to
    1Q-8 divisions of the primary lines; so that if r be = 10,
   then the line BC = mr.           The distance AC being then di
   vided into ten equal parts, with their subdivisions, afforded
   the means of continuing the same scale to any desired
   length. Since the first line BC was laid down parallel to
   AF, and equal to mr, any other lines drawn through cor
   responding numbers 7 and 7> 8 and 8, &c. will be also
   parallel, and, by preserving due proportion, will correctly
• represent mr.          Hence, in ail positions of the line FR, the
   same similarity of triangles obtains, and the same pro
   portion of F : R : : mr : R— r ; and consequently the focal
   length, corresponding to any assumed radii, is truly ascer
   tained. . .

ciency of light and     ;      accordingly expedient to make

the aperture of the little lens as large as    consistent with         is
distinct vision.    But    the object to be viewed
                                   if                   of such                 is
magnitude    as  to appear under  an  angle of several   degrees
on each side of the centre, the requisite distinctness cannot
be given to the whole surface          common lens, by   a  con                      in
sequence of the confusion occasioned         oblique incidence    by
of the lateral rays, excepting         means of        hy
                                                     very small             a
aperture, and proportionable diminution of light.
    In order to remedy this inconvenience, conceived that              I
the perforated metal, which limits the aperture of the
lens, might be placed with advantage in its centre            and                       ;
accordingly     Iprocured two plano-convex lenses ground to
the same radius, and applying their plane surfaces on op
posite sides of the same aperture in         thin piece of metal

sired effect   having virtually a double convex lens so con
               ;
trived, that the passage of oblique pencils was at right an
gles with its surfaces, as well as the central pencil. With
a  lens so constructed, the perforation that appeared to give
the most perfect distinctness was about one-fifth part of
the focal length in diameter     and when such an aperture
                                              ;
is   well centred, the visible field        at least as much as

an angle of 135 degrees.      In the construction formerly

   bone black be mixed with a litre of the filtered acid, in a.

   three days, on filtering the mixture, the acid will pass
   through perfectly colourless.       By this means almost the
   whole of the acid employed in the preparation of ether may

   place the crucible on a forge fire, and heat it gradually till
   Ted : when the flame from the oily and gelatinous parts of
   the bones has ceased, diminish the opening and suddenly

  XXI.       Notice respecting some Experiments on Alcohol;
       read before the Edinburgh Institute %d February 1813.
       By Mr. Hutton.
  I     have been prevailed upon to communicate a notice of
  some experiments and observations I have made on the
  production of a great degree of cold. It is scarcely neces
  sary to observe, that my doing so at this time is not a mat
  ter of choice : these experiments and observations were
  mentioned to my friends ; and they were made without any
  injunction as to secrecy, as I did not anticipate that such
  communications would either be received with so much
  avidity, or repeated with so much eagerness. The conse

  quence has been, that accounts       of these experiments have
 now got into very general circulation, and many verv con
  trary and erroneous ideas have been entertained, not only
  as to their extent, but even as to their nature: and it has
 been imagined that a communication like the present is
 the- only way to obviate these misconceptions, — miscon
 ceptions which I owe as much to you as to myself to re
 move.                              ,
      The importance of      a method of producing a great de
 gree   of  cold  becomes   apparent, when it is considered that
 it  is at present a very   common opinion among chemists, —
 an opinion founded on a very general analogy, — that all
 gases may be reduced to the state of liquids by the abstrac
 tion of caloric ; and that, by a further abstraction of caloric,
 all liquids in their turn may be reduced to the solid state.
 If this be true, and were we in possession of a method of
 sufficiently abstracting caloric, all bodies whatever might be
 reduced to the solid state.       We should thus become ac
 quainted with a great number of substances that we have
 hitherto had no opportunity of examining ; many powerful
 agents would likely be obtained ; many new and interesting
 compounds formed ; and much light could nol fail to, be
 thrown on the constitution of known substances.
    Directing my attention to this subject, in the summer of
 18)0, a method occurred to me, by which I imagined a
greater degree of cold might be produced than had hitherto
been obtained.       Although the power of this method ap
peared     in theory almost indefinite, yet it was easy to foresee
that in practice many circumstances         might at first concur
to set limits to its application: from the nature of . these
circumstances, however, it was to be expected that some of
them might be considerably modified, and many of them
micht in time be altogether removed, and thus the practice
made in some degree to approximate to the theory.
    At the time this method occurred to me, the pressure of
my professional avocations did not allow me to prosecute
it ; but, as I anticipated some leisure in the following
autumn, I immediately began to provide, at any leisure mo
ments I had, such apparatus as I considered absolutely
necessary, or was most likely to be useful.        The litile de-.
pendence, however, which is to be placed on general rea
soning on such subjects, and the apprehension that th»
method might have been previously tried and found in
sufficient by others, prevented me from providing any very
extensive apparatus.
    My first experiment was tried in the followine5 autumn.

The thermometer was rilled and sealed by myself. The tube
was previously tried by the common method, and found,
as nearly as such tubes are commouly to be met with, of
equal calibre throughout.    The spirit with which it was
filled      was prepared by Richter-s             process,      and afterwards
re-distilled by itself. — Its specific gravity at 62° was 798. —
The points 60° and 100° were determined by a mercurial
thermometer which had been made with the usual precau
tions ; the interval was divided into four spaces, each of
which, of course, corresponded to 10° ; the part of the stem
 below 60° measured nearlv 1 8 of these spaces.                A mark
 was made at every space, till, on arriving at the end of the
 1 7th,   the graduation could not be carried further. This
 point, of course, corresponded to                60°— 1/0°= — 10

 dee.   of  Fahrenheit-s scale.
     This thermometer was exposed to the cold produced                         by
 the method alluded to, and after some time was examined,
 when the alcohol was found to have passed all the marks,
 and was obviously sunk within the ball of the thermometer.
 A slight degree discoloration was observable. The ther
                         qf
 mometer was replaced, and examined about five minutes
 afterwards, when the ball of the thermometer was found
 broken, and crystals adhered to the fragments.
 I    next took      glass tube about 3-10ths of an inch
                     a                                             dia  in

it  was so completely solid, that on inverting the tube            did   it
not drop, and only          very minute stream was perceived to
                              a
glide slowly down the inside of the tube            when this stream

                                              a
several pieces, which quickly melted.
    This experiment was several times repeated              but  ;       by   al
lowing     the  alcohol  to  remain    little longer exposed to the

cold,    itbecame so completely solid, that on inverting the
tube, not the least portion of fluid could be perceived to se
parate from the mass.
    In order to be as certain as possible of the strength of
the alcohol     I  employed,      again took its specific gravity,
                                  I

that time to pursue these experiments.        They were resumed,
however, in the autumn or 1811. The second experiment
was repeated and varied, and solid masses of alcohol of
some magnitude obtained.           Some of these I soldered to
gether, using     as a  hot  bolt 3  rod of frozen mercury, and
sometimes a straw cooled down to a very low temperature.
    It now appeared to me to be an object of some impor
tance to ascertain the form of the crystals which this sub
stance assumes.        This I found attended with some diffi
culties which I did not anticipate, and attempts to over
come them have led to the discovery of some facts which
I  did not at all expect.
    The common masses exhibited crystals of different forms ;
two kinds appeared to predominate, and each was tolerably
distinct in its kind ; but it was not very easy to perceive bv
what increments or decrements the one could be supposed
to pass into the other: a rather casual circumstance, how
ever, explained the source of this variety. — Attempting to
freeze alcohol by a modification of the general process,
which I conjectured would yield more regular crystals than
the common method, I observed that, before crystallizing,
the alcohol separated into three very distinct strata ; the
 uppermost was of a pale yellowish green, while the second
 was of a very pale-yellow colour : — both these strata were
 very thin, the last-mentioned was rather the thickest ; the
lowermost stratum was nearly transparent and colourless,
and very greatiy exceeded the other two in quantity.         After
 allowing   a part of  the  lower   stratum, which I conceived  to
 be the pure alcohol, to freeze, I attempted to pour out
 the remainder, but was prevented by the upper strata, which
 proved to be solidified. The lowermost of these two strata
 bore some marks of crystallization — the upper had none,
 and proved so firm as to resist a straw with which I at
 tempted to perforate it to open a passage for the sublatent
 liquid. On removing part of these superior strata, and de
 canting the remaining fluid, the crystals of the lower stra
 tum appeared very distinctly to be rectangular prisms of
 equal planes, a few of them on one side of the glass sur
 mounted by quadrangular pyramids, but most of them by
 dihedral summits. This experiment I repeated several times,
 and the results coincided.
     In order to ascertain whether these phaenomena arose
 from a decomposition of the alcohol, or from the separa
 tion of foreign substances previously held by it in solution,
 the products of several of these experiments were mirlajed
 together in a stoppered matrass ; the whole was then raised
                                  I 3                           to

  to the temperature of about 120 ikg. by a water bath of
  that temperature.     The substances forming the different
  strata united together, and formed a colourless liquor, which
  had the specific gravity and all the other properties of the
  alcohol from which it was obtained.       This experiment was
  repeated   several times, and the results were uniform, af
  fording sufficient evidence that the alcohol had not been
  decomposed by this process, but that the superior strata con
  sisted of foreign substances which it had held in solution.
  The variety in the form of the crystals obtained by former
  experiments, was therefore most likely occasioned by the
  presence of these foreign substances, — a phaenomenon not
  uncommon in chemistry.
      The result of these experiments led me now to perceive,
  that the assumption       that alcohol, prepared by Kichter-s
  process, is perfectly pure, or at most contains only a very
  minute portion of water, is entirely gratuitous.        The di
  luted alcohol of commerce, from which the more concen
  trated is obtained, is well known tn contain different vola
  tile impurities; and since Richter's process makes no pro
  vision for the separation of these, we ought rather to ex
  pect still to meet with some portion of them in alcohol pre
                             -
  pared in this manner.
      I next proceeded to examine the properties of the dif
 ferent substances into which I had separated RichterValco-
  hol : but the time ! had now left for this purpose was too
  short for making much progress in this inquiry ; a few only
  of their habitudes with water, and with one another, were-
  all that i had time to examine; even these I could examine
  only imperfectly.
^
      The lowermost stratum, or nearly colourless fluid, which
  J have called alcohol, had no flavour, and produced on the
  organ or smell only a sharp pungent sensation.            It has
  the remarkable property of smoking when exposed to the
  air, and when diluted with water it differs considerably in
  taste from common diluted spirit of wine.-
      The pale yellow substance, or second stratum, has a pun
  gent taste, leaving an impression of sweetness.         It has a
  very strong but agreeable smell.        When mixed with the
  alcohol, and diluted with water, it has very much the fla
  vour or the better kinds of Highland whisky.          It readily
  dissolves in water, and communicates to that fluid its pe
 culiar flavour.
     The pale yellowish green substance which composes the
 uppermost stratum, has a strong and very offensive smell,
 and a very sharp nanseous taste.       It dissolves in alcohol,
                                                                to

h) whieh      it communicates       its peculiar flavour; its dis
 agreeable   smell  is considerably heightened by this combina
 tion.    It dissolves in water, though less readily than the
 substance last treated of. The compound, when much di
 luted and heated, has very much the flavour of the low-wine
of our Lowland distillers at the time when it issues from
the still.
    The two last-mentioned substances, or those of which
the two upper strata
and greatiy diluted with water, have very nearly the flavour
of alcohol. They have rather more volatility than water j
for, when half of a solution of them has been distilled over,
the distilled part has a much stronger smell than that which,
remains in the retort.
    It may be proper to mention, that from the circumstance
of my sense of smell having been for some time extremely
obtuse, I have been under the necessity of trusting to others
for the facts regarding the flavour of these new substances
and mixtures: from the uniformity of the reports, how
ever, which I have received from different persons, I have
no doubt that these facts are correct.
    Besides that from which I filled the thermometer in the
first experiment, I have operated on alcohol of the speci
fic gravities S02, 797, and 784 ; the specific gravity of the
last was taken when its temperature was 66 deg. and it is
probably the most concentrated that has ever been obtained.
But, with alcohol of all these different strengths, the ge
neral results were similar.        In alcohol obtained from dif
ferent sources, the proportions of the impurities were dif
ferent, both with regard to the pure alcohol and to one an
other ; but I have met with none that did not contain both»
    From these experiments I think it is ascertained,
   "1st, That the strongest alcohol which we are able to ob
tain may be frozen by the method alluded to.
    2d, That this alcohol contains at least two foreign sub
stances, which are highly volatile, and, so far as is known,
can only be separated by freezing.
    3d, That it is to the-se substances that alcohol owes its
peculiar flavour j and that, according as the one or other
predominates, the flavour of the alcohol is agreeable or
otherwise.
    Last autumn I resumed this subject, and my attention
was chiefly directed to the habitudes of these impurities
with the chemical re-agents.         This I found attended with
considerable difficulties, none of the least of which was to
procure a sufficient quantity of these impurities in a sepa-

  rate state.    The series of experiments I proposed to myself
 on this subject have not yet been completed ; but I may re
 mark, that the result of some of those I have made pro
 mises to afford practical hints of considerable importance
 to those brewers whose products are intended to afford spi
  rituous liquors.
     From this notice it will be observed, that I have scarcely
 yet entered on the wide field of inquiry, for cultivation of
 which, the method alluded to appears to offer so powerful
 an instrument.        Alcohol only has been subject to experi
 ment ; it was the only liquid which had resisted all at
 tempts to reduce it to the solid state by the abstraction of
 caloric.     If these experiments be correct, we may now pro
 nounce it a general law to which there is no exception, that
 all liquids with which we are acquainted may be reduced to
 the solid state by a suitable abstraction of caloric. Whether
 all gases may be susceptible of reduction to the solid state,
 by the abstraction of caloric, remains to be ascertained ;
 although, as I have mentioned, analogy renders it in the
 highest degree probable.
     The examination of the singular substances which alco
 hol prepared by Richter-s process contains, has drawn me
 aside from the course of experiments I prescribed to myself,
 and taken up that time which I intended to have devoted to
 the examination of the effects of cold on the gaseous bodies.
 Whether I shall proceed to these bodies, or resume the ex
 amination of the habitudes of the alcoholic impurities with
 the re-agents, will much depend on the leisure which I can
 obtain ; but, to whichever of them I may direct my atten
        I
 tion, shall not fail to give the earliest information of the
 result to the Institute.

    Jan. 98.  The Right Hon. President iti the chair. A
letter  from Dr. Brewster to Sir Humphry Davy was read,
announcing some important discoveries in the double re
fraction and dispersing powers of several substances, as
agate in a thin plate about 1-1 5th of an inch thick; chro-
mate of lead, sulphur, fluor spar, Iceland spar, &c.       The
first two of these minerals, it appears, exceed the diamond
in double refraction and also in dispersion.     Dr. Brewster
refers to the experiments of Malus on colours, and expresses
a hope that his own discoveries in this difficult branch of
science may lead to some correct theory of light: but he is
still pursuing his experiments, which are not yet in a state
for generalization.
    Feb. 4.    Sir Charles Blagdcn communicated a short
paper on Near-sightedness, confirming the observatfbns of
Mr. Ware, that the early use of concave glasses contributes
to injure the sight.   Sir C. stated his own case, being like
Mr. W. near sighted : this he discovered when only nine
years old, and used watch-glasses to aid his sight : at length
requiring proper glasses, at the age of 30 he used No. 2 ; a
few years after he found it necessary to adopt No. 5, in
order to" obtain a clear view.    Since that period his sight
has remained stationary; but he is inclined to think that
had he abstained from the use of glasses, it would have be
come sufficiently long and clear by exercise, — such is the

    Feb. 11. A letter to the President from Mr. Hamilton
of Nevis was read. It contained a long account of the
eruption of the Souffriere in the islaud of St. Vincent, in
May 1812. This volcano had not experienced an eruption
since 1718; the recent one was preceded by near 200
shocks of earthquakes duri:>g the twelve months before
May. The most particular phaenomenon noticed by the
writer was the sound of the eruptions, which so much re
sembled the alternate firing of cannon and small arms, that
the captain ofashippf war convoying a fleet of merchantmen,
conceiving that a privateer had attacked some of the rear
vessels, made signal to the fleet to close, and steered to
wards the place whence the sound came.          It was also re
marked, that the noise was much greater at the distance of
many leagues than it was in the island ; a circumstance for
which Mr. Hamilton could not account.          By»this eruption
 two rivers were dried up; immense volumes of thick smoke
 were emitted before any flame appeared at the mouth of
 the crater ; the flame was accompanied by successive shocks
 of the earth, thundering noise, and the discharge of large
 pieces of pumice during eight hours, without intermission,
 Several houses were thrown down in Kingston by the
 tremor, and many negroes were wounded by the pumice
 which struck them in their plantations.          The Souffriere
 is in a part of a great chain of mountains which pass
 through Nevis and several other of the West India
 islands.    Its crater is a mile in diameter, and about 900
 feet deep.
     Feb. 18.    In consequence of the indisposition of the
 President, Mr. Lysons was in the chair. A paper by Sir
 Everard Home was read, describing the head of the Narval.
 Mr. Scoresby junior having informed him that the female
 narval has no tusk, and that it is a vulgar error to believe it
  such a deadly enemy to the whale, Sir E. examined the
 head of one in the Hunterian museum, and compared it
  with the head of a female, which tie procured.
     He observed that the head of the male lias a socket for two
  tusks, but has only one, while that of the female has a place
  for one, but has none.       Hence he thinks the question be
 yond all doubt, and      that  Mr. Scoresby-s information was
  correct, that the female narval never has any tusks.
     Dr. Wollaston communicated the result of his experi
  ments in drawing wire.       Having required some fine wife
  for telescopes, and remembering that Muschenbroek men

tioned wire 500 feet of which weighed only a single grain,
he determined to try the experiment, although no method
of making such fine wire has ever yet been published.
With this view he took a rod of silver, drilled a hole
through it only 1 - 10th its diameter, filled this hole with
gold, and succeeded in drawing it into wire till it did not
exceed the 3 or 4000dth part of an inch, and could have
thus drawn it to the greatest fineness perceptible by the
Senses.   Drilling the silver he found very troublesome, and
determined to try to draw platina wire, as this metal would
bear the silver to be cast round it- In this he succeeded with
greater ease, drew the platina to any fineness, and plunged
the silver in heated nitric acid, which dissolved      and left  it,
the gold or platina wire perfect.        The process Dr. W.
thinks may he rendered useful to manufactures.

pearance of the latter.    The consideration of this almost
inscrutable topic induced the lecturer (whose business only
was to apply to his present object so much of it as is most
easily recognizable) to notice " our habitual propensity to
prejudge the appearance of persons, in proportion to our
knowledge of the energies of their minds."        From this na
tural (and generally expected) coincidence the lecturer con
cluded with intimating the necessity, " where Nature has
been less bountiful of external accomplishment than might
be desired, of the culture of mind, and of recourse to all
the aids and advantages derivable from art and science,
with tenfold ardour .and perseverance."
    Having thus discussed the advantages derivable from an
intimate acquaintance with the powers of articulate sound
and of gesture, as adaptable to the various modifications of
passion, Mr. VV. advanced more fully into his subject, and
 proceeded to elucidate the different characters of Express
sion ; at the commencement of which elucidation he de
livered a needful (and to us in some measure a novel) defi
nition of the distinction between reading and oratory. " In
 relation to Expression and Feeling," said he,        " an orator
may occasionally appear      in four distinct situations.   First,
He may be the Actor or Imitator ; secondly, the Describer ;
 thirdlv, the Narrator ; and lastly,, whether imitated, de
scribed, or narrated by an author, he may be the Reader of
a circumstance : so that one and the same individual pas
 sion may assume six different forms or modes of expres
 sion." This principle the lecturer ably enforced by his
 manner of reciting the inspired Ode of Collins ou the Pas
 sions; in commenting upon which he displayed consider
 able critical acumen, while he elucidated the reference it
bore to some of his own leading positions.         He extolled in
 strong language   the vivid   and  unequivocal   delineations   of
 character exhibited by the poet.     "  In every picture  of  pas
 sion (said Mr. Wright) therein presented, the prominent
 and peculiar features of each are so faithfully preserved, that
 the action almost appears present to the mind.        The sloth
 like caution of Fear, the pride and impetuosity of Anger,
 and the long incoherent pause of Despair, are exemplified
 by the hand of a master: and the sweetly-flowing numbers
 of Hope, moving like the 'golden hinges' of Milton,
 are interrupted with almost unequalled force of contrast by
 the loud ravings and boisterous exultation of Revenge.
    "   The exordium of this ode," continued the lecturer,
 "  invests the speaker with the character of Describer. Care
 therefore should betaken to avoid an actual imitation of the
                                                          passions

    passions therein delineated : it would be departing from the-
   intention of the Ode. It is required only that the student
    should bear in mind, while he echoes the sense, that the
   expression of his voice and gesture is for the information
   only of the auditor: consequently his whole deportment
   should assume the air of communication.          If the repeater
   be only a reader, then his relation to the original action will
   be more remote : He will not be supposed to have seen the
   circumstance ; consequently his expression of the passion
   should be proportionally less animated.         Yet, although
   ' the page prescribed ' before him must, in some measure,
   restrain the manner of the reader, it becomes him to infuse
   a resemblance of character into his delivery; otherwise the
   whole will be blended into one uniform, monotonous ex
   pression  of tranquillity.
       " In reading, the signs of passion  are not so  forcibly ex
   pressive as in repeating from memory     ; and  for reasons  ap
   pearing perfectly analogous to nature.     A reader cannot be
   supposed to know what turn of thought an author may
   have taken, until he has actually rounded his"period. He is
   only in possession of the growth of idea, or, in other lan
   guage, of the meaning of such portions of words, forming
   parts of a period, as through the medium of the auditory
   organ may be clearly conveyed to the mind.         Now, when
  •we consider the nature of some of these portions, and the
   aptitude of the mind to receive impression of completion
  however false in point of logical accuracy, we shall be more
  fully convinced of the propriety of what is now advanced ;
  viz. that it is highly requisite for the reader to restrain his
  feelings. For as a written theme," continued Mr. W.
                                                               " as
  opposed to oratory, is produced by more deliberate acts of
  the mind; so should reading, as opposed to the higher
  branches of elocution in the various modes of utterance,
  bear no more than suitable proportions of energy and pa
  thos."
      From these and subsequent observations the lecturer de
  monstrated, that, as in narrating the probable motives of a
  transaction, description of the act would be irrelevant ; so,
  in describing the apparent feeling of the actor in such trans
  action, it would not be decent for the orator to assume his
  attitude or supposed gesture.
      " The peculiar properties," resumed the lectnrer in his
  seventh discourse, " of Narration, Description, and Imita
  tion, and their relation to each other, being recognized, will
, enable the student to ascertain the distinct characters of
  Expression."      Dividing, then, this Expression into two

  grand classes, Dramatic and      Oratorical, Mr. W.    proceeded
  to maintain the propriety of this division, and to interest
  his hearers by a wide range of citation from our critical,
  metaphysical, and dramatic writers.       Nor did the annals of
  senatorial eloquence pass unheeded, enriched as the page
  has been by the stupendous talents of a Chatham, — a states
  man and orator whose luminous and capacious intellect,
  ardently employed in the cause of truth and humanity, has
  left so decided a claim on the admiration and gratitude of
  his countrymen.
      We should not however overlook the observations of the
  lecturer which immediately preceded these examples, inas
  much as they are explanatory of his system, and were ia
  substance nearly as follows : " I am aware," he said,
      that as the Drama represents ( the very age and bodv of
, the time, its form and pressure,- all the passions may l>e
  called dramatic ; but as some of them only are oratorical,
  and the rest purely dramatic, it appears requisite to distri
  bute them into the two classes I have adopted.            By dra
  matic passion I mean selfish,    —  and by oratorical, I wish to
                                    "
  be understood, social feeling.       Man is urged into action
  by selfish and social feelings.     If the one be necessary to
  his individual preservation, the other may be considered re
  quisite to engage him into vigorous and laborious services
  to his friends, his country, and his whole species.        Com
  passion will engage him to succour the distressed, even with
  his private loss or danger ; an abhorrence of the unjust,
  and commiseration with the injured, a sense of virtue and
  honour, can make us despise labour, expense, wounds, and
  even death.     What is properly understood by social feeling
  constitutes the genuine principle of true, unsophisticated
  oratory. ' Social feeling,' says Dr. Hutcheson, ' is fixed
  humanity; it is such a desire of the good of all to whom
  our influence can extend, as uniformly excites us to every
  act of beneficence, and makes us careful of informing our
  selves rightly concerning the truest methods of promoting
  their interests.'    That social appeals are oratorical, and that
  an unqualified    effusion of pride is not oratorical, no one
  would doubt who saw them exemplified : an audience
  would hardly be influenced in fav6ur of a speaker who dis
   played before them the selfish passion of hatred, as actuat
  ing his own mind. At the same time, could we listen to the
  detail of the accumulated crimes of Piso, as enumerated
  and denounced by Cicero, we should join with the orator,
  .and participate in his feeling.

  stood, that when  I    speak of dramatic and oratorical pas
  sions, the vulgar acceptation of the term ' theatrical- bears
  no relation to either class. This acceptation seems to imply
 an idea of censure : but I am of opinion with Mr. Walker,
  that it is a stale trick to depreciate what from indolence,
 want of taste, or other incapacity, ourselves cannot attain;
  so that, in many instances, calling a spirited and efficient
  pronunciation and delivery theatrical, is but an artful me
  thod of glossing over or excusing our own inability of
  speaking with becoming force and energy."
     For our own parts, we are inclined to think that those
  persons who apply the term to whatever appears to them
  forced, or out of character, have the same narrow notion of
  acting with Partridge, at the representation of Hamlet. He
  thought
            " the innocent-faced " man who performed Clau
 dius the best actor : " for (said he) Mr. Garrick does only
just as I or any body eUe would do in his situation :— 4)ut
 the king for my money; he speaks all his words distinctly,
 and half as loud again as t-other. All the world may see he
 is an actor."
     "  If the man who addresses an assembly," continued
 Mr. Wright, " imitate passion when he should only de*
 scribe  it, or describe when he should but narrate, borrowing
a   phrase from the theatre,      would certainly call him the

 mere actor;- because his efforts and manner carry with
 them the air of fiction.
     "Should the word 'theatrical' be employed to signify
'   a dissimulation of real sentiments, or the affectation of
adopting the opinions and language of another,- then may
 the term be forcible and correct     ;but    am inclined to be
                                                I
 lieve that few who have employed          (any more than Mr.

                             is
if  not ungenerous, to confound under one term the clumsy
caricature of an affected speaker, with the chaste delivery
and accurate delineation of nature, sought and so justly ad
mired on the stage at the present day.
     Adhering, with some deviations and refinements, to the
system formerly promulgated by Aaron Hill, Mr, Wright
commented with considerable discrimination and success on
the various examples produced          him. These would be

content ourselves with quoting an additional observation on

. the oratorical character. " Correspondent with the authority
  of a public speaker should be his air or character of ex
  pression.     However we may be inclined to doubt the sin
  cerity of strangers, the intenticn of a parent can never be
  disputed.     An orator, ihen, whose character has not only
   been irreproachable, but whose ability has been proved, and
  whose moral principle has been displaved by active social
  Iove, may undoubtedly assume the authority of a parent,
   and enforce every emotion of his mind with the earnestness
  of a father prescribing salutary rules for the conduct and
  government of his children?'                                      . '
      Having   shown   how  the  countenance  and  voice  are affect
  ed in expressing some of the principal passions, Mr. Wright
  proceeded, in his eighth lecture, to speak of the mechanical
  means through which the various alterat.OLis of appearance
   and sound may be accomplished.
      " Taking it as already granted, that when the body is dis
  posed to the appearance of any one passion, by a mechani
  cal effort of the will the mind becomes sensible of alteration,
  and feels the particular passion ;" the lecturer enforced,
  as indispensably necessary, a ready and familiar acquaint
  ance with the various circumstances of countenance              and
  gesture,   connected   with   the  passions and   their  modifica
  tions ; advising, at the same time, a frequent recurrence
  to the mirror, and a comparison, by the student, of the
  faithful transcript of his look with his actual feelings.
  Much advantage he conceived attainable from an acquaint
  ance with the writings of Sterne; whose readers indeed
  may, at times, almost fancy themselves intent on a masterly
  painting, rather than on a printed page.
      The instrumental powers of voice next engaged the at
  tention of the lecturer; upon which he noticed at consider
  able length the best means of rendering them flexible, so
  norous, strong, melodious, and swelling.           " The voice,"
  observed he,    "  like every other faculty of the body, may
  be improved      by judicious exercise.      This too, like the
   sight and other organic powers, may be so exerted as to
  destroy rather than strengthen it.        Every one in familiar
   conversation may be said to have a key note, one which he
  more ordinarily employs than any in his compass.              This
   sound should be improved by repeated exertion, being care
   ful to make the tone as sonorous as possible.          This, with
   the assistance occasionally of a musical instrument, while
   pronouncing any given passage in a monotone will be found
   of considerable service. The two inflexions should be tho
   roughly practised ; a theme should then be selected, in which
      Vol. 41. No. 178. "Feb, 1813.               K                the

  the modulation does not vary: this, and an accurate observ
  ance of the proper inflexion, should be studied carefully be
  fore any further attempt is made. This being sufficiently prac
 tised, it may be said that one octave of the student's voice is
              -
 in tune. The same course should be pursued one note
 higher, with a like observance of inflexion ; and so on till
 the whole is practised upwards.         The lower or under voices
  should then be proceeded with, using the same inflexions
 till completed.
     " To express our common ideas, we make use, then, of
 that key from which we tune our whole compass.               This is
 the key in which our voice is susceptible of the greatest
 variety of modulation. It is on this that all our efforts to
 improve the voice should be directed.
     '.' The situation," the lecturer continued,      "  of a public
 speaker, with relation to his audience, as regards compass
 and variety     of voice, is one exacting the nicest art and dis
 crimination.        He would wish to address a whole assembly
with as much apparent ease to himself, and pleasure to his
 audience, as though it were composed but of one person.
     "   A public speaker, in addressing himself to his auditory,
 who meet either to be informed or amused, should adopt,
 to convey his sentiments, his ordinary and familiar tone of
 voice. He should endeavour to be heard in this familiar
 tone and facility of utterance by the most distant person,
 .without offending the ear of the closest : in a word, a pub
 lic speaker should be solicitous that the tones of his voice
 should be sufficiently audible, distinct, and natural, to every
person in the whole assembly."
     To attain these important objects the lecturer afforded
naauy practical rules, to offer any abridgement of which
would be doing them injustice : dismissing, then, the sub
ject, he passed on to consider the " Genera of Causes," the
distribution of which into Demonstrative, Deliberative, and
Judicial, is said to have been invented by Aristotle. The
definitions and elucidations of these genera occupied the
remainder of the eighth lecture.
     "   A mixed assembly, a concourse of men, women, and
children, are not insusceptible to logical induction, or to
the effect occasioned by the beauties of rhetorical refine
ment      ; to excite their attention to just notions and feelings,
 ^o  stimulate    the actions of their wills, demand the whole
 strength     of oratory.   Particular assemblies may be more
refined ; and these assemblies we recognize in the oratory
of the Bar and the Senate. The former accords with that
genus termed by the ancients Judicial; controversy arising
                                -    -

 From what is past, and contesting certain points, just or
 rot, according to the letter and spirit of the law. The lat
 ter is said to belong peculiarly to the Deliberative genus,:
 but, connected with the senate, the object of this genus
 being to contend for new decrees of state, it must appear
 that the Judicial also is inseparable from certain objects of
senatorial eloquence.
     " The Demonstrative, by which the ancients understood
 ' commendation and censure,- can hardly perhaps be called
 a genus : connected, however, with the Deliberative or the
Judicial, the talent of praising or dispraising must add con
 siderable strength and importance to the arguments, and
 also assist towards conviction.    As virtue and authority is
to oratory in general, so is the demonstrative to a judicial
or deliberative cause in particular."
    The ninth and concluding lecture consisted chiefly, of a
 peroration of the present and former courses.     Of the pro
gress   of both we have endeavoured to give the reader   a suc
cinct account.     In conclusion, Mr. Wright delivered   a high
and, we cordially believe,   a merited eulogium on the Society
whose members he had       addressed ; from whqm the lecture*
   ratefully acknowledged   to have received much liberal in-
   ulgence and attention ; congratulating the Society on their
happiness in possessing    a President who had fostered it in
its earliest infancy, and  whose learning, talents, and ame
nity of character would    be honourable to any association. .

    At   a  meeting of this Society on January ), 1813, (the
President in the chair,) the reading of Mr. Philip-s paper
*f on the Veins of Cornwall" was concluded.
    The metalliferous veins of the Heiland and Drannack
mines Yun E by N and W by S, and the cross courses run
H by W and S by E. The rock or country which they
traverse is schist, in some places so hard as to require being
blasted.     The width of most of the metalliferous vein*
varies from two inches to six inches : whenever exceeding
this latter measure, they have been found soon after to
divide and pass away in mere strings. A contre or oblique
vein traverses these mines in a direction W by N and E
by S, varying in width from one to three feet. Near the
surface it was found to abound in blende and iron pyrites,
but lower down afforded large quantities of copper ore.
Whenever it intersected the metalliferous vein6, the place
of junction formed one lode for about eight fathoms in
)epgth and three or four in width.      The contre was heaved

by the cross courses, and these latter at the place of inter
section are found to be not only enlarged, but impregnated
with ore.       The contents of the cross courses are clay,
quartz,   or  a mixture of both.    It was in one of these cross
courses,   at  the place of its junction with one of these me
talliferous veins, that the celebrated deposit of silver was
found mingled with galena, with iion pyrites, with bismuth,
cobalt, and wolfram : apd these substances were also
found in those parts of the vein adjacent to the cross
course.
  Huel Alfred is in immediate contact with the mines just
mentioned, and is, at present, one of the richest and most
profitable copper       mines that Cornwall              can boast of. The
great deposit of ore is contained in                          from 9 to 24
                                                       a contre
feet wide, which is considered as                 the continuation of that
in Herland mine. The contre traverses a regular east and
.west vein ; and it is remarkable that the ore, abundant as it
is, has hitherto been found only in one mass at the depth of
 117 fathoms, at the point of junction of the contre and of
 the vein, giving off a branch 1 10 fathoms in length, along
 the eastern part of the same vein.
    Another singular circumstance in this mine        that one       is,
 of the cross courses    heaved and intersected
                          is                        an     and      by     E
W   vein.
   Since the beginning of 1801, there have been sold about
45,000 tons of copper ore, the produce of Huel Alfred, for
the sum of about 350,000/. of which the profit divided
among the adventurers has amounted to about 120,000/.

genera.    He observes however at the same time, that his
reason for this arrangement is only a very slight analogy,
as the objects in question differ materially      from every
known zoophyte recent or fossil.
   Mr. Conyheare having been so fortunate as to obtain
several specimens of this fossil in a much better state of
preservation than usual, shows clearly that they occur be
tween the bony plates of a large bivalve shell, the ostreo-
pennite of Walch ; and, in a similar situation, in fragments
of a striated shell, one of the patellites of Da Costa, which
more probably, however, belongs to the genus Oslrea.
Similar substances have also been observed on the surface
of a cast of the Echinus. The matter of which these bodies
are composed is flint; and they are supposed by Mr. Cony
heare to be casts of the cells of some minute parasitical
insect inhabiting the substance of the shells of certain
species of the testaceous Molluscae, and probably deriving
hence its nutriment either in whole or in part.

    Feb. 19th. The President in the chair. John Bostock,
M.D.     and Thomas Stewart Trail, M.D. of Liverpool, were
elected members of the Society.
   A paper by John Taytef, Esq. M.G.S. on the CEcono-
»ny of the Mines of Cornwall and Devon was read.
   The subjects treated of in this paper are :
   i. The nature of the agreements between the owner of
the soil and the mine adventurers.
   fit* The arrangements between the partners or adventurers
 themselves, an5 the system of control and management
appointed    by them.
    in.  The mode of employing and paying the miners and
workmen, in use- among the agents of the principal con
 cerns.
    iv. The purchase of materials for carrying on the underr
 taking.
    V. The sale of the ores from the mine adventurers to»
the smelting companies.
     1. The regulations of the -stannary laws refer only to
mines of tin : hence the search after and working lodes of
copper, lead, and other metals, is left open to such condi
tions as the adventurers and the lord of the soil can mu
tually agree upon. In general the lord grants a lease for
twenty-one years, determinable, however, at any time, on
his part, if the mine should not be effectually worked. In
return he requires a certain proportion, varying according"
to circumstances from an eighth to a thirty-second part
of the ore, to be delivered to him on the mine in a mer
chantable state, or its value in money.         He stipulates for
a power of inspecting the works at all times, and binds the
adventurers to maintain and have at any determination of
their grant all the shafts, adits, and levels perfect, and in
good condition as to timbering.
   2. The adventurers divide the whole concern into sixty-
four shares, which they share among themselves, and those
who are allowed to join thern, in various proportion*.         -At

                       Geological Society.                              151
the end of every two or three months a general meeting of
the adventurers is summoned, a statement of the account*
is laid before them, and the profit or loss is distributed to
each according to the amount of his shares.
   The general detail of management is usually delegated
to one person, under whom are subordinate superintendants
called captains, selected from among the working miners
for their skill and character.
   3. The work of the mines, both on the surface and belovr
ground, is almost universally contracted for by the piece,
at a kind of public auction held at the end of every two
months, an accurate survey and measurement of the whole
being previously taken bv the captains.     The lowest bidder
has the set ; and in order to execute          it,
                                              he associates to
himself from one to eleven men, women, or children, ac
cording to the nature of the work.        An account       then    is
opened between the principal captain and the contractor,
in which this latter  is credited with all the tools, candles,
gunpowder, and subsistence money required                 by
                                                   him and his
gang during the term   ;  at the end of which the tools and
articles not used are returned   the account
                                 ;               balanced, and
                                                     is
the gain or loss upon the contract       declared to the per
                                          is
sons interested.
   4. If materials for the use of the mine are purchased
from those holders of shares who deal in the articles
wanted (as  is  not unusual), great vigilance      required in
                                                      is
the other proportions to check the natural temptations to
charge exorbitant prices, and to encourage       wasteful con
                                                     a
sumption.                    <
   5. The smelting companies for copper have seldom any
share of the mines.     There are about fifteen copper com
panies, all of which have agents and assay officers in Corn
wall, though the smelting itself     iscarried on at Svvansey.
A weekly meeting      is advertised to be held at some place
near the principal mines, where the ores on hand, allotted
into suitable parcels (the produce of one mine being care
fully kept separate from that of another), are offered for sale.
Previous to the day of sale, the persons intending to pur
chase attend at the mines for the purpose of taking sam
ples, which are immediately put into the hands of the assay
masters.    The agents for the smelting companies being
thus furnished with the requisite information, attend at the
meeting, and each hands up to the chairman              note ora
ticket, containing  the  price per ton which  he    disposed to
                                                          is
give.   The chairman then reads aloud the various offers,
and the highest  is declared the purchaser.

                     EDINBURGH    INSTITUTE.
     At a genetal meeting of the members of this Institution,
 oil Tuesday, February 2, for hearing" communications on
  subjects connected with science, literature, and the artsy
  Dr. Millar in the chair, the following papers were received:
      I . Account of a new method of ascertaining the quantity
  of spirituous liquors by weight, proposed as a substitute for
  measurement; — communicated by Mrs. Lovi.
,    The patent acrometrical beads were invented by Mrs.
  Lovi, the patentee, some years ago. They consist of small
  hollow glass balls, with short stems, blown of different spe
  cific gravities, from 800 to 1800, and corresponding to the
  even numbers 80O, 802, 804, &c. each bead having the
 -specific gravity it denotes engraven on the upper part of its
  surface.    Those used for spirituous liquors are 30 in num-
 -ber, and extend from 890 to 948.                In using them, a
  small quantity of the liquid, whose specific gravity is to be
  ascertained, is put into a phial, and several beads are suc
   cessively immersed in    it,   till one  is  found that remains
   suspended    below the  surface   of the liquid, without sinking
   to the bottom. The -number on this bead indicates the
   specific gravity of the liquid.     A thermometer accompanies
   the heads, for taking the temperature of the liquid      and the
                                                            ;
   correction necessary to be made when this exceeds or falls
 below     60% the standard temperature,         exhibited
                                                 is                 by   a
sliding  rule.   -
   These bead* exhibit the specific gravity of liquids much
more correctly than the common hydrometers               do, and
they are not liable to go out of order.        Except breaking,              .
they are not exposed to any accident that can in the least
degree impair their accuracy; whereas            it  well known
                                                       is
that the common metallic hydrometer               injured
                                                  is            by
                                                              the
chemical    action of the air, and the fluids    it used
                                                       is to mea
sure    has its bulk diminished     by  partial depression of its

       ;
surface, or its weight increased         admitting portions of
•the liquid into its inside; and, even in its most perfect
state, is an instrument upon which little dependence can be
 placed.                          i   .
     The specific gravity of spirits being determined with           fa
 cility    by
           the beads, the quantity in gallons, or measures of
 any other denomination, may be found            by
                                               weight with the
 utmost certainty.     For, since the weight of cubic foot of
                                                       a
 water, and the number of cubic inches in          wine gallon,
                                                       a
 have been carefully ascertained, the specific gravity of any
 other liquid will enable us to ascertain the weight of wine    a
 y    .:                                                        gallon

                       Edinburgh Institute.                 153
gallon of that liquid ; and, in the same way, the weight of
any larger quantity may be found.          On the other hand,
the weight and specific gravity being given, it is equally
easy to find the number of gallons.       Such a method would
evidently be less convenient than measurement, when ap
plied to small quantities of liquor; but, on a large scale, it
would certainly be found greatly preferable.       A cask hold
ing 180 gallons, for instance, when filled with a 5-gallon
measure, according to the present practice of »pirit-dealers,
requires 36 distinct manipulations, each of which ought
to be conducted with considerable care and attention. But
such a cask might be filled with equal accuracy, and less
labour, and in a much shorter time, by weighing the cask,
first when empty, and afterw ards when full : the difference
of these weights would of course be the weight of the spi
rits, from which the bulk or measured quantity might be
 obtained, as already stated.    Such is the method proposed.
 It has been already put in practice by a few individuals, and
would probably have been generally adopted, had it not in
 volved calculations too laborious for practical men, — a dis
advantage which the correct and ample tables Mrs. Lovi
 has now in the press will completely obviate.
     It has already been stated,  that this method is more ex
 peditious   than  common   measurement,    and it may be added
 that it is more ceconomical ; as, by substituting one opera
 tion for a great number, it avoids the waste occasioned by
 the frequent mechanical agitation of the spirits, and the
 loss that constantly attends a series of small operations.
 Superior accuracy, however, will be found to be its greatest
 recommendation. This it owes to several circumstances :
  1. Because measures are seldom made with the same ac
 curacy as weights ; 2. Because they have their capacities
 changed by variations of temperature, or by accidents, and
 are much more acted upon by air and moisture ; and lastly,
 Because they do not show excess or deficiency in the quan
  tity of the substance measured, with so much precision.
      2. Account of an improved crane, invented by Mr. Kerr,
  mathematical instrument maker.
      The base of this machine rests upon cones, by which the
  horizonta] motion is effected ; and the arm is lengthened
  or shortened by a peculiar contrivance, of which it would
  be difficult to convey an adequate idea without a diagram.
  This improvement obviates the difficulties which have long
  been experienced in the use of cranes. With its assistance,
  a weight may be laid down, with the greatest accuracy, on
  any point within tfie area of the circle described by the
                                                       extremity

   extremity of the beam, excepting where the machinery
  stands.   It may be used with much advantage in loading
  .or unloading ships, as it never interferes with" their rigging.
  It may be also extremely useful in building, where it is
  often necessary to place large stones on particular spots,
  which is very difficult to accomplish with cranes on the
  common construction. The whole apparatus is extremely
  simple, and attended with little expense.              A model of this
  improved   crane   was   exhibited    in presence    of  the meeting.
     3. Notice respecting some Experiments on Alcohol. By
  Mr. Hutton.

        XXIV.      Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
                            ARTIFICIAL COLD.
 The      method employed by Professor Lesslie to produce
 intense cold, by placing water over an open vessel contain
 ing sulphuric acid, and subjecting both, under the receiver
 of a powerful air-pump, to quick exhaustion, is already
 known to the public. The rapid vaporization from the
 water quickly lowers the temperature of the residue, which
 is ultimately converted into ice. By investing the bulb of
 a mercurial thermometer with a thin coat of ice, and sub
jecting this to exhaustion over sulphuric acid, the Professor
 has also succeeded in freezing the mercury.
     By a communication from Dr. Marcet to Mr. Nichol
 son * we learn that that gentleman has effected the conge
lation of mercury by simply substituting the evaporation of
ether for that of water under the receiver of an air-pump.
For convenience, the graduated stem of the thermometer
should pass through a collar of leather in the plate that co
vers the receiver.       The bulb (which should descend a few-
inches into the receiver) wrapped in a little cotton wool, or
in a little bag of fine fleecy hosiery, being dipped in ether,
the plate is then placed over the receiver, which is exhausted
as quickly as possible.          In two or three minutes the tem
perature is reduced to about 45° below o, when the mercury
rapidly sinks and is speedily congealed.               This experiment
succeeds whether sulphuric acid be inclosed in the receiver
or not, especially if the temperature of the apartment
be as low as 40° ; but it is more certain when the acid is

present.    When the surrounding temperature is unfavour
able, the success of the experiment may be facilitated by
first dipping the clothed bulb in water, and, after freezing
this by means of the air pump, pouring a fewdrops of ether
upon    it,
          and again exposing    to exhaustion. it
    In another part of the present number will be found an
interesting notice by Mr. Hutton of Edinburgh respecting
some experiments on akohol, effected        means of artificial
                                                        by
cold. The author, in giving his results, has been silent re
specting the method employed for reducing the temperature
of the alcohol but Dr. Marcet-s process, described above,
                       ;
would certainly answer the purpose.       Indeed many new
results, obtained     means of this powerful agent, may be
                             by
speedily expected.

    In paper read some weeks ago before the Royal Society,
        a
D.r. Wollaston describes     new instrument, to which he has
                                         a

                  by   a
 of these half full of water, the other empty, and the whole
exhausted of air. If the empty ball be plunged into      mix-           a
lure of salt and snow, the water in the other ball will be
 frozen       few minutes, though several inches, or even,
             in   a
some feet, distant from the cold mixture.
    In the communication alluded to in the preceding notice,
 Dr. Marcet states, that,                 by
                                  process similar to that de
                                               a
 scribed for the congelation of mercury, the water in Dr.
Wollaston-s instrument maybe frozen without any cooling
mixture in less than   minute, and with
                                     a    pump of very       a
moderate power.
                                 SUGAR FROM STARCH.
    In the preceding volume of the Philosophical Magazine
some account was given of this process, the discovery of
M. Kirchoff of the academy of Petersburgh.          M. Kirchoff
employs sulphuric acid,     one  part diluted  with 200 parts of
water, which       made to boil in
                       is             well-tinned copper vessel.

                             is
mixed with the boiling diluted acid; and the whole          kept           is
in state of ebullition for 36 hours, water being added for
    a

                                 :                   then added, is
and, lastly, chalk sufficient to saturate the acid.         then,     It   is
filtered through     cloth, and afterwards evaporated gently
                           a a
to the state of     syrup, and set aside for crystallization,
which takes place in three or four days,

    156      Sawing Cast Iron wllh a Carpenter-s Saw.
       M. Vogel    has repeated M. Kirchoff's experiment *, using
    2 parts of sulphuric acid to 100 of starch. After clarifying,
    when cold, with charcoal and chalk, he evaporated nearly
    to a syrup, set it by to cool that more of the sulphate of
   lime might fall down, decanted off the clear liquid, and then
   finished the evaporation.        When be used a silver basin in
   place of a tinned copper vessel (which is acted on by the
   acid), the sugar was sweeter and whiter; but a leaden ves
   sel was found to answer every purpose-                   From a mean of
   several experiments, starch appears to yield its own weight
   of syrup. The syrup mixed with yeast yielded carbonic
   acid by fermentation, and by distillation a notable quan
   tity of alcohol.
       The fecula of potatoes, substituted for starch, gave also
   a very saccharine gummy syrup : the syrup of starch al
   ways contains gum, the proportion of which varies accord
   ing to the time of boiling and the quantity of acid employed.
  The gum, separated by means of alcohol, seemed in no re
   spect to differ from gum arabic, except in not forming mu
   cous acid with nitric acid.                                           -J
       Sugar of milk, which never ferments, acquired that pro
  perty when treated with sulphuric acid, and yielded alcohol.
       Dr. Tuthill has also converted the fecula of potatoes into
  saccharine matter \.         From impound of this fecula (the
  produce    of  8£ pounds     of  potatoes), treated with six pints
  of distilled water and £th of an ounce of common sulphuric
  acid, and clarified with charcoal and chalk, he obtained
   \ \ pound of a crystalline mass resembling common brown
  sugar mixed with a little treacle; and from one pound of
  this mass he obtained by fermentation and distillation two
  ounces and five eighths by measure of. dilute alcohol, of
  such a gravity as (by calculation from Sir Charles Blagden's
 experiments) made the produce equal to 14 drams by mea
  sure of proof spirit.

 lume of Ann. de Chim. announces that he has succeeded in
 sawing cast iron with a carpenter's saw, and that all that is
necessary to ensure its being sawn as easily and in the same
 space of time as dry wood, is that the iron be heated to a
cherry red. For heating the iron a furnace is preferable to a
forge fire, as the temperature is thus rendered more uniform

throughout the mass. The iron should be so placed as to
have a firm bearing every where, except where the 3aw is to
pass, to prevent any part from being torn off by the saw,;
and the iron should be cut briskly, using the whole length
of the saw, the teeth of which -should be set fine. By this
simple method not only plates but mill gudgeons, and even
anvils, haye been cut with great facility.    When the piece
to be cut is large, two saws should be employed, for the
convenience    of using and cooling them alternately : the
saws receive little or no injury. Tins useful process, though
not generally known, is not new : several years ago M. Pic-
tet observed a workman saw a hot cast-iron pipe in the
workshop of Mr. Paul of Geneva.
    On Saturday the 20th of February this useful process was
tried in the presence of several gentlemen at the iron foun
dry of Mr. Williams, in Waterford, and the success of the
experiment was complete.       The operation was repeated se
veral times, and always with facility.     The iron, as stated
above, should be heated to a cherry red, and the saw need
only be selected according to the fineness of the pieces into
which the metal is to be cut. The operation is perfectly
easy, and the saw remains uninjured.
              HEATING BUILDINGS BY STEAM.
   This beneficial practice is every day coming into more
general use.    Not only are large manufactories, as cotton-
mills, now rendered comfortably warm in this manner, but
churches and less extensive buildings.      Some time ago a
plan was presented by Mr. Robertson Buchannan, civil
engineer, to the magistrates of Aberdeen, for heating one
of the churches in that city, (a Gothic building we believe,)
which has since been executed, and gives perfect satisfac
tion.    The fuel is put to the boiler on Saturday evening,
and is continued till the congregation meets for the after
noon service on Sunday. At the end of January the steam
heat brought the temperature of the place to 46° or 48%
which was increased by the presence of the congregation
about 4° or 6° higher.    The printing-office of the Glasgow
Chronicle has for some time been comfortably and oecono-
mically heated by Mr. Buchannan's arrangement of steam
tubes.
    A  recent number of the Gazette de Sante contains the
following account of a remarkable recovery from the effects
of poisonous mushrooms. A boy ten years of age, having
incautiously eaten some mushrooms which he had picked

   158              Meteorological Observations
  up in  a wood, was almost immediately taken ill. He was
  conveyed to his parents in a dying state, and, from certain
  circumstances, four days elapsed before he was visited by a
  medical practitioner. A Dr. Dufoirr having been sent for,
  he found the child in the following state : Countenance of a
  ghastly paleness ; clammy sweat over the body ; eyes open
  and fixed, exhibiting the opaque cornea only ; belly flat and
  hard; the jaws spasmodically closed, so as to prevent all
  food from being swallowed ; the motion of the heart
  scarcely perceptible.   Dr. Dufour immediately broke two of
  the front teeth, and administered through the aperture a
  mixture of sulphuric ether and syrup of orange flowers: the
  body of the patient was then placed among the dried leaves
  of tansy, dulcamara, jasquiama ; and the belly was rubbed
  with oil of chamomile, camphor, alcohol, and ammonia,
  mixed up together : every thing was done with a view to
 heat the patient.     This mode of treatment had the desired
  success; and the child, after swallowing about an ounce of
 ether, and the same quantity of syrup, completely reco*
 <U+25BC>ered.
     M. Alexander Kis, of Pest in Hungary, has recently in
 vented an universal alphabet, or species of pasigraphy ap
  plicable to all languages.   At a public exhibition before the
  members of the various learned bodies at Pest, M. Kis
 made an application of his invention to the Lord's prayer,
 which was read in Greek and English by a person present,
 and immediately committed to writing with the new alpha
 bet, so as to be read with facility by every person present.
     Mr. Bakewell will commence a Course of Geolocical
 Lectures in March at Willis-s Rooms, King-Street, St,
 James's; designed to illustrate the Geology and Mineralogy
of England, and particularly intended to direct the atten
tion of landed proprietors to the neglected mineral treasures
on their own estates.        Mr. Bakewell also intends shortly
to publish in one volume octavo a Work entitled Outlines
of Geology, with Observations on the Geology of England.

   XXV.      Account     of the  late Earthquake at the Caraccas*.
The       earthquake which took place last year at the Ca
raccas, -and laid waste the fine city of that name, besides
a great many others in this rich and extensive province, has
been but superficially described in the newspapers in which
I   have seen it mentioned.            The extraordinary convulsion
has not (December              1812)  as  yet ceased; it has already
caused,     and   may still occasion, so many calamities, that it
deserves to be more particularly laid before the public.
     On the 26th of March 1812, at five o-clock in the after
noon, the first commotion took place.                  The air was calm,
the beat excessive : nothing preceded or announced such
a catastrophe.           A shaking was first perceived, strong
enough      to  set  the  bells of the churches a-ringing : it lasted
about six seconds, and was followed by an interval of ten
or twelve seconds, during which the earth exhibited an un
 dulation similar to the motion of the sea in a calm : the
 crisis was then supposed to have passed ; but immediately
extraordinary subterraneous noises were heard, and electrical
 discharges infinitely stronger than atmospheric thunder; the
 earth was agitated with a quickness which cannot be de
 scribed, and seemed to boil like water when subjected to
 the heat of a very strong fire ; there was then a perpendi
 cular rumbling or strepitus for about three or four seconds,
 followed by agitations in an opposite direction from north
 to south, and from east to w est, for three or four seconds
 also.    This short but awful period was sufficient to turn
 the whole city of Caraccas topsy-turvy, with upwards of
 thirty towns, and the country houses and numerous esta
 blishments spread over the surface of that delightful pro
 vince ! In an instant all was destroyed to an extent of 300
 miles, and 80,000 inhabitants ceased to live, while thou
  sands were dreadfully wounded.
     The city of Caraccas, placed at the foot of the declivity
 of the highest mountain, called La Silla, and on the margin
 of an immense plain through which several rivers flowed,
 was considerably elevated above the level of the sea, and
  always enjoyed a cool and agreeable temperature.                 The 26th
 of March (being Good Friday) had attracted all the inha-

  yrho has resided may years at the Caraccas, .and was an eye-witness to the
  scenes which he describes.    He was taken prisoner, on his return to France
  on board the American ship Dolphin, by Capt. Malcolm of the Rhin fri
  gate.  To the latter gentleman our readers are indebted for the publication

162            Account  of the late Earthquake
bitants to the churches of the city which were destroyed ;
thus serving for their tombs : the churches of La Trinidad
and AltaGracia, which were in the more immediate vicinity
of the mountain, experienced more forcibly the effects of
the extraordinary commotion ; for although originally up
wards of 150 feet high, no part of their ruins exceeded five
or six feet in height ; and some idea may be formed of the
violence of the shock which overturned these stupendous
edifices, when it is recollected that they were supported by
columns and pilasters exceeding thirty or forty feet in cir
cumference, and of which scarcely a vestige remained.
    A superb range of barracks two stories high, capable of
containing 4000 men; and serving as a depot for the artil
lery, shared the same ruin : a regiment of the line, in the
act of marching to join in a religious procession, was al
most wholly swallowed up ; a few men only being left
alive.
   It is impossible to paint the terror and desolation which
this catastrophe occasioned : disorder, confusion, despair,
misery, and fanaticism were at their height. At first every
person fled as well as they were able, prostrating themselves
to supplicate heaven for mercy ; in this state the individuals
who escaped death, mutilated or wounded, covered with
dust, their clothes torn, and carrying in their arms their
children, or the sick and wounded, presented a most heart
rending spectacle.    After the first moments of terror, in
which self-preservation     made every other consideration
give way, the most painful recollections agitated those
who had escaped; every one with distracted anxiety sought
for a relation or a friend, and inquired for them with looks
of terror and affright : among the bloody and desolate
ruins, those who remained of the unfortunate population
were seen endeavouring to dig up, without other instrument
than their weak and trembling hands, the living and the
dead who were covered by the fragments : every one ran
to and fro over this vast burial-place, throwing themselves
occasionally on the rubbish, and listening with an attentive
ear to the groans of the unfortunate whose lives were pre
served, although shut up, perhaps irrecoverably, in the very
buildings where they had enjoyed tranquillity and happiness
but a few minutes before.
   The remainder of the day and the whole of the night
were devoted to this interesting      and pious occupation.
Next day, it was necessary to perform the last offices to the
dead, but it was impossible to bestow on them the rites of
sepulture j instruments and a sufficient number of persons
                                                          were

                         at the Caraccas.                  163
tvere not to be found : in order to avoid the effects of a
pestilence, therefore, from an infected atmosphere, the
bodies were piled up at different stations and burnt with
the timber of the ruins.     The first sad moments after the
catastrophe were thus spent: other labours, equally if not
more distressing, remained to be performed.
    Almost all the provisions, furniture, linen, and the
usual necessaries of life were destroyed, or had been stolen
by the lower class of the populace, or- the negroes: every
thing was in short wanting. The violence of the earth
quake had destroyed the water-pipes, and the rivulets were
either dried up, or diverted from their usual course : there
was in fact no water near the city; there were no vessels
in which to collect    it,
                         and  itwas necessary to travel far off
before   aquantity sufficient to allay one-s thirst was ob
tained, even      by
                 using the hands to carry    to the mouth.
                                            it
   Pressed   bythirst and hunger and the want of an asylum,
those who possessed country houses fled towards them on
foot but alas
    ;             !nothing was spared — all was ruin and de
solation ; and they returned to the city, where they seemed
to be less miserable among their companions in misfortune,
the silence and solitude of the country apparently adding
to the dismal aspect of nature.
   The markets were without provisions; the farmers brought
none into town; and many, after wandering about in search
of food, at length lay down and died of hunger those who
                                                 :
survived obtained sustenance with much difficulty.        Had
not some cocoa, sugar, and maize been saved, (which were
retailed at  amost exorbitant price,) more would have pe
rished from hunger than from the effects of the earth
quake.
  Three thousand wounded of all ranks were collected        and
placed at first on the banks of     river, under the shade of
                                      a
some trees   : but they were absolutely in want of every
thing, even the most indispensable requisites    :   they were
abandoned;to the medicine of consolation     : they were told
that they  must  conform  to  the decrees  of providence, and
that every thing was for the best.
   During this awful crisis, judicious observer of mankind
                              a
might have witnessed     astriking exhibition of the manners,,
character, and principles,    bywhich the Spanish people are
regulated  in their conduct.
   Their extreme insensibility       scarcely credible

conversation with an image of the Virgin, or some privi
leged saint *.        Others gaily drowned their sorrow in rum j
and all appeared much less grieved at the event, than they
would have been at the loss of a process which affected
their rank as nobles, or deprived them of their precedence
in a public company or at a religious procession.
     It is loo true, that human beings, naturally superstitious
and ungrateful, never so cordially respect their deities or
their kings when they are beneficent as when they are
severe: the more rigorous they are, the more just and
equitable are they esteemed.          Such is the lot of mankind !
 they forget benefits ; and governors, in order to acquire
 the homage which is due to them, must be feared : grati
 tude and love are sentiments too delicate to be common
 among mankind.
     Good Friday is without doubt the most imposing of the
 Catholic holidavs : it is that which ought to inspire the
 most pious reflections ; but at the Caraccas, as in many
 other places, on this occasion, the women are occupied
 with their dress, more anxious perhaps to appear amiable in
 the sight of men than to worship the supreme Being: they
  think of nothing but amusement, and they almost forget
  that Being who does not manifest himself openly. But
 scarcely had they experienced the earthquake, when they
 said it was the thunder of Heaven sent to punish the crimes
 of mortals: their elegant clothes were immediately laid
 aside; those who had it in their power changed them for
  Coarse garments, by way of showing their penitence: sack
  cloth, cords, and chains, were substituted for elegant fa
  shions and seductive head-dresses.            The ladies now sub
 jected themselves to monastic discipline, and beat without
  remorse their bosoms, but a short time before adorned with
 the most costly jewels : many of the gentlemen at the sam«
  time forgot their gallantrv for fanaticism ; and, in order to
  appease the anger of Heaven,         they walked night and day
  in processions, the body entirely uncovered with the ex
  ception of a large girdle, barefooted and with long beards,
  a cord around their necks to which was frequently attached
  a large stone, and on their shoulders they sometimes car
  ried a wooden cross 100 or 150 pounds in weight.
      In the city and throughout the country there were pro
  cessions day and night; every mountain was transformed
  into a Calvary-, where the people dying with hunger im-

plored the divine mercy, embracing with groans the relics
of their tutelar saints.
    Every one accused himself of having called down the
anger of Heaven, and of having caused the universal ca
lamity : those who could not meet with a priest openly
confessed their sins upon the highways, accusing them
selves of robberies and murders which they had secretly
committed.
    In less than two days about 2000 individuals (who per
haps never had any intention of the kind) were married :
relaiions formerly despised or neglected on account of their
poverty were now recognised : many unfortunate children,
the truits of an illegitimate intercourse,        who had never
known father or mother, were now acknowledged                   and
legitimated.    At the same    time  an infinite number   of  resti
tutions were made, and law-suits terminated. But not
withstanding all this remorse, a singular and paradoxical
 spectacle was exhibited to the eyes of the philosopher :
while one half of the multitude thus hastened to expiate
 their offences, the other half, who perhaps never had been
 guilty of any great crimes before, but possessing an ac
 commodating conscience, profited by the confusion, and
 with the utmost composure committed every imaginable
 excess.
    In the mean time the shocks from the earthquake con
tinued ; — every day and every hour some ruins fell, which
 had been only shaken by the first commotions.             On the
 5th of April, at four in the afternoon, there     was  a shock so
 violent that several mountains were rent asunder, many in
 clined from their centre of gravity, and enormous detached
 rocks were precipitated to the valleys.
    From the above hour until nine o-clock next morning
 the shocks were violent, and so frequent as to admit of an
 interval of about five minutes only between each ; and du
 ring these intervals a rumbling subterraneous noise was
 heard, and the earth was continually agitated.
    The succession of these phaenomena was not interrupted
 in the month of December 1812, when I left the place, and
 those were reckoned the most tranquil days, in which there
 were only fifteen or twentv shocks ! Every thing was de
 stroyed; the ramparts of La Guyra, not less than twenty
 feet in thickness, were thrown down.            As a natural con
 sequence of the opening of the mountains, which are the
 great reservoirs of water, some rivers were observed to have
 considerably increased.      Many high mountains were rent

     It is difficult to say what will be the close of this dread
 ful event : it may be hazarded as a conjecture, however,
 that it will end in the opening up of one or more volca
 noes : in the mean time the unfortunate inhabitants of
 these countries, attached to their native soil, and not
 wishing to abandon the ashes of their fathers, have with,
 great labour erected rude habitations, in which they await
 with stoicism and resignation the termination of their ca

 Sir, — About two years ago I             resided at Hatherleigh            in,
 Devonshire, where        Ihad     day-school, and lodged with

 people who kept      shop: they had frequent occasion to cast

 mechanical contrivance could be invented to cast up bills,
it  would be of great service to many, or even to all who are
in business.      I knew that multiplication, division, and
many other rules       arithmetic, were often worked mechani
                      in
cally; but addition being in itself so irregular, was afraid  I
no instrument could be invented to work it. However,                        by
repeatedly considering the subject,           discovered after some

friend of mine got me one of the lists of premiums offered

                         of the Society  the Encouragement of Arts, Manu
factures, and Commerce, for 1812.       The silver medal of the Society wai
 voted to Mr. Goss for this communication, and the Instrument          is
                                                                        pre
 served in the Society's Repository.
                                                                            by

    Addition of Numbers with Accuracy and Dispatch,        167
by the Society of Arts, &c. published in the year 1809.
After I had read of those honorary and pecuniary rewards
which    had been given, and were then offered, my desire
to obtain some mark of the Society's approbation could
not be appeased but by possession, and I was determined
to carry my idea- into execution ; I immediately renewed
my study of this instrument with increased application.
    Casting up bills is what falls to the lot of most people
in business, and many who are moderately clever at it often
find it a troublesome task before they can place any depen
dence on their being right ; they have need to cast them
up two or three times, and even then have often as many
different sums, and therefore frequently find themselves
much contused and puzzled in the operation : the instru
ment of my invention in such cases would be very accept
able : it would take the work from the mind, and give it to
the hand, which would perform it with greater ease, accu
racy, and expedition ; a person who can only read figures,
may by this help add up a bill with as much accuracy as &
 mathematician.
    The same day I completed my instrument, I showed it
 to the people with whom I lodged, who as I have already
 observed were shop-keepers.      I wrote a bill, and desired
 them to cast it up ; I then showed them how to do it by
 my wheel, and desired them to add up the same bill by
               was right.                                   it it,
 and see   if   it          They then proceeded, and cast
up righl    bythe wheel, when they discovered that they had
made   a  mistake of one shilling in the row of pence, and
 two shillings in the row of shillings.   They were therefore
much pleased with my new contrivance, because         it   was
 more true and less troublesome than the common way.
    This wheel has four circular rows of figures upon its
face.    The first row whichis   nearest the teeth on the cir
cumference, denotes pence, the second shillings, and the
third and fourth denote the total number     ofpence or shil
lings, &c. Thus,     if C4 in the third row should be under
the index,      if
                 I were casting up pence,I   should see in the
first row,  4 under or next before the index, and the next
red figure passed over by the index would be 5, which

Reference to the Engraving of Mr.                   J. Goss's Instrument
    to work the Addition of Numbers in Arithmetic.                    Plate
    V. Fig. 1, 2, 3, 4.
   This instrument consists of a brass hoop, fixed to a flat
circular plane of wood; this hoop is divided on its upper
edge into 180 ratchet or saw-like teeth, and the circle has
a number of radii lines of figures upon its face, in divisions
corresponding with the teeth; also of a supporting circle,
having a fixed index reaching across those lines of figures ;
and a circular row of 20 divisions, and another of 50, cor
respondent      to the ratchet         teeth  ;   and  of a brass  central
index which takes into the teeth, and will turn the ring in
one direction only, to one certain place or stop ; and then,
the numbers on the circle, close to the fixed index, will
show the sum total of the different numbers to which it
has been turned round, at any number of intervals. Fig. 1.
is a plan, showing a portion of the moveable hoop and
circle, and the numbers which are upon its face.                    Fig. 2.
is a section of the instrument, answering to the same.
Fig. 3. is a plan, on a smaller scale, of the instrument
on the under side ;                and fig. 4. an edge view corre
 sponding with        it ;   the  same   letters of reference are used
 in all the figures.            AA represents the principal upper
 or moveable circle, on which some of the numbers are
 marked; this is attached by a centre pin R to another cir
 cle BB, figs. 2, 3, and 4, which is held in the hand when
 the instrument is used.; these two circles turn round freely
 upon each other, and upon the centre of the upper one a
 radial lever, or index, CL, is fixed, which has a free motion
 round the centre pin R.                The circle AA has a ring or
 hoop     of brass   MM,       fixed  round   its circumference, which
 is cut into 180 serrated teeth, as shown in fig. 2. The
                                                                     centre

centre index CL slips over the sloping side of these teeth
when moved in one direction ; but when moved in the
other, its edge c catches into the perpendicular sides of the
teeth, and carries the circle round with it. EE, fig. 3, are
two brass cocks, screwed to the side of the lower circle
EB, and projecting from it beyond the circumference M
of the upper circle; the ends of them support a flat circular
wooden or brass limb, FF, which (as shown in fig. 1.) has
other correspondent           divisions and figures upon             over                    it,
.which the index passes              at one end of the limb
                                              :                      wire                         a

               is                                   pressed against this,
                                                                      is

 upon the edge of the great circle A; so that, by moving the
 index to any of these numbers, its edge                will have passed   C
 over the same number of teeth of the circle, as the number
 of the limb which                carried to denotes

moveable on a centre pin attached by a stud H to the lower
circle BB, and its tail is pressed by a small spring h, which
causes it to press constantly upon the under side of the

 Constantinople                for a long period gave laws to Europe
 jn the arts ; but in spite of the influence which this school
 may have had over the painters of Rome, the ancient
 models, always reviving in this rich capital of the world,
 presented nourishment too abundant and too wholesome to
 encourage a preference for the new style of paintings sent
 from the East, to which they conformed occasionally
 merely out of condescension.               All the artists of Rome, in
 short, down to the time of Raphael, knew how to profit
by the innumerable sculptures and subterranean paintings
 which were daily discovered in that famous city. There
 cannot be a doubt, therefore, that the character of this
 school consisted at all times in a correct style, in clear and
 expressive pantomimes, forcible and yet agreeable, as well
 as in draperies of a good taste; and we ought therefore to
 regard this school as the first preserver of the true ancient
 style of painting *.

these sepulchral ornaments Moses striking the ro".k, Jesus entering into
 Nazareth, or standing in the midst of his apostles, and so many other sa-

    When Byzantium became the residence of Constantlne,
his favourite city was enriched not only with beautiful
monuments brought from Rome, but there were also col
lected at the same place such objects of the greatest rarity
as still existed in ancient Greece.              The number of famous
statues and pictures, according to historians, was immense;
and it is truly astonishing that so many fine models had
not perpetuated a race of good artists even in spite of,every
obstacle.       To say nevertheless that there no longer remains
 any thing of the ancient simplicity, or of the grandetfr and
dignity so essential to the majesty of the art, would betray
 an ignorance of the progress of the human mind ; and, we
may even conjecture, that in the same way as certain em
perors at Rome caused either from taste or caprice, the an*
cient style of the Greek sculpture to be imitated, so also we see
 certain artists of the present day, from motives which we
cannot exactly divine, assume the ancient characters of the
schools, and reproduce recollections of the beautiful, in such,
a way that observers, more than once in this school, must
have met with figures full of elegance and simplicity*.                      In
general the characters of the Greek school of Constantinople
are gravity, dignity, and even beauty, although indicated by
 feeble means        f.
                 Florentine School of the middle -Age.
     I should be inclined to believe that the zeal and enthu
siasm which were manifested at Florence for ancient litera
ture, at a period probably anterior to that of the Medici,
produced among the artists of that period an inventive
 and poetical taste, and that it was in this school that the
tions of the ancient mythology.        In the same way there is reason to be-
lieve that the style of portable pictures painted upon wood, and which have
been destroyed by time, was a continuation      of the style of the preceding
paintings. The Catacombs exhibit proofs of this.
   • Witness, for example, the statue of Julian the apostate in the Napoleon
Museum, No. 6.
    f Those who have not seen the grand Mosaics of the most ancient
 churches in Rome may consult, intft atia, the engravings of Ciampini, and
particularly that which represents the Mosaic of Saint Agatha, of Ravenna,
torn, i tab. ilv. as well as the engraving tab. liv. and several others in the
same work, which will show the noble simplicity of the Greek style of Con
stantinople.     It is worthy of remark, that the artists which Italy attracted
from this city were rather Mosaic daubers, than painters properly so
called.   It is a pity that they should have so frequently repeated the ideal
 of each other : nevertheless, upon considering their works with attention,
we discover more variety than is at first imagined ; and they possess this in
common with all the ancients, who are very different from each other, when
they are considered with care and without prejudice.
                                                                     qualities

qualities of expression       were most frequently to be found.
To attain this there was no occasion for the assistance of
the Greeks and Romans : the mere bent of the genius of
the artists and the study of the passions were sufficient.
Hence those painters, who gradually got rid of the ancient
maxims in their taste and in their style, gave more ani
mation to their figures.       Hence proceeded those expressive
and true images which have been subjects of imitation
with so many subsequent painters ; hence those physio
gnomies truly natural, and inspired by a sound judgement
and feeling heart.        In this school therefore may be ac
 quired a great accuracy of delineation, a quality which
alone perhaps, when it was properly appreciated, formed
 the Verrochios,the Michael-Angelos, the Leonardis, and the
 bold designers who adorned Tuscany, and whose celebrity
 was such that the whole of the painters of Italy, in studying
 their designs, were forced to imitate their new taste. May we
 not suppose also, that fhis custom of servilely copying in
 dividual peculiarities, and this neglect of the aneient mo
 dels, may have led them to introduce into almost all their
 subjects the costumes of contemporaries? and perhaps several
 pictures of that time, in which the costume is Grecian,
 have been executed by Florentifflq artists.
                 Venetian Sckqg^ff^fi'middle       Age.
     Venice received the artsfrojBoiIhe East, and her school
  of painting was much more influenced by the painters of
  Constantinople than by those of Rome or Florence : there
  was a direct and commercial communication with the city
  in which the emperors had taken up their residence ; and
  if commerce ought to be considered as a vehicle of, or as
  influential on, the arts, we may easily conceive that all the
  portable works, which could be regarded as objects of spe
  culation, must have had the character of those which were
  exported from the East.         The Venetians, following (he ex
  ample    of  the  Orientalists,  studied brilliancy of colouring,
   and all the arts by which this effect could be obtained ; and
  it would seem that not only did they profit by the rich co
   louring materials which commerce procured them, but
   long before the time of Giorgioni there were painters who
   studied the calculation of the masses of chiaro-oscuro, as
   well as the effects of opposite shades ; so that this school can
   not fail to be regarded as the parent of the modern colourists j
   since long before the Carpacci, the Basacti, and even the
   Bellini, they had atways painted with vivid and durable co
                                                               lours.

  lours *, Thus,      I have no doubt that, by carefully pursuing
  these researches, we may be able to discover the source of
  the colouring in the most distant periods of this school.
  We may also add to these causes the custom of contem
  plating the highly coloured dresses of the Levantines who
  visited Venice ; but their painters, not having the ancient
  models, nor the manners of the East, could not perpetuate
  the grand style which belongs to design.
                      Gothic School     of the North.
     Although      the general    appellation of Gothic has been
  given   to the  architecture    of the middle age, the constant
  contemplation of ancient monuments must nevertheless
  force us to acknowledge certain distinctions in the various
  stvles.    The Italians, for example, gave the name of Arabo-
  tudesco to the style of the dome of the Great Church at
  Florence, built by Arnolfo in 1290; and they add thai it
 is a mixture of the Moorish or good Greek with the Ger-
 mano-Gothic.         In architecture a distinction has also been
 made among other styles, of the Saracen and the Saxo-
  Gothic.     Sculpture has not been submitted to the same
 analyses, since its productions have been too much neg
 lected ; but the styles of painting were still more forgotttn,
 and their different characters have not even been inquired
 into. The appellation of Gothic has therefore been given
 indiscriminately to all those paintings of a different phy
 siognomy from those of the modern schools of Italy, and
 a great confusion of ideas has consequently been the result.
 Now, as the few paintings which were to be"fotind in the
 North, before the existence of the Florentine school, were
 confined to some imitation of the Greek- Christian style,
 and presented but a very small number of images, it was
 thought that the Gothic style in painting was precisely
 that which had so abundantly filled France, Germany, and
 the whole of the North, with the vicious studies which
 were brought from Italy.          We may therefore say that the
 school which has been called Gothic, originated much later
 than has been imagined, beginning only at the epoch when
 the influence of the ancient styles had become almost null ;
 and when caprice, the barbarous taste            of the times, and the
    * AH the movable paintings anterior to the innovation of John of Bruges,
introduced at Venice by Antonello de Messina about the year 1450, were
executed with white of eggs, wax, or gum; and when oil was introduced
into the colours, it was merely used to finish, or to give permanence to,
the pictures already far advanced by the first processes.  Several Venetiati
pieces in the Napoleon Museum are painted in this way.
                                                                       tone^

sential qualities, painting also,      which    was  more generally
attainable, was almost entirely abandoned to the taste of
those who attached themselves to                 as

withstanding the ingenuity       of  some    figures jn  certain ma
nuscripts,  it   can never be said that in these countries the
art was upon the same level as in Italy.           Some time after
wards the influence of the styles of some men very justly
celebrated elsewhere, such as Albert Durer and Van Eckc,
did nothing but degrade even the bad taste which prevailed;
and it   was after their time        particular, and after the pre
                                     in
tended imitations of the Florentine school, that artists every
where produced on glass, in altar- pieces, and in books, those
works equallv ridiculous as disgusting, and which are still
to be met with daily        :   it  probable, therefore, that
                                     is                            in if
these countries there are occasionally paintings of some
value, they have been the productions of foreigners in
vited there either     by   the princes and churchmen, or                     by
some rich individuals.        We may therefore repeat that, in
the North, the style of almost all the paintings of the six
teenth century, notwithstanding certain qualities which
sometimes render them valuable,               truly barbarous
                                               is                and ;
that this  is  the sole and true cause of that disgust which
has been erroneously referred to causes originating              for in
mer ages, which were supposed to have been still more
barbarous.
  It  will be no longer astonishing that             has been falsely
                                                        it
supposed that painting took its rise in the sixteenth cen
tury, since,    infact, we generally find in the countries of the
North styles which may be referred to the aera of the new
schools, and since the churches, monasteries, and public
buildings, were every where emblazoned with the mixed
tastes of so many new painters            ;tastes which were even
combined with that of Michael Aneelo, the aspect of which
gives to the public the false idea of works executed more
than hundred years before.
       a                              This school was the aera of
 those attitudes and of those harsh and angular postures,
 the aera of the barbarous superfluity of hack grounds and ac
cessaries, perpetuated perhaps            the slight degradation of

to have been brought from the Vatican: in a word, it was
then that they introduced the strange and revolting custom
of employing grotesque draperies of woollen stuff or moist
ened parchment : a style which even for gravest subjects
too much resembles that which painters would study at
present in our great cities, were they to frequent every
public masquerade.
    Let persons call these shameful perversions of painting
Qothic if they please; they possess nothing in common
with the fine arts of antiquity, and it is unfair to class them
with the simple and rational productions of the middle
age : certainly it was not these miserable daubings which
Raphael made use of as his models j and it would not be
absurd to suppose, that in these degraded times that con
tempt arose which the Italians have ever since cherished
for ultramontane artists.
  I   conclude therefore from these observations, that Rome
in the middle age produced paintings of a simple, rational,
and regularly composed style, and that there are to be
found in the works of that time subjects clearly conceived
and finely expressed, — methodical compositions, and dra
peries of a happy and graceful flow: that the Greek school
of the Lower Empire always presented figures of a severe
 and dignified character ; that it still excels with the lustre
of the colours of the Eist, and that it propagated this grand
 and ancient problem, magnificence on simplicity.        I con
 clude that Tuscany witnessed the cultivation of painting
 by men of genius, who formed for themselves a style ani
 mated, but not very conformable to the elevation of the
 arts : that Venice exhibited in the most distant periods
proofs of intelligence in colouring and chiaro-oscuro, and
 participated in some respects with the Greek taste of Con
 stantinople : in a word, that the Goths of the North, who
 went in search of the arts to that Florence whose celebrity
 attracted the whole world, brought nothing from          it,  or
 from Rome, but superficial and altered idtas, or false and
 trivial traditions, which spread thoughout their own still
 barbarous country all those hideous images which        I. will
 ingly   abandon   to the ill-nature of the malcontents.
     There certainly were mixtures of these various manners
 in different countries but the characters of these schools
                       ;
 are not the less determined, and seem to be founded on the
 nature of things.
  It    has been already shown how erroneous the opinion of
 those has been, who, confounding all .times and stvle6, do
 aot admit of common sense as guiding the painters until

 the efforts of the celebrated men of the sixteenth century.
 Here we ought to enforce a principle which is very pal
 pable, and easy of being retained, viz. that the art of
 painting is the purer, the nearer it approaches ancient times j
 that all which it has acquired in practical perfection, in sub*
 sequent ages, has only improved it in so far as artists have
 preserved a respect for ancient doctrines ; and lastly, that
 if the manners and society of posterior times have restored
 its credit and activitv, it is nevertheless true, that the best
 productions of the epoch called improperly enough the
 aera of the revival of letters, are those in which the new
 styles and imitations were not substituted for the ancient
 documents.     The art therefore never perished ; and when
 we compare the evils which it experienced at the periods
of the conquests of the barbarians, with those which were
 brought upon it by the theories of the new students, we
 shall not hesitate to affirm, that it has suffered much more
 from the latter than from the former, and that their true
destroyers have exerted their ravages much more directly
 and much more slowly than has been imagined.
    Besides, in order to have a clear idea of these influences,
 and of the progress of the art, we must necessarily have
seen and attentively considered the various productions on
 which these influences were exercised.          But how much
 have these inquiries been despised !       In fact, that person
 who, after having expressed his disgust at the sight of
 some of the vignettes of a manuscript of the sixteenth
century, or of some badly stained glass much more mo
dern, will inform us that the Gothic is a pitiful style; such
a person, I say, who has seen those insufficient objects and
some scraps of portraits, h achiever visited Tuscany, Venice,
 or Rome, has no knowledge of the fragments deposited
in the voluminous collections of Bosio, Aringhi, Ciampini,
 Battari, and others : he passes by with disdain some valu
 able paintings which are frequently found in the cabinets
 of the curious, and he despises them because they are not
decorated with the livery of our schools.        In a word, the
 belief is too prevalent, that with the sixteenth century
painting revived ; and 011 the contrary the term revival is
applied very improperly to the aera at which, perhaps, the
 art began to receive the last touches of degradation : and
if  eminent men and bokl and original artists have adorned
this memorable aera, if the too famous Michael Angelo
by his pompous works has attracted the notice of all men ;
it is notwithstanding true, that he has stripped the ancient
art of its naivete", and the best picture* even of the present

dav are those in which we trace the beauty, the true siril-
plicity, and the striking truths of nature.  Thus the period
of the corruption of the art was not        when  it lost its
honours and consideration, but rather that it was no longer
founded upon the grand principles which are its true sup
porters ; and such is the immutable order of things, that
all the splendour of the Cartoni, the Bernini, all the noise
inade by the Vanloos and the Bouchers never disguised the
degraded state of paining.
   Siuce therefore a new aera has commenced, and the art
has risen by the force oi genius alone, and without the aid
of that cruel benefit of nature, which generally paves the
way for the lustre of the arts by the previous darkness of
 destruction,-*— ought we not boldly to extinguish the preju
dices which still pursue us, and reject with dignity all that
is unworthy of our new glory ?
   But we shall now point out more precisely the various
qualities observed in the last productions of the languishing
and enfeebled art, and prove that they have been common
at all times to the works of the most distinguished, both
among ancient and modern artists.

Dear Sir, — When        I  say that   Ihave been greatly sur
prised to see in the second part of the Philosophical Trans
actions for 1812, Don Rodriguez-s animadversions            upon
part of the English Trigonometrical Survey,          conjecture

that  I am merely describing    feeling which has been more

that nation, the Royal Society, that is,          work which
                                                     in   a

censures currency in such a vehicle: but how much more
extraordinary must it be thought, if on inquiry it shall ap
pear that his strictures are causeless, and therefore unjust I
This is an inquiry which every man of competent informa
 tion, who has at heart the honour of his country, has a
right to institute: and, however unpleasant the under
 taking may in some respects be, I enter upon it without
delay, because Colonel Mudge, whose reputation is so
deeply implicated in this business, is at present prevented
from giving Don Rodriguez's paper that decided and com
plete refutation which it will hereafter receive at his hands;
and because his silence, though unavoidable, may be con
strued into defeat.
     Impressed   by these considerations,   I  propose in this
communication to show, that the obsei vat ions of this in
genious foreigner are, in all his main positions, unfounded;
and although the matter under investigation is, in general,
 so nearly elementary,    that any man of moderate scientific
attainments might safely rest the truth of his assertions
 upon his own character and their intrinsic evidence ; yet,
 lest it should be apprehended that, on this occasion, my
judgement may be warped either by strong national feeling,
or by private attachrrienl, I shall fortify my positions, as  I
 go along, by such authorities as neither Don Rodriguez
 nor any other person will be inclined to Question.
     Before I proceed to the points which Don Rodriguez
 selects as the basis of his animadversions,     it may not be
 thought improper if I briefly advert to what appears his
 main, if not his sole object, in making those animadver
 sions at all.  I shall not, I hope, be deemed uncandid, if
 I say, that to me this object appears to be no other than
 the depression of English (and perhaps other) ingenuity
 anct exertion, in order to the undue exaltation of the French
 scientific character.   To this end, as it would seem, (for
 to what other purpose can it be ?) we are told that in con
 sequence of u the general impulse which the human mind
 received" from the French revolution, the members of ttieir
 academy of sciences
                        " invented new instruments, new me-     x-
 thods, new formula?," for the purpose of ascertaining the-
  figure of the earth, &c. and commenced •• an important
  undertaking almost the whole of which consisted of some
  thing new in science." I have no wish to depreciate the
 value of the discoveries and improvements of the Fiench
 mathematicians ; yet surely I may affirm that much had
 been done with respect to the grand topic in question, long
 before the French revolution.     Did not Euler invent "new
                               il9                     methods

methods and new formulae" for this express purpose, and"
publish them so long back as the year 1753, in the Berlin
Memoirs ? Did not Dionis du Sejour much improve this
branch of analytical theory ? Did1 not Professor Playfair
solve the general problem in all its useful varieties in the
Edinburgh Transactions, before the publication of Delam-
bre's investigations ? Did not General Roy, and the subse
quent English measurers, publish ingenious formulae in the
Philosophical Transactions; although Don Rodriguez in
sinuates that their methods are kept back ? And, with re
spect to actual admeasurements, might not the Don have
learnt from the Philosophical Transactions (see volumes
Ixxv. Ixxvii. Ixxx. &c.) that Government surveys were com
menced in Scotland, so long back as 1745, by Lieut. Gen.
Watson; that in 1 775 the work was continued; that in
 1 783 an authorized committee      or deputation of the ma
thematical    philosophers   of Eogland and France met at
Dover, to concert the best means of carrying a series of
triangles from Greenwich to Paris ; that the work was soon
after pursued by the appointed persons in both countries;
and that from that period it has almost regularly proceeded
in England, whatever interruptions it may have expe
rienced in France ?     How, then, can a writer insert in the
Philosophical Transactions, where evidence to the contrary
abounds, a paper from which, all who are miacquainted
with the history of this important class of operation?
would conclude that they originated in the determination
»f the French to " establish a new system of weights ani
measures ?" »
    To the same end apparently tends the Don-s assertion
that " the Swedish Academy of Sciences, encouraged by the
success of the operations conducted in France, sent als«
three of its members" into Lapland to verify their former
measurement." For the natural tendency of this state
ment is to produce the belief, that the recent operations of
the Swedish philosophers were in humble imitation of the
French, and that they were undertaken for the purpose of
verifying or of correcting their own former admeasure
ment; in both which respects the colouring given is widely
diffe rent from the truth.     The Lapland measure in 1736
was not conducted by Swedish, but by French academicians ;
and ihe correction of it was proposed long before the
French revolution. The following are the true circum
stances of the case, as I received them from a learned Swede.
Melanderhielm, the venerable president of the Stockholm
Academy, had almost from his youth doubted the accuracy

   of the operations of 1 736, and sought anxiously for an
  opportunity of repeating them ; but waited many years
   before he could avail himself of a favourable conjuncture
   of circumstances ; although latterly he had found ifi
   M. Svanberg, a young man of great talent and activitv to
  conduct the operative part. After hearing of the new
   measure of a degree by MM. Delambre and Mechain, he
  wrote to some of the French mathematicians on the sub
  ject, but with no intention of soliciting them to visit Lap
  land. Soon after this, Bonaparte, at the suggestion of the
   then National Institute, wrote a letter personally to the late
  king of Sweden, requesting permission for some members
  of that body to proceed to Lapland, in order to determine
  an arc of the meridian.    That high-spirited young monarch
  replied, that he would  consult  his own Academy of Sciences
  at Stockholm, whether       such an operation was desirable
  for the interests of science ; and, if they were of that opii
  nion, he had no doubt he could find Swedish mathemati
 cians competent to the undertaking. Hence MM. Svan
 berg, Ofverbom, Holmquist, and Palander were appointed
 to examine and repeat the measure of the French acade
 micians; and this is what Don Rodriguez terms the ex
 pedition of three of the Swedish academicians '' to Lap
 land to verify their former measurement 1"
     With the same spirit it is natural to suspect Don Rodri
 guez speaks of Culonel Mudge as       " a skilful observer," and
 merely such, adding       that "one    cannot   but admire the.
 beauty and perfection of the instruments employed
                                                             "

 him : while, when he characterizes the labours of the French
 measurers, he assures u* they " merit the highest degree of
 confidence;" and, " by the sanction of such an union of
 talents, give such a degree of credit and authenticity to their
conclusions, as could scarcely be acquired by other means."
 I shall not animadvert upon this invidious contrast ; but
simply remark here, that the Don adopts a strange methed
of verifying his positions. He admits that Colonel Mudge
is a skilful observer, who knows very well how to employ
 his instruments ; and, that there may remain no doubt on
that head, publishes a long paper to prove, or at least to
 show it probable, that he has made a mistake of 4\ se
conds in the determination of a zenith-distance.             This
animadverter has, as he assures us, gone through all the
Colonel-s computations by different processes, and found
them correct, or onlv evincing very trifling discrepancies,
such as may naturally arise from the diversity of methods :

 commendation      on him as a computer, or as an investi*
 gator.
     The preceding remarks will suffice, I apprehend, to ren
 der manifest the probable object or" Don Rodriguez's paper.
 I  shall now proceed to inqtiire how far the reasons assigned
 by this gentleman bear hiin out in his attempt to throw
 suspicion upon the operations of Colonel Mudge in mea
 suring an arc of the meridian. The Don's paper, it is true,
 is rather desultory and unconnected ; but 1 trust I shall
 neither misrepresent him, nor do injustice to his arguments,
 by endeavouring to reduce them to the following order.
     1. Colonel Mudge-s observations must be wrong some
 where, because his results do not correspond with those of
the French measurers. Tin"s is not positively affirmed, but
every where strongly implied : for Don R. assumes his
value of the radius of the earth-s equator from the French
measurements       and computations ; and he takes it for
granted, that the fraction exhibiting the ratio of the difference
of the earth's axes to the major axis, technically termed the
compression, lies somewhere between those limits (-5-^ and
-j-f-y)  which a superficial observer would adopt as most
suitable to the French operations.            Such assumptions, by
the way, are neither consistent with fair criticism nHf with
sound logic : for the grand object in measuring arcs of
meridians is to determine the ratio of the earth-s axes ; and
when in the course of any such admeasurements avowedly
remarkable anomalies arise, it is a mere petitio principii to
conclude that there must be some error in the astronomical
observations, because irregularities       as great or greater than
those which tlje operat>ons indicated result from computa
tions resting upon a gratuitously assumed ratio.
     But some of the French operations at home, compared
with those at Peru, give about .3-^-5. tor the compression*.
Be it so. That is no reason why any such ratio should be
adopted as the te6t by which to try the accuracy of English
observations,    Don Rodriguez himself, when applying the
same test to the French meridian, thereby detects irregu
larities, and great ones too; yet does not whisper the
gentlest hint that they were occasioned by inaccurate ob»
servations.    Why not ? Because M. Mechain " handled
instruments with great delicacy, and was possessed of pe-
euliar talents for this species of observation." So that &
gratuitous assumption should suffice to render English ob
servations doubtful, while it leaves the accuracy of French

©net  unimpeached.      To me it appears that a candid critic
would in analogous circumstances        make analogous in
ferences ; and not sift one class of results to the bottom,
while he satisfies himself with merely glancing at the sur
face of the other class.     Had he examined the French
measures a little more minutely, he would, instead of adopt
ing them as his standard, have found that they exhibit
far too great irregularities to be entitled to that honour.
Taking the results of the operations of Delambre and Me-
chain, as subdivided naturally by the assumed stations at
Dunkirk, the Pantheon at Paris, Evaux, Carcassone, and
Montjouy, and applying to them the principle developed
by Legendre, in which " the sum of the squares of th«
errors is made a minimum," the requisite compression is
i4t ; and even then, the deviations from what the theory
would require are, at Dunkirk —2 "23, that              is,
                                                    nearly 2$
decimal seconds; at the Pantheon, + 5"63; at Evaux,
— 4,"79; and at Carcassone, + 1-"34.      Here the compres
sion which agrees best with the observations      more than
                                                       is
double what     ought to be.
               it                If medium compression had
                                     a
been chosen, the errors at the several stations would have
deviated still further from the probable errors- of observa
tion.    Don Rodriguez will find this confirmed         by

Systeme du Monde, liv.     i. ch. 12.   After he has duly re
flected upon the deductions of those philosophers, he will
perhaps be convinced that he has been rather precipitate in
taking the French operations as      astandard.
   But 2dly, This writer infers that there must be some
error in Col. Mudge's observations, because they tend to
show that the terrestrial spheroid      verv irregular.
                                          is              All the
measurementSi *' which have been hitherto made in the
northern hemisphere are (he tells us) extremely satisfactory
by  their agreement, and give us great reason to presume
that the general level of the earth-s surface     elliptical, and
                                                  is
very regularly so."
                       '' There would not have remained the
smallest doubt respecting the earth being flattened at the
poles," but for the "measurement performed            England."
                                                       in
But '- this measure alone would lead to the supposition,
that the earth, instead of being flattened at the poles, is,    in
fact, more elevated at that part (the author means those
parts) than at the equator, or, at least, that its surface      is
not that  ofa  regular solid."    The degrees, in fact, increase
as the latitudes    diminish ;   which, says Don Rodriguez,

vations themselves   j"  whereas, the enly fair inference       is,

that an insular situation is very ill fitted to promote the
determination of the figure of the earth.
    Let us see, however, how " satisfactory" former mea
sures have been "by their agreement," and how completely
they prove that, the earth-s surface is
                                              " very regularly" ef-
hptical. Lacaille-s degree in lat. 45° N. compared with
Bouguer's at the equator, gives for the compression ^-fg-.
The degree in Maryland, with Bouguer-s equatorial, gives
.j4f. The Spanish degree at the equator, with the French
decree lat. 453, gives -j-i T, Boscovich-s Italian degree, lat.
43°, compared with Bouiruer's at the equator, gives -jfe.
Bishop Horsley, by a geometrical mean of twelve different
cllipticities, obtains -j-oV-t- Boscovich, taking a mean from
all the measures of degrees, so as to make the positive and
negative errors equal, obtains              Laiande, bv comparing
Father Leisganig-s degrees in Germany with eight others
in different latitudes, gets -j4t.       -And the recent measures
in France give, as we have seen, -j4t- Such is a summary
of the evidence from which" it is to be concluded that the
earth is " elliptical," even " very regularly so."           General
Roy, who had got a habit, not very uncommon among
scientific Englishmen, of deducing reasonable conclusions
from anomalous appearances, and not twisting them to
suit a fanciful hypothesis, assumed seven different spheroids
 of varying ratios between Tfo and T-.J-o-; and, on finding
that none of them corresponded so uniformly as might be
wished, with the operations in different latitudes, made
 these inferences : " Hence it is obvious, that the arcs of
 an ellipsoid, however great or small the degree of its oblate-
 ness may be, will not any way correspond with the mea
 sured portions of the surface of the earth."          ** Hence it is
that philosophers are     not  yet agreed in opinion with regard
to the figure of the earth ; some conteriding, that it has
no regular figure, that     is,  not such as would be generated
hy the revolution of    a  curve around its axis."        And again,
 after specifying some other facts, " From all which we
may conclude, that the earth      is   not an ellipsoid."
    Nor is  this opinion peculiar to Gen. Roy     :
                                                      it
                                                      is   common,
I  believe, to all who have contemplated the subject, except
Don Rodriguez. Thus, Puissant, at p. 187 of his Geode"sie,
says,
        " La comparaison ties divers degres mesures l-equa-a.
 teur, en France, en Pensylvanie, etc. donne lieu          a decider
.que  les  meridiens  sont   diflerens   entr-eux,   et n-ont pas la
 tonne elliptique."     And at    p.   222, " D'ou Ton doit con-
clure que    la  terre n'a point    la   forme reguliere que Von
«erait tente de lui attribuer."       To the same purpose writes
                                                           Laplace,

           Dr. Gregory's Strictures      on Don Rodriguez.       1 85
Laplace, at p. 56 of his "Exposition:" "Les degres da
nord et de France donnent -j-J-j- pour t-ellipticite de la terre,
que les    degrees  de France et de l'equateur donnent egale k
.jirr- il   paroit  done   que la terre est sensiblement differente
d-un ellipsoide.      II y a m^me lieu de croire qu-ellc n-est pas
un solide de revolution, et que ses deux hemispheres ne sont
pas semblables de chaque cote de l-equateur."
     It is curious, however, to observe that notwithstanding;
this extreme want of uniformity, in the results furnished
by terrestrial admeasurements,           those which are deduced
from astronomical theory, and the oscillations of pendu
lums, correspond very nearly. Thus, Laplace-s deduction
of the compression from the lengths of pendulums in dif
ferent latitudes, is -j-»-f yj-. (See Puissant, Topographic, &c.
p. 66.)      Clairaut-s well known modification of Newton-s
theorem, derived from the diminution of gravity, gives »-J-T.
The phaenomena of the precession of the equinoxes and
 the nutation of the earth-s axes give -g-JT for the maximum
 limit.     A lunar inequality in longitude depending upon
 the earth-s ellipticity, and expresssed by — 20-"Q87 sin a
 of the moon in longitude, requires the compression to be
 between           and ^a j.flil but nearest the latter limit.   And
 a lunar inequality in latitude, depending also on the com
  pression, and expressed by — 24-"Ggi4 sin J), requires the
 compression to be between               and -tbW»         leaning to
 the latter limit.      So that the ratio of the earth's axes, as
 deducible from these independent theoretical considerations,
  lies within much narrower limits than we can get in any
 other way.        But thisjdoe"s not affect the truth of the pre
  ceding remarks.        It serves principally to show that, what
  ever may have been the derangements of the terrestrial
  spheroid since its original formation, they are not such as
  have differently affected the several phtenomena occasioned
  by its asrsiregate attraction : while a very slight considera
  tion of the effects of the deluge, of earthquakes, of volcanic
  operations, of extensive dislocations of strata, &c. may serve
  to convince us, that however regular the earth might once
  have been in its general shape, there is now no reason to
  expect that " very regular" surface from which Don Ro
  driguez persuades himself there ought to be no essential .de
   viation.
      3. Don Rodriguez is further confirmed in his opinion
   that there must be an error in the observations, especially at
   Arbury Hill, of      "  nearly five seconds," because he thinks
   no such anomaly as that can fairly be ascribed to the effect
   of local attractions.      He doe3 not deny " that irregularities
                                                                     of

  186      Dr. Gregory's Strictures   on Don Rodriguez.
                             f
 of the earth and local attractions may occasion considerable
 discrepancies ;" yet he does not believe they can ever pro
 duce a deviation of the magnitude just specified.           Here
 again he is at war with the decisions, I believe, of all pre
 ceding philosophers who have directed their attention to
 this subject.    There are, obviously, three causes which may
jointly   o.  separately occasion a deflection of the plumb-line
 from the    true perpendicular to the earth-s surface ; namely,,
 an insular situation, the attraction of mountains, and strata
 of unequal density beneath the surface : and either of these
 mav be productive of considerable effects.
    To arrive in the easiest manner at an estimate of the effect
 upon a plumb-line arising from observations made in an in
 sular situation, let Don Rodriguez imagine the simple case
 of a triangular island so posited on the surface of an aqueous
 spheroid, that a meridian shall run along from its vertex,
 directed northward, to the middle of its base ; he will per
 ceive that, in such a case, as an observer proceeded from
 the south towards the north, there would be a constant va
 riation in the deflection of the plumb-line, in such manner
 that there would be only one point on the meridian, where
 the attractions occasioned by the island itself should be so
 counterpoised and adjusted, that the true and observed ver
tical lines should correspond.       Pursuing this hypothesis,
 with the requisite modifications, for a neighbouriug con
 tinent on the south and an immense ocean north, he will
find that the singular order exhibited by the English esti
mates of degrees, though an unexpected, 14 by no means
an unnatural, consequence of our insular situation. Dr.
Hutton has treated this very point with his usual perspi
cuity, in a valuable note at page 19s, vol. ii. New Abridge
ment of the Philosophical Transactions, published in 1803.
That note is too long to be copied into this place; I shall
therefore merely transcribe the Doctor's concluding in
ference : " Hence also it follows that insular situations
must be worst of any, having the plumb-line deviating to
the north at the south end of the line, to the south at the
north end, to the east at the west side, and to the west at
the east side ; thus producing errors in all observed latitudes
and longitudes."
    Laplace most probably alludes to this kind of effect, at
p. 59, ''Exposition," where he speaks of the much more
extensive attractions than those of mountains, of which the
effect is sensible in Italy,- England, 8cc.
    That the deflections of the plumb-line, and the conse
quent estimate of the lengths of degrees, must be greatly

          Dr. Gregory's Strictures       on Don Rodriguez.      187
 affected by hills and valleys, is also very manifest. Pro
 fessor Playfair, after describing the irregularities thus oc
 casioned in the degree at Turin, adds, '• There axe,nodoubtt
 situations    in which the measurement           of a small arc
 might, from a similar cause, give the radius of curvature of
  the meridian infinite, or even negative."         See Edinburgh
 Transactions, vol. v. p. 5.           And Dr. Maskelvue, after
.treating of Mason and Dixon-s degree in North America,
 says, "Mr. Henry Cavendish having investigated several
  rules for finding the attraction of the inequalities of the
 earth, has, upon probable suppositions of the distance and
  height of the Allegany mountains from the degree mea
  sured-, and the depth and declivity of the Atlantic. Ocean,
  computed what alteration might be so produced in the
  length of the degree; and finds that it may have been di
  minished by 60 or 100 toises by these causes.         He has also
  found, bv similar calculations, that the degrees measured
  in Italy, and at the Cape of Good Hope, may be very sen
  sibly affited by the attraction of hills, and defect of the
  attraction in the Mediterranean Sea and Indian Ocean."
  Phil. Trans, vol. lviii., or New Abridgement, vol. xii.
  p. 578
      With respect to the third cause of irregularity Puissant,
   Geodesie, p. 137, remarks that " anomalies in the latitudes
  are dovbtless produced by local attractions which change
  the direction of the apparent vertical."           And Professor
  Playfair, in the excellent      memoir     I have just quoted, (a
  memoir, it should be recollected, which was written five
  years before the remarkable anomalies in the English mea
  sures were known,) affirms that " from suppositions no
  way improbable, concerning the density ancfextent of masses
  of varying strata beneath the surface, he has found, that
   the errors thu3 produced may easily amount to ten or twelve
  seconds."     **
                   This cause of error (as he justly remarks) is
   formidable", not only because it may go to a great extent,
   but because there is not any visible mark by which its ex
   istence may always be distinguisfied."
      Here, then, are three sources of'deflection from the true
   plumb-line, neither of which is correctly appreciable in all
   circumstances, yet of which each may be not only percepti
   ble but important; and the concurrent effect of all may,
   doubtless, be very considerable.         Yet Don Rodriguez is
   unwilling  to   attribute a deviation  of four or five seconds to
   any or all of these causes.
      4. This writer infers that mistakes must have occurred
   in the observations, because the sijm of other "errors will
                                                                  be

 be found in the estimate of the entire arch, and will in
 crease in proportion to the extent of the arch measured :
 but in the English measurement we find exactly the reverse
of this." Here he assumes the principle proposed by Bos-
 covich, but condemned by Laplace, for a reason thus briefly
 assigned by Puissant: — "La solution donnee d-abord par
 Boscovich est vicieuse en ce qu'elle est fondee sur une hy-
.pothese inadmissible, savoir, que les erreurs dans le mesure
 des arcs du meridien sont proportionates a leurs lon
 gueurs."
    5. He concludes that there must be "an error of some
 seconds in the observations of the fixed stars," because
 "  the results of the observations made on different stars
 differ no less than four seconds from each other."       Now,
 what are the facts on which this inference      rests ? Simply
 these: that the only two stars which indicate any such dif
 ference, in the whole series of observations, are ft Draconis,
and £Ursae; that they give a difference of 4-"l9, not iu
 the amplitude of the arc between Dunnose and Arbury Hill,
but of that between Dunnose and Clifton; and that whether
 those two stars be rejected, or retained with the nlherfifteen
 employed in finding that amplitude, they will not occasion
a difference of a quarter of a second in the result.      How-,
 then, can a fair investigator bring this as a reason for an
 alleged inaccuracy, when it obviously cannot apply to the
 case?    And what must be thought of his impartiality, if it
shall appear that even in this respect the observations of the
French and of Major Lambton, which he so manifestly
prefers to the English observations, are far more open to
censure ? Allow me, therefore, just to make the com
parison.
    Of the English observations none are suppressed, (the
observers going upon tbe principle explained by Simpson
in his " Tracts," which clearly establishes the propriety, if
not the necessity, of taking the mean of a number of ob
servations,) and yet no irregularity of consequence, except
the one above specified, appears.     But, it may be seen from
p.   72, Discours  Preliminaire,   tome    i. Base du Systeme
Mitrique Decimal, that no less then sixty-eight of the
French observations upon /3 Ursa? majoris were rejected,
and termed bad ; for no other reason that I can perceive,
than that if they had been employed they would have given
the latitude of Dunkirk about a second less than the obser
vations of the pole-star gave it.       Let Don Rodriguez re
flect upon this, and then repeat that the French operations
" merit the highest degree of confidence." But this is not

all.    From p. 39 of the same Discours Preliminaire, it ap
pears    that three stars only were selected by Mechain at
Montjouy, in consequence of the coincidence of the results
arising from them.           Among the stars rejected was    £ Ursce„
because different observations gave a difference of 4".            So
that the French also detected an irregularity respecting this
star.    They assign, however, a wrong reason for the fact:
for they attribute it to errors in Bradley-s table of refrac
tions ; while the truth        thatis,  Ursae   £  double star, by
                                                          is   a

those of Dr. Herschel, (Phil.          Trans,   vol. Ixxii.     New
Abridgement, vol. xv.,) that both            Draconis and
                                                    ft          Ursae   £

able, and at the distance of 4-"35 from each other, mean

 unequal, and the largest difficult to bisect.        Hence, Her-
 schel's observations completely confirm those of our trigo
 nometrical surveyors.      See also the Catalogues of Wolras-
 ton and Bode.
    Let us next inquire how far Major Lambton's observa
 tions, which Don Rodriguez also seems to delight in eu
 logizing, deserve to be preferred to Col. Mudge-s.             From
 p. 356, vol. x. Asiatic Researches, \ve learn that the Major-s
  observations upon a Serpentis were 14, of which two were
  5° 57' 3-"38 and 5° 56'                furnishing     difference of
                                                                   a

in great measure attributable to the imperfections in Major1
Lambton's sector, which is only of five feet radius (while
the English is of eight feet), and is provided with but few
comparatively of the requisite means of adjustment: but
 whether they are to be ascribed to the observer or his in
 struments, they prove that Don Rodriguez has been rather
 precipitate in saying,
                           " the same Major Lambton, who has
 succeeded so well in Asia, and is in possession of such per
fect instruments for the purpose, would be singularly qua-
  lifted for a similar undertaking in Africa."        In matters
 which admit of examination and proof, it is not the custom
 with Englishmen to bow at once to the authority of a mere
  ipse dixit.    Was Don Rodriguez really ignorant that, with
 respect to accuracy of observation, the English proceedings
 are thus greatly superior to those of the French and of
 Major Lambton ! If so, how greatly is he to be pitied for
 writing so much on a subject he had previously so little
 considered ! If he was aware of this superiority, how much
 more is he to be pitied, for giving so unfair and unnatural
 a representation of the business before him !
      From one or other of the reasons I have thus examined,
 Don Rodriguez says, " it is almost beyond a doubt that it
 is to errors in the observations of latitude," the singularity
 in Col. Madge-s results must be ascribed.        There must be
 an error of some seconds in the observations, " especially
 at Arbury Hill." And he asks " How is this to be disco
 vered ?
           " How ? Why,
                             by simply repeating the observations
 at Arbury Hill.      The position of the station is so clearly
 described in the Philosophical Transactions, that any person
 may find it within twenty feet ; and the farmer who owns
 the field can show the identical spot.       Don Rodriguez or
some one of his friends has doubtless handy circular in
 struments of the French construction, by which the zenith
 distances could readily have been taken, and then the cor
 rectness or incorrectness of the English observers might
 have been proved in a way from which there could be no
 appeal.     Though to be sure, if that plan had been adopted,
 and the English results had in consequence been verified,
 Don Rodriguez's paper could never have appeared.
          is,
      There     however,a     method of determining the point,
 even     without taking    this  trouble. Having then shown,
I    trust satisfactorily, that Don Rodriguez-3 reasons for
imputing an error of four or five seconds to the English ob
 servations are nugatory ;  I    shall now proceed, with all pos
sible conciseness, to show that there cannot be an error       of
                                                               one

one second either   in the observations  at Arbury  Hill, or at
Dunnose    ; and those at Clifton are, by the Don-s own con
cessions, out of the qnestion.
   First, the manner of fixing the zenith-sector could not
lead to error.        "
                 For, to procure for the external stand (says
Col. Mudge, Phil. Trans. 1803), and thence for the whole
apparatus, a firm foundation, I caused four long stakes to
be driven into the ground, (one for each foot of the stand,)
to which its feet were firmly screwed down.       The surfaces
of the stakes were cut off smooth, and brought into the
«ame horizontal plane, by which means the interior frame
and sector were placed much within the limits of their se
veral adjustments."     The whole was inclosed in a suitable
observatory.
   Don Rodriguez may perhaps think the French method
of fixing their instruments, on   some occasions,    preferable
to this. The reader shall judge. Their instruments, both
for taking horizontal and vertical angles, were sometimes
placed on tottering stages, so as to give anomalies in the an
gles of from 5" to 8"; furnishing, as Delauibre terms them^
"  le tourment des observateurs."     Thus, at p. 46, Discours
Preliminaire, we are told that at Chatillon there was a
high wooden stage erected for an observatory, in which the
carpenter had so badly done his work that
                                                  " le moindre
vent agitait toute la machine, de maniere, non seulement k
rendre les observations moins sures, mais a inquieter Its
observateurs."     And on turning to p. 174, tome i. it will
be seen that the observers had not to contend with a gentle
gale; for they there tell us of the " grand vent qui agitoit
le signal et l-instrument."     The whole was blown down
shortly after. Will Don Rodriguez place reliance on ob
servations made from such a platform in such a wind, and
notwithstanding doubt the observations made with a stable
instrument by the English?       And let him not forget, that
 whatever error was thus occasioned in the distance between
Boiscommun and Chatillon, is more than doubled in all
 the remaining triangles of the series, by reason of the bad
 shape of the triangle, Chatillon, Boiscommun, Chateau-
 neuf.
    If no error in the English observations can be fairly im
 puted to the manner of fixing the zenith sector, neither
 can any be ascribed to the " construction" of the instru
ment itself.    This was most positively declared by two very
txcellent judges, the late Astronomer Royal, and the Hon.
 Henry Cavendish, on their close examination of the instru
ment.     It will also be inferred, without hesitation, by all
                                                    competent

competent judges, on reading the description of it in the
Phil. Trans, tor 1803. To those who have seen neither
the instrument nor the description, it may suffice if I re
mark, that the equality of the divisions on the arch is
evinced from this consideration, that on running the mi
crometer screw from division to division over the whole arch*
there was nowhere au indication of an error amounting to
half a second ; and that the instrument still continues free
from important " derangement," is tolerably well proved
by this, lhat the line of colhmation has been constant du
ring all the observations and all (he journey ings of the
sector, and that it still continues the same.
    In the next place, it may be remarked that no -grror in
 observation can be imputed to a deviation from " vertical
          " in the sector.
position                       Important inaccuracy in this re
spect is precluded by the great length of the axis, by which
the instrument is rectified ; and by the ready and certain
means of placing the plumb-line directly over the illumi
 nated dot which marks the middle of the axis, or true cen
 tre of the divided arch.    For want of this admirable mode
of   correction,  all previous instruments are necessarily im
perfect.    It appears from Phil. Trans, for 1803, pp. 405,
406, that when the instrument is adjusted in one position
 by means of the plumb-line and dot, it is turned to a posi
tion at right angles to the former, and the adjustment con
firmed ; and this being the casein these two situations, the
instrument must necessarily be vertical in all others.
    Various reasons may be assigned to show that the sector
 could not, at any of the stations, be out of the plane of the
meridian. I shall select only two or three. As 1st :       If the
sector were inclined to that plane, just so much would the
 path of any star in its apparent motion be inclined to the
horizontal wire of the telescope ; instead of which, both
 Col. Mudge and Capt. Colby assure me, that when a star
 came into contact with the wire, the light of the star would
appear on both sides of the wire for about three-quarters of
a minute of time, the light on each side being equal at the
central wire: which of itself is a positive proof.          But,
 2dly : Had the sector been out of the plane of the meridian,
the times of the transits of the extreme stars employed, as
compared with two excellent           time-keepers,   must have
shown it. Further, the errors arising from a wrong plane
of the meridian being comparatively very great in the ex
treme stars and small in those near the zenith, it would
follow that the error in Capella, which is almost at the ex
tremity of the arch, would be great, compared with those in
                                                    /3 Draconis,

         fDr. Gregryry's Strictures on Don Rodriguez.         193
ft Draconis, x Cygni, &c. which were within a small di
 stance of the zenith.     But the amplitude of the arch be
 tween Dunnose and Arbury Hill, as derived from Capella,
 is 1° 3& 20-"02, while those derived from the other two
 stars are 1° 36' Jtf-"42 and 1° 36' 19""94: a coincidence
 which proves that the instrument could not possibly have
 any perceptible deviation from the plane of the meridian at
either station.    Other reasons for coming to the same con
 clusion will appear, on attending to the precautions in ad
justing by double azimuths, &c. as described in the Phi
 losophical Transactions.
    The correct position of the sector in all respects is further
 proved from this : that the observations, however distant
 in point of time when the proper corrections for aberration,
 nutation, &c. are applied to them, reduce always very nearly
 to the same mean place.
     Hence it must be obvious that no error could arise, as
 Don Rodriguez suspects, from the instrument, whether in
 "  vertical position, construction, or some accidental de
              " I shall now advance still further, and
 rangement.                                                 prove
 that there is no error, in fact.   For, if there were any error
 in the zenith distances at Arbury Hill, it would at once be
 detected on comparison with the observations at Blenheim.
 Now the distance between the parallels of latitude of Blen
 heim and that hill, 139,822 feet, furnished by the survey,
 gives for the corresponding celestial arch 22' 59-"33, while
 the observations of y Draconis at Blenheim, compared
 with the observations upon the same star at Arbury Hill,
 give 22' 59""fj.     So that there cannot possibly be an error
 of half a second at Arbury Hill, unless the observations for
 five successive years at Blenheim were all wrong : and
 Blenheim observatory, be it recollected, has been long
 celebrated for the excellency of its instrument, and se
 lected even by Svanberg for the accuracy of the observa
 tions there made.      So again, with regard to the Dtlnnose
 station, the latitude of Portsmouth observatory, as in
 ferred from the said station and the data in the Trigono
  metrical Survey, is 50° 4S' 2,"65 ; whiie the Requisite
 Tables, the edition of 1781, give it 50° 48' 3". So that
  the observations    at Dunnose cannot possibly err half a
  second, unless there was an error made by VVitchell and
  Bayly in determining the latitude of Portsmouth observa
  tory, with an admirable mural quadrant by Bird. These
  two deductions, then, completely exclude sensible error at
 Dunnose and Arbury Hill: and these inferences, it is evi-

dent, might as easMy have been- made by Don Rodriguez snf
by me.
    This gentleman may find stitl further confirmation of
the truth of the whole survey, if he will examine the ope
rations by which the meridian of Dunnose is extended to
Burleigh Moor, and those for carrying on a new meridian
from Black Down^ to Delamere Forest.           These, it is true,
are not to be found (for what reason I cannot say) in the
Philosophical Transactions.         But they may be seen in the
third volume of the Trigonometrical Survey, published in
 1813 by order of the Board of Ordnance ; a volume with
which some of Don Rodriguez's friends in England are
 doubtless acquainted.
     As a last corroboration of the whole portion from Dun-
tiose to Clifton, amounting to 2° 50' 23-"38; let me add
that, when compared with the meridional arch of 3° 7' l"
at Peru, by means of the valuable theorem investigated by
 Professor Playfair (Edinburgh Transactions, vol. v. pp. 8, 9. J
 for the comparison of large arcs, it produces xrr"rr f°r tne
 resulting compression.       While Svanberg (p. 1 92, Exposi
 tion) gives ^j-^^-^j. for the compression,    as deducible from
 a comparison of fits measure with that at Peru.
     Thus, we have confirmation upon confirmation, of the
  correctness of Col. Mudge-s operations, both general and
 particular 5 and of the extreme rashness with which Don
  Rodriguez has affirmed that " it is very evident that the
  zenith distances of stars taken at Arbury Hill are affected
  by some considerable error." The matter in question might,
  as you will perceive, have been settled in narrower compass:
  but the celebrity of the Institution under whose auspices
  the Don-s animadversions are circulated, seemed in some
  measure to call for a tolerably full reply to his paper.
     For the reply here presented the public must consider
  me alone as responsible : and I trust that when the two
  papers have been compared, I shall not be thought to speak
  incompatibly with the courtesy due to a foreigner, or the
  respect due to a brother mathematician,        when I say that
  Don Rodriguez has completely failed to establish the point,
  respecting which he ought to hawe felt certain before he

   Mr. Joseph Davis*.
Sir, — Having     to repair andbeautify the frotitofiny house,
which is called the Minor-Theatre,       in Catharine-street^
Strand, I invented a machine which answers for such pur
poses much better than a scaffold, and saves considerable
expense.       As I conceive this contrivance may be beneficial
to the public, I should be happy to submit a model thereof
to the Society of Arts; he. for their inspection.
  My machine is twenty-six feet long, and cost me two
pounds ten shillings; and when lio longer wanted for this
purpose, the timber is worth two pounds.          A single ma-,
chine may be made thirty-six feet long, and united to any
length, and when not ill use, may bte folded up and put by
is a common ladder.
   On this plan of a scaffold, there is no occasion to break
up the pavement; or to give the least interruption to pas
sengers in the Street.

        of a loaded Cart. Plate VI. fig. 2.
        Figure 2. of Plate VI. represents a cart, in which the
   horse having fallen, has been relieved by detaching the
   shafts from the cart, which is provided with temporary legs
   or stays, DD, to support the weight of the front part, and
   prevent its falling any lower until other means can be re
   sorted to for raising it again.
        The figure represents a common cart. AA represent the
   shafts detached and lying on the ground ; the connection
   is formed with the cart in use by two screw-bolts, one of
   which is seen at I, passing through the bed of the cart, and
   also through the iron hinges aa, by which the shafts are
   united to the cart : besides these screw-bolts two steady
   pins, or bolts without heads, also pass through holes in the
   shank of each of the hinges, and two nuts BB are screwed
   on to fasten them when the cart is in use ; but if the horse

 Martin-s method of relieving a horse in such a situation is
 thus effected.     The locking bar E is first removed from
 the staples ee of the shafts, with which the body of this,
 like most other carts, is provided, for the purpose of turning
 up and discharging its-contents : this being done, a man
 must creep under the cart from behind, and first put down
 the legs or stays DD, which were before turned up out of
 the way beneath the cart ; then unscrewing the nuts BB,
the shafts fall down, completely detached from the body of
 the cart, as represented in the figures ; aud nothing then
prevents the horse from getting up, the cart remaining
supported in front by the legs DD. C is an additional leg
folded up beneath the cart; it is of nich a length that it will,
when set upright, support the cart in an horizontal posi
 tion, and is used to support the cart when lifted up whilst
the shafts are fixed on again : the legs DD are provided
 with iron hooks, one of which is seen at F, which retain
them steadily in their places, when the weight of the cart
tends to throw them forwards : the leg C is provided with,
a similar hook.

sulphur, and strongly ignited in a glass retort, furnished
with a receiver and a tube of safety } they acquired an ad

thrown up to a height of sjx or eight inches, while the
copper is cooling, after the removal of the ashes aud cin

          In a repetition of this experiment, the increase of the
         2.)
    weight of the copper amounted to 2"6 grammes.
         Several       experiments exhibited a still greater in
                           other
    crease     of weight but I do not particularly describe them,
                                   ;
    since the results are always somewhat too great, and do not"
    perfectly agree, a circumstHtice probably depending on au
    oxidatior, which the superfluous sulphur is incapable of
    reducing.
       The following experiment however deserves to be noticed.
    I had put thin laminated copper in a small retort with sul
    phur, some of the plates projecting l{ ineh beyond the
    sulphur. Wheiv the temperature was raised until the cop
    per began to unite with the sulphur, the mass became
    heated, but was not ignited, because the sulphur was                               in,
    excess, and ihe projecting p^rts of the plates did not enter-
    into combination with the sulphur. When continued to.             I
    inorease the heat, the small retort became completely full
    of sulphurous gas, and before the mass at the bottom of
    the retort was ignited, the plates were inflamed, and burnt
    with    very bright light, exactly as during combustion>
               a                                                                       iq
    oxygen.    The copper therefore condensed the gaseous sul
     phur with the appearance of fire.     Since copper combines
    also with solid sulphur with     similar appearance of fire,
                                                   a                                   I
    was desirous to know        the phaenomena could be derived
                                              if
    in this case also from condensation.        weighed therefore I
    the sufphuret of copper, which had obtained, in water its
                                                   I                               :
    specific gravity was 4-/6, that of the laminated copper
    8-723, and that of the sulphur foo.         Now "four parts of
    coppei\had absorbed one of sulphur; so that the mechani
    cal mixture of four parts copper and one sulphur          denser          is
    than the chemical compound,         the proportion of one to.

1
    in the same proportion as tho laminated copper would have
    done by fusion     consequently:  the change of bulk could
    not be the cause of the appearance of fire. Whence then
    were the matters of light and heat in this case derived                            ?

hewce too the sulphuric acid, a combination of two_ strongly
negative^ substances, is the strongest,       that is, the most
negative of a!! acids, with respect to all salifiable bases.
May not the appearance of fire be derived from an electro
chemical discharge ? Much may be adduced in favour 6f
this opinion from Davy-s excellent investigations : it appears
to me to be by no means an improbable one, and Davy
himself seems to have hinted at it.
     If  copper bears the same relation to sulphur and oxygen
that lead does, it must absorb, at its minimum of oxida
tion, half as much oxygen as it fakes up of sulphur, that
is, 12 S or 13 per cent, of oxygen, and the sulphate of the
protoxide of copper must consist of 3S-83 of acid with
€4 - 1 7 of the protoxide.    And if the sulphuric acid requires,
in the bases by which it is saturated, always "half as much
oxygen as it contains of sulphur, the sulphate of the oxide
.of copper must consist of nearly equal parts of the acid
 and of the base.
                    V. Copper and Ojmtokn.
                        A. Oxide of Copper.
     1.) Ten grammes of copper, roljed into a very thin plate,     .
 were burnt in the muffle of an assaying furnace in a crucible
 of platina. The metal was changed into black oxide, and
 had acquired the additional weight of 1-05 grammes.
     2. ) Five grammes of copper were dissolved ip nitric
 acid in a glass flask, then dried and ignited : they afforded
 6-12 of black oxide of copper.
     3. ) Another experiment gave 6- 145 of oxide.
     4. ) Ten grammes of copper were dissolved in nitrie acid,
 and precipitated with neutral carbonate of potass, which
  had been prepared in a vessel of platina from purified tartar.
 The precipitate, when washed and ignited, weighed 12 .33
 gr.      From the fluid, to which the alkali had been added,
 some more copper was thrown down by sulphuretted hydro--
 .gen, which, when burnt to a black oxide, weighed -08 gr,
  making with the former 1 2-4.1 gr,
     5. ) The same quantity of copper was dissolved in nitric
  acid in a glass retort; the acid was carefully distilled off to
  dryness, and the mass left in the retort, when ignited,
  weighed 12-3S gr. The acid which had passed over was
 •distilled again, and the green fluid which was left behind
  afforded a precipitate, by the successive addition of alkali
 and of sulphuretted hydrogen, which afforded -07 gr. more
 «of black oxide, making with the former 12"45 grammes.
     it is difficult to obtain in these experiments a very accu-
                                  N4                          rate

rate result, because some of the copper is dissipated during
 combustion, or if carried away during the oxidation by
nitric acid, together with the vapours which are emitted.
The fourth and fifth experiments appear to be the nearest
to the truth, but they require a correction which I cannot
determine with perfect accuracy.         It is well known that
all copper contains carbon and a little sulphur. If we as
sume that these together make        per cent, of the weight of
the copper, the quantity of oxvgen which the experiments
indicate is so much too small, and -05 gr. must be added
to it for 10 gr. of copper, the mass of the copper being
diminished in this proportion during the oxygenization.
Since then 100 parts of copper, in experiment 5, received
the addition of 24-5 parts in weight, we may assume that
pure copper would have taken up 25 of oxvgen, and that
the oxide of copper, in round numbers, is composed of
                    Copper 80           100
                    Oxygen 20             25
                     B. Protoxide of Copper.
    Ten grammes      of oxide of copper were mixed with       art
equal weight    of  the  pure copper  dust   already  mentioned,
and 75 grammes of concentrated muriatic acid were poured
on them in an air-tight vessel. The mixture remained
three days standing on a warm stove, and was shaken from
time to time. The undissolved copper was placed on a
filter, washed, and hastily dried on a plate of cast iron : it
•weighed 1-97 grammes.        Consequently 8-03 gr. of copper
had been dissolved at the expense of the oxygen contained
in the oxide.      Now the oxide contained also eight gr. of
metal ; consequently the protoxide now formed, and dis
solved in the acid, contained twice as much metal as the
oxide.    The difference of -03 gr. in the experiment arose
probably from the operation of the concentrated acid on
the copper, by means of which a little hydrogen gas was
produced, which was forced out with some violence when
the vessel was opened.      Hence it follows that 100 parts of
copper, in order to become a protoxide, take up, according
to the experiment, 12-3 parts, and according to the calcu
lation, 12-5 parts of oxygen; and the protoxide of copptr
consists of          Copper 88-89              100 0
                              11-11             1 2-5
  •
    Mr. Chenevix found, in a similar experiment, the quantity
of oxygen a little greater, that is 1 1:5 per cent, or 13 to
 100 parts of copper.
    If we calculate the oxygen of the protoxide of copper ac
                                                         cording

                  On definite Proportions.                 201
cording to the rule deduced from the experiments on iead,
taking half the quantity of the sulphur, we shall have 12-8
for 100 of copper, which take up 25-6 of sulphur; and
this number differs but little from the number found by
.direct experiments.   In the analysis of the muriate of/"
copper we shall find, a new confirmation of the propriety
of this mode of reasoning.
   But before I proceed further in these investigations, I
must determine the true proportion of the component parts
of the muriate of silver, which is of essential importance
for pursuing the inquiry.
          VI. Moriate of Silver and of Baryta.
    Rose and Bucholz       have examined these salts with great
apparent accuracy, and their results agree very nearly with
each other ; at the same time they are by no means correct.
The error lies in the defective analysis of the salt of barvta.
Wenzel has come the nearest to the truth of all those who
have made experiments on the subject, and his researches
were performed with a degree of accuracy which was not
to be expected from the time in which he lived.        He found
in 100 parts of muriate of silver, 7.5-33 of silver, 6-4 of
oxygen, and 1 8-27 of muriatic acid.          Bucholz and Rose
found 75 parts of silver, 7-5 or 7 of oxygen, and J7-» to
1 7 7-5 of muriatic acid.
    "
    1. ) I took three grammes of pure silver, obtained from
the muriate, and kept for some time in fusion in an open
fire, in order to get rid of the carbon ; and I dissolved it in
nitric acid, in a small glass flask ; I added pure muriatic
acid, and evaporated the mixture to dryness ; an additional
quantity of muriatic acid was poured on      it,  and the mass,
when again dried, was melted in the flask. This colourless
Juna cornea weighed 3-£)8 gr. Consequently 100 parts of
silver had taken up 32-    7  of oxygen and muriatic acid, and
 100 parts of the muriate pontain 75-358 of silver.
      2.
      )   From 10 grammes, similarly treated,      I    obtained
 13-275 of the fused muriate.      Hence   100 parts of this con
 tain 75-3296   of silver.
    3. Ten gr. of .carbonate of baryta were dissolved in,
     )
 muriatic acid in glass flask
                 a             ;   the solution was poured into
a  dish of platina, carefully dried and ignited.   I     thus ob
 tained 10-56 gr. of muriate.
    4. The experiment was repeated, leaving the mass to be
     )
 dried and ignited    in    the flask;
                                     it   afforded again 10-56
grammes.
    Since 100 parts of the carbonate of baryta contain 78-4
                                                             of

  208                   On iejiniit Proportions.
  of the earth, the 10-56 grammes of muriate must have
  taken up 2-72 of muriatic acid.        Consequently dry muriate
  <tf baryta  consists  of
                Muriatic acid 25-75             ' 100
                Baryta             74-25           288 4
      Tf it were possible to obtain a result for the carbonate
  correct within a ten thousandth, we might deduce from it in
  tbts manner a very accurate analysis of the muriate.           At
  present   the error  can scarcely  exceed one  thousandth.
      Bucholz obtained, from 84 grains of ignited muriate of
  baryta, 94j grains of sulphate; this gives, if we employ his
  analysis of the sulphate, the quantity of muriatic acid l£
   per cent, too small ; but according to my analysis of that
  salt, the 94{ gr. contain 6-2-37 of pure baryta.             Now
   84 : 62-37 = 10O : 74-25, which is exactly the proportion
  already determined for the muriate of baryta.         This result
   therefore confirms my determination of the composition of
  both these substances.
      5.) The 10-56 of muriate of baryta, obtained in the
  fourth experiment, were dissolved in water, and precipitated
  with nitrate of silver.       The fused luna cornea weighed
   14-55 gr. agreeing exactly with Bucholz's experiment, and
  differing but little from Rose's. Consequently 100 parts
  of the muriate of silver contain 18-697 of muriatic acid, or
  consist of       Muriatic acid 18 7               110-0    *
                   Oxide of silver 81-3             434"8
     The oxide of silver therefore will consist, according to
  this experiment, of
                  Silver 92 67               100 000

  heated to the temperature of melting tin, were dissolved in
  water and precipitated by muriate of baryta.        The precipi-
•
  late, washed and ignited, weighed 7-22 grammes, indicating
  the presence of 2-455 gr. of sulphuric acid ; consequently
  the remaining 2-545 of the 5 gr. were oxide of copper ;
  and the sulphate of the oxide of copper consists of
              Oxide of copper      50 90          103-66
              Sulphuric acid       49- iO         100-00
     Supposing 100 parts of sulphuric acid to require in the;
  base, by which they are saturated, 20-29 of oxvgen, this
  quantity must be contained in 103 66 of the oxide of cop
  per.    Now 125 : 25-= 103 (56 ; 20-73 j so thai the result of
                                                        calculation

                     On definite Proportions.                   203
calculation differs very little from the analysis : 100 parts
of the acid ought to combine with 10145 of the oxide ;
and the difference may perhaps depend on a portion of
water left behind in the salt.       It appears also that in this
sulphate    100 parts  of  metallic    copper are united to 50 of
sulphur,    which is  very little less  than twice the least quan
tity that copper takes up in the form of a sulphuret.
    I  imagined also that the subsulphate       of copper, already
known, must contain copper and sulphur in the proportion
determined by this experiment.           I precipitated, in order to
examine this, a solution of the sulphate of copper by means
of caustic ammonia, so that the \Vhole of the copper was
not thrown down. The subsalt was washed and dried on
a filter, and gently ignited.      When dissolved in nitric acid,
and precipitated by nitrate of baryta, it appeared to consist
of 20 parts of sulphuric acid, and 80 parts of oxide of cop
per.     Consequently the acid was combined^in this subsalt,
with nearly four times as much of the base as in the neutral
 salt, and 100 parts of copper take up, in this case, only
 half as much sulphur as in the sulphuret of copper. Hence
 it seems probable that copper and sulphur must exist in the
 required proportion in the sulphate of the protoxide of
 popper: of this salt, however, I am unacquainted with
 the characters and with the mode of preparation ; its com
 position may however be calculated in two ways, which
 afford nearly the same result.        In the sulphuret of copper,
 if 100 parts of copper take up 25 of sulphur, 125 parts of
 this substance must give 173-86 of sulphate of the prot
 oxide, and 10Q parts of sulphuric acid will be combined
 with 183 of the protoxide.           We shall find hereafter that
  100 parts of the muriatic acid are saturated by 278-4 of the
 protoxide of copper j and since they are also saturated by
  288-4 of baryta; and since lOOof sulphuric acid combine with
  194 of baryta, We have 187 for the proportion of protoxide
 of copper answering to 100 of sulphuric acid ; for, 288-4 :
  278-4=194: 187 ; and this number differs but little from
  183, the result of the former calculation.-
                  VIII. Muriate of          Copper.
      I have advanced the conjecture, that every other acid, as
  well   as the sulphuric, in order to be saturated by a base,
  requires the same quantity of oxygen to be contained in it:
  and in order to examine the jtruih of this opinion, I fixed
  pn the muriatic acid.
              A. Muriate of the Protoxide of         Copper.
      A  solution of this substance in concentrated          muriatic
                                                                 acid

504                        On definite Proportions.
acid was precipitated by boiled water, and the precipitate
well washed with boiling water; it was pressed on a filter,
hastily dried on a hot brick, put into a small glass retort,
and melted by a red heat.      Of this fused substance six
grammes were dissolved in pure nitric acid, and precipitated
with nitrate of silver. The precipitate weighed, after fu
sion, 7- 12 gr., which implies the presence of 1-321 gr. of
muriatic acid. This muriate consists therefore of
           Muriatic acid .      26 42       1O0-O
           Protoxide of copper 73-58        278-4
  , Hence the quantity of the protoxide which saturates 10O
parts of muriatic arid contains 30-93 of oxygen; for
       : 12,5 = 278,4: 30-93.
           B. Muriate of the Oxide of Copper.
   Four grammes of black oxide of copper were dissolved
 in muriatic acid, and carefully dried, so as to drive off the
superfluous acid.      Hence was obtained a bright liver-co
loured mass, which recovered, when exposed to the air, its
water of crystallization, and its colour, [becoming green as
at first, Kem. II. 331. Engl. Tr.]      The salt was dissolved
in water, and precipitated with nitrate of silver. The mu
riate,, thus formed, weighed, when fused, 14-4 gr.,. an
swering to 2-69 of muriatic acid.       We have therefore for
the muriate of the oxide of copper,
              Muriatic acid 40-21            lOO-O
              Oxide            59-79         148-7
  If   we calculate the result of this experiment from the
analyses of the sulphate of baryta, of the sulphate of copper,"
consisting of 100 acid and 101 "8 oxide, and of the muriate
of baryta, we obtain 194: 101-8 = 288-4: 151"3, that                is,
g-fi more of the oxide than the experiment exhibits.
    Ip this experiment 100 parts of muriatic acid require 30
of oxygen         the base
                  in             by
                               which they are saturated for   ;

periment as an additional proof, that the oxide of copper
contains twice as much oxygen as the protoxide.           And
that the protoxide of copper, which saturates      given quan
                                                          a

of oxygen as the oxide which       capable of saturating
                                      is                      it,   is
placed beyond all doubt       the mode of preparation of the

 A     solution    of the neutral muriate of copper was prccipir
                                                              tated

tated by caustic potass, so that the      whole of the copper was
not separated.     The mucilaginous green precipitate was
washed on a filter with boiling water; but since the water
passed through it too slowly, after the filtration had con
tinued two days, it was dried, powdered, and then boiled
with spirit of wine. The salt was again well dried, and
became of a yellow brown colour. I introduced five graihmes
of it into nitric acid, in which it was very slowly dissolved:
it was then precipitated by nitrate of silver.          The luna
cornea, when fused, weighed 3-3 gr., indicating -6 17 of
muriatic acid. The liquid was boiled with mercury, in.
order to separate the oxide of silver, then evaporated in X
crucible of platina, and ignited; it afforded 3-680 gr. of black
oxide of copper.      The suhsalt consists therefore of
              Muriatic acid       14-36          100
              Oxide of copper 85-64              596
    Consequently 100 parts of muriatic acid are combined,
in this salt, with four times as much of the base as in the
neutral salt; for 148-7 X4 = 5Q4,8, which diners only by
 1 "2 from the result of the experiment.

                         To  Mr. Tilloch.
S i R,»— In  a work recently published,        on Diseases of the
 Eye, by   Mr.   Adams,   Oculist    Extraordinary to His Royal
 Highness the Prince Regent, and late Surgeon to the West
 of England Infirmary for curing Diseases of the Eye, insti
 tuted at Exeter, I have perused with much satisfaction
 some original observations on the causes, and ingenious
 hints for the removal, of the impediments to the acquire
 ment of vision by persons cured of cataract who were born
 blind with them.       This form of the disease appears to be
 much more frequent than is generally supposed, if we
 may judge from the large number of persons (upwards of
 seventy) Mr. Adams mentions to have successfully ope
 rated on. The benefit however to be derived by the patient
 even after the most successful operation, according to Mr.
 Adams-s account, who seems to have bestowed great atten-
4ion to this subject, depends on their after education. This
 then must be considered an object of the highest import
 ance; and as I know of no one except himself who has
 hithertb suggested any plan for the purpose, I inclose a

                            Extract.
      " The
          advantages  of an early operation in patients affected
with congenital   cataract   have been slightly noticed.    This
is a subject of the highest importance ; for those who have
had the disease removed at an advanced age; are equally
destitute of a knowledge of visual objects as the merest in
 fant, while at the same time they are placed in circum
 stances far more unfavourable for its acquisition.         The
healthy infant examines every object with the eagerness
natural to its age ; while the more aged congenital patient,
from long-continued habit, has contracted a disinclination
to the exercise of the eyes, which he is seldom able entirely
to overcome.      The rolling motion of the eye^ depending
 on an involuntary action of the muscles, is thereby ex
 tremely difficult to be corrected, when the removal of the
 cataract has been delayed, and it affords another obstacle to
 improvement in vision : this points out the necessity of an
early operation.     My own experience as well as that of
Mr. Saunders, and my late colleague Mr. C. T. Johnson^
 sufficiently demonstrate that it may be performed as soon
 after birth as the defect is discovered, with the most, per
fect ease and safety*. Were it practicable, I would not
 suffer an infant's eyes to be exposed to the light till the ca
 taracts were removed ; by which means I conceive the in
 voluntary action of the muscles of the eye-ball might be
 in a great measure, if not wholly, prevented. Most authors
 who have written on the subject of congenital cataract,
                                                                          *
    * Mr. Saunders cured an infant of congenital cataracts by the posterior
operation, at two months old ; Mr. C. T. Johnson performed the same ope
ration with success at six ; and I have been equally fortunate on a child
   ten months old.                                                  -

mention the imperfect             vision of patients for a longer or
shorter period after the operation, and attribute it to an
original deficiency of the retina itself.                  None of them,,
however, appear to me to attach sufficient importance to the
subject, except the late Mr. Saunders, whose opinions, as-
expressed in a letter written a short time before his death,
correspond more exactly with mine than any others                              I
have seen.        It is evident, from the powerful obstacles to
the acquisition* of useful vision, that unless congenital
cataracts are removed during the earliest periods of infancy,
the progress in the knowledge of visual objects must be
very slow and tedious.            This is indeed sometimes so much
the case, that I have known instances where both the pa
tient and his friends have despaired of ultimate success,
 and have altogether ceased to make the necessary efforts,
 even after the patient had begun to see objects with tole
 rable distinctness.         It is by no means uncommon for the
 friends of a congenital patient to expect that he should
 obtain the power of perfect vision immediately after the-
 operation, and even attribute their consequent disappoint
 ment to its imperfect execution.                 Parents ought therefore
 to be fully apprized of all these attendant circumstances of
 the complaint, and of the great necessity of a regular and
 constant attention to the future education of the patient ;
 and they should not be discouraged because immediate
  success does not attend their most anxious efforts.                     From
  an early period of my attendance at the London Eye In
  firmary, my mind has been deeply impressed with the con
  viction, that much more than is generally supposed neces
  sary, remained to be accomplished after the removal of the
  disease; and every day-s experience confirms me in this
  opinion.      Since an extensive practice has opened to me a
  wider field for observation, I have directed a considerable
  portion of my attention to the development of the various
  causes which retard the patient-s progress in acquiring a
   knowledge of visual objects, as well as to the best methods                     -
   of training the eyes for its attainment : and I am convinced
   that if proper plans, which must vary according to the ca-
      • " To turn the faculty of sight to use, so as to display precise notions cf
   Objects, demands experience, which can only be given by the exercise of
   vision with considerable attention for a long time.     The operation has no
   power to confer actual knowledge of objects. It only prepares the eye for
   receiving, and afterwards the intellect must be employed on the objects so
   received, before any readiness can be acquired.      The child therefore must
   be the object of the parent-s attention, and be regularly and diligently ex
   ercised about large objects at first, and be taught to know them ; then with
    smaller, and so on by degrees." — Vide Saunders-s. Posthumous          Works,

  pacity and disposition of different patients, were systema
 tically pursued j not only would useful vision be obtained
 by congenital patients in a much shorter period than usual,
 but it would fall little short of that enjoyed after the re
 moval of the disease from persons not born blind. An
 intelligent person should always be appointed to superin
 tend the management of those cured of congenital cataracts,
 whose sole business should be to watch and correct as
 much as possible those habits which impede the acquire
 ment of vision, and to assist, by every expedient which in
 genuity can devise, in the attainment of the desired object.
 To correct the rolling motion of the eyes, and to acquire
 the power of keeping them steady, the patient, after being
 fitted with spectacles, should be made to look steadfastly
 on one object.        The muscles of the eye, and the organ it
 self, will soon become fatigued with this exercise ; but it
 should be daily continued at proper intervals, by which the
 power of fixing the eyes at pleasure will rapidly increase.
 He should be made also to pick up small objects, such as
 grains of rice, &c. : this is also particularly useful, as it
 will in time enable him to judge accurately of distances, of
 which at first he is ignorant. — Letters of a large size should
 be next cut out on pasteboard : as these are capable of be
 ing examined by the touch as well as sight, they will begin
 to afford him a knowledge of different forms and shapes.
 The propensity to indolence and want of exertion in con
 genital patients, even in children, is often so great, that the
 preceptor will have considerable difficulty in making them
 apply daily for as long a time as is necessary; and I have
always found it regarded more as a task than a pleasure :
 but this must not tempt him to any relaxation in the
system.
     "  The sensibility of the retina to the impression of light
 increases in proportion to the degree of exercise to which
the eye is subjected *.          It is therefore obvious that the de-
    * This  appears very strikingly to have happened in the case of Mr.
Purkis, organist   of St. Clement-s Church, Strand, who was born with ca
taracts, and was operated on at thirty years old ; before which he was only
capable of perceiving light and brilliant colours.     In a note at the end of
his case Mr. Adams states : " The professional avocations of this patient, and
the continual rolling motion of his eyes, have hitherto prevented him from
reaping all the benefit to be derived from the operation.     The rolling mo
tion of his eyes, however, is very much corrected, and he has acquired the
power of fixing them at pleasure. He has learnt to read musical characters,
to tell the hour with the greatest accuracy on a watch-dial, or by a church
clock at a considerable distance, and his power of vision, continues to im
prove. Since his return from Exeter, he walks without a guide by day and
night, which he never ventured to do before the operation, and has now
entirely laid aside the use of spectacles, except to view minute objects."

  feet in its function arises -from continued      inaction, and
 .can therefore onlv be cured by constant application. Those
  who possess the blessing of sight, are in the constant and
  almost momentary habit of exercising the retina, while in a
 congenital patient all its powers are suffered to lie dormant.
  Even in persons not born blind, who have successfully
 undergone    • the
                     operation for cataract, if the disease had
 continued for many years, the functions of the retina
 during this period have been much impaired, and are after
 wards materially improved by exercise.           If this partial
 want of a natural sensibility in the retina be confined to
 one eye, which is often the case in the slate-coloured ca
 taracts with transparent edges, the other eye should be
 covered, or the spectacle before it obscured, to prevent the
 passage of light, whUe the one affected is exercised as much
 as possible.
     " In the hope of establishing a systematic plan of edu
cating persons who have been unfortunately affected with;
 congepital cataracts, a young gentleman about 1-1 years
 old, on whom I successfully performed the operation, has
 been placed under the tuition of an able and ingenious
 master, who has been made acquainted with the different
 causes which appear to me to retard the acquirement of
 vision, and with the means judged necessary to be em
 ployed in his instruction.      The progress this patient made
"while he was previously with his friends, by anattentiom
 to some of these rules, leads me very sanguinely to anti
cipate the greatest success from the present experiment.
After his recovery from the operation he could merelv di
stinguish colours, but was so entirely ignorant           of the
forms of objects that he could not perceive any difference
between a square and a circle.        To my great gratification,
when he arrived in London, nine months after the operation,
he could read letters of a middle size, could help himself at
table without assistance, walk alone in the street, &c. ; and
I have greai reason to hope, that at some. future period        I
shall be able to lay before the public the favourable      result,
of my efforts, assisted by those of the intelligent master on
this interesting      subject. ..On the contrary, I have fre
quently seen instances where the operation has been at
tended with equal success ; yet, owing to a want of a pro
 per attention afterwards, the patient has derived little ,«r no
benefit from it. A young lady upwards of twenty years
of age, one of the first persons I operated on at Exeter, to
whom I was enabled myself to pay at first a good deal of
attention, a month after she was cured, could distinguish

  that it was only by constant watphing she could be urged

 return home she has entirely given up every exertion for
 the improvement of her sight, and now remains nearly as
 helpless as ever. The little attention which appears hitherto
 to have been paid to a subsequent education, in the con
 stant exercise of the improving powers of vision, and the
 wish of impressing its importance still more strongly on
 the minds of those who are not sufficiently aware of the
 prevalence of the retarding causes, have induced me to ex
 tend these observations; and I feel a strong hope that, by
 the hints which they contain, they will materially assist the
 efforts of many anxious parents in the future education of
 such of their children as have undergone the operation for
 congenital cataract,"

 A complete         system of meteorology, even so far as the
 properties of climates, with regard to temperature only, are
 concerned, presents almost as great difficulties as a complete
 theory of the nature and cure of diseases.               In this, as iq
 many other departments of medical knowledge, we perpe
 tually find  a multiplicity of accounts,         apparently well at
 tested, but totally at variance with each other, which render
jt desirable to appeal to some more satisfactory testimonials
 than the results of common and superficial observation ;

        An Essay    on the medical Effects  of Climates.     211
   The simple indications of a thermometer, however accu
rately they may be observed, in the most unexceptionable
exposure, by no means afford a correct test of the tempera
ture, as it affects the human system: nor is it possible to
express the modifications produced by wind- and moisture,
even supposing them to be easily known, by any numerical
measure which shall be applicable to every relative situation
of the individual.    I have known an atmosphere at 65°,
with a thick tog, and a very little wind from the N.E., ap
pear, tor a person taking moderate exercise, most oppressively
sultry ; although a person, sitting long still, might have felt
the same air uncomfortably cold.          Moisture must make
both heat and cold more sensible; the one, by diminishing
perspiration, the other, by increasing the conducting power
of air. Wind is doubly concerned in affecting the pro
perties of a climate; first, as the great cause of preventing
a general accumulation of heat over considerable tracts of
country ; and secondly, as having a similar effect with re
spect to the immediate neighbourhood of the person ; and
its operation is as generally perceptible in the latter way,
where we have no precise mode of estimating its magni
tude, as in the former, where it is correctly indicated by a
thermometer sufficiently exposed : although, in fact, the
most shaded fixed thermometer may often be observed to
indicate a temperature many degrees higher, than that of
the breeze which is circulating in the neighbouring country.
Still more commonly by the sea side, the wind exhibits the
temperature of the water over which it has blown: at
Worthing it is seldom above 64° in the hottest weather,
although the sea, when the tide flows in at noon, over the
heated expanse of sand, is sometimes raised to 78°, where
it is several feet deep.
   To the inhabitants of these islands, the most important
properties of the climates of other countries are those, which
render them more or less fit for the residence of persons liable
to catarrhal or consumptive affections. Hence, warmth and
equability of temperature, especially in the winter months,
are the first objects of our inquiry in the theoretical com
parison of climates.     Moisture is supposed, by some, to be
favourable, by others, to be unfavourable, to such persons :
it may therefore be safely neglected, except as tending to
increase the evils depending on a want of equability of tem
perature.    The effluvia of moist ground are sufficiently well
known as the causes of paludal fevers ; further than this
they require no particular -investigation;     Nor can we at
tempt   to assign any  reason  for peculiarities, which render
                              O 2                          some

    '   some situations  preferable to others, for some individuals
        only, labouring under   a given disease, as asthma ; which is
     sometimes induced by the atmosphere of cities, and some
     times of the country ; and which it occasionally mitigated
     by a residence in places having no marked distinctions from
     such as are less favourable to                          it,
                                             as Kensington, and per
     haps some others.
         In the hotter seasons, there are few diseases, and few
     constitutions, which would require           climate milder than  a
    -our own: in the colder, an increase of the facility of cir
     culation, which heat appears to afford, may often be bene
     ficial, partly perhaps as exciting perspiration, and partly as
     preventing too great        congestion of blood in the internal

    It appears from this comparison, that none of the situa
tions here enumerated, North of Lisbon, except Penzance,
has any material advantage over London in the mildness of
its winter.    The best part? of Devonshire seem to be about
a degree and . a half warmer ; Torquay however may perhaps
be a little milder than this ; the account, which was kept
at llf-racombe, must have been taken from a thermometer
in a confined or a sunny situation.         But Penzance may be
fairly  considered   as having  a temperature 4|° higher than
London in the. coldest        months;    nor is the journal here
tern ployed the only one, which allots such a superioritv to
 the climate of this extremity of our island.         It is remark
able, that the temperature of the three coldest months is the
 same at Paris as at Edinburgh, being, in both these cities,
 about three degrees lower than in London.          There are pro
 bably particular spots on the coast of Hampshire or Sussex,
 which, from their sheltered situation, must be considerably
 less subject to the effect of the northern and eastern winds,
 than most other parts of the island ; and Hastings, or its
neighbourhood, may perhaps be reckoned among the most
 eligible of these; but ihe further we go up the channel, the
 inore remote we become from the mild gales of the Atlantic,
 while ihe prevalent south-westerly winds, in passing over
 a considerable part of the continent, must have lost much
 of their warmth. It is scarcely necessary to observe, that
 both Malta and Madeira present, numerically, a mean tern*
 perature for the winter months, as favourable for an invalid
 as can.possibly   .be desired.
     Equability of temperature is   a  second quality, of no small
 importance, as tending to diminish the chance of incurring,
 or aggravating, pulmonary diseases, by repeatedlv taking
  cold. When, indeed, the temperature is much below 60°,
  the most material changes are those which occur upon
  going from the house into the open air; so that a cold cli
 mate becomes, in some degree, of necessity a. changeable
 one also;    The regularity of this change, and the power of
 avoiding its effects by additional clothing, as well as of
 obviating them in some measure by exercise, contribute
                                03                          however

however to lessen its influence ; and it does not therefore
altogether supersede the effects of that changeableness,
which consists in a great extent of variation of the tem
perature of two successive days, or of different hours in the
course of the same day.         The simplest, and perhaps the
best mode of appreciating the effect of the extent of such a
variation, in deteriorating a climate, is to observe, for each
month, the greatest variation, at the same hour, in any two
successive days within its duration.          The mean variation
of successive days may also be computed, in order to assist
in the comparison ; and the mean diurnal range, or the
space through which the surface of the mercury moves, in
ascending and descending, throughout the day and night,
will give a collateral estimate of a similar nature. The best
practical mode of deducing this range from the observations
is, to find separately the mean of the heights for the morn
ing and afternoon, and to double their difference.       Where
none of these particulars can be obtained, the extreme va
riation of each month will afford a character not altogether
unimportant.

Mr. Farey-s Mineral        and Agricultural    " Report on Der-
                            byskire."
The first    chapter and volume of this work have been some
 time before the public : in our xxxixth volume, pages 19S
 and 253, we gave extracts from this volume, and made re
ferences to three previous communications from Mr. F.
 inserted in previous volumes, of matters contained therein,
 though under different forms of arrangement. We have now
 to notice & second \o\vxmz of this important work, containing
 chapters 2 to 13, treating of the subject usually embraced
 by the County Reports of the Board of Agriculture ; but
 treated most of them, as appears to us, with a degree of
 precision in all matters relating to persons, improvements,
 places, soils, strata, &c. which has not, we believe, been
 attempted in any of the other reports, though tbeir utility
 depends so much on such particulars.
    In the chapter on woods and plantations, we find the
 subject of pruning and training up young plantations ably
 treated, and at considerable length, as one which previous
 reporters had rather surprisingly overlooked, and the sug
 gestions of the author seem to us calculated to obviate, in

     In the section on draining, several instances are men
 tioned of unsuccessful attempts at improving lands, by Mr.
 Elkington, in Derbyshire, and in Bedfordshire, for the late
 Duke of Bedford, while the author was his Grace's land
 steward j from which it would appear, that far less of science
 or success attended Mr. E.'s practice as a drainer, than the
 public have been led to believe.         The principles of draining
 seem now, however, to be well understood ; the art is suc
 cessfully practised by great numbers of professional drainers
 all over the country, and scarcely any thing seems wanting
in point of theory, to Mr. John Johnston-s able Work on
 this subject, published by the Board. Some omissions and
misstatements in Mr. Batchelor-s Bedfordshire            Report re
 lating to this and some other branches of rural" improve
ments, in which the author was concerned, are noticed in
 this volume.

    In  the chapter on irrigation, it seems pretty satisfactorily
made out, that the Jlatness of the watered surfaces, of
 meadows in Derbyshire, Norfolk, Bedfordshire, and other
 places, have principally occasioned the numerous failures
 which have been complained of, in the practice of this art,
 though charged by Mr. Batchelor, and many other writers,
 to the account of soils and waters, either as to the mineral
 qualities or alleged coldness of the latter: some extensive
.schemes of irrigation in newly1 inclosed parishes in Bed
 fordshire, belonging to the late Duke of Bedford, are men
 tioned and shortly described.
     On the whole, we can recommend this volume to the
 careful perusal of our agricultural readers, as containing
 much practical and valuable information, applicable greatly
 beyond the limits of the county whose name it bears, and

   The extension        of science, humanity, and interest, all
combine to    give importance to Mr. Clark's discoveries, and
render it necessary to make them better known to the
public. The author well observes, in defence of the ve
terinary profession, that
                               " there is no art so perplexed and
difficult that by human industry and research, steadily and
properly exerted, cannot be rendered more clear and prac
ticable." He might have added that the progress of ani
mal is quite equal to that of human medicine, although the
latter interests all, the former only a part of mankind. Mr.
C. however, has given another, and, with his professional
brethren, very rare example, that of uniting the urbanity of
the schoFar and the precision of the philosopher in writing
on veterinary practice.         Formerly the vocabulary of such
writers was entirely vituperative,           " It is indeed," says
         "
Mr. C. high time the wretched style of declamation and
abusive writing on these subjects should give way to a bet
ter taste; that of real investigation and research, as in other
objects of a scientific nature, by which alone the art can
receive any useful accessions, and mankind and the horse
be benefited.      The empty verbosity of style alluded to be
gan about the reign of Charles II. or a little earlier, arid
has continued with few exceptions ever since.           It was un
known before that period, and was in reality the natural
produce and legitimate offspring of jockeyism and the race
course."
   The want of scientific terms, and the literal absurdity of
many of those now in use, imposed on the author an ar
duous task to make himself intelligible.          Such is the word
heel, when applied to the foot of a horse, where there is
really nothing analogous to the human heel. To remedy
this inaccuracy, Mr. C. has used the expressions" lower or
horny heels for the parts covered by the shoe; the posterior
heels, or back of the frog, and the superior or heels above
the hoof, formed by the cartilages." In like manner ha
shows that the wall of the hoof, as the exterior horn of the
foot is called, is not conical but cylindrical, being a very
obliqucly truncated cylinder.         The frog, which is a triangle
of elastic horn, has the effect of and may be compared to
an elastic key-stone received into an elastic arch.             This
                                                          structure.

 Structure,    destroying the continuity of the horny circle,
  contributes to divide equally the pressure on all parts of the
  hoof. The cleft of the trog, which keeps the foot from
  slipping, and also from too great eondensation of the horn
  by pressure, is prevented from rupturing by a stout cone of
  horn passing directly from it into the sensitive frog. This
  cone is quite as hard as the exterior horn, and thus obviates
  the tendency to division which exists in the horse's foot as-
 well as in cloven-footed animals.      The destruction or rup
  ture  of this cone becomes the source and cause of the dis
  ease  called the running thrush i it splits or cracks from
  whatever cause : the consequence is that extraneous sub
  stances introduce themselves, and these are followed by
  ulceration and discharges of matter.     Mr. C. traces the va
  rious appellations which the frog has received in different
  nations. The Latins call it furca, the French la J-ourc/iette,
  the fork ; and once in Vegetius it is called pendiginem,
 apparently from its hanging from the roof of the sole. The
  Italians have no proper name for this part, as pastoja is the
  pastern, arid tuello, or root, of the nail, precisely suits what
 the author calls a " coronary frog band j" a circle envelop
 ing the upper part of the hoof adjoining the hair. The
 Spaniards call it ranilla or little frog, but the Portuguese
 have ho distinct term for it.     The Greeks termed it ^AiSaw
 or swallow. The origin of the terms running thrush is thus
 traced: "Furca, in French Jburehe, and its diminutive
fourchette ; this contracted became the running fourche ;
 and thence we find about the days of Elizabeth, as in Blund-
                                                      f
 ville and other writers of that period, running rush ; and
 subsequently     in James-s reign, on the establishment        of
 horse-races, and the prevailing influence of the jockeys,
 who not finding in their vocabulary of English words such a
 one as frush, declared it must mean a thrush; and a running
 thrush it has ever since been called by the whole king
 dom."
     The horny heels, sole, wear of the hoof, and its bearings
 on the ground, are all examined with care, and manv im
 portant facts and circumstances are suggested, which we
 hope will not be overlooked by the thinking part of horse
 men. But the first and leading fact is the unresirained
 growth of the hoof, which requires five years before being
 iron-bound, instead of two or three as is too common.
 "The horse," says the author, " like other large animals,
 is slow in acquiring maturity, and like them is not very
 short-lived. Some celebrated writers have considered the
 natural period of his life about fifty years.      This was be

 from the truth in those times.      If we were to give an opi
 nion on this matter; we should state it as our belief, that
 he acquires his stature or height at about five years, but
 obtains his full" bulk and strength about the eighth year j
 and this period, as in most other animals, if multiplied by
 four, will give somewhere about the period of his natural
 life ; which, without any desire of unnaturally extending,
 would be from 32 to 40; and at the former age we have
 seen (setting aside the state of his feet) horses capable of a
 great deal of service.     But frequent visits to the slaughter
 house led us to observe and conclude, that six arrive there
 before, to one after the 14th year!" Thus, it appears that
 men abridge the lives of horses on an average, just to one
 third their natural duration. The unfortunate animals are
 crippled with strait shoes, their feet are contracted as un
 mercifully as those of the Chinese females, arid it becomes
 ceconomy to '' use them up," or wear them out by the
greatest barbarity, and then sell them to the caterers for dogs
 and cats ! The most obvious evil of the iron-shoe is " its
 permanent application and constant pressure against the
 bottom of the foot, with a force altogether indefinite, de
 pending on the strength with which the nails are clenched,
 and the proximity of the shoe to the sole, which causes it
 to act with more or less violence against the lower surface
 of the coffin-bone. Next the nails in the sides, being im-
 movcably blocked in the perforations of the shoe, create a
 solid resistance of iron at this part, not admitting the na
 tural expansion of the hoof ; and it must be obvious that
 they almost, though hot entirely, prevent, by keeping the
quarters fixed, every movement of the posterior parts and
heels."     It is impossible to form any adequate idea of the
dreadful   tortures which the animal must experience under
 such circumstances; it is also necessary to examine the,
 author-s very accurate plates, to comprehend the extraor
 dinary changes which shoes make even on the very bones
 of the horse-s foot. Mr. C. took casts of natural hoofs,
from which that ingenious arid accurate delineator Mr. S.
Edwards made drawings, which correctly represent the
figures of the hoof in its natural state, and after it has un
dergone the process of shoeing at different periods.           In
this case the outline of the hoof is changed from, nearly a
circle to a good oval, the posterior part contracting, the toe
extending.      That part of the hoof which is nearly hori- .
zontal can grow a" little, but that which is perpendicular,
cannot possibly overcome the resistance of a thick bar or
iron.                                                          Iu

  .In  an *' Essay on the     feet of horses that have*suffered
by shoeing, witji experiments exhibiting the effects of a
sudden removal of the shoes, and turning to gi^ss," we              ,
find some very curious, osteological and physiological re
marks, which almost make us doubt the accuracy of our
anatomical knowledge of the horse :iWei allude to what
the author calls a fvj>atiloba or scaly node of the coffin-
bone," which consists pf plates, or scales, f"orming-an ob
long lobe of soqie extent at the hind part of the foot, and
placed over one another like tiles, but not in contact,
having spaces between them. This peculiar. bone, it seems,
is entirely destroyed by tight shoes.         The numbness occa
sioned by the pressure of the nails also makes horses cut
in travelling. The conclusion whiph ,Mr,.C. draws from
his experiments, is,     " that after .the foot has been exposed a
certain time to the operation of the iron, it becomes so
much changed from its natural state, that it is safer and
more advisable for it to remain in the diminished and fixed
condition to which it is reduced, than by any measures,
especially severe or coercive ones, to attempt its restoration;
as any sudden or violent change appears to disturb the foot
and bring on morbid affections, rather than the healthy
condition of the part; so that a continuance of it in this
state appears the less evil, or even an advance of the mis
chief, if it be a very slow and uniform one, is to be pre
ferred.    Such appear the disclosure and unfolding of this
mysterious matter, and which, though it may appear sim
ple when explained, has been no small stumbling-block to
many people both in and out of the profession.              The ex
posure   of  strong  feet  a few  days   or weeks  at grass, merely
to cool them or remove any casual compression from nails,
is not prohibited by this caution, but further exposure
would be injurious. The author has the pleasure of find
ing his discovery immediately reduced to practice, and se
veral noblemen and gentlemen now bring up their young
horses in their parks and pastures without having recourse
to the early and unnatural application of iron shoes. Even
the young horses for the regiments of Guards are kept in
 this state of nature, in consequence of which their lives
 will in all human probability be doubled.
   The   "  Essay on the knowledge of the ancients respecting
shoeing" is more interesting to the lover of polite litera
ture, and more entertaining to those who can amuse them
selves with the natural history of language and the aits.

  camel was subject to tender feet on going long journeys,
  when it was shod with the karbatinai.         It appears that the
  earliest veterinary surgeons were those emploved by Con-
  stantine to attend the horses of the Roman armies.           Ap-
  syrtus, whose work on this subject is still extant, lived at
  that time.     When iron shoes were introduced, about the
  fifth ccnturv, the smiths became the horse-doctors, and
  were called ferrer.» ; afterwards Jerriers, and corruptly
  farriers, from J"errvm, iron.        Instead of leather socksj
  somt   think  the ancients  used  broom    twigs ; but it appears
  better ascertained that they sometimes put iron over the
  leather.   It is more probable that the broom was applied
 rather medicinally, than to protect the feet as shoes.       Even
 the Spani>h broom {sparttum juncevm Linn ) would be
 very inadequate; the barilla-matting of the slipa lenacissima
 Linn, would be much better, and also the leaves of the
 dwarf palm, chamcerops humilis Linn. The origin of mo
 dern shoeing can be traced no higher than the nailed shoe
 found in the coffin of King Childeric, who died in 481}
 but a more unequivocal intimation of the modern horse
 shoe occurred in the ninth century under Leo X. of Con
 stantinople.     Daniel savs that horses were shod only, iri
 frost or particular occasions in that age.          William the
 Conqueror introduced the practice of shoeing into England j
 he gave Northampton to Simon St. Liz, a Norman, to pro
 vide shoes for his horses ; and Henry de Ferrers, the an-
 cestorof Lord Ferrers, was the superintendant of Vne shoers. .,

     Dr. Brewster, of Edinburgh,       is about to publish a Trea

in the Arts and Sciences,       with Experiments on Light and
 Colours, in one -volume      8vq.  with twelve Plates.

 In     our report of last month, our account of Dr. Brewster's
 paper was in some respects inaccurate; the following ia
 more correct ;
      This paper contained a short abstract of Dr. Brewster's
 numerous experiments on light and colours, and was divided
 into four parts.       1. On a new property        impressed upon
 light by transmission through         the  agate.   When light is
 transmitted through a thin plate of transparent agate cut
 in a direction perpendicular to the laminte, Dr. Brewster
 has found that it possesses all the characters of one of the
  pencils formed by double refraction, one of the image of the
  luminous object from which it proceeds disappearing in
  every quadrant of its circular motion when viewed by a
  prism of Iceland spar.       The kindred substances of carnelian
  and chalcedony       possess   the same property.       2. On the
  doub'e refraction of chromate of iead.         Dr. Brewster found
  that this metallic salt possessed a double refraction, which
  was nearly thrice as great as that of Iceland crystal. 3. On
   substances which have a greater refractive power than the
   diamond. Since the time of Sir Isaac Newton, who first
   disco-vered the powerful action of the diamond upon light,
   it has always been conceived that this precious stone pos
   sessed the highest refractive power of all bodies whatever :
   but Dr. Brewster has found that both chromate of lead
   and realgar exceed it considerably          in refractive power.
   4. On     a double dispersive power     in doubly refracting cry
    stals.  Dr. Brewster has discovered, that all bodies that
    possess a double refraction have also a double dispersive
    power, one of which is verv much greater than the other;
    the highest dispersive power of Iceland spar being consi
                                                               derably

 power is very much below that of writer.
    February 25.     In consequence of the continued indis
 position of the President, the Earl of Morton, Vice-presi
 dent, was in the chair, when a paper by Dr. Wollastori was
 read, containing a description of his newly invented single
 lens micrometer.      This instrument is made like a common
 telescope, but the focus of the lens is only l-12th of an
 inch : this glass is placed behind a brass plate, through the
 centre of which an eye1 hole is drilled ; the- subjects to be
 viewed are placed between glasses serving as object glasses,
 and the measure of the magnifying powers and of the sub
jects examined is taken by means of a certain number of
 wires fixed- near the object glasses.   The measure and num
 ber of the wires being determined, the objects may be ex
 tended to such distances as to give their dimensions by
making a wire the two hundredth part 6f an inch cover
 them. The description was illustrated by designs of the
 micrometer, which the author adopted in consequence of
his experiments on drawing very fine wires, some of which
 did not exceed the thirty thousandth part of an inch ; but
 they were incapable of supporting themselves at this fine
ness, and were broken in very short pieces. He found wirejs
 1S000 of which covered an inch, to be the finest arid
strongest for any useful purpose.
    A paper by Dr. Pearson, on the tingeing matter of
 the bronchial glands of the lungs, and ou the black
or tingeing matter of the lungs themselves, was read.
From hU researches it appears that this black matter is
principally charcoal in an uncombined state, or at least
that it is only intimately mixed with a small portion of
an;mal matter.      He conceives that it is derived from the
atmosphere in breathing; that it is first conveyed into the
air-tubes, and from them by means of the numerous lym
phatics into the bronchial glands, and therefore that it is
not a secreted substance;      This subject being so novel, Dr.
Pearson declined entering info much reasoning or drawing
many conclusions until more facts are brought to light.

  not be intelligible.
      March 18. Sir E. Home, Bart, through the Society for
   promoting Animal Chemistry, communicated the result of
  his observations and experiments for ascertaining the origin
  of animal fat and adipocire.     He began by detailing his ex
   periments   on  fowls,  and  particularly alluded to the casso
"
  wary of Java, which has a colon of only twelve inches,
  Vhile that of Africa has one 45 feet long. This diversity
  he attributes to the wise ceconomy of nature, the former
  country being extremely fertile, and the latter as sterile.
  This circumstance led him to examine the cause and
  effects of fat in the intestines, and the nourishment      it af
  fords to the entire animal ; and hence he inferred that it is
  the intestines in all animals which supply the system with
  fat. Ambergrease, he observed, is the product of a disease,
  and is never found in whales above seven feet from the
  anus;, it is usually from 14 lbs. to 100 lbs. and in one in
  stance a piece weighing 182 lbs. had been found.           Sir E.
  described  the state of a woman   buried  in-Shoreditch  church
  yard in 1 790, ten feet below the surface of the ground, which
  is two feet below the level of a sewer passing through    it, and
  leading to the Thames.        In spring tides the sewer over
  flows, and the dead bodies are inundated.           After eleven
years,  in  1801, the grave was opened, and the whole body
was found to consist of adipocire.       According to some ex
 periments   made    by Mr.  Brande,    the   animal fibre is  con
verted into adipocire     byimmersion      in  gall
                                                  ;  hence   Sir E.
concludes that the gall-bladder assists in accumulating fat,
 as well as other functions of the animal ceconomy.          Fat   is
rapidly formed, and as quickly absorbed      ;   it soon accumu
lates in dormant animals, and     isagain absorbed during their
sleeping   season;    lies
                     it     near  the   skin* and in old people
supplies  the  place of muscle   or  fibre.    The author related
the case of child born without any gall-bladder;
             a                                            it  never

Pr. Babington, in letter to Sir Everard, mentioned case

fatty matter, which on examination were found {a consist

 of one- third oil  and   two-thirds mucus.     The author con
 cludes  that fat is  not  a secretion, as generally believed by
 physiologists.

             The Right H,on. Charles Long, M. P. ;
             William Clarke, Esq. Trinity Coll. Cambridge,
 were severally elected members of the Society.
    Two letters from Mr. Webster, draughtsman and keeper
 of the museum to the Society, addressed to L. Horner, Esq.
 were read.
    In the first Mr. W. states that during a late examination
 of the Isle of Wight, made by him for Sir H. Englefield,
 he discovered a seires of calcareous strata of later formation
 than the chalk, and especially characterized by containing
 fresh-water shells.     From this circumstance he was led to
 suspect a correspondence between this formation and tlie
 ealcaire d'eau douce, which has been described by firog-
 niart and Cuvier as forming some of the strata in the basin
.of Paris ; which conjecture was confirmed by a comparison
 ©f the fresh-water fossils of the Isle of Wight with those
 of the French strata which were given by M. Brogniart
 to the Count de Bournon, and by him have been deposited
 in the cabinet of the Geological Society.
    In consequence of this interesting discovery, the attend
 ance of Mr. Webster at the Society's apartments was for
 s time dispensed with, that he might re-examine the Isle of
 Wight and its vicinity. Accoidingly his letter is dated
 front Freshwater, in the Isle of Wight, March 3d. In this
 he states that he has succeeded in obtaining some very de
 sirable sections of the strata, and an abundant collection
 of specimens.       He is inclined to think that there are two
 fresh-water   formations,   with a marine formation between.
 The lowest fresh-water formation consists of beds of sand
 »nd marie, with numerous fragments of the limnea of La
 marck, and of two species of planoibis ; the interposed
 marine deposit is of blue claV, with venuses, oysters, and
 tarious turbinated shells: and the upper fresh-water, for
 mation consists of a calcareous rock inclosing numerous
 aid very fine .specimens of the limnea and planoibis. Some
 q£ tills stsatum is very friable, being only marie: other

parts are extremely hard, and tlie uppermost part of it has
•a  porcelainous character.     Mr. VV. has not discovered any
bed of gypsum, nor siliceous concretions.
     A paper by Dr. MacCulloch, on the granite Tors of De
 vonshire arid Cornwall, accompanied bv three drawings,
 was read, and thanks were voted for the same.
     The object of this communication-is to show the process
followed by nature in the destruction of the granite rocks
of Cornwall and Devonshire, and to explain how this pro
cess is dependent upon a particular mode of aggregation of
the materials of which this rock consists, and which can
be satisfactorily observed only during the progress of its
 decomposition.
     Dr. M. first treats of the granite which forms that pro
montory near the Land-s End on which the Loggan rock is
 situated. Its length is about 200 yards, and the entire rock
 of which it is composed is traversed by numerous vertical
and horizontal fissures, thus dividing the mass into a mul
 titude of cubical and prismatic blocks. The Loggan rock
 itself, which is the subject of one of the drawings, appears
 to be one of these blocks in a state of decay, but still oc
cupying its original site.      Its general figure is irregularly
 prismatic   and  four-sided, with a protuberance on the lower
 surface on which it is poised.      The breadth of the appa
 rent surface of contact between this protuberance and the
 rock that it rests upon, is about a foot and a half; but its
 figure being cylindrical, and not spheroidal, the motion of
 the stone is limited to a vibration in one direction.       The
 utmost force of three persons (according to Dr. M.-s
 trials) is only capable of making its exterior edge describe
 an arc the chord of which at six feet distance from the
 centre of motion is three quarters of an inch.      A force of
 a very few pounds, however, is sufficient to begin and main
 tain a very visible degree of vibration : even the wind when
 blowing on its exposed western surface produces ttfis effect
 very sensibly. Its weight, as estimated from its dimensions
 and the specific gravity of granite, appears to be 65 tons.
     The subject of the second drawing is the Cheese-wring,
  which occupies the highest ridge of a hill to the north of
  Liskeard.     It is an irregular column about 15 feet high,
 composed     of  five stones, the upper ones of which are so
  much larger than the rest as to overhang the base on all
  sides.   The angles and external borders of these stones are
  considerably rounded by the effect of decomposition : and
  there is no doubt that in process of time this disintegration
  will proceed so far that the balance of the pile will be de-

Stroyed, and its ruins will not be distinguishabe from the
other bowlders with which the tops of all the hills in this
vicinity are overspread.
    The third drawing represents the Vixen Tor on Dartmoort
Almost all the granite of Cornwall and Devon, like that
of the Land-s End, is divided by fissures into masses more
or less approaching a cubical form.       If a rock of this kind
nearly level with the surface of the soil is examined, the
fissures will be found to be a mere mathematical plane, and
the angles formed by the intersection will be sharp and
perfect.    If we then turn our attention to granites which
from their greater elevation above the soil appear to have
been longer exposed to air and weather, we may observe a
gentle rounding of the angles such as is exhibited in the
 Vixen Tor.
   By degrees the fissures become wider; and the blocks, which
were originally prismatic, acquire an irregular curvilinear
boundary resembling those which form the Cheese-wring.
    If the centre of gravity chances to be high, and far re
moved from the perpendicular of its fulcrum, the stone falls
from its support, arid becomes rounder by the progress of
decomposition, till it assumes one of the various spheroidal
figures which the granite bowlders so often exhibit.
    These fissures, and the rounded form which the cubical
blocks acquire bv decomposition, Dr. M. is inclined to at
tribute to the original structure of the rock.      In this, as in
basalt,  crystallization appears  to have  begun  in  distinct and
more or less distant points, from each of which it proceeded
forming thick concentric lamellae, till at length the exterior
shells of adjacent concretions came in contact, but were in
capable of mutual penetration.        The outer lamella are the
Jeast hard and dense, and therefore yield the easiest to the
various causes which occasion the disintegration of rocks.
    March 1 9. Mr. Webster exhibited specimens of the rocks
Containing fresh-water shells, recently discovered by him in
the Isle of Wight.
    A paper on the rocks at Clovelly in Devonshire, with
illustrative drawings by the Rev. J. J. Convbeare, was read,
and thanks were voted for the same.
    The fishing town of Clovelly is situated in a narrow
yavine, on the N. coast of Devon, about 22 miles W. of
Ilfracombe. The shore is precipitous, being formed of cliffs
about 130 or 140 feet in height, intersected bv narrow,
alternations of grauwacke and grauwacke slate, curved and
contorted    in the most capricious way imaginable.            No
organic remains were observed in them, nor any foreign
                                                         minerals,

                         Geological Society.                    991
  minerals, except opaque white quartz forming numerous
  veins.   Nearly the whole of north Deronshire is composed
  of the rock just described, which is locally distinguished
 into dimstone and shillat, the latter being the slaty grau-
  wacke, and the former the compact. It is always very irre
 gular in its stratification, is destitute of metallic veins, alter*
 nates with transition limestone, and, where it does so, occa
  sionally contains organic remains : it also, in one instance
 at least, alternates with thick beds of a kind of culm; its
 veins, besides quartz, occasionally offer calcareous spar.
 Killas, which Mr. C. is inclined to regard as a variety, not
 of mica slate, but of clay slate, is contorted in its stratifica
 tion only in the neighbourhood of the grauwacke, is tra
 versed almost through its whole extent by frequent veins or
 dykes of a porphyritic rock which does not pass into the
 grauwacke, contains sometimes topaz, and not unfrequently
 garnet : its veins are often filled with chlorite mica and
 crystallized felspar, and also contain tin stone, gray cobalt
 ore, &c.     These characters, in the opinion of the author of
 this paper, form a sufficient mark of distinction between the

read, and thanks were voted for the same.
    The circumference of this island is about 2 miles ; it
 forms a kind of table land of irregular surface, gently
 sloping to the N. E, and is bounded on all sides by steep
and generally perpendicular cliffs, from 60 to 70 feet above
 high-water mark, the greatest elevation in the island being
about 120 feet.
    The entire island is a mass of basalt, but a bed of sand
 stone is said to be visible at low water on the western
 side.       .              .  /
    The basalt presents two varieties, the columnar and
 amorphous, the latter of which is generally amygdaloidal,
 containing zeolites.
     In the columnar variety lamellar stilbite is occasionally
 found filling the intervals of approximate columns, and
 sometimes, though rarelv, in the substance of the smaller
 and more irregular columns.
     On the south-western side of the island there appear to
 be three distinct beds of basalt, the lowermost of which
 seems to be amorphous. The next bed, from thirty to
fifty feet thick, consists of those large columns which form
•the conspicuous feature of Staffa: the upper one appears,
at a distance,    to be a mass of amorphous basalt, but on
closer inspection is found to consist of small columns, often

wood-laid    and entangled in every   direction.  The columnar
basalt   of Staffa is by no means      so regular as that of the
Giant-s Causeway; but, in return, it presents many beauti
ful specimens of bending columns, which do not occur at
the latter place.    Of these the most remarkable form a co
nical detached rock, called Budchaille or the Herdsman.
Besides the great cave are two smaller ones, which being
only accessible by a boat and in perfectly calm weather, can
very rarely be examined.
   The surface of the island is in many places overspread
with a bed of alluvial matter, containing rounded fragments
of granite, gneiss, mica slate, quartz, and red sand-stone,
together with a few rolled pieces of basalt.      As there is at
present a considerable extent of deep sea between this bed
and the nearest primitive rocks of Iona, Coll, Tirer and
Mull, it becomes an interesting subject of speculation to
inquire into the conditions requisite to account for this fact.
These seem to be, either that a declivity sufficient to allow
the transportation    of rounded fragments has formerly ex
isted sloping upwards from the present level of Staffa to
some primitive mountains which no longer exist, or that
the whole of Staffa itself has been raised to its present ele
vation from the boitom of the deep sea by which it is now
surrounded.

             PHILOSOPHICAL     SOCIETr OF LONDON.
     The learned President, Dr. Lettsom, has during the last
mojuh delivered a lecture on the Natural and Medicinal
Histories of Tea.       He commenced by observing, that he
could not be ignorant in presenting an object of discussion,
that it is expected that some extent of novelty may be
afforded, and some useful information conveyed ; but from
the universally known subject, he feared that disappoint
ment must result ; for what is familiar admits of little no-
relty, and what is known of little interest.        " To convey
instruction," said the Doctor,      "  I do not aspire; but im
 pelled by a cordial impulse to evince my respect for and
 approbation of this Society, as well as excite the labours of
 others, I have presumed to throw the discus which a more
 youthful and vigorous arm is better qualified to direct." The
 lecturer then proceeded upon the botanical history, and,
 having given a description of the parts of fructification,
 stated, that there is but one species of the tea plant, the
 difference of green and bohea tea depending upon the na
 ture of the soil, the culture, and manner of drying the leaves.
 Sir John Hill, from observing a different number of petals
 in different corollas, described the green and bohea tea as
 different species, giving to the first nine, and to the latter
 only six petals. He conveyed this opinion to Linne, who
 adopted the mistake, which his future experience corrected,
  as he informed Dr. L. by letter.
      The authors who have treated upon this subject amount to
  at least a hundred, many of whom never saw the tea tree. The
  first figure given of it was in the Acta Haffniensia, whic"h<
  was taken    from   a dried specimen   ; since that it has been
  figured by Bontius, Plukenet, Kaempfer, and Lettsom, the
 latter the only perfect one.       He had access to the first
  plant grown in Europe, which was raised by his ingenious
  friend Mr. Ellis, in Gray-s Inn, from seeds taken out of a
  canisier, and promiscuously sown in a pot placed outside of
  his window.      As China and Japan are the only countries
  known to us where the tea shrub is cultivated for use, we
  may reasonably conclude that it is indigenous to one of

them,    if not to both, and probably the brackish ill-tasted
 water in many parts of those countries first led to its use
 as an infusion.
    Tea was first introduced into Europe by the Dutch East
India Company, early in the sixteenth century, and a quan
tity of it was brought over from Holland in 1666 by Lords
Arlington and Ossory. In consequence of this, tea soon
became known amongst people of fashion, and its use by
degrees since that period has become general.              Cornelius
Bou-tekoe,   a  Dutch physician,    wrote   a  treatise in  praise of
tea as early as 1678.       The lecturer passed on to consider
the soil and culture best adapted to this plant, and observed,
that according to Kffimpfer, no particular gardens or fields
are allotted for           it,
                      but that      cultivated round the borders
                                                it   is
of rice and corn fields without any regard to the soil that                        ;
there are usually from six to twelve seeds in each vessel                                ;
that they are promiscuously put into              hole four or fivea
inches deep at certain distances from each other.           The rea
son why so many seeds are put into one hole is, that they
contain great quantity of oil, which
         a                                      apt to turn rancid,is
and then they       will not   germinate.     They then vegetate
without further care. The leaves are not fit to be plucked
before the third year's growth, and in about seven years the
shrub rises to     man-s height; but as
                       a                          then but scantily

provided   with  leaves,      cut downit to the
                                           is    stem,  from which,
an exuberance           of fresh shoots arise.                     The   tea tree delights
particularly in valleys, or on the declivities of hill, and upon
the banks of rivers where           enjoys    southern exposure to
                                                it             a

   The Doctor then proceeded to describe the manner and
the seasons of gathering the leaves, and the method of
curing or preparing tea in Japan.          Of the varieties of tea,
Dr. L. observed of the green, the bing, imperial, or bloom

by  the name of hyson, so called after an East India mer

rolled up in the form of baits and threads.        He said he
had formerly infused all the sorts of green and bohea teas
 he could procure, and expanded the different leaves on pa
per to compare their respective size and texture, intending
thereby to discover their age.       He found the leaves of
green tea as large as those of bohea, and nearly as fibrous ;
which led him to suspect that the difference did not so
much depend upon the age as upon the other circumstances.
    The Asiatics give a flavour to tea by introducing among
it the olea fragrans, whose small flowers are frequently to
be met with in teas exported from China.        On the subject
of drinking of tea, Dr. L. observed, that the Chinese and
Japanese never use tea before it has been kept a year, by
which time its narcotic properties are diminished. They
drink it without sugar or milk. Having mentioned various
methods of preserving the seeds for vegetation, the lecturer
entered upon its medical history.
    It is natural to conclude, that as tea was imported
 from a foreign country, and at no inconsiderable danger
 and expense, and the custom of drinking it almost uni
versal, much attention would have been excited respecting
its natural and medical history, as well as its commercial
influence; and indeed, as the learned President noticed, if
 saying much is a proof of attention, much has certainly
been said and written, and much to no purpose, on its medi
 cinal properties ; for although he has examined nearly a hun
 dred authors on the subject, he has acquired little informa
 tion ; nor can it be expected, where vague hypotheses are
 substituted for experiment, and theories for facts : thus
 claiming no fixed data, the inductions are fallacious or in
 decisive.   This induced the Doctor to institute experiments,
 and establish principles upon which reason might exercise
judgement, and truth elucidate facts. From theseexperments,
 which we are sorry our pages will not allow us room to re
 late, the sedative and relaxing effects of tea appear greatly
 to depend upon       an odorous fragrant principle, which,
 abounds most in green tea, particularly that which is most
 highly flavoured.     This seems further confirmed by the
 practice of the Chinese, who avoid using this plant till it
 has been kept at least twelve months, as -they find when
 recent it possesses a soporiferous and intoxicating quality.
    The author deprecated the practice of taking tea very
 hot, and quoted in support of his opinion a passage from
 Professor Kalm's Travels into North America.      The Doctor
 concluded by the following observations : " From the re
 sult of the experiments we may clearly' explain the causes
                                P4                           of

of those different effects produced by tea-drinking ; as well
as upon what predominant qualities of this exotic these
effects depend.      Hence it will be inferred, that when the
fine green teas are employed, whose sedative counterbalance
their astringent qualities, and particularly in weak or deli
cate constitutions, debilitating and injurious effects may
succeed; as tremors, fluttering and agitation of spirits,
pain of the stomach, and weakened digestion, with flatu
lence, head-ache, and various nervous affections ; and with
such constitutions, this tea taken in the evening produces
watching, and the unhappy sensations which want of the
refreshment of sleep naturally produces : and may it not
 also be suspected, that the increased frequency of palsies
and apoplexies may in some measure be attributed to the
fragrant, odorous, and sedative influence of this exotic ?"
    "  Indeed, from the whole analysis of green and bohea teas,
the sedative and exhilarating qualities of the former will
be clearly comprehended, as well as the astringent qualities
 of both ; although, from the larger proportion of tannin in
 the bohea, it will be less relaxing; nevertheless combining
 such a proportion of odour as to give it a grateful influence
 on the nervous system ; and thus, either single or mixed,
 they convey a pleasant and reviving sensation, as has been
 so often mentioned by travellers; and persons after fatigue
 of body, as well as exertion of mind, find in tea a grateful
 sedative and pleasing diluent."

    Jan. 27.    Mr. Carmichael    concluded his paper cf on the
 electric fluids, considered as different compounds of the
 solar rays."     But as a long chain of induction, supported
 by  references   to a multiplicity of unconnected facts, and
 given in the most concise and naked form, scarcely admits
 of a" perspicuous analysis, we are necessarily confined to a
 mere statement of the plan of the memoir.
    It commences with the grounds for supposing that elec
 tricity is derived from the sun, as well as light and heat;
 and details the experiments made by M. Ritter, Dr. Wol-
 lasion, and Sir H. Davy, on the disoxygenating ray, whose
 effects so nearly resemble those of the Galvanic influence.
 After which are suggested such further experiments as would
 lend to a more satisfactory examination of the subject.
    The possibility of chemical combinations, between the
 calorific, colorific, and disoxygenating rays, is next dis
 cussed : -and it is supposed that the formation of one of the
 electric fluids is effected by a union between the disoxy
                                                      genating

                      Transparent Paper for Artists.                       233
genatlng and calorific rays; and of the other, by a similar
union between the disoxygenating and colorific.
    Evidence is then adduced, to disprove the present sup
position of the mutual repulsion of the homogeneous par
ticles of electricity, and the mutual attraction of the hetero
geneous; and the true laws that govern both fluids investi
gated.        The laws proposed are as follow :
     1. That in a free and unconfined state, at an indeter
minate distance, there is a mutual attraction between any
two volumes of electricity, whether of similar or different
species.
     2. That in the same free state, at a minute distance, all
particles of electricity attract similar particles, and repel
 those of an opposite nature *.
     3. That when contained in other bodies, an opposite
 effect takes place; and such bodies as are similarly electri
 fied repel each other, and those which are differently elec
 trified attract each other.
     The phaenomena of the Galvanic trough and Leyden
 phial are then explained, in reference to the proposed hy
 pothesis ; and such evidence as could be collected, is
 brought forward to- prove that positive electricity is com
  posed of the disoxygenating and colorific rays ; and nega
  tive, of the disoxygenating and calorific. This is followed
  by a disquisition, whether it may not be either the colorific
  ray, or the calorific, and not the disoxygenating,                      which
  should be considered the base of both fluids.                        And the
  whole concludes with a consideration of the philosophical
  inquiries likely to arise out of the proposed hypothesis, if
  on due investigation it should be found worthy of adoption.

  sugar of lead finely powdered ; shake it up, and let it stand
 a day and night ; then pour it off, and add to it one pound
 of the best Canada balsam, set it in a gentle sand heat, and
  keep stirring it till it is quite mixed, when it will be fit for
 use ; then lay your paper on a smooth board, and with a
 large brush, brush your paper over very even with the mix
 ture, and then hang it upon lines to dry, and it will be fit
 for use in about four days.

    EFFECTS OF COLOURED RAYS IN A MIXTURE OF OXY-
                  MURIATE AND HYDROGEN GAS.
    Mr. Leebeck, a German chemist, having made a mixture
 of these gases exposed them to the light of the sun, which
 suddenly decomposed them with a great explosion. This
 experiment was suggested by Gay Lussac and Thenard,
 and M. Leebeck has repeated it with success by means of
 gas collected over hot water.          He afterwards introduced
 this gas into a yellowish red bell glass, and another of a
 deep blue, which he exposed to the solar rays.         In the blue
 bell glass the decomposition took place instantly without
 any explosion, and in a minute at most it was ended, and the
 greater part of the bell glass was filled with water.      On the
contrary,     in  the red   bell  glass  the  decomposition took
 place very slowly : after being exposed for twenty minutes
 to very strong solar rays, a very small quantity of water
rose in the red bell glass.       This mixture of gas in the red
bell glass was introduced into a white bell glass, and also
exposed to the solar rays : no explosion took place, but in
a few minutes the decomposition was complete,             and the
glass was filled with water.        The experiments were several
times repeated with similar results.

    March    11. — The thermometer      has been down below the
freezing point in the night. Snow is now falling (8 A.M.)
when there is no dense cloud near the zenith, only some of
the fleecy kind ; there is however a denser kind of cloud in
the horizon ; afterwards common snow showers prevailed,
with clear intervals, and strong wind from NE. Therm,
at 11 P.M. as low as 29°; clear star-light night, at inter

    March 12. — Snow showers, In which the nimbi never
appeared very dense ; the same phaenomenon of snow fall
ing, when there was no nimbus near the zenith, happened
again today.         Either the snow must have been blown
along horizontally for some distance by a strong wind, or
must have come from light clouds not suspected to be
nimbi from spectators below. These clouds were a kind of
confused cirrus of light texture.       The night was clear, and

XXXVII.       An Investigation of the Properties of Lactic
    Acid.    By Jacob Berzklius, Professor of Medicine and
    Pharmacy, and M.R.A. Stockholm.                  Translated from
  »
    the Swedish *,
The lactic acid       was discovered by Schtele.           He allowed
sour milk to coagulate, filtered the fluid, and boiled it away
to I 8th ; he then filtered it again, to separate the curd
which was deposited.         This acid fluid he saturated with
lime water, which threw down a precipitate of bone earth ;
the remaining lime was cautiously separated by the addition
of oxalic acid, taking care that it should not be in excess,
and tiie fluid was evaporated to dryness.                The acid was
then dissolved in alcohol> which, after evaporation, afforded
it in the purest state that was then known.             Scheele deter
mined the relations of this acid to the greatest number of
bases so clearly and accurately, that there was no reason to
"entertain any doubt of its proper nature, as essentially di
stinct from all other acids. The assertions of Scheele have
however within the last few years not only been called in.
 question, but even positively contradicted, by some French
chemists, Bouillon Lagrange, Thcnard, FourCroy» and Vau-
quelin.     Since only the two last chemists have had suffi
cient confidence in their scientific character to decide posi
 tively on this (juestion, in contradiction to the results of
 Scheele's experiments, I shall here only say a few words
 respecting their assertions.      Among the properties of the
 lactic acid, Scheele has mentioned that it is not volatile, and
 that it is destroyed by distillation, and affords a sour spirit;
 a name, by which the empyreumatic vinegar, which is- ob
 tained in the distillation of organic substances, was then
always distinguished.         In their investigations respecting
 this acid;1 lne French chemists saturated it with an alkali,
 mixed the salt with concentrated sulphuric acid, and di
 stilled the mixture.. The liquid distilled contained a weak
 Vinegar, which was saturated with alkali, was evaporated
 to dryness, and was distilled again with sulphuric acid.                 It
 requires no great depth of chemical knowledge to discover
  the impropriety of this mode of operation, and the neces
 sity of the formation of vinegar at the expense of the com
 ponent parts of the lactic acid destroyed.              On the other"
 hand, these chemists seem not to have paid the slightest
 attention to the proper characteristic salts, which are pro
 duced by the lactic acid with different bases, and from
    * From the Animal

which we usually derive the principal and the most certain
criterions of an acid.   They Concluded from their experi
ments, that Scheele had been mistaken, and that the lactic
acid was nothing else than a combination of the acetic with
a proper animal matter, which hindered the volatilisation of
 the acid.
     Since we have found that the lactic acid acts a more or
 less distinguished    part in the blood, in muscular flesh, in
  the marrow, in urine, and in milk, it appears desirable that
  these circumstances     should be very accurately examined.
I   have therefore undertaken to investigate its nature very
  fully, and have obtained, by means of a long and often re
 peated series of different experiments, a complete conviction
 that Scheele was in the right, and that the lactic acid is a
 peculiar acid, very distinct from all others.
     I shall here relate the results of my experiments.       The
 extract which is obtained when dried whey is digested with
 alcohol, contains, as I have already observed, uncombined
 lactic acid, lactate of potass, muriate of potass, and a pro
 per animal matter.      I mixed this solution in alcohol with
 another portion of alcohol to which             of concentrated
 sulphuric acid had been added, and continued to add fresh
            of this mixture as long as any saline precipitate was
   ormed, and until the fluid had acquired a decidedly acid
 {tuitions
 taste. Some sulphate of potass was precipitated, and there re
 mained in the alcohol muriatic acid, lactic acid, sulphuric
 acid, and a minute portion of phosphoric acid, detached
 from some bone earth which had been held in solution. The
 acid liquor was filtered, and afterwards digested with car
 bonate of lead, which with the lactic acid affords a salt so
 luble in alcohol.     As soon as the mixture had acquired a
 sweetish taste, the three mineral acids bad fallen down in
 combination with the lead, and the lactic acid remained be
 hind, imperfectly saturated by a portion of     it, from which
it   was detached    by  means of sulphuretted hydrogen, and
 then evaporated to the consistence of   a   thick varnish, of a
 dark-brown colour and sharp acid taste, but altogether
.without smell.
     In order to freeit  from the animal matter which might
 remain combined with      it,
                             I     boiledit with mixture of
                                                 a             a
 large quantity of fresh lime and water, so that the animal
 substances were precipitated and destroyed            by
                                                        the lime.
 The lime became yellow brown, and the solution almost
 colourless, while the mass emitted      a   smell of soap lees,
 which disappeared as the boiling was continued. The fluid
 thus obtained was filtered and evaporated, until      agreat part

fef the superfluous     lime held in solution was precipitated.
 A small portion of it was then decomposed by oxalic acid,
 and carbonate of silver was dissolved in the uncombined
 lactic acid, until it was fully saturated- With the assistance
 of the lactate of silver thus obtained^ a further quantity of
 muriatic acid was separated from the lactate of lime, which
 was then decomposed by pure oxalic acid, free from nitric
 acid, taking care to leave it in such a state that neither the
 oxalic acid nor lime water afforded a precipitate.       It was
 then evaporated to dryness, and dissolved again in alcohol,
 a small portion of oxalate of lime, before retained in union
 with the acid, now remaining undissolved.          The alcohol
 was evaporated until the mass was no longer fluid while
 warm ; it became a brown clear transparent acid, which
was the lactic acid, free from all substances that we have
hitherto had reason to think likely to contaminate it.
   The lactic acid} thus purified, has a brown yellow coloui",
and a sharp sour taste, which is much weakened by dilut
ing it with water.      It is without smell in the cold, but
emits,  when   heated, a sharp sour smell, not unlike that of
sublimed oxalic acid.      It cannot be made to crystallize, and
does not exhibit the slightest appearance of a saline sub
stance, but dries into a thick and smooth varnish, which
Slowly attracts moisture from the air.      It is very easily so
luble in alcohol.     Heated in a gold spoon over the flame
of a candle, it first boils, and then its pungent acid smell
becomes very manifest, but extremely distinct from that of
the acetic acid ; afterwards it is charred, and has an empy-
reumatic, but by no means an animal smell. A porous
charcoal i? left behind^ which does not readily burn to
ashes.    When distilled, it gives an empyreumatic oil, wa
ter, empyreumatic vinegar, carbonic acid, and inflammable
gases.    With alkalis, earths, and metallic oxides, it affords
peculiar salts   5    and these are distinguished              by being soluble
in alcohol, and in general by not having the least disposi
tion to crystallize, but drying into a mass like gum, which
slowly becomes moist       the air.

 the precipitation of the superfluous base upon exposure to
 the air, it becomes pure and soluble in alcohol.
    Lactate of magnesia, evaporated to the consistence of
 a thin syrup, and left in a warm place, shoots into small
granular crystals.    When hastily evaporated to dryness, it
affords a gummy mass.        With regard to alcohol, its pro
perties resemble those of the two preceding salts.
    Ammoniaco-magnesian      lactate is obtained by mixing the
preceding salt with caustic ammonia, as long as any preci-
pitat on continues.     By spontaneous evaporation this salt
shoots into needle-shaped prisms, which are little coloured,
and do not change in the air.           I have once seen these
crystals form in the alcoholic extract of milk boiled to
dryness : but this is by no means a common occurrence.
   The lactate of silver is procured by dissolving the carr
bonate in the lactic acid.     The solution is of a light yellow
somewhat inclining to green, and has an unpleasant taste
of verdigris. When evaporated in a flat vessel, it dries
into a very transparent greenish yellow varnish, which hap
externally an unusual splendour like that of a looking-glass.
If  the evaporation is conducted in a deeper vessel, and with
a stronger heat, a part of the salt is decomposed, and re
mains brown from the reduction of the silver.         If this salt
is dissolved in water, no inconsiderable portion of the silver
is reduced and deposited, even when the salt has been
transparent ; and the concentrated          solution hns a fine
greenish yellow    colour, which   by  dilution  becomes yellow.
If we dissolve the oxide of silver in an impure acid, the salt
becomes brown, and more silver is revived during the eva
poration.
   The lactate of the protoxide of mercury is obtained when
the lactic acid is saturated with black oxidated mercury.
It has a light yellow colour, which disappears by means of
repeated solution and evaporation.         The salt exhibits acid
properties, deliquesces in the air, and is partially dissolved
in alcohol, but is at the same time decomposed, and de
posits carbonate of mercury, while the mixture acquires a
slight smell of ether. The lactic acid dissolves also the
red oxide of mercury, and gives with it a red gummy deli
quescent salt.     If it is left exposed to a warm and moist
atmosphere, it deposits, after the expiration of some weeks,
a light semi-crystalline powder, which I have not examined,
but which probably must be acetate of mercury.

 the carbonate oi lead, it becomes bfowner than before, but
•.cannot be fully saturated with the oxide; and we obtain an.
 arid salt, which does not crystallize, but dries into a syrup
 like brown mass, with a sweet austere taste. When a so
 lution of lactic acid in alcohol is digested with finely pow
 dered litharge, until the solution becomes sweet, and is
 then- slowly evaporated to the consistence of honey, the
 neutral lactate of lead crystallizes in small gravish grains,
 which may be rinsed with alcohol, to wash- off the viscid
mass that adheres to then, and will then appear as a gray
 granular salt, which when dry is light and silvery, like the
   recipitate thrown down by alcohol from a precipitated al-
    ali.   It   is not changed in the air ; treated                    with sulphuretted

f 48          Critical Observations  on  Dr. IVollaston'ii
 point out to your readers, what       I  consider to be the error
 of his reasoning, and the fallacy of his inference.
      In his description of the effect of the double convex lens
 in the common camera, page 90, he states the known effect
 of the images distant from the middle, or direct focus of
 the lens, being somewhat indistinct, on account of the
 plane of representation becoming, in distance, greater than
 the principal focus of the lens, and the oblique pencils of
  rays being refracted to a focus rather shorter than the prin
 cipal one.      "  On this account (he adds) it is in general best
 to place the lens at a distance somewhat less than that
  which would give most distinctness t<» the central images,
  because, in that case, a certain moderate extension is given
  to the field of view, from an adjustment better adapted to
  lateral objects, without materially impairing the brightness
  of those in the centre." The aberrations of the lens also
  add to the indistiuctness.
      The collateral indistinctness in our portable chest ca
  meras is but trivial and unimportant; and, in my opinion,
  the remedy, as above proposed, will be found by the artist
  to be worse than the defect, as the distinct and vivid central
  images will be vitiated, and the extreme images but very
  little improved.     The most perfect remedv is that which
  has been used by opticians in large cameras, for more than
   fifty years, of placing a bottom board, or wintered table,
   with a concave surface, proportioned to the focal distance
   of the lens; which, corresponding very nearly to the focus
  of all oblique refracted rays, exhibits universally the images
   with the greatest brilliancy and distinctness.         The exact
   curve   of the surface of this board or table should be that of
   a conic section ; but the concave one answers sufficiently
   well.    It is necessary for the reader unskilled in optics to
   know, that what opticians name the axis of a lens, is that
  imaginary line that is supposed to pass through its centre,
  is not subject to any refraction, and all other rays incident
. on its surface are refrangible,     in proportion to the angle
   they make with this axis; those rays impinging nearest the
   centre of the lens, and, with the least obliquity of position,
   are refracted with the most perfect images, ot with the least
   aberration, in double convex, plano-convex, and meniscus
   lenses.    The longitudinal aberration produces a focus short
   of the principal one, and the lateral aberration a confused
   lateral extension of the images blended with prismatic co
   lour. These aberrations increase directly with the diameter
   and thickness of the lens, and inversely with its focus.      In
   leqses of large diameter and «bort foci these aberrations

       stated Improvement    of the  Camera Obscura,    &c.    249
U-ill, by experiment,    be rendered very manifest,    and which
have been clearly demonstrated by that learned optician
Mr. Benjamin Martin, in his Elements of Optics, by Dr.
Smith, and by others.
    The subsequent paragraph, at page 91, describes Dr.
Wollaston-s proposed improvement: the substance, in his
own words, is as follows :
    " The lens is a meniscus, with the curvatures of its sur
faces about in the proportion of two to one, so placed that
its concavity is presented to the objects, and its convexity
towards the plane on which the images "are formed.             The
aperture    of the lens is four  inches, its focus  about twenty^
two. There is al?o a circular opening, two inches in dia
meter, placed at about one-eighth of the focal length of the
lens from its concave side, as the means of determining the
quantity and direction of rays that are to be transmitted.
    " The advantage of this construction over the common
camera obscura is such, that no one who makes the com
parison can doubt of its superiority ; but the causes of
this may require some explanation.           It has been already
observed, that by the common lens, any oblique pencil of
rays is brought to a focus at a distance less than that of the
principal focus. But in the construction above described,
the focal distance of oblique pencils is not merely as great,
but is greater than that of a direct pencil.        For since the
effect of the first surface is to occasion divergence of
parallel rays, and thereby to elongate the focus ultimately
produced by the second surface, and since the degree of that
divergence is increased by obliquity of incidence, the focal
length resulting from the combined action of both surfaces
will be greater than in the centre, if the incidence on the
 second surface be not so oblique as to increase the conver
gence.      On this account, the opening E is placed so much
nearer to the lens than the centre of its second surface,
that oblique rays Kf, after being refracted at the first sur
face, are transmitted through the lens nearly in the direction
of its shorter radius, and hence are. made to converge to 3,
 point so distant that the image (at     f)   fa;ls very nearly in.
 the same plane with that of an object centrally placed."
     The radii of curvatures for a meniscus of twenty-two
 inches focus, being as two to one, is not essential.          The
 theory of Dioptrics shows that the greater the proportion,
or the nearer that the radius of one side approaches to in
 finity or the side to a piano, the more perfect the lens will
 be.    Dr. Wollaston has not stated the diameter of the con*
yex lens, but the reader must suppose it to be four inches.

   ^50         Critical Observations on  Dr.   PFollas ton's
   like that of the meniscus    ; nor lias   he told the reader  what
   improvement      would be produced,    if he placed a   similar cir
   cular opening, or limited aperture, also over the convex
   lens.    I must, therefore, inform the reader; and he may
   himself prove it to be correct.       The diameter or aperture
   of four inches is too great for a lens of twenty-two inches
   focus, either double convex or meniscus lens, placed in a
   camera obscura ; as it transmits too much light, and pro
   duces too much aberration for the most distinct representa
   tion of the images, within the camera.             Dr. Wollaston
  therefore, no doubt, was obliged to correct this palpable
   defect, by a curtailment of the area of his lens no less than
   three-fourths of the whole, and the lens would have been
  more like one applied by a skilful optician, if he had at
   first inserted a lens of about two inches diameter.            The
  limited aperture therefore, it is evident, advantageously ex
  cludes rays, but has nothing to do with the determination
  of their direction.     Upon a fair comparison, the reader will
  not only doubt of the superiority of Dr. Wollaston-s ca
  mera, but he convinced of its absolute inferiority; for the
  double convex lens, under the same diameter and focus as
  the meniscus, has less spherical surface, and consequently
  less longitudinal and lateral aberration of the two.         Let us
 now advert to the transformation of the double convex lens
 lo become a meniscus with the same focus : by considering
 their figures in his diagrams, the reader will perceive, that
 as much as the upper surface of the convex has been incur-
 vated for a meniscus, so much the more has the convexity
 of the under side been augmented, to retain the original
 focus. The oblique pencils of rays first entering the me
niscus, or any part of its surface, are, from the immutable
 laws of refraction, refracted from the axis of the lens, con
trariwise, to the first direction of the convex, and, after
wards in their passage into air, by the increased inferior
convexity, refracted back towards the axis proportionally
more than by the under side of the double convex fo be
converged to the same focal distance; and all pencils of
rays that impinge on the surface in an oblique direction to
its axis, must be united the same as by the convex lens, at
a focus somewhat shorter than the principal focils from
direct rays.       The meniscus lens, in refractive property,
differs not from the double convex one.              The above ex
planation is agreeable to all writers on optics, and to cor
rect experiment.        In this meniscus it is not "    if  the inci
dence," &c. but, the incidence always is so oblique on the
second surface as to increase the convergence : and no kind
                                                                    of

  of opening, E, whatever          will  change Nature-s laws of
  refraction so    as to elongate    the focus, or to produce two
  different focuses in one lens ; and his previous explanation
  of " occasioning all pencils to pass as nearly as may be
  at right angles to the surfaces of the lens," page 90, is an
  irrelevancy in optics, and is the error of reasoning I for
  merly imputed to Dr. Wollaston in his spectacle glass.          It
  is the angle that the rays make with the axis of I tie lens, of
  whatever shape, that refraction is estimated from, as the
  science teaches us ; but not from the geometrical positions
  of pencils and surfaces. From the greater aberration that
  the meniscus possesses, the images formed by it will be less
 distinct, have less light, and be more distorted than bv the
 double convex lens.        It is from the extended lateral distor
  tion, and bringing the meniscus nearer to the plane than
 its exact focus, that I can assign a cause how Dr. Wollas
 ton could have fallen into the error: had he placed the
 concave side downwards, it would have been a better posi
 tion, the images would have been more defined and en
 lightened ; it was so applied in his spectacles, the convex
 side being next to the object ; but in neither case will the
 images be so perfect and vivid as by the double convex lens.
 TJie meniscus in a camera is not a new application ; several,
 some years back, were made, but not preferred.           I can re
 fer to a machine now existing with one.              I have caused
 two lenses to be ground, one a double convex, the other a
 meniscus, as Dr. Wollaston directs, of the same diameter,
 nearly four inches, and focus twenty-two inches, which ex
 perimentally yerily the correctness of my observations, and
 which any intelligent person may inspect, by application at
pur manufactory, 30, Holborn.
     The following quotations may, to some of your readers,
 better corroborate the truth of my remarks:

     "  If the side were concave (of a piano) so that the lens
 became a meniscus, there is no proportion of the radii or
 position of the lens, with regard to the radiant, but what
 will give the aberration greater than the plano-convex in its
 best position ; and since this was first observed by opti
 cians, the meniscus began to lose ground in the construc
 tion of optical instruments, and is now quite rejected."

    " When        parallel rays fall upon a plane side of a plano
convex glass, the aberration of the extreme ray, which is
\of    the thickness, is less than the like aberration caused
by any meniscus glass whose concave side is exposed to
the incident ray.
    "  When the said glasses have their convexities turned to
the incident rays, the aberration of the extreme ray in the
 plano-convex, which is now but {- of its thickness, is less
than the like aberration of any meniscus in this position.
    '< The best of all double concave             glasses has the semi-
diimeters of its first and second concavities as 1 to 6; and
consequently this is the best figure of a glass to help short
 sighted persons, as the double convex one of the like figure
 is the best tor spectacles."           Smith-s Optics, art. 66), 662,
 665.
     " For since a meniscus, unless the surfaces of it are pa
 rallel to one another, has the same effect either that a con
vex lens or a concave one would have, all the cases of di
 verging or converging rays that are refracted by it will be
 the same with those already explained in the instances of
 convex or concave lenses."            Rutherford-s Philosophy, vol. i.

Whence it necessarily follows, that that meniscus is best,
which approaches nearest in shape to a plano-convex lens."
Harris-s (of the Mint) Optics, 1776, page 67*.
    The sort of French angle of reduction that Dr. Wollas-
 ton has given to obtain geometrically, but nearly, the radii
 of a meniscus for a given focus, will be useless to the work
man, as he already knows by a very short arithmetical
operation, how to obtain exactly such radii in half a mi
 nute-s time, or a tenth part of the time necessary to con
 struct that problem : by Gunter-s sliding rule the time
would be still shorter.
    The combination of using two glasses in ordinary sim
ple microscopes, or hand magnifiers, to diminish the errors
arising from the spherical figure of one glass, was known
to Sir Isaac Newton» and to successive opticians. That late
   • So sensible have some optical glass-grinders been of the impracticability
and insufficiency of the meniscus glasses of very short foci for spectacles,

excellent optician Mr. Ramsden, by the combination in the
best position of two piano glasses, with their convex sideir
to each other, applied eye-pieces to his instruments with
great advantage, to read off divisions, of his circles, and
magnifv the wires- of his telescopes with clear definition at
the circumference of the field of view, the diameters of the
glasses being no larger than the aperture of the tube.         The
same principle has since been advantageously applied to
large object lenses for the lucernal microscope, by the late
 Mr. G. Adams and ourselves, where the diminution of
light was of less consequence than indistinctness of the
images.      In many cases the combination of two convex
lenses answers well ; but the combining of two similar
plano-convex lenses together, of superfluous diameter and
thickness, and for the greatest defect or aberration, in the
worst position to each other, and afterwards to palliate it
with a small aperture, as shown in fig. 4, (Plate IV.) is
such an anomaly or absurdity in optics as not to require
any serious comment on my part.              I shall only appeal to
the least experienced constructor of microscopes,          whether
he does not know that the substitution of a double convex
lens, of the diameter only of Dr. Wollaston's aperture, and
of the same focus, would produce an image infinitely more
perfect and vivid than the mutilated lens proposed by Dr.
Wollaston.
    From these remarks, I presume, there will be nothing to
apprehend from the attempt of Dr. Wollaston to depreciate
the excellence of the spectacles, camera obscuras, and mi
croscopes, which have been constructed by themost eminent
opticians of the day.

XXXIX. M. Montgolfier-s                  Process  for making White
       Lead.    By Messrs. Clement and Dksormes*.
The      celebrated Montgolfier-s process for the manufacture
of white lead, being one of great simplicity, ought to be
better known; and with th-.s view we have drawn up the
following description.
   The first operation consists in forming the lead into
sheets.     He found from experience, that by running the
melted metal on ticking, the sheets might be made of any
thinness, and varied at will, by inclining the frame a little

 fi54          Process for   making While Lead.
more or less; The surface then becomes a little irregular*-
and full of points ; which is favourable to the oxidation that
follows.     On this operation we need not insist, the process
being already well known.
    The second operation consists in oxidizing and carboni
zing the lead. The following is the disposition of the ap
paratus  : ,
    M. Montgolfier    had a common chemical reverberatory
furnace, in "which he burned charcoal.         The chimney on
its dome was four or five metres high, and, taking a hori
zontal direction, was introduced into an opening in the end
of a cask (which lay on its side) a little above its centre.
Some vinegar was put into the lower part of this cask, and
towards the centre of its other end was adjusted another
tube, equal to the chimney, and communicating by its
other extremity with a large rectangular case in which were
suspended the sheets of lead, alternately high and low, that
the air might pass entirely over their whole surface.      The
other end of this ease had an opening to allow the redun
dant gas to escape. The case had a cover, which could be re
moved at pleasure, for the purpose of placing the sheets of
lead on small pieces of wood prepared to receive them1.
    The air from the furnace, being thus made to pass through
the cask containing the vinegar, by communicating heat to
the vinegar carries it off in vapour, and passes with it
through the case containing the sheets of lead, which of
course are exposed to the action of acetous acid, of car
bonic acid from the combustion of the charcoal, and of
oxygen and azote, or atmospheric air which has escaped
the action of the fuel, and which may be augmented at
pleasure by leaving holes towards the middle of the chim
ney to admit fresh atmospheric air.        Thus are combined
all the circumstances necessary to the production of car
bonate of lead — oxygen, carbonic acid, vinegar, and heat.
    In a short time the sheets of lead become charged with
a coat of carbonate.      If their entire conversion into car
bonate at a single operation is not intended, they are with
drawn from the case, and suspended in water : the white
lead readily detaches itself, and falls to the bottom.   If the
sheets are left till wholly converted into carbonate, still
they must be put in water; and, besides, the deposit must
be levigated to separate the metallic particles which may
have escaped oxidation, and which would tarnish the white
colour*

advantages over London with respect to equability of cli
mate, if we judge of the climate of London from the ob
servations made at the apartments of the Royal Society
only: but in so central a situation, the changes must be
rendered much less sensible by the effect of the surrounding
buildings; and they appear to be considerably greater af
Gravesend, and greater still at Knightsbridge.      In this re
spect, too, Penzance retains its superiority even over Devon
shire. Lisbon seems to have a less variable temperature
than any part of Great Britain; and in Madeira, to judge
by the monthly variation only, the advantage in this re
spect appears to be still greater.
   The greatest possible equability of temperature seem*
however to be obtained in a sea voyage to a warm climate*
in which the variation seldom amounts to half as much as
in the most favourable situation on shore, even on a small
island ; and in pulmonary cases, the motion of a ship would
probably in general be rather beneficial than otherwise*
while the fatigue of travelling in bad roads, and the danger
of sleeping in damp beds, present an alternative by no
means favourable to a journey by land;
   The direction of the wind alone can seldom have any im
mediate effect on the salubrity of the climate, except by
variously modifying its temperature, according to the seas
or countries over which it blows. There is a method of
computing the mean direction of the wind, which does not
appear to have been hitherto adopted, but which affords a
very simple and intelligible result, although somewhat la
borious if extensively applied.    It consists in finding the
bearing and distance of a point, to which a light oody
would be carried by the wind in the course of the year,
supposing the velocity to be constant, when( its variations
have not been ascertained by observation.         It is obvious
that the bearing of such a point will show at once the mean
direction of the prevalent winds ; and its distance, com
pared with the effect of a constant wind for the same time,
as a unit, will indicate the degree in which those winds
have prevailed.

 Such westerly winds predominate,             is more than twice as
 great as in London : or, if We convert the measure into
 days, that the predominance amounted, in 1794, to 68 days
 for London, of a wind nearly W. S. W. and to 1 70 days
 for Dawlioh, of a wind a little to the south of w est.
    The variations of the climate of the same place, with re
 spect to mean temperature, are easily collected from the
 usual meteorological computations. Dr. Heberden has very
 Successfully combated the common opinion respecting the
 superior salubrity of cold winters ; it appears however that
 the winter which he particularly observed was more varia
ble, as well as colder, than usual.              Mr. Kirwan has at
tempted to account for the greater frequency of colds, which
he supposes to occur in spring and in autumn, by the greater
variability of the temperature at those seasons : but both
the fact and the explanation are very questionable ; for in
reality the variations of temperature, if estimated by the
total range of the thermometer* within the 64 hours, are
almost uniformly greatest in the hottest weather.              In Lon
don, the greatest variations of successive days at the same
hours in the morning are greatest in winter; in the after
noon, in summer ; and although the latter are a little greater
in April than in some of the succeeding months, the dif
                                                -
ference is by no means considerable.
    Of the empirical evidence, which may be Collected, re
specting the medical effects of different climates, the most
authentic is perhaps that which is derived from well regu
lated bills of mortality ; since these documents ought to
afford us a tolerable criterion of the general healthiness or
Unhealthiness of a place, from the proportion between the
annual deaths and the population, and at the same time
a pretty correct determination of the degrees in which dif
ferent diseases are fatal. Thus, when we find that in Stock
holm the annual deaths amount to -fa of the population,
in London to T1T, in the Pays de Vaud to                  and in some
villages  in   different   parts  of  Great  Britain  to  ^  onlyj we
cannot hesitate to consider a residence in the country as
generally more healthy, than in a metropolis similar to
either of those cities; although it cannot fairly be concluded
that the healthiness is precisely in the proportion which
might be inferred from this comparison, until we have con
sidered how far the effect of emigration to a great town may
influence the apparent mortality.            After the age of eight
or ten, the probable duration of life may be estimated
with sufficient accuracv, as Demoivre has very ingeniously
shown, by assuming that, of a certain number of persons

born together, one will die annually until the whole nuttf-.
ber is become extinct; and it is well known, that this
number may in common cases be snpposed to be 86 ; so
that at any given age, for instance 36, we may find the
probable duration of life by deducting it from S6, and
halving the remainder, which will give us 2.1) for the esti
mate required ; and if this law were universally true from
the time of birth, it is easy to show that the mortality in a
metropolis would alwavs be increased by the accession of
settlers ; so that if, for example, the whole population were
supplied by settlers at 20, and all children were sent to a
neighbouring village to be educated, the mortality of the
town, instead of T'-y, would become 1 : (43— 10) = -jV, and
that of the village would be 1 : (86—10) = TV; and that
any partial changes of a similar nature would cause a
smaller alteration of the apparent salubrity, in proportion to
their extent.     But the .mortality during infancy is actually
much greater than is assumed in the simple hypothesis of
Dcmoivre; and from this circumstance, as well as from the
frequent return of aged persons into the country, Dr. Price
has inferred that emigration in general has no tendency to
 increase the mortality of cities. In reality, the question de
 pends altogether upon the mortality which may be supposed
 to take place within the first year, which is often estimated
 at one third of the births; but nothing like this can well
 be expected to occur at any tolerably healthy place in the
 country ; and on the whole it does not appear that Dr.
.Price-s observations can by any means he admitted as con
 clusive. With respect to the evidence afforded by the pre
 valence of diseases, it has been observed by Dr. Gregorys
  that removing from a colder to a warmer climate maybe
 beneficial, even in those diseases to which the inhabitants
 of the warmer climate are subject ; but if they appeared to
  be equally or more subject to any disease than tl>e inhabi
  tants of the colder, there would surely be little encourage
  ment for the change: for instance, in a person supposed
  to be liable to diseases of the liver, it would surely be in
 judicious to undertake a voyage to a hot climate, with a
  view of avoiding the chance of taking cold, since the well
  known frequency of hepatitis, in such climates, would
  much more than counterbalance any prospect of advantage
   from the change.
      The frequency of consumptions is decidedly greater in
   cold than in hot climates, but not by any means in exact
   proportion to the depression of the mean temperature. The
   principal situations, that require to be compared with the

         An Essay     on the medical Effects of Climates.    259
Metropolis, as a standard, are the south of Epgland, the
south of Europe, the islands of the Mediterranean, Madeira,
and the West Indies.
     There do not appear tb be any precise accounts of the
proportionate mortality from consumption at any place
upon the southern coasts of this island, on a scale sufficiently
extensive for rhe comparison ; but there is abundant reason
to think that such a report would be greatly in favour of
the salubrity of these coasts, more so indeed than any
conclusions, that we should be at all authorised to form,
from such thermometrical observations           as have hitherto
been compared. A greater number of registers is still want
ing to obtain sufficient evidence for the inquiry : and it
would be desirable that some journal should be kept at one
of the Scilly islands, as a situation fully exposed to the in
fluence of the sea air ; for there can be little doubt that, for
equability of temperature, a very small island must have
 great advantages above every other situation on shore. But
 in the present state of our knowledge on this subject, al
though we are fully justified in recommending a residence hi
 Devonshire or Cornwall as advisable in a certain stage of
 consumption, it does not appear that any meteorological
 observations     will authorise us to represent the advantages,
 to be gained by such a residence, as by any means equiva
 lent to those which may be found in remoter situations ; nor
 that the empirical testimony, derived from accounts of the
 comparative prevalence of the disease, is at all so clear, or
  so firmly established, as to make up for the want of evidence
  of a great and decided superiority of the climate.
      In the south of Europe, the situations which have been
  most frequented are Lisbon> or some other part of the penin
  sula, the neighbourhood of Montpelier, and different part*
  of Italy. In Spain, and probably in Portugal, consumption
  js said to be not common, but by no means wholly un
  known ; and whether from accident, or from causes which
  are likely to have a constant operation, the climate of Portu
  gal has certainly failed, in a number of instances, of pro
  ducing any material benefit, where there has been apparently
   a very fair chance for the patient-s recovery.   With respect
   to the south of France, it is perhaps sufficient to remark,
   that the general proportion of deaths -from consumption at
   Marseilles is fully as great, as the greatest which has been
   observed in London, where, according to Dr. Heberden-s
   remark, its prevalence has of late years been so much in
   creased.    In Italy the disease appears to he decidedly les3
   frequent; and there is no reason to doubt but that, in the
                                  R2                      southern

 S60       An Essay   on the medical Effects    of Climates.
  southern    parts of that country, there may be situation*
 approaching     in their climates to those of" the neighbouring
  islands.
      It is however highlv probable that some of these islands
 possess very considerable advantages wver almost every part
  of the continents which surround them, at least as far as we
 can judge by their affording a climate of that description
  which seems to be the most desirable; for actual experience
 will not allow us to be too confident 6f obtaining success*
 even from a residence in these.         Dr. Domeier informs us,
 in his very interesting account off the island of Malta, that
 the thermometer seldom varies here more than 6° in the
 24 hours* or stands below 31°, even in the depth of winter;
 while in Lisbon he has seen ice, and both ice and snow in.
 Naples; besides that, in these two cities, the difference
 between day and night often amounts to 20°.           If an invalid
 leaves England in the middle of August, the voyage lasts
 about a month, and is often of itself highly beneficial, so
 that he arrives at Malta, in time to be fully prepared to be
further benefited by the mild winter : ii appears, however,
from the more particular account which Dr. Domeier else
where gives of the temperature, that it continues through
out October rather higher than is altogether desirable, being
seldom below 70° throughout that month ; and in a country
where there is scarcely any visible foliage, walls occupying
universally the place of hedges, this cannot be a matter of
perfect indifference.
    In Madeira, though the thermometer attached to a building
is seldom found below 34°, there are frequently cold winds,
snow, or more commonly something intermediate between
siiow and hail/ often falling on the mountains, at the height
of 1000 feet above the sea, and at still greater elevations
sometimes lying undissolved till July : and this imperfect
kind of hail falls occasionally even on the low grounds.
The island is probably a more agreeable residence than
Malta : but it seeiws very doubtful whether it possesses any
determinate advantage over it with respect to climate; and
it is not impossible, that some other islands in its neigh
bourhood ntay afford       a  greater equability of temperature.
We have however a more established experience of its be
neficial effects in pulmonary diseases than of almsot any
other situation. Dr. Adams says that, " in cases of tuber
cular or scrofulous consumption, if the patient does not
saunter away his time after you have advised him to leave
England, we can with certainty promise a cure,"              (Med*
Phys. Journ. Apr. 1800.)          This true English consumption

he thinks is not to be found in Madeira, while the catarrhal
Affection, which somewhat resembles                  though without
                                                       it,
purulent expectoration,    is not uncommon, and may be fatal
if neglected or improperly treated. Dr. Gourlay agrees
with Dr. Adams, in his report of the general benefit derived
from the climate of Madeira,               by consumptive person*
going to  it  from colder countries, to pass the winter in the
island, and of the frequency of catarrhal affections among
the inhabitants; but he strongly insists that genuine con
sumption      isalso very common and very fatal.             There can
however be little doubt, from the concurrent testimony of
 the majority of observers, thnt the climate of Madeira                      is
 extremely salubrious, and that consumptions, though they
 mav sometimes occur, are comparatively rare.
     In the Vy^est Indies, it   is
                                 agreed         by
                                               all authors, that eon•-
 sumptive affections are almost unknown, and that scrofula
 in all its forms uncommon while the inhabitants of the
                   is                ;
 West Indies, coming into        a colder climate, are peculiarly
 liable to the attacks of these diseases. Dr. Hunter, how*
 ever, observes, that notwithstanding this exemption in fa
 vour of the natives of the West Indies,            residence in this
                                                       a
 climate appeared to him to be of no manner of advantage
 to persons who were already affected                        by
                                                        incipient con-
  Sumptions   when   they  arrived  there.     We    cannot   doubt the
  accuracy of this evidence,     as  far as regards the facts which
  came immediately under Dr. Hunter-s observation                  they

  Jamaica, .or in some other of the West India islands, tpr

  the patient must be exposed during the voyage, must pre
   sent every advantage, towards the recovery of consumptive      a
   person, that climate alone can possibly bestow.
      In other diseases, the effects of climate are perhaps less
 exclusively beneficial; although     appears that gouty per

 remark, in an observation recorded by Dr. Carvick, re
 specting the influenza of 1803.
                                      " One of the most open
 and exposed of the buildings on Clifton h.ll is Richmond
 terrace, which forms three sides of a parallelogram, front
 ing respectively the east, south, and west ; on the east side,                      .
 riot one family, and scarcely an individual, escaped the
 complaint ; while on the south side, a great majority, both
 of persons and families, in all other respects similarly cir
cumstanced, escaped it entirely."       Such facts as these are
among the few which afford solid grounds for medical rea
soning ; and they deserve the more attention, as they relate
to circumstances, of continual occurrence, and of perpetual
influence on our health and comfort; and in proportion as
both the medical and the meteorological      sciences become
founded on a firmer basis, it cannot be doubted that their
beneficial effects will be more and more experienced, as
well in the preservation of health, as in the treatment and
cure of diseases.

    It is obvious, that those counties which contain large
manufacturing towns exhibit a mortality wholly indepen
dent of their climate, as is exemplified in the case of War
wickshire ; while the natural salubrity of others, for in
stance Cornwall, is probably rendered more conspicuous
by their exemption from sedentary employments.
  XLI.    On the Aurora Borealis,         By Mr. B- M. Forster.
                          To  Mr, Tilloch,
Sir, — Being       desirous   of calling the attention of mete
orologists and other       persons to that beautiful meteor the
aurora borealis, or northern lights, in order that they may
observe it accurately, I beg the insertion of the following
remarks in your Magazine as soon as may be convenient.
    For several years past, these lights have made their ap
pearance very seldom in this part of the island. Whether
they have been seen as usual in the more northern counties
I  wish to be informed. They are, I understand, very brilliant
at times in the Shetland       islands, where they are called the
Merry     Dancers,  from   their  rapidity of motion.
    The celebrated Dr. Halley remarks of the aurora borealis
as   follows (see Phil. Trans. Mott-s Abridgement, vol. ii.)    :
 »
    '' This  was the only sort of meteor I had not as yet
seen, and of which I began to despair, since it is certain it
hath not happened to any remarkable degree in this part of
England since I was bom ; nor is the like recorded in the
English annals since the year of our Lord 1574, that is
above one hundred and forty years ago, in the reign of
queen Elizabeth."
    Jn the same paper,     Halley afterwards mentions   " one   of
                                   R.4                       small

November 1707 ;" also " one of short duration ,seen near
London, a little before midnight, between the ninth and
tenth of August i 708,"
   It   is,
         Ibelieve, the opinion of some people, that this phae-
nomenon did not appear            England until the 6th of
                                              in
March 1716, when           was very remarkable;
                                    it              particular            a
account of which      jriven   the
                               is   paper of
                                         in  Dr. Hallev  above
mentioned. Since that period          has been frequently ob
                                                   it

            I
   It  occurred to me some time ago, that having had             good          a
deal   of lightning lately, and very little of the aurora bo
 realis, the disappearance of the one and appearance of
 the other might have some connection            and      find
                                                            ;      theI           in
 Gentleman-s Magazine fdr January 1751 the same idea.
 Mention        there made of an aurora boreaTis which was
                 is
 seen   inSouth Carolina in April 1750, and that there had
 been but very little thunder and lightning for several
 months and an observation made, that had there been as
            ;
 much as usual, they would not have been witnesses of the.
 aurora borealis       that part of the world.
                          in
*
     This appearance         generally, and
                                    is           my opinion with
                                                            in
 good reason, imagined to be occasioned                         by
                                                    the electric fluid
 darting about in the atmosphere.           Dr. Halley suspected                       it
 was caused           by
                      magnetical effluvia; for he remarks that
 this ** subtile matter freely pervading the pores of the earth,
 and entering into         near its southern pole, may pass out
                               it
 again   into    the  ether at the same distance from the
 northern;" and that "this matter may,             the concourse of

 several causes very rarely coincident, and to us as yet un
 known, be capable of producing small degree of light,  a
perhaps from the greater density of the matter, or the
 greater velocity of its motion, after the same manner as the
effluvia of electric bodies               by
                                        strong and quick friction

have    agreat affinity.'*
    Dalton in his Meteorological Essays, published some
years ago,       if mistake not, remarks that the beams of the
                      I
aurora lie in the same direction as the magnetic needle
 points, and that when they form canopy of light, the ver

know whether this notion            original or not, but
                                         is                       well        it

worth the attention of philosophers.           In the Gentleman's
Magazine for January 1750,             an account of remarkable
                                              is                      a
aurora borealis seen in Northamptonshire, the coruscations
of which         "
               met not in the zenith, but                        in
                                                         point about  a

      On Bread made from Wheat Flour and Potatoes.                      96-5
nineteen degrees southward in the meridian."   The dip of
the magnetic needle being about 72 degrees, the southern
end would consequently be inclined from the zenith 13
degrees.
    This very near coincidence of situation as to altitude
seems in some degree to strengthen Dalton-s idea. What
the horizontal position of the needle was in the year 1750,
I do not know ; but the expression " in the meridian" may
not mean exactly so.       I do not mean to offer an opinion
on the connection between electricity and magnetism, but
much wish for accurate statements of facts respecting
the aurora.    It is much to be wished that journals of the
variation or declination of the magnetic needle were kept
in various places, and transmitted to some periodical publi
cation. The subject of magnetism is not in my opinion
sufficiently attended to by philosophers.      A good variation
needle, as it is called, is not, I believe, a very expensive in
 strument, and might no doubt in many places be fixed to
 lerably secure from being shaken.         Might not a dipping
needle be constructed also, at a moderate expense, sufficiently
exact for eeneral use?                                      s
    Would not the terms horizontal magnetic needle and
 vertical magnetic needle be preferable to variation and
 dipping needle ? When the situation (or direction) of the
 magnetic needle is spoken of, the expression should in
 clude both the horizontal and vertical situation, that       the    is,
 azimuth   ; and depression,     we speak of the northern end,
                                  if

verv great advantage.    I had many prejudices to encounter
in the first attempts I made, and I think great merit is due

    Sixteen pounds of potatoes were washed, and when pared
 weighed twelve pounds.         After boiling they weighed thir
 teen pounds, and       were  then   mixed, whilst warm, with
 twenty-six pounds of flour: the potatoes were bruised as
 fine as possible, and half      pound of yeast added.

       Mr. Way-s bread had been sent from Bridport Harbour
  to the Society on the 10th of March 1812; and had been
   examined and tasted at sundry times by members of the
  Society, from the 12th to the 26th of March, so that the
   greatest part of the loaf had been eaten. What remained, on
   she 26th, had every appearance of bread made wholly from
   wheaten flour well fermented, and well tasted, without
   being in the least mouldy or stale, though it had been
  baked fourteen days.          It appeared to the Committee to be
   a very successful mode of making bread, and that it might

tend to lessen the consumption             of flour, an object of con»

communication may prove useful to many families, we
have given it a place in our pages.     We have only to add,
that so far as this mired bread may be considered as pre
ferable to that from flour, we have reason to believe that
many of the good inhabitants of London, and its vicinity,
have for a considerable time been enjoying the benefit — to
the great emolument of many honest bakers.
   If the absurd practice of regulating the price of bread
must be continued, would it not he equitable that the ma
gistrates, in fixing the assize, should in future be directed,
by law, to take into their consideration       not merely the
market price of flour, but also of potatoes ? — Edit.

    Cor. 1. We learn, from the preceding analysis, that the
figure  of the solid is independent of the law of density, in
hit cases.    This leads me to observe, that although Mr.
Plavfair, in the Edinburgh Transactions, restricts his pro
blem to the case of homogeneity, there appears to be no
thing in his ingenious manner of treating the subject*
which renders such a supposition necessary.                    For, when
we are directed to take a small portion of matter from a
point at C, and place it at another point D, it may be con
ceived to be contracted or dilated, at this latter point, as
any Variable law of density may require, without making
                                                                •
any difference in the reasoning, or in the result.
    Cor. 2. If we suppose <p(x,y, z) to be a function of the
distance, or of the form <p(x1+y1 + zi), equation (1) takes
the form x = ^>{x1 +y1 + zi), which is the general equation
of solids of revolution: see Monge " Application," &c.
p. 18.
                           Scholium.
   Although it appears from what has been shown, that
when the force is a function of the distance, the solid of
greatest attraction must be a solid of revolution; yet the
converse is by no means true ; — that the particles must ne
cessarily act with a force, which- is some function of the
distance, in order that the solid of greatest attraction may
be a solid of revolution.          Thus, if we want the figure
of the solid when the force, or &(x, y.x) = — £H£±5L

yx— z1) = 0, evidently the equation of a solid of revolution
round the axis of x. Let a be the value of x when y and
* =» 0, then we have C =                  and by substituting              this
                                                                         value

value the equation becomes ax—              x*= ~       (y%   +        whictt
belongs      to an ellipsoid     of revolution, or      a sphere   if d=a.
Again, if ${x,y,%)            ==                       we «nd the        solid

    It is required to solve the reverse problem, or to find the
force when the figure of the solid of greatest attraction is
given.
    By equation (l) X = ~^r~~y— : Suppose then, that^
from the nature of the given solid, x= F(x,y,z), we have
by making these values              equal  F(x, y, z) =       —               >
whence,       <j)(x, y, z) =                   j
                                  .^.y,.^
    Cor. It is plain that we may give F(x, y, z) a variety
of forms for the same solid j and, consequently, that there
may be various laws of force, Q(x, y, z), which give the
same solid for the solid of greatest attraction.
    If the solid be of revolution, there will be one of these
laws of force which is a function of the distance* ; and to
the finding this law I shall confine myself in the following
examples.
    Ex. l. What function of the distance must the law of
force be, when the solid of greatest attraction is an ellip
soid of revolution, whose axis of revolution coincides with
that of x, and terminates at the attracted point m ?
    Let a be this axis, b the other, the equation of the super
ficies is    ~ {ax— x*)=z y*+z*;          or, putting Dts±xt+y*+x1i

    If  the spheroid be oblong, this law              of force is is always

     But a portion of an oblong spheroid thus situated, may

 provided there be a distance greater than b between the

   the cylinder in Viviani's celebrated problem,- is a solid of
   greatest attraction of this kind.
      Ex. 3. The surface still being a sphere, if the attracted
   point, instead of being at the centre, is at the extremity of

   curve is  .        —     + Q   == 0, or x    ==  C {x*+ y*)1; which
  is the same curve which generates, by its revolution, the
  solid of greatest attraction, when the force is inversely as
  the cube of the distance.        Vide Ed. Trans, vol. vi. p. ao3.
      In the first proposition, the mass of the solid was sup

  of that solid is independent of the density: but if it is the
  volume, instead of the mass, that is given, the case will be
  different.

     If the density is constant, this, of course, enters into the
 first proposition ; but, in other cases, there may be an in
finite variety of functions of the distance which represent
ing the law of force, will give the same solid of greatest
attraction ; provided a suitable density be supposed.
     Ex. 1. What laws of force and density will give the
 solid of "greatest attraction, of this kind, a sphere?             It is
plain    we    have  only  to  satisfy   the   equation   $(x, y, z) x

   about one shilling the pint, and add thereto one pint of
   clear lime, water, made from pouring boiling water on lumps
   of chalk lime in a close vessel till fully saturated : when the
   lime water becomes clear, it is proper to be added to the oil
   as above mentioned, and on iheir being stirred together
    they will form a thick oily mixture, or emulsion, proper to
    apply upon the moulds.
       In forming the side or jamb of a chimney-piece, the
   mould is to be first half filled with the sand-lime and plaster
   composition, then two wires wrapped round with a thin
   layer of hemp, and which wires are nearly the length of
   the piece to be moulded, are to be placed in parallel lines,
   lengthways, in the mixture or composition in the mould,
   and afterwards the mould is filled up with more of the com
   position, and if there is any superfluous quantity, it is to be
   struck off with a piece of flat board.
      The lid or top part of the mould is to be then placed
   upon it, and the whole subjected t6 a strong pressure from
   weighted levers or a screw press.         The composition is to
   remain under this pressure for twenty or thirty minutes ;
   the precise time necessary may be known, from examining
   a small specimen of the composition reserved purposely to
   determine the time it requires to harden and set firm.
      The sides of the mould are to be held together by iron
   clamps and wedges.
      The wires above mentioned answer a double purpose, by
   giving strength to the jambs, and retaining the whole mass
   together in case it should at any time be cracked by ac
   cident.
      The chimney-pieces may be made either plain or fluted,
  according to the mould, and when moulded, they are fi
  nished off by rubbing them over with alum water, and
  smoothing them with a trowel and a little wet plaster of
  Paris.
      A common plain chimney piece of this composition is
   sold at only seven shillings, and a reeded one at twenty-
  eight shillings, completely fitted up.

                      IX. Muriate of Lead.
   1 .)  Five    grammes      of yellow oxide of lead were dissolved
in muriatic     aTcid   in a glass flask ; the product dried and
melted in the flask, was 6- 187 gr. of muriate of lead.
   2. ) Ten gr. of the yellow oxide afforded in a similar ex
periment 12-30: during the fusion, a little horn lead flew
off with a visible vapour, the smell of which was not acrd,
but like that which is afforded by liquid metallic salts.
Hence it follows that the muriate of lead consists oi 81 or
80-82 of oxide and 19 or 19- 18 of acid. :
   3. ) Five gr. of muriate o. lead, fused in a red heat, were
dissolved in water impregnated with a little nitric acid, and
precipitated by nitrate of silver.            The precipitate, when
fused, weighed 5- 1 1 gr. ; and this gives 19-13 of acid in
 100 of the muriate of lead.
   4. ) The experiment was repeated, and afforded 5-09 of
muriate of silver; whence we have 19 04 of acid.
   According to these experiments, the muriate of lead con
sists of        Muriatic acid 19-18                 100-0
            •   Ox;deoflead           80-82         4il-4
   If   we calculate from the component parts of the sulphate
of baryta, the sulphate of the protoxide of lead, and the
muriate of baryta, we have 19* : 230 = 288 : 4i6 2. The
calculation differs by 5-2 from the experiment ; and al
though I have frequently repeated the processes, I have not
been able to detect the source of the error.             It, according
to one of the experiments, we take 193 for the baryta by
which 100 parts of sulphuric acid are saturated, we st^ll
have only 419 «f oxide of lead to 100 of muriatic acid.
The oxide, which saturates 100 parts of muriatic acid, con

 87<5                  On definite Proportions.
 tains, according to the experiment, 30-49, and according-
 to the calculation, 30-1 of oxygen.            Since 100 parts of
 muriatic acid take up the same quantity o-f oxygen in the
 oxide of lead as in the two degrees of oxidation of copper,
 the proposition already laid down is further confirmed by
 this agreement.
     I must however here confess the existence of an irregu
 larity, which I cannot yet explain, but which supposes an
 inaccuracy in some of those experiments which I thought
 the most unexceptionable.
     A hundred parts of muriatic acid are saturated by 434-8
 of oxide of nilver, which contain 3 1 "9 of oxygen. Now,
 since the analyses of the oxide and the muriate of lead,
 and especially that of the muriate of silver, seem to be of
 such a nature as to be susceptible of accuracy, and since
 they are also confirmed by other tests which serve as checks
 to verify them, I am utterly unable to discover on what the
 principal error can possibly depend.         Does the salt of silver
 contain water ? I have melted it in a red heat, without
 any loss of weight.       Is the oxygen of the lead assumed be
 low the truth ? I refer to the experiments on the sulphate
of lead, the second of which was occasioned precisely by
 this question ; here it appeared that 100 parts of lead, with
sulphuric acid, afforded exactly as much sulphate as 107-8
of the oxide of lead. Or, is the analysis of the muriate of
lead inaccurate 5 This supposition is contradicted both by
 the result of the calculation, which agrees sufficiently well
 with the analysis, and by that of the precipitation with
nitrate of silver.     The difference of 1-41 of oxygen between
 the oxides of lead and of silver is indeed not very consider
able ; but it must depend on some unknown circumstance.
                      X. Ikon and Sulphur.
    It  has long ago been demonstrated by Proust, that several
metals may be combined with sulphur in two proportions,
a maximum and a minimum.                It appeared to me to be in
teresting to examine, how far inflammable bodies observe
the same laws in their combinations with each other, a*
with oxygen.        For this purpose I chose the sulphuiet of
iron,   as  being most easily subjected to analysis.
               A.  Sulphuret    of Iron  at a Minimum.
    I  mixed one part    of pure iron, very nearly free from car
bon, which had       been  rolled out to the thickness of a leaf,
•with   three of pure sulphur, and heated them in a small
glass   retort  with a receiver luted to it. When the sulphur
                                                                had

"had been distilled over, I ignited the mass, and as soon at
the gas in the bulb of the retort had lost its yellow colour,
I suffered the apparatus to eool.. The mass had retained
the form of the plate of iron ; and when it was touched,
6onie pretty thick shining scales fell off from the iron on
which the sulphur had not acted. These scales had a cry
stalline fracture and a metallic appearance.   In their entire
state they were not attracted by the magnet, but they be
came magnetic when pulverised.
   Two grammes of these scales, in large and regular pieces,
were digested with aqua regia, till nothing remained un
dissolved, and the solution was precipitated by muriate of
baryta.    The precipitate afforded 5-38 gr. of ignited sul
phate of barvu.
   According to the experiments above related, 100 parts of
sulphate of baryta contain 34 of sulphuric acid, and in this
J 3-795 of sulphur; so that 5-38 gr. give "742 of sulphur,
that      is,
          37-  percent, of the weight of the sulpburet of
                1
iron.   (Mr. Hatchett, who has examined the magnetical
pvrites, makes     36-9

                              :
lysis, and the data assumed for his computations are such,
that     can only consider our agreement, in this and the
         I
following analysis, as perfectly accidental.)
   The liquid to which the muriate of baryta had been added
was freed from the baryta              by
                                 sulphuric acid, and then de
composed         by
               caustic ammonia. The oxide, after ignition,
weighed lM92.gr. which gives 1-26 of iron.       Here then                  is
an excess of -002 gr. [one thirtieth of grain,] which may
                                                     a
have depended on the supposition of too great      proportion
of sulphur in the sulphuric acid, or perhaps on slight in        a a
accuracy        of the weights employed.                 If   we compute   the
quantity of sulphur from that of the iron,     will appear     it
that 100 parts of iron took up 58-73 of sulphur; so that
the sulphuret of iron at  minimum consists of
                                  a
                Sulphur 37           58-73
                 Iron      63...    lOO'OO
   If on the contrary we deduce the proportions from the
quantity of sulphur determined, we shall have 56-S8 of sul
phur for 100 of iron, and 100 of the sulphuret will contain
37-1 of sulphur and 62    of iron.9

     Jn
      order to determine the proportions of this compound,
I reduced again some of the scales to    fine powder, mixed
                                                     a
them with finely pounded sulphur, and distilled the mixture
in   small glass retort with
     a                         very gentle heat, as long at
                                           a
                                      S    3                               any

 any sulphur passed over.     The mass, when taken out, was
 still in the form of a. powder, only that its colour was
 somewhat brighter, and it was still partly attracted by the
 magnet. It was not however soluble in muriatic acid.
 Two grammes of it were burnt in an open platina crucible,
 and left 1 -4 gr. of red oxide of iron not at all magnetic,
 answering to -97 of metallic iron. Consequently the re
 maining 103 gr. was sulphur; and 100 parts of iron had
 taken up 106-5 of sulphur.        Since however the pyrites,
 which was formed, v as still partly magnetical, I conjec
 tured that it somewhat resembled the red oxide, which by
 top strong ignition has been reduced in a slight degree to
 the state of a protoxide, and for this reason is again sub
jected to the influence of the magnet.
    I therefore distilled 20 gr. of very pure native pyrites in
 a small glass retort with a receiver.     At first a trace of
moisture passed over, which, when the experiment was con
 cluded, had assumed the form of oily drops adhering to the
receiver, and which I took for concentrated sulphuric acid;
but by dilution with water this fluid became milk white, and
not at all acid.     It was therefore neither wattr nor sul
phuric acid.     I could not afford this substance any further
attention ; perhaps it was the alcohol of sulphur. The
mass left in the retort was exposed for some time to igni
tion ; it had lost 4-4 gr. of sulphur, which was collected in
the neck of the retort and in the receiver. Of the remaining
15-6 gr., five were dissolved in nitric acid : these being
evaporated to dryness, a. a! ignited, in a platina crucible,
left 4-3 .of red oxide, which was not at all magnetical.
Dissolved in muriatic acid, it left "02 of silica.  Hence we
have 13-416 of red pxide for the whole mass, or deducting
•0625 for silica, 13-35, answering to 0-258 of metallic iron.
There remain therefore 10-7 gr. for the sulphur.       Conse
quently 100 parts of iron had been combined with 115"5
of sulphur; that    is,  with nearly twice the quantitv which
had been found in the sulphuret at    a  minimum.
 I.  repeated the experiment with some select pieces of an
other specimen of pyrites.      Itwas very finely powdered,
roasted in the muffle of an assaying furnace, in      adish  of
platina, and   in the mean time occasionallv stirred with    a
hook of the same metal.      Ten grammes of pyrites afforded
me 6"67 of red oxide, not in the least magnetical, leaving
•0,Z of silica when  dissolved  inthe muriatic acid,    These
6/6 gr. of red oxide indicate 4-5775 gr. of pure iron, which,
added to the quantitv of silica, and subtracted from the
whole weight, leaves 5-3525 for the sulphur. Consequently

                        On definite Proportions.                   279
   100 parts  of iron were combined with 117 of sulphur, and
  sulphuret of iron at a maximum [or super-sulphuret                of
  iron] consists of
                   Iron         46-08          100
                   Sulphur      53-92          117
     The combination of 100 parts of iron with 58| of sul
  phur in the former and in the latter case 117"2, that is
  •3 parts less than a double portion, indicates        some slight
  inaccuracy in one of      the  experiments.    If  we  assume that
  the silica, found in the pyrites, existed in a metallic state,
 which is a very probable supposition, we must calculate on
  •04 only of the base, or of silicium ; and the sulphur com/7
 bined with 100 parts of iron will be 1 17-5, that is precisely
 according to the calculation ; neglecting, at least, the small
 quantity of sulphur which may have been combined with
 the silicium, if these bodies have any affinity for each
 other.
     It may be considered as tolerably well established, that
 no other combinations take place between iron and sulphur
 than the two which are here examined.           Yet we often find,
 in preparing the artificial pyrites, products which are dif
 ferently constituted. This was the case, for example, in
 my analysis of sulphuretted hydrogen (Afh. ii. 86.)             The
 sulphuretted    iron, which   I  then  employed   for obtaining the
gas,   contained    36$  of sulphur   to 100  of iron.    In general,
 I have found in the preparation of the sulphuret at a maxi
mum by ignition in close vessels, that when the mass was not
brought into fusion, the iron always retained a greater quan
tity of sulphur, than the sulphuret at a minimum contains.
In two different experiments, I found this excess of sulphur
pretty constant ; in one, 100 parts of iron had retained 68-6,
in another, 68-2 of sulphur. If in the preparation of the
sulphuret we employ iron in excess, a portion of the metal
is dissolved by the sulphuret, and the solution may vary by
imperceptible gradations, like that of a salt in water.             If
this were not the case, the whole doctrine, which is sup
ported by so many experiments, must be merely a ground
less imagination.       [The solubility of a metal and its oxides
in the sulphuret, in all proportions, was observed by Proust
in his experiments
respect to antimony. — Gilbert.']
    Wc have seen that the sulphuret of lead, and in all pro*
bability that of copper also, become neutral salts by oxy-
genization.      It is now to be inquired if the same is true of
the sulphuret of iron.                                     . . . .

   Some crystallized sulphate of iron, which had been obi
tained by dissolving sulphuret of iron in dilute sulphuric
acid, was reduced to a coarse powder, first washed with
water, then digested with a little spirit of wine, in order
to separate the superfluous sulphuric acid, and dried
with blotting paper. That which had crumbled having
been rubbed and blown off, 10 gr. of this salt were ex
posed in a glass retort to a high temperature, short of
jgnition.    They lost 4-63 gr. of water.      I was in hopes
that, if all the water were thus driren away, I should
be able to compute, from the analysis of the dry salt, the
quantity of oxygen in the protoxide which had entered into
combination with the acid; but having repeated the ex
periment several times with different results, I found that
a part of the acid escaped with the last portions of the, wa.-»
ter, being reduced to the staie of sulphurous acid.
    1. ) Nine grammes of the crystallized and washed salt
were dissolved in water, and mixed with the nitric acid in
great excess, being boiled with it until the protoxide was
fully oxidated : muriate of baryta was then added : the pre-?
cipitate when washed and ignited weighed 7-685 gr., con-»
tainipg 2o-13 of sulphuric acid, or 1-06 gr. of sulphur.
Sulphuric acid was added, to throw «Jown the superfluous
baryta, and then caustic ammonia, which afforded a preci
pitate of 2-59 gr. of red oxide of iron, containing I 796 of
                                                        •
the metal.     Consequently 100 parts of iron had been com
bined with 59 of sulphur.
    2. ) Ten gr. of sulphate of iron, treated in the same way,
afforded 8 5 of ignited sulphate of baryta, and 2-87 gr. of
oxide of iron. The former corresponds to 2-89 grains of
sulphuric acid, or 1'172 of sulphur; the latter to 1-99 of
iron.     Consequently 100 parts of iron had taken up 58-9
of sulphur.
    3. ) In both these experiments, notwithstanding the ex
cess of acid, the sulphate of baryta had attracted a portion
of the oxide of iron, which gave it a yellowish tinge after
ignition ; I therefore varied the process, so as to separate
first the iron and then the acid.    Ten grammes of sulphate
of iron afforded in this manner 2-935 of red oxide of iron,
and 8-7 of sulphate of baryta: hence we have 2-055 gr. of
iron, 2-958 of sulphuric acid, and 1-997 of sulphur; and 100
parts of iron again appear to be united to 58-9 of sulphur.
   These experiments therefore completely demonstrate, that

                        On definite Proportions.                  281
in the sulphate of the protoxide of iron, the sulphur and
iron are in the same proportion as the sulphuret at a mi
nimum.
     The slight excess of M5 of sulphur undoubtedly depend*
on some trifling error in the experiments, or in the data;
perhaps, for instance, from having assumed a little too
much sulphur in the sulphate of baryta.
     Thenard has described six different combinations of iron
with the sulphuric acid, {Ann. Ch. lvi. 5cJ.) and among
 them a supersulphate of the protoxide.             It is obtained by
adding concentrated sulphuric acid to a solution of neutral
 sulphate of the protoxide.        Although I had often seen salts
 precipitaied from their solutions by acids, without receiving
 an excess     of acid, for instance the muriates of baryta and
 of copper by the muriatic acid, yet T determined to examine
 the fact more accurately.           The fine grained white salt,
 which I obtained in this manner, was freed from the acid
 which adhered to it by water and spirit of wine, then dried,
 dissolved, and decomposed.           It appeared to contain exactly
 the same proportions of its component parts, as the neutral
 salt; and when it was evaporated in a retort, it afforded
 crystals of the same kind.         Consequently Thenard-s super-
 sulphate   is  nothing more than the neutral salt, its whiteness
 depending onlv on the state of powder in which it is thrown
 down by the acid.         Here therefore we could not expect to
 find a combination answering to the sulphuret at a maxi
 mum.
     Thenard, who considers         the neutral salt which      I have
 examined as acidulated, although in a lower degree than
 that which is thrown down by the acid, describes a neutral
 sulphate of an emerald green colour, which is obtained
 when dilute acid is boiled with an excess of iron .filings.
 The sulphate, which I employed in my analysis, had been
 boiled with iron filings as long as there was any action be
 tween them, and yet it was by no means this emerald green
  salt.
      I now kept a solution of neutral sulphate of the protoxide
  of iron in a gentle beat for several days in an open vessel,
  and as it evaporated, I added water gradually.-         During this
  operation a yellow powder -was precipitated.               The salt
  which,  was   left at  last crystallized  in oblique rhombs, and
  had an emerald colour.         A part of this salt I tookout; the
  remainder I boiled with nitric acid, and afterwards exposed
  it in a platina crucible to a heat approaching to ignition.
  This mass, freed from nitric acid, was dissolved in water;
  it deposited a red powder, which I afterwards found to be
                                                                  sub

  subsulphate of the oxide.        The solution was evaporated to
  drvness, and the remainder was heated in a platina cruci
 ble, in order to expel all the water.         It weighed 57 gr.
 When dissolved in water, it deposited some subsalt, of
 which the acid had been driven away with the water of
 crystallization, and which, after ignition, weighed -24 gr.
 The solution in water was decomposed by adding to it first
 caustic ammonia, and th^n muriate of baryta.              The red
 oxide after ignition weighed 2" 16, answering to 1-498 gr.
 of pure iron: the salt of baryta 9-7 gr. which contained
 3-3 of sulphuric acid, or 1-335 of sulphur.          Consequently
  100 parts of iron had been united with 89 of sulphur, that
 is, with half as much more, within -5, as is contained in
 the sulphuret at a minimum.          This gives for 100 parts of
 sulphuric  acid 65-46    of  oxide   of iron, containing 20- I of
 oxygen, or again, within "19, the same quantity as we have
 already found to be appropriated to the base uniting with
 100 parts of sulphuric acid. According to this analysis, the
 neutral sulphate of the oxide of iron consists of
              Sulphuric acid 60 44               100-0
              Oxide  of  iron      59-56          65-5
    The yellow powder, which was deposited by the neutral
 sulphate of the protoxide during the digestion in an open
 vessel, which is considered as a neutralised oxide by The-
nard, is a subsulphate.         I placed it on a filter, washed it
very carefully,   and   dissolved it,    while still moist, in pure
muriatic acid,   the solution being effected without difficulty,
although the same salt when dry could only be dissolved
by long boiling.     The caustic ammonia threw down oxide
which weighed -855 gr. after ignition         ;    the muriate of
baryta -Q45 of sulphate of baryta, weighed with the same
precaution, implying "321 of sulphuric acid.                Conse
quently 100 parts of sulphuric acid were here combined
with 266 of oxide of iron, and the sulsalt consists of
             Sulphuric acid       2J-33            100
             Oxide of iron        72-67            266
    Since 100 parts of sulphuric acid neutralise 65-5 of
oxide of iron, and in the subsalt take up 266 parts, that       is
four times as much,   it   is evident that the same law prevails
here as with regard to the subsalts of copper.           This gives
22 parts of sulphur for 100 of iron, which indeed          is   one
quarter of the quantity of sulphur contained in the neutral
salt of the oxide, but stands in no simple relation to the
quantity of sulphur with which iron can be combined with
out the presence of   a    third body;  a   proof that, under cer
tain "circumstances, nature departs.,   in    the case of compli

cated bodies, from the proportions which she observes in
simpler combinations.        We see here, that although in the
neutral salt of the protoxide the proportion of the compo
nent parts is determined by the sulphur and the iron, it
depends no longer on these elements in the subsalts of the
oxide of iron, but on the acid and the base, which unite in
such a proportion, that the acid takes up a certain portion
of oxvgen in the neutral salt, and four times as much in
the subsalt : and this irregularity arises from the quantity
of oxygen in the oxide, which is not twice as much as in
the protoxide, but only once and a half.         Hence the affi
nity of the oxygen for the iron of the oxide forcibly intro
duces a proportion for the sulphur and the iron of the salts
of the oxide, totally different from that which they have
originally a tendency to observe.       In the salts of the oxide
of copper, on the contrary, similar proportions are ob
served between the sulphur and the copper, because the
oxide contains twice as much oxygen as the protoxide.
The>e hall steps, or half intervals, as they may be called,
in which a subsequent combination contains only half as
much more as a preceding one, will require, in future ana
lyses of complicated combinations, a greater readiness in
calculation, and a greater precision of conception, than if
each step corresponded        with a double proportion, or at
least with a multiple of some preceding step.
   I have already mentioned, that subsulphate of the oxide
of iron is deposited by a solution of the neutral sulphate of
the protoxide, and that the salt, which then crystallizes, is
of an emerald green, and forms oblique rhombs. This salt
is a triple combination of the neutral sulphates of the oxide
and the protoxide. The yellow colour of the former turns
the blueish    hue of the latter to a purer green.  I have reason
to consider this salt    as the same which Thenard supposed
to be a completely neutral salt of the protoxide.          When
we dissolve the most regular crystals in water, we obtain a
solution slightly greenish, from which a small addition of
 ammonia throws down a subsulphate of the oxide. This
is at its first precipitation white or green, the oxide and the,
protoxide being separated together; but after some minutes
the latter falls no longer, and the precipitate is the yellow
 subsalt of the oxide, even in close vessels.      Exposed to the
air, the solution of the salt of the protoxide absorbs oxygen
 very rapidly,     until the triple salt is formed ; and if
 we boil it and cool it in succession for several days to
gether, tye obtain a red syrup-like salt, which affords a
                                                            green

green precipitate upon the addition of caustic ammonia
in great abundance.        This [s Thenard-s supersalt of sul
 phuric  acid  and   black   protoxide of iron.        If, on the con
trary,  we  add  the  ammonia     by   little and little, the salt falls
down at first yellow, and afterwards green. This nncry-
 stallizable salt is again a triple combination of the two
 salts of iron, and it is to he presumed that it contains one
 of its constituent parts in twice or four times as great a
 proportion as the emerald green salt. If we boil this salt
 with nitric acid, it is converted into a salt of the oxide,
 which, after the expulsion of the nitric acid, leaves a por
 tion of the snbsalt undissolved.           The solution of the neu
 tral sulphate of the protoxide is orange, but becomes light
 yellow when it is diluted with water and decomposed by
 an acid, as the vellow salts of iron- lose a great part of their
 colour by the addition of an excess or acid ; but I do not
 consider this circumstance as a proof of the existence of
 an acid sulphate of the oxide of iron, as Thenard maintains.
 Without doubt M. Thenard holds a distinguished rank
 among the chemists of our time, arid his results may be
 considered as possessing considerable authority.             So much
 the more unfortunate is it when such a person ventures to
 ground on such experiments,          as have certainlv been made,
 and considered as unsatisfactory, by other chemists, a sy
 stematic essay, which discourages others from investigating
 the subject, as they entertain no doubt of the accuracy
of the facts that are advanced in it.
    Since I have not hitherto been able to discover any su
persalt of the sulphuric acid and the protoxide of iron,
whatever probability there may be of the existence of such
a compound, there is hitherto no known saline compound
 corresponding to the natural pyrites.             May not the non
 existence of such a salt be the reason that this pyrites re
mains so little altered, notwithstanding its exposure to
 moisture in our mines?            So also its insolubility in dilute
 sulphuric   and  muriatic    acid  depends on the inability of the
hydrogen     of  the   water   to   combine with the sulphur in
more than one proportion ; while the pvrites contains pre
cisely a double portion, as we shall see hereafter.

XLVI,       Researches upon tlie Heat developed in Combustion,
    and in the Condensation of Vapours. Read before theFrench
    Institute on the 24th of February and 30th of November
     1812.      By Count Rumford, F.R S. Lieut.- General
    in the Service of the King of Bavaria, Foreign Associate
    of the Imperial Institute      of France, &c. &c*
Attempts          have been long made to measure the heat
which      is  developed in the combustion of inflammable
substances ; but the results of the experiments have been
so contradictory, and the methods employed so little calcu
lated to inspire confidence, that it is with reason that the
 whole labour has been considered as not far advanced.
     I have undertaken it thrice within these twenty years,
 without success. After having made a great number of
 experiments with the most scrupulous care, and with an
 apparatus long since contrived, and afterwards prepared by
 clever workmen ; 1 have nevertheless done nothing worthy
 of being made public. A large apparatus of copper, up
 wards of twelve feet long, which I constructed at Munich
 fifteen years ago, and another one not less expensive, made
 at   Paris four years ago, and which I have still in my labo
 ratory, are testimonies of the desire which I have long en
 tertained to find the means of elucidating a question which
 has always appeared to me of great importance both with
 respect to the sciences and the arts.
     I have now the satisfaction to announce, that after all
"my fruitless attempts, I have at length found out a very
 simple method of measuring the heat which is manifested
 in combustion, and even with a precision which leaves
 nothing more to be desired.
      In order that a proper estimate may be formed of my
 method of operating, and of the confidence which may be
 reposed in the results of my experiments,              I have exhibited
 my apparatus       to  the class.
      The principal pari oi this apparatus is a kind of prismatic
  receiver, 8 inches- long by 4| broad, and 4f inches in height,,
  constructed of very thin leaves of copper.              This recipient
  which may well merit the already celebrated name of Ca
  lorimeter, is furnished with a long neck or gullet near one
  of its extremities, three quarters of an inch in diameter
  and three inches high, "which is destined to receive, and to
  keep in its place, a mercurial thermometer of a particular

      286          Researches upon the Heat developed
     form.     This receiver has also another gullet of an inch in
     diameter,    and an inch in height, situated at the centre of
     its upper part, which is closed by a cork stopper.
         In the interior of this receiver,two lines from the bottom,
     is a peculiar kind of worm, which receives all the products
     from the combustion of the inflammable bodies which are
     burnt in the experiments, and which transmits the heat
     evolved in this combustion to a considerable mass of water
     which is contained in the receiver.
        This worm, which is constructed of thin plates of copper,
    occupies and covers the whole bottom of the receiver,
     without touching, however, either the sides or bottom. It
    is a flat tube, an inch and a half broad at one of its extre
    mities, an inch broad at the other, and half an inch in
    height or thickness throughout.         It is folded horizontally,
    so as to- pass thrice from one extremity of the receiver to
    the other ; and it is kept in its place by several small feet,
    at the height of two lines above the bottom of the receiver.
        The aperture which forms the mouth of the worm, is a
   circular hole in its bottom near its extremity, where it is
   broadest   ;  and at this hole a vertical     tube is soldered,  an
   inch in diameter and an inch in height, which enters a
  quarter of an inch into the interior of the worm above the
  level of the bottom.
       This tube passes through the bottom of the receiver by a
  circular hole made for the receiver, and where it is soldered:
 its lower aperture, which is open, is seven lines below the
  level of the bottom of the receiver, and it is by this passage
  that the products of the combustion are made to pass into
 the worm.
       The other extremity of the worm traverses horizontally
 the vertical side of the extremity of the recipient opposed
 to that near which the products of the combustion enter
the worm.
       The worm, before passing through the vertical side of the
extremity of the recipient, takes the form of a round tube
six lines in diameter, and a piece of this tube, an inch in
length, is seen outside of the receiver.           This piece is in
tended to enter another       similar  tube  belonging to the worm
of a second receiver, which I call the secondary receiver,
and which is intended to receive the heat which might still
exist in the products of the combustion after they have
passed through the worm from the principal receiver.
      In order to support these two receivers in the air, so as
not to touch the table on which they are placed, they are
both fixed into squares of dry linden wood, made of
                                                               sticks

  in Combustion, and in         the Condensation   of   Vapours.       287
sticks of an inch square each : a border of copper, three
lines in breadth, which descends quite round the bottom of
the receiver, serves to attach the receiver to its wooden
frame by means of a row of very small nails. The body
of the receiver enters about one line into its frame, and
fills it up exactly.
   The perfection of this apparatus depends essentially on
the form of the worm, as will be seen when we consider
the object for which it is intended.
    The products from the combustion being all elastic
fluids, and consequently substances which cannot com
municate their heat except by proceeding particle by parti

    Previous to making use of horizontal worms constructed
 of flat pipes,   Ihad tried more than once those of the com
 mon form     ; but they never answered my purpose            in
                                                             per   a
 fect manner, and      I   never could take any account of the
 experiments in which they were employed.
    There    isno doubt that the form which      adopted for the
                                                   I

           admit, that have paid very little respect to some*
 experiments which have been communicated to me, when
 I knew that ihey have been performed in so negligent a
 manner; and certainly I shall never throw away time in
 endeavouring to build theories on their results.
     In using the apparatus which [ have described, it is ne
 cessary to have recourse to several precautions.       It is easy
 to see in the first place, that when it is necessary to deter
 mine the quantity.of heat developed in the combustion of
 any inflammable substance, it is indispensably necessary to
 arrange matters in such a way as to make the combustion
 complete; and I am of opinion that it may be regarded as
 complete, when the substance burned no longer leaves any
 residue, and burns with a bright flame without smoke or
 smell.
    The least smell, particularly that which is peculiar to the
 inflammable body which we burn, is an infallible indication
                                                   ^
 that the combustion is not perfect.                  .
     It was long before I discovered the method of burning in
 a satisfactory manner the very volatile liquids, such as al
 cohol and ether; but I finally succeeded, as will presently
 appear.    I have frequently succeeded in burning highly
 rectified sulphuric ether, without the least smell of ether
 being perceptible in the room, and it was only under these
 circumstances that T regarded the experiment as accurate.
     As to the woods, I discovered a verv simple method of
 burning them without the least appearance of smoke or
 smell. I procured from a joiner some chips of wood about
 six lines broad and one-tenth of a line in thickness ; and
 by holding them between the fingers, or with a pair of
 pincers, elevated at an angle of 45 degrees, and with their
 edge in a vertical position, they burned like a taper, and
 with a very fine flame.
     The piece of wood which is burnt being very thin, and
 being between twx> flat frames which embrace it very closely j
 is exposed to the action of so strong a heat that it burns
 completely. If very thick chips are employed, a part of
 the charcoal of the wood remains, particularly if it be oakj
 or any other wood which burns slowly ; and in this case
•the experiments are not good j but in making use of thin
 well dried chips, I have discovered that all kinds of wood
 may he burned completely.
     In burningcandles, tapers, and oils in lamps, the only pre
 cautions necessarv consist in arranging the wick in such a way
 as to give out no smoke ; then pface the flame conveniently

      There is in these experiments a source oF errors tori evi
  dent to escape the most superficial         observation,  and to
  which it is indispensable to pay attention.        While the ca
  lorimeter is heated by the heat developed in the combus
  tion of the inflammable substance which is burnt at the
  apertute of its worm, it is continually cooled by the cir-
  enmambient air.        It would doubtless be possible, by calcu
  lations founded on a knowledge of the law of the cooling
  of the receiver, which might be discovered by particular
  experiments, to determine the measure of the effect produced
  by the cooling in question, and even with a certain degree
  of precision .-out it would be impossible to appreciate by
  this method, or by any other method known, the effects of
  another cause of error, less ostensible perhaps, but certainly
  more powerful, than that of the cooling of the external star-
  face of the receiver.
       The azote which is mixed with the oxygen of the at
  mospheric air is necessarily carried into the worm, with
   the products properly belonging to combustion; and without
   a precaution which occurred to me to prevent the effects of
   this cause of error, by compensating for them, all my ex
   periments would have been useless.
       Fortunately the method which I emploved to prevent the
   effects of this cause of error, was sufficient to prevent at the
   same time those which might have resulted from the cool
   ing of the external surface of the receiver.
       As the receiver is not cooled by the atmospheric ait
   which touches its external surface, or by the azote and the
   other gases which pass through the worm with the pra-
   ducts of combustion, unless the worm be warmer than,
   the surrounding air ; and as on the contrary it is heated by
   these same elastic fluids, always when its temperature is
   lower than theirs ; by taking care that the temperature of
   the water in the receiver .is always at the commencement
   of an experiment a certain number of degrees by the
   thermometer      (five for example) below the temperature
   of the air, and by finishing the experiment at the insiant
   when the water in the receiver shall have acquired a higher
   temperature than that of the air of the same number of de
    grees, the receiver will be heated by the air during half the
    time occupied by the experiment, and cooled during the
    other half: the calorific and frigorific effects of the air on,
    the apparatus will be counterbalanced so as not to produce
    any sensible effect on the results of the experiment, and
    consequently- so as to require no correction.

*£>0           Researches upon the Heat developed
     When experiments are undertaken with a view to eluci
date the phaenomena of nature, it is always more satisfac
tory to avoid errors, or to compensate for them, than to rely
 upon calculations to appreciate their effects.
     As the law of the variation of the specific heat of water
at different temperatures is not known, and as we are but
 imperfectly acquainted with the true measurement of the
 intervals of temperature which are marked by the divisions
of our thermometers; in order to prevent the effects of our
uncertainty on this head, as to the results of the inquiry in
 question, I took care to make my experiments in a room
 in which the temperature varied very little, and to confine
 them to a very trifling elevation of the temperature of the
 water in the receiver.          It is true that I performed some ex
periments       in    a   room   where    the air was much colder, and
 in which I filled the receiver with ice instead of water;
 but these experiments were for a particular purpose, and
 they are not arranged along with the others.               Besides, they
 never yielded results so constant or satisfactory as those of
 the experiments made under other circumstances.
     In order to give an idea of the confidence which maybe
  placed in the results of the experiments made with the new
  apparatus which I have described, I shall subjoin the details
 of an experiment made with the express view of discover
 ing the measurement of its perfection.
     Having filled two receivers properly attached to each
  other, with water at the temperature of the air of the room,
  that of 55° Fahrenheit, I burned a taper under the mouth
  of the principal receiver, so that all the products of the
  combustion passed through the worm of the secondary re
 ceiver, after having passed through that of the principal,
 ^ach    of  the receivers contained 2371 grammes of water.
     The following were the results of this experiment :

     It would seem from the results of this experiment, that
  the water in the secondary receiver only began to be per
  ceptibly heated after that which had been in the principal
  receiver had been already heated from 15 to 20°; and as        I
  proposed to myself, from the commencement of this work,
  never to continue an experiment/ longer than the tempera
  ture of the water in the principal receiver was raised to 10
  or 12° F. it may be conceived that as soon as I had learnt
  by this experiment how much heat remains in the products
  of the combustion, after they have passed through the
  worm from the principal receiver, I renounced the project
  which [ had first conceived of working with the two re
  ceivers joined together.     As it was evident, from the re
  sults of this experiment,     that the second receiver could
, never be sensibly affected, or indicate any thing, notwith
  standing the confidence which I ought to have in the in
  dications of the first, I have taken the resolution to get rid
  of it.
     We shall see by the description which I have given of
  this apparatus, that we may make use of it very conveniently
  in order to determine the specific heat of the gases, as well
  as that which is manifested in the condensation of vapours,
  and generally in all the researches for measuring the quan
  tity of heat communicated by a given elastic fluid in its
  cooling ; and as it would be very easy, by a simple process,
  to separate completely the products of the vapours con
  densed in the worm, and of the gaees which pass through
  it without being condensed, I do not refrain from hoping
  that this apparatus will become useful as an instrument to
  be employed in chemical analyses.       Besides, this will be
  only an extension of the method already employed with
  so much success by M. Saussure and by Messrs. Gay-
  Lussac and Thenard.
     As soon as my apparatus was finished, I was anxious to
  ascertain what quantity of heat I should find in the com
  bustion of wax and of olive oil, that I might afterwards
  compare the results of my experiments with those of
  M.Lavoisier; and as I have the most implicit confidence
  in every thing which this most worthy man has published,
  I  was desirous to find in this comparison a proof of the
  exactitude of my method, and at the same time a confirma
  tion of M. Lavoisier's calculations.
         § I. Heat developed hi the Combustion of Wax.
     The air of the room being at the temperature of 61° F.
  2781 grammes ok water at the temperature of 66° F. were
                               T  2                        placed

 299                "Researches upon the   Heat   developed
 placed   in the receiver of the calorimeter (including the
 quantity ot this liquid which represents the specific heat of
 the instrument) ; and a lighted taper having been placed at
 the mouth of the worm, the calorimeter was heated for
  } 3 minutes and 26 seconds.    When the thermometer an
 nounced that the water had acquired the temperature of
  66° F. the taper was extinguished.
    As I took care to weigh the taper before lighting      on"              it;
 weighing          it
               again  at the end  of the experiment,    found       I
  that -63 gramme of wax had been burnt.
          1
    In order to express the results of this experiment                        in   a
 way to render them palpable, and at the same time easy                            to
 be compared with the results of other similar experiments,
 .we shall show how much water at the freezing point, the
heat manifested in the combustion of 1-63 gramme of wax
which were burnt, must have boiled under the mean pres
 sure of the atmosphere.
    The interval upon the scale of Fahrenheit's thermometer,
between the freezing and boiling points, being 180 degrees;
if, in order to raise the temperature of the water    the ca        in
lorimeter 10 degrees, we must burn 1-63 gramme of wax,
39-34 grammes must be burnt in order to raise         180          it             de
grees and :      29-34 grammes of wax can furnish
                    if                                   suffi          a
ciency of heat in their combustion to raise the temperature
of 2781 grammes of water 180 degrees; one gramme                                   of
the same flammable substance ought to furnish enough to
heat 94-785 grammes of water the same number of                                   de
grees.
   Consequently, one pound of while wax, or of        taper             a
which we burn, ought to furnish in its combustion enough
of heat to raise 94-785, pounds of water from the freezing
to the boiling point.
   In order to ascertain how many pounds of ice the same,
quantity of water would be capable of melting, we have
only to add to the number of pounds of water at the tem
perature of ice which this heat    capable of boiling, the
                                           is
third part of this number, and the sum will express the.
weight in pounds of this quantity of ice*.
   For white wax therefore — 9i-785
                            +31-595
                                  = 126-380 pounds             of       thawed
ice for one pound         of the substance burnt.
 *   It   known that the same quantity of heat which
          is                                                  necessary for
                                                              is
melting one pound of ice, would be sufficient for heating and boiling three
quartan of pound of water at the temperature of ioe>

     in Combustion, and in the Condensation         6f Papours.  293
   Before comparing the result of this experiment with that
of  an experiment made with the same substance by ^A.
Lavoisier, I shall give an account of two other experiments
made by myself with wax, and my readers will ho doubt
be struck with the uniformity of their results.             It is in
fact so remarkable, that I should scarcely dare to publish
them, if I had Hot proofs that all my experiments were
really made and registered before commencing any calcula
tion on their results, and if I was not certain that those who
prefer adopting my method, by using the same apparatus,
will have the same results, if they repeat my experiments.
   As the method of proceeding in making these experi
ments ought to be now well known, I can without incon
venience suppress the details, and give only the results of
the experiments.
    I shall begin with three experiments made with bees
wax ; and in order to render them easy to be compared,             I
shall present them together in a table.

         2-17    28-15         13i»
   If we    take the mean term between the results of these
three   experiments, we shall find that the quantity of heat
developed in the combustion of wax is such, that a pound
of this substance is sufficient to heat and boil 94-682
pounds of water at the free2irtg point : consequently one
pound of wax ought to be sufficient, when burnt, to melt
 126-242 pounds of ice.
   In the experiments of M. Lavoisier, the; heat developed
in the combustion of a pound of bees wax was sufficient to
melt 133-166 pounds df ice.
    The difference between the results of our experiments
made with this substance is not very great ; and if those of
M. Lavoisier were made at a time when the temperature
                                   T3                             of

394              Researches upon the Heat developed
of the air was only  a few degrees higher than that of ice
(a  circumstance   with which I cannot be acquainted), the
quantity of azote which must have entered into the calori
meter with the oxygen employed to keep up the combus
tion, 13 so great, that it would be sufficient to account, for
the difference ; but the very great difference which exist*
between the results of our experiments made with oil of
olives, proves that one or other of our processes must have
been faulty.
    § II. Heat developed in the Combustion of Olive Oil.
   The mean result of several experiments made with oil o(
olives gave me as the measure of the quantity of heat de-.
veloped in the combustion of one pound of this substance,
90-439 pounds of water heated 180° of Fahrenheit, or 120
pounds of dissolved ice, omitting fractions.
   In the experiment* of M. Lavoisier there were upwards
of 148 pounds of ice dissolved by the heat which appeared,
to result from the combustion of one pound of this oil. It is
true   that this excellent experimenter has himself regarded
this result   as too great, and he adds with becoming mo
desty,  "We     shall probably be obliged to make considerable
corrections in most of the results which I have given ; but
I di ; not cosider this a good reason for delaying to assist
those who may purpose to engage in similar inquiries."
§   III.  Heat developed in the Combustion of purified    Oil of
    Colsa, such as that which is sold in Paris for Lamp   Oil.
   As it appears very probable that all the fat oils which are
perfectly pure, are composed of the same elements, I was
anxious to know if oil of colsa, purified with sulphuric acid,
would not give out more heat in its combustion than oil of
olives when burnt in its natural state. The results of three
experiments made with purified oil of colsa, convinced me
that in fact this oil gives more heat in its combustion than
olive oil : the difference is even considerable, and more than
I had suspected.
   With the combustion of one pound of refined oil of
colsa                      93 073 pounds of water heated 180°,
one pound of olive oil 90-439 ditto            ditto.
   Chemists are best qualified to inform us if the quantity
of incombustitl$ matter separated from the oil of colsa, in
refining   it,betufficient to account fortius difference.
   On comparing the results of the experiments made with
bees wax with those of purified oil,   itseems that, the weight
being equal,   these   two substances furnish  in their combusr
                                                           tk>n

    in Combustion, and in    the Condensation of Vapours.    2Q5
tion nearly equal quantities of heat; and as this ought to be
the case, in fact, according to the quantities of combustible
matter which these substances contain, this result is made
in order to give confidence to the method of measuring ti e
heat which is developed in combustion.
    With the combustion of one pound of bees wax 94-632
pounds of water were heated 100°, and with one pound of
refined oil 93-073 pounds of water were heated 180°.
    As the object which I had chiefly in view in these ex
periments was to determine the quantities of heat which are
developed in the combustion of pure hydrogen and carbon j.
in order to render this new method useful in chemical ana
lyses, I attached myself particularly to inflammable sub
stances which have been analysed with the greatest care.
§   IV.   Estimate of the Quantities of Heat developed in the
           Combustion of Hydrogen Gas and Carbon.
    Several attempts have been made to determine these in
teresting questions by direct experiments,     by burning pure
hydrogen,     or hydrogen gas,  and  pure charcoal;  but the re
sults of these inquiries have been s6 variable that we can
not rely upon them.
    According to Crawford, the heat developed in the com
 bustion of one pound of hydrogen gas is sufficient to. raise
the temperature of 410 pounds of water to 180° F. but the
 estimate of M. Lavoisier is much lower: according to him,
 this heat could raise only 221 -69 pounds of water to this heat.
   Jn   return, M. Lavoisier estimates the quantity of heat
 developed in the combustion of charcoal much higher than
 Mr. Crawford. I have a great many reasons for thinking
 that both estimate too highly ; and if this opinion be con
 firmed, we shall be obliged to estimate the heat developed
 in the combustion of hydrogen even a little higher than
 Mr. Crawford, in order to account for that which was ma
 nifested in my experiments.
     According to the results of several experiments made five
 years ago, it appeared to me that the heat developed in the
 combustion of one pound of charcoal, dried as well as possi
 ble before being weighed, by making it red hot in a crucible,
  was not fit to raise more than 52 or 54 pounds of water
 from the freezing to the boiling point.
     According to Crawford, this heat ought to be sufficient
  to boil 57"606 pounds, and according to M. Lavoisier
                                                                  '
  72-475 pounds.
     We shall see how these estimates agree with the results
  ef my experiments.

    As the experiments      made with wax have given very-
uniform results, and as the analysis of this substance has
been effected with great care, I shall show how the quantities
of hydrogen and carbon which are found in this substance
agree with the quantity of heat which it furnished me in
combustion.

sufficiently to heat 90-439 pounds of the same water.

 XLVII.      An Account relative to the Situation of His Ma
    jesty-s late Ship Royal George, sunk at Spithead in the
     Year i 782; together with the Value, andAieans of raising
     her.     By Mr. J. HiciyS, of No. 22, Charlotte Street,
     Rathlone Place.
 It    has been conjectured by many, that the Royal George
 mnat be nearly covered with sand and mud, and that any
 attempt to raise her would be fruitless-, and also, that in
 the event of her being raised, the hull and her stores must
 be so decayed at d injured by the length of time she has
 been sunk, that trie produce would not pay for the trouble
 and expense; which has induced me, at the request of
 many fri< nds, t>> give an account of her situation and value,
 with the expenses of raising her.
      After showing rr>v plan, model, 8cc. to the Lords of the
  Admiralty, T received an order on the 6th of August last,
  informing me iheir Lordships had caused directions to be
  given to Admiral Sir Richard Bickerton,Bart. at Portsmouth,
  to call together a Committee of the most scientific Captains
  who might be at that port, with the Commissioner, the

    288          An Account relative to the Situation"
   Master Attendant, and the Master Builder of the Dock
   Yard, to inquire into and report upon the probability of
   success attending my plan, and for me to proceed to Ports
   mouth with my model, &c. for the consideration of the
   Committee, and to take soundings upon her, &c. which,
   was accordingly done by me and two of His Majesty-s pilots
    (Mr.   J. Paddon and Mr. R. Hartfield), with poles, leads,
   and lines, in September last.      The result proved that no
   deviation had taken place since I took soundings first (which
   was two vears after she went down).       The report from the
   Committee to their Lordships proved so favourable and
   satisfactory,   that they were pleased to obtain an Order in
   Council, that my proposal should      be acceded to; namely,
   that  I  should be allowed to raise the Royal George at my
   own expense, and receive as my reward, should I succeed,
   the ship with all her stores, guns, and other articles con
   tained in her.
      The Royal George lies in the middle of the best anchor
   age at Spitheacl, in thirteen fathoms at low water, and on a
   bed of stiff blue clay, in which she has not sunk seven feet,
   the bed of the sea close along side and for a considerable
   distance about her a perfect level, no sand, nor any other
   obstruction further than the natural sediment of water, of
  which there can be but little, as the pilots and myself could
   distinctly hear the poles and leads strike the decks.

           of His Majesty's late Ship Royal George.        301
   Mr. Hicks has issued the following Proposals for raising
by loan the sum of ten thousand pounds, in one hundred
shares of one hundred pounds each : to be applied to the
purpose of raising His Majesty-s ship Royal George, sunk
at Spithead; which, upon the representation and recom
mendation of the Lords of the Admiralty, His Royal High
ness the Prince Regent has been graciously pleased, in the
name and on the behalf of His Majesty, and by and with
the advice of His Majesty-s most honourable Privy Council,
to give to Mr. James Hicks (late Secretary to the Hon. Sir
Henry Edwin Stanhope, Bart. Admiral of the Blue), the
hull, furniture, naval, victualling and ordnance stores of
the said ship (which is copper bottomed), estimated at up
wards of Fifty Thousand Pounds !
   The plan has been seen and approved by most of the su
perior mechanics in the kingdom.
   It is proposed in the event of the ship being raised, (of
which there is uot the least doubt,) that the subscribers shall
be repaid their subscription money out of the first property
recovered: and half the remaining sum to be equally di
vided among the subscribers, immediately after the sale of
the ship, furniture, naval, victualling, ordnance stores, and
the materials, in proportion to the number of shares sub
scribed.
   The Lords of the Admiralty have kindly consented to
furnish Mr. Hicks with all the timber, iron, ropes, blocks,
mooring anchors, cables, bridles, buoys, &c. equal in value
to »£l 8,000, together with the lifting ships and as many
men and officers as will be requisite ; and for which their
Lordships only require £6000 to be deposited in their
hands, to cover any loss that may arise by conversion, wear
and tear, &c. ; (which, upon a fair calculation, cannot ex
ceed one-fourth of the whole amount of the subscription ;)
of which sum Government require onlv £ 1000 to be de
 posited upon  Mr. Hicks-s commencing his operation.
   The Lords of the Admiralty have agreed to take back all
 the stores, which may be issued to Mr. Hicks, at a fair
valuation after they shall be done with.

April I. The Right Rev. Dr. Goodenough, Lord Bishop
of Carlisle, in the chair. Sir Everard Home communicated
some additions   and corrections to his paper on the Narval.
Since writing the first part of          it,
                                        he has had an opportunity
of examining the heads of both male and female narvals                                y
he found in the male       tusk of four feet long, and what he
                              a
calls a milk  tooth  imbedded      in the substance of the skull
about nine inches long        and
                               ;    in     young female, two milk
                                           a
teeth eight inches long likewise imbedded in the skull                            :
hence he concludes      that the latter has two tusks of an
equal  length,  and   that   the former has        tusk and
                                                        a       milk     a

point, and solid where they are united                 by

  Dr. C. Wells communicated an account of Harriot Trest,
a woman who has her left shoulder, arm and hand as black
a? the blackest African, while all the rest of her skin         very     is
white.   She      isnative
                       a      of  Sussex     and; the   account  she
gives isj that her  mother     set   her  foot on     lobster during

her pregnancy.         Dr. W. describes the appearance of her
skin, her blue eyes, and general comeliness,                    with much mi
nuteness, as she was      patient in the hospital to which he
                              a
isphysician.     He  hence  infers that blackness of skin     no             is
proof of  difference  of species, and  alleges that the sun does
not blacken but rather whitens the skin.

  April 2d, 1813. W. H. Pepys, Esq. Treasurer, in the
chair.
   The reading of a memoir by Mr. John Farey, Sen., on
the Ashover denudation in the county of Derby, was be
gun. The first part of this paper consists of minute local
observations, incapable of abridgement, relative to the in
osculation ridges, the basset ridges, the partial incurvation
of   the beds, and the ascertained or supposed faults.
    April 23d. The President in the chair.
    Thomas Gregory, Esq. of Bays water — Thomas Botfield,
Esq. of Hopton Court near Bewdlcy — were severally elected
members of the Society.
    A notice by the Rev. J. J. Conybeare, M. G. S. relative
to the slate of Tintagel in Cornwall, was read, and thanks
were voted for the same.
    The slate quarries of Tintagel are situated close to the
sea, about six miles N. W. of Uamelford : they are worked
on a large scale, and are celebrated for the excellent quality
of the roofing slate w hich they afford. No dykes of granite
or of porphyry have been observed in this rock ; but there
are veins which afford quartz, rock-crystal of great trans
parency and beauty, calcareous spar, chlorite, and in some
instances adularia.    The slate of Tintagel appears to bear
a near resemblance       to thai of Snowdon, and like it
occasionally presents the impressions of bivalve shells.
    The reading of Mr. Farey-s paper on the Ashover denu
 dation was concluded, and thanks were voted for the same.
    This portion of Mr. Farey-s paper contains a detailed ac
 count of the several strata represented in the maps and sec
 tions, beginning from the lowest of those that are known.
    The fundamental rock of Derbyshire is the fourth lime-
 itone. It is supposed to lie at the depth of about 350 yards
 below the level of the river Amber in Ashover valley.       It
 rises towards the surface under Matlock valley, and actually
 bassets in Griff-dale.    The thickness of this bed is un•
 known ; but as   the deep vale of the Dove is entirely exca
 vated in it, without discovering the bottom of the bed, its
                                                     thickness

thickness cannot be less than 350 or 400 yards.        It is ge
nerally a pure calcareous freestone, of a whitish yellow co
lour, disposed regularly in very numerous strata. These
consist either of very white marble, or of aggregations of
small rhombic crystals : towards the top it is very compact
and porcellanous.     Few of the beds are without organic
remains : in some are found small anomiae, in others en-
trochi, or turbinated shells, cornua ammonis, nautili, and
branching coralloids. This rock is superficially cracked,
so as to present a columnar appearance.          Beneath it is
much rent, and abounds in shake-holes and large caverns
with water-swallows.      Some of the fissures connected with
the surface are filled with clay sand and quartz pebbles.
The veins are filled principally with calcareous spar, heavy
spar, and fluorspar: they also contain in their- upper part
galena, calamine, manganese, red iron ore, white china
clay, and steatite.
   Upon the fourth limestone lies the third toadstone. The
most eastern basset of this rock is at Bonsall upper town.
Its thickness in different parts is very various, from four
feet to eighty yards.      Its usual appearance is that of a
cavernous stony mass, of a dirty purplish brown hue.
Often it is of a dark blue colour with shining specks, as
hard and sonorous as cast iron, also of a light green or
blueish gray colour, and rarely it appears as a gritty yellow
ish stone called Dunstone.       Its structure when recent ii
ainygdaloidal,  the  cavities  being filled with green or white
globules of calcareous spar.      The veins in the limestone
above and below this stratum have rarely if ever broken
through it ; but rents proceed from these into the top and
bottom of the toadstone, in which galena and the usual
veinstones are sometimes found.
   Third limestone. — The most eastern basset of this rock
in the line of section is on the western slope of Masson
Low. Its average thickness near Matlock is about 80 yards.
Its colour varies from gray to brownish black. It includes
several beds of limestone, with layers of dark gray nodular
chert.   Its organic remains are numerous, and it abounds
in mineral veins that afford galena, calamine, and blende,
embedded in calcareous spar and heavy spar.
   Second toadstone. — The most eastern basset of this rock
is in the bed of the Derwent.            Its average thickness is
greater  than  that of the   third toadstone,  and it does not ap•
pear liable to  such  variations   of thickness as that rock.  Ill
external characters it does not greatly differ from    it,  except
that  itcoataiu\ narrow veins of fibrous calcareous spar. .,

   Second limestone. — The most eastern basset of this rock
is in Matlock high Tor.      Its average thickness is about 80
yards. Its colour   is yellowish or blueish gray. Some of its
beds are magnesian limestone. Its principal organic remains
are entrochi. It contains metallic veins of galena, calamine,
and, as it is said, of copper.
   First toadstone. — The first tegular basset of this rock ap
pears to be in Matlock high Tor.        Its average thickness is
about 28 yards.      Its general characters differ little from
those of the third toadstone, except that it seems disposed
in more regular beds or strata.
   First limestone. — The average thickness of this rock is
60 yards.     Its usual colour is lightish gray : near the top
it incloses beds of swinestone interlaid with dark or striped
chert.     The organic remains of this rock are anomite,
entrochi, nautili, and other shells, together with many co-
railoids. It abounds in caverns and water-swallows, and
in numerous metallic rake veins, or long vertical rents.
Massive fluor (blue John) and elastic bitumen occur in this
rock.
  The great or limestone shale. — The average thickness of
this rock is about 150 yards: its general character is that
of a-black or dark brown shale, inclosing beds of a soft
yellowish sandstone, and of a dark blue limestone; also
thin beds of clay, ironstone and septaria.  Its organic re
mains are not numerous, consisting chiefly of anomiae,
lnyae, helices, and a few vegetable impressions.
    First or millstone grit. — The average thickness of this
rock is about 140 yards.     It is generally a white or yellow
ish coarse-grained freestone in thick beds : but at the upper
part of the rock is a considerable thickness of soft mica
ceous thin beds.     Its organic remains are large reeds and
 flags, and occasionally coralloids of a horn-like appearance.
    Coal formation. — This lies on the millstone grit, and
 consists of eighteen beds of grit and of shale; the aggre
 gate thickness of which is 706 yards, and presents the usual
 characters of the independent coal formation.

   In the course of last month the president, Dr. LettsomJ
delivered a lecture on Intemperate Drinking.
   Dr. Lettsom commenced by observing, that one of the
earliest objects of discovery, nearly coeval with the first
history of man, and the knowledge of       it,
                                            preserved to the
present time,   isthat of intoxication, or the improper use

of  things which tend to excite inebriation.         After pointing
out  the  knowledge     of  metals,  and   the  manner  of working
them, evidenced by Tubal Cain, the lecturer said, that al->
though metallurgy had been brought to a considerable de
gree of perfection before the . deluge, it might be presumed1
from the silence of the sacred historian, that fermentation,-
 so essential to the production of inebriating liquors, had
not been discovered.        Noah, who planted the vine in the
valley of Mount Ararat, (Baris or Luban, described by
Tournefort, who visited      it,   as the finest valley    inPersia,)
appears to have been ignorant of the effects of the fer
mented juice of the grape, till he had experienced its in
ebriating influence. The memory of the great patriarch
was preserved       by various rites, till at length the knowledge
of their origin was lost, for which those rites had been in
stituted, probably hastened        by  the confusion of tongues,
and emigration and dispersion which ensued, about 600
years  after the patriarch had settled in the valley of Ararat.
In these ceremonies they religiously preserved the number
nine, constituting the eight persons saved in the ark, with
the dove, the messenger of the cessation of the flood.        These
 ceremonies were conducted with secrecy and                   pomp,
                                                      av^ful
as early as 1400 years before the Christian aera, particularly
at Eleusis  ;   ceremonies strongly resembling        those of free
masonry     in all the lodges in Europe. They were introduced
into Europe as early as the Crusades in the llth century,
and the same mystic numbers continued, as nine, or three
times three, the root of nine.
    On the origin of drinking healths, the learned lecturer
related the manner of that of Rowena, the daughter or niece-
of Hengist, to Vortigcrn, king of the Britons. — rt She came
into the room where the king and his guests were sitting.
Making      a low obedience to him, she said,          'Be of good
health, lord king    I-  Then having drunk, she presented the
cup on her knees to the king, who replied,         'I    drink your
health,- and drank also." This           is said to be the origin of
the practice of .drinking healths; but the President observed,-
that  it was certainly in use as early as the time of Homer,
and from the account in Jamblichus,           in  the Eleusinian or
Masonic ceremonies also, accompanied with libations of
wine to the mystic number nine. Man, endowed with sen

tfian the animals destined to his use, or subservient to his
istibsistence ; for, as the impulse of instinct is sooner ex
cited, than the evolution of reason is matured, their wants
are supplied with little care, and less reflection, and where
animal gratification alone -constitutes the summit of happi
ness. But with man, impressions are as varied and nume
rous as the objects of creation, and the operations of mind
co-extensive with nature, which subject hiin to feelings of
pleasure or pain, of gratification or dislike ; — his passions
faence become hasty and violent, or slow and temperate ;
and whilst the latter conduce to intellectual character and
dignity, the former sink him to sensual and animal depra
vity.
    The human mind is an existing something, that revolts
at quiescence ; this spring for exertion is often a source of
intellectual improvement, by exciting its energies, till
 mind itself, as it were, creates mind and action ; bold and
vehement figures spring up, which wing the thoughts with
fire; an animated expression of sentiment, which pervades
the whole frame, as blood runs through the veins.          But         if,
 from the want    ofstimulus, this action of the mind         susis
 pended, or weakened, some excitement             sought for, to
                                                       is

 tions and no excitement
     ;                          so generally grateful, as liquors
                                  is
 that have acquired more or less potency           the process of
                                                       by
 fermentation.
    After having shown that where          succession of various
                                               a

 occupation, the desire for strong drink           regulated in

 great measure     bythe  climate,  and  diminishes or increases
 according to the variation of the temperature, the lecturer
 proceeded to observe, that in Europe and other civilized
 regions fermented liquors are principally produced from
 sugar, grape, or grain, and the quantity of spirit made in
 this kingdom alone amounts to 80,000 tons, which produce
a    revenue of four millions annually, and destruction to
 health, happiness, and morals.
     The accretion and nutrition of the body           principally
                                                            is
 produced   by  the solids taken into the stomach.     To divide,
 dilute, and assimilate these, fluids are requisite as menstrua,
 and the thinner and purer they are, the better they are
  adapted to these purposes and hence the lecturer concluded
                              ;
 that water must appear the most prominent, agreeably to
  the poet of health*. Next to simple water, cyder, beer, and
  those fluids which contain the least alcohol, may be ranged          ;

either in their pure or diluted states : all these fermented
liquors, however, contain more or less alcohol, and in this
proportion are thty more or less safe or injurious*. The
learned doctor here presented                   a moral       and physical
 thermometer, or a scale of the process of temperance and
intemperance produced by different liquors ; and, having
 submitted some conjectures respecting the action of spirits
on the stomach productive of intoxication, proceeded to the
consideration of some of the unhappy effects of intempe
rance : — loss of tone of the stomach and its digestive powers
•— disorganization of the functions which prepare,                     assimi

health of the body — hard, scirrhous, enlarged aud ulcerated

 Mr.    James Thomson, Gun-maker, Parliament Square.
    Mr.Thornson exhibited to the meeting a beautiful fowling-
 piece, with his improvement, which is applicable to fire
 arms of all ki-nds, and consists of a circular pan, with a cy
 linder closely fitted to the outside.            This external cylinder
  serves   to  cut   off  anv superfluous powder, by which means
  the pan can never be over- primed,                  It also keeps it per
  fectly water proof ; and the powder being left quite loose,
  it never fails to explode.         This improvement appears to be
  well worth the attention         of Government, as it ensures the
  action of every musket, however far troops may he required

      IT. Description of a Galvanic Battery, on an improved
   Construction, invented by Mr. Jackson; communicated by
  James Millar, M.D.
      Those who have been engaged in Galvanic experiments
   are well aware of the inconveniences that arise from the
   loss of time, the great attention requisite, and the considei
   able expense which is incurred, even when they are con
   ducted on no very exiended scale; and brilliant and rapid
   as the progress of Galvanism has been, it is perhaps owing
   to such circumstances           that the number of those who have

"been "occupied in investigations of this nature has been
chiefly limited to professional inquirers.
   The apparatus of which I am now to give a short de
scription appears to me to be so simple in its construction,
and so easy in its application, that it may, in a great mea
sure, obviate these inconveniences.     It is the invention of
Mr. Jackson, my assistant, who has long employed it for
the purpose of applying Galvanism medically. The pairs
of plates of which this battery is composed are carefully
  fused together so as to form one solid mass of metal, and
  are therefore united in every point of their surfaces.      This
  last circumstance is generally supposed to add greatly to the
  strength of the battery, and perhaps it serves to increase the
  power of the battery of Mr. Jackson's construction.         The
  pairs of plates thus prepared are arranged horizontally and
  alternately with pieces of cloth moistened with the chemical,
  solution employed.         A frame, which is also of very sim
  ple   construction,  is all the apparatus necessary to complete
  the battery.     This frame, whose length is to be accommo
   dated to the number of plates employed, has two glass rods
-
   at the bottom, as an insulated support to the plates.        At
   each end of the frame there is an upright pillar, through
   which passes a wire or small bar, which moves horizonially,
   and is secured by a screw in the top of the pillar, when the
   bar presses on the plates, to keep them in a vertical posi
   tion, and in close contact with the intervening moistened
   cloths. The conducting wires are applied to the poles of
   the battery in the usual way.
    . The
           advantages of this battery over any other that has
   yet   been  contrived, will be sufficiently obvious to those
   who are much conversant with such pursuits ; it seems,
   indeed, to unite the advantages of the simple construction
   of the pile with the increased power obtained from the
   trough, but is free from the unavoidable expense which
   attends the operation of the latter.
       1. The first obvious    advantage of a battery of this con
   struction is, that it is more portable than any form, of the
    Galvanic trough, whether the pairs of plates in the trough
   be soldered together and cemented in    it,  or whether they be
   moveable, according to the principle ef the couranne de
t asses.
    2. Another obvious advantage of this apparatus        is,
                                                            that
 the original expense far inferior to that of those constructed
                         is
 in any other form. The materials of which the plates are
 composed, and the labour of soldering each pair, constitute
 almost its only expense.       frame of the simplest con-

struction answers the purpose; and, with a little ircge>
nious contrivance, a temporary frame may scarcely ever be
wanting.
 , 3. It is unnecessary to mention to those acquainted with
Galvanic apparatus, that it is of great importance to keepv
the surface     of the plates elean,      so that the chemical solution,
may act on the metallic matter to produce the effect.         The
apparatus   before us possesses  this   advantage   in  a high de
gree ;  because  the  plates, being   iu  detached   pairs, can be
easily cleaned, so as always to     exhibit,   at the commence
ment of every new operation, all their metallic brightness.
   4. But it is one of the peculiar advantages of this appa
ratus, that its operation is attended with scarcely any ex
pense.    It has been one of the great objections to the use
of the Galvanic battery, in the form of the trough, that the
quantity of nitric acid, to bring a powerful apparatus into*
full action, renders the expense enormous ; for it is found
that the effects        of the cheaper acids      are too   rapid and vio
lent : but in this apparatus the cheaper acids, as the mu
riatic or sulphuric, can be conveniently employed, since the
violence    of its action                        of its appli
                                is moderated by the mode
cation, through the intervention of the pieces of cloth ; and
yet the power of its action seems to be greater than bat
teries of a different construction having the same numbeF
of plates in the series, and the same extent of surface.
    The apparatus now described has been found to be ex
tremely convenient in the application of Galvanism to me
dical purposes.     For these purposes, I believe, Mr. Jackson
first thought of        it,
                      and has long and pretty extensively em
ployed      in this way and 40 pairs of two inches square
           it                   ;
form  a  battery of sufficient power for this purpose.
   But batteries of greater number of series, and of greater
                            a
extent of Surface, have been constructed       Mr. Jackson on
                                                     by
the same plan       ;battery, consisting of 100 pairs of plates
                        a
of four inches square, was fitted up and when the cloths
                                               ;
were moistened with sulphuric acid diluted with water,
the power of action of this battery seemed to be superior to
that of the trough, composed of an equal number and of
an equal surface of pairs of plates         say seemed, for no
                                              ;I
comparative experiments have been yet instituted to ascer
tain this point, on which expected to have been able to lay
                                    I

as the experiments are not yet completed,      must reserve
                                                       I

   rarely been exhibited by the trough, eVen with plates of
   larger surface, and an equal number of pairs.       It may be
  just mentioned as one reason of the superior action of the
   battery of Mr. Jackson-s construction, that the chemical
   agent, employed in      it,
                             namely, the sulphuric acid, could
   not be usedin   the trough, even when very largely diluted)
   without 'producing so violent an action as to injure the
   apparatus, and to render its operation extremely incommo
  dious.
      As connected with the subject of Galvanism, the brief
  account of an experiment which shows to what distance
  the Galvanic fluid may be conveyed through water, will
  not,
     [    trust, be deemed out of place.      The experiment               al
  luded to was first suggested       Mr. Jackson, and was made
                                      by
  by him, some years ago, in presence of several gentlemen,
  belonging to the University.       For the purpose of having
  the fact fully verified, the same experiment was repeated
 yesterday, with his portable apparatus of 40 pairs of two
  inches. The battery was placed on        rocka    the bed of the
                                                        in
 water of Leith, and       awire from one end was introduced
 into the river,   a few feet from the apparatus          wire at
                                                             :   a
  tached to the other end of the battery, and extending 60
 yards in length, was carried along the dry bank           the end
                                                                 :
 of this wire was taken in one hand moistened with water,
 and the other hand was dipped into the river and although
                                                        j
 the circuit thus formed was equal to 120 yards, or 360 feet,
 yet the shock from so small an apparatus was quite per
 ceptible.  It    was still more sensible when the hand was
 dipped in the river, and the tongue was applied to the wire.
 The decomposition of water proceeded rapidly             but thej
 wind prevented        fair trial of the deflagration of metals,
                       a
 and some other experiments which were proposed.              In           a
 former experiment, Mr. Jackson found that metals were re
 vived from their solution in acids            by
                                             the same apparatus,
 and when the extent of the circuit was not much less.          In
 the course of these experiments,        had an opportunity of

 witnessing the remarkable effects of the conducting power
 of bodies, which, indeed,       Iought to notice, was observed
 by Mr. Jackson at the time he made the first experiment.

    March 10. A paper       " On  certain Combinations of the
Oxymuriatic Acid, with Observations and Experiments on
their respective bleaching Powers," was read by S. Witter,
Esq.
    The paper commenced with stating the methods of pre
paring the oxymuriates of lime, potash, and magnesia, for
the purposes of commerce: the formation of the dry oxy-
muriate of lime on the large scale, with analytical experi
ments on its composition, was particularly detailed.          To
ascertain the proportions synthetically of the constituent
principles of oxymuriate of lime, the oxymuriatic gas was
tletached from its combination, and received through a sa
turated solution of common salt : the analysis was calcu
lated from the weight gained by hydrate of lime during its
conversion into the oxymuriatic salt, compared with its
weight previous to that operation.        Corroborating the cor
rectness of the analysis, two proportions of lime were uni
 formly found combined with one of oxymuriatic gas, in a
solution of that effective bleaching agent.      The application
i>f Sir H. Davy's views of the nature of chlorine and mu
riatic acid, to Mr. Dalton's analysis of oxymuriate of lime
 (described in Dr. Thomson-s Annals), harmonized the
composition of Mr. Dalton's oxymuriate with that stated
in Mr. Witter-s experiment: and this circumstance was
supposed to favour an opinion which the latter had ad
vanced ; namely, that the bleaching strength of the oxy
muriates was inseparably connected with the presence of
an excess of base, and that the real bleaching oxymuriates
in solution resemble that class called sub-salts.      The neu
tral oxymuriate of potash was found capable of being re
stored to its original maximum of strength, by the addition
of a slight excess of alkali.
    All attempts to prepare the oxymuriate of magnesia in a
dry form were stated as unsuccessful, and tbeTiquid ob
tained in the direct way was found to be too expensive, and
 tedious in preparation, for general use.
    The decomposition of muriate and sulphate of magnesia
in the mother liquor of salt works, the former by heat, and
the latter by charcoal, wa3 suggested as an ceconomical

process for obtaining magnesia, were the preparation of the
 dry oxymuriate readily practicable.
      The author then proposed processes for obtaining liquid
 oxymuriates of magnesia and of soda.                     The process for
 obtaining       the   former    was    recommended        to the calico-
 printer, on the grounds of facility            of  preparation and com
 parative ceconomy : that for obtaining the latter was pro
 posed to the manufacturer-s notice, as promising utility in
  the arts, from the happy coincidence that occurs in the
  preparation of oxymuriatic gas; namely, the formation of
 sulphate of soda in large quantities, a substance essential
 to the proposed process.
      Some experiments were then detailed concerning the re
 spective energies of the oxymuriates in discharging vege
 table colouring matter; and also on their action upon the
  texture of linen fabric, the cohesion of which,- by using
 concentrated solutions of each, was found completely de
 stroyed, while no apparent injury was observed to result
  from the action of the diluted liquid of the bleacher, al
 though the cloth was boiled therein for some hours. Con
  cerning the muriate of lime, it was found that in no de
  gree oi strength was it injurious.
      The paper concluded with a detailed account of the com
 parative expense of the oxymuriates enumerated, and with
 some observations on the objections urged against the
                                                                           oxy

  and Experiments relating to Fiorin Grass," by the
                                                                        Right
  Hon. G. Knox, President of the Society.
      The intention of the author had been to present a minute
  detail of his attempts to analyse that interesting vegetable;
  but on account of the exaggerated reports that began to
  circulate concerning his inquiries, it became a matter of
  necessity to state the facts as far as he had ascertained
  them *.
      The author first adverted to the uncertainty which attends
  drying the grass: if was observed that at the temperature of
  212° or lower, the formation of an empyreumatic oil was
  evident ; while at a still lower temperature it was apparent
.    * This necessity was further increased hy an unfortunate
                                                                accident which
  occurred to the author during his experiments, the consequence of which was
  tlKit he was compelled to relinquish the investigation. The period when he
  might be enabled to resume it being uncertain, he preferred communicating
  the present statement, although much more imperfect than what he at
                                                                              first
  intended ; beside that Che general analysis became less necessary, as it is
                                                                                re
  ported that such will shortly appear in Sir H. Davy-s Agricultural Lectures
  now iu the press.
                                                                            that

 that the whole of the water could not be removed.          Thft
 author then stated objections which arise when certain
 other methods are employed, the consideration of which
 occasioned in him a distrust of his estimate of the vegetable
soluble matter.
    The general method employed was to drv a certain quan
tity of the grass, to digest it in water, and dry the residuum
in the same temperature as at first: the weight lost in these
processes showed the quantity dissolved, and this quantity
generally agreed pretty exactly with the solid extract obtained
by evaporating the filtered water. In this manner, with but
little variation, 25 per cent, of extract, that         is,
                                                     of soluble
nutritious matter, was obtained.
    It was then stated that the author after many attempts
.was not enabled to obtain sugar in tbe insulated form       but    ;
that   by  acomplicated process he separated what         ismost pro
bably   saccharine    matter   of
                                a   peculiar nature, amounting to
 to per cent. this result was corroborated
               :                                   by   the action of
alcohol on the extract.
   But whether the saccharine matter exist in the grass as
sugar or as    a  peculiar substance,it   is  certain that alcohol       is
producible    from it   in  no very inconsiderable   quantity.   wasIt
stated   that  different   persons who conducted      the process for
the author produced different quantities. On one trial made
with more accuracy than the rest, and under the author-s
immediate inspection, twenty-six ounces and half of spirit
                                                    a
(S. G. 930) were obtained from 27£ avoirdupois pounds of
the grass, which did not amount to one half of what was
produced when large but proportionate quantities had been
employed, and in the hands of experienced distillers.
   The formation of 26-J- ounces of spirit certainly does not
at first sight seem to countenance the quantity of saccharine
matter as above stated. Had there been 10 per cent, present,
the whole quantity in 27    kpounds must be 19,200 grains:
these, according to Thenard-s experiments, would produce
9,856 grains of alcohol (S. G. 791), whereas but 4,560 were
really obtained. The latter quantity would indicate the exist
ence of no more than 4£ (nearly) per cent, of saccharine
matter.    But this offers no sufficient objection      rather
                                                          ;    it
offers a presumption in favour of the abovementioned sug
gestion, namely, that the sugar does not exist in an insu
lated form, but in such   acombination perhaps as to consti
tute   peculiar proximate principle.

    The fossil remains of organised bodies continue to occupy
 the attention    of naturalists.
    M. Traulle, of Abbeville,        has presented to the Class the
 petrified  head   of a small   cetacea,  which seems to have be
 longed    to  the whale  genus,    and  which  was dug up in the
 basin of Antwerp.       Count Dejean has sent one similar, and
 from the same place, to the Museum of Natural History.
 There were also found at the same time a great number of
 Vertebrae of animals of the same class, and several shells.
    M. Traulle also presented a portion of the lower jaw of a
 rhinoceros, found in the sandpits of the valley of the Somme,
 in the environs of Abbeville.
    M. Daudebart de Ferussac, a young military officer who
 has visited most parts of Europe, has profited by his leisure
 to notice fossils ; and as he has made a particular study of the
 shells found in fresh water, "tie applied himself particularly
to that sort of soil in the environs of Paris, exposed by
Messrs. Brongniart andCuvier, which, as containing nothing
 butfresh-water shells, appeared to these naturalists nottoowe
its origin to the sea, like most other secondary formations.
    M. de Fernssac has found similar strata, containing the
 same shells     and composed of the same substances, in the
south    of  France, in several provinces of Spain, in Germany,
 and even in Silesia; so that it seems to be no longer doubt
ful that it is formed everywhere.
    M. de Ferussac, in order to give more precision to his
 observations, turned his attention to the shells themselves,
determined the species with much rigour, and gave some
 good observations on the variations which they may undergo,
 and several correct notions which may distinguish the
genera.
    M. Cuvier has published in 4 volumes, 4to. .with many
 plates, a collection of all his memoirs on the fossil bones
 of quadrupeds.       He describes 78 species, 49 of which are
 undoubtedly unknown to naturalists, and of which sixteen
or eighteen are still doubtful. The other bones found in
 recent soils appear to belong to animals which are known.
 In- a preliminary discourse the author details the method
 which he pursued, and the results which he obtained. Rea
 soning upon facts which he has discovered, it seems to him
that the earth has undergone several great and sudden revo
lution^ the last of which (not more than 5 or 6 thousand

IVIr. William        Shires, formerly nautical master in the
royal navy, assistant to Mr. Sanderson, the mathematical
examiner, &c. having reflected upon the little satisfaction
usually gained by the common definitions of fluxions and
fluents, has taken upon himself to illustrate the same by
contemplating the augmentation of the falling body, whose
fluent is the square of the time, and whose fluxion is its
root = the time ; whence, if the augmentation was less than
the square of the time, the value of the fluent would be a
rectangle; but if the fluent was more augmented than the
square of the time, the fluent would be equivalent to a solid ;
and if uniform, or viz. not augmented at all, the fluxion
and fluent would both unite and become one, in which the
uniformity or time only would be measured.
   Having found these definitions to answer the intended
purpose, Mr. Shires intends to publish a small work on this
subject.— He considers no other definitions requisite at
present.

        March 20. — Heavy clouds and cool wind ; some small
     rain in the evening was succeeded by a clear cool night.
    Thermometer 2 P.M. 45°.
        Marchl\. — Fine clear morning. Barometer 29, 90.
     Thermometer at l P.M. 56°. During the day linear and
     other cirri appeared at no great height.    I observed about
    eleven o-clock in, the morning an unusual inversion in the
     order of the clouds, a long cirrus moving rapidly in a north
    wind, at right angles to its length, while at one end of" it
    cirrose fibres pointed to the N. and at the other end to the
    E.    In a higher region flimsy cumuli moved in a south,
    wind, and higher came over large flimsy and plumose
    beds of cirrocumulus in NW. wind ; afterwards cirrocu-
    mulostratus formed, and the sky became clouded at inter
    vals : the wind was strong below from NW.
       March 22. — Cloudy morning, followed by small rain,
    after which rainy features of the different modifications ap
    peared.     In the evening large confused cirrocumuli with
    some bars of cirroslratus appeared.      Therm. 5 P.M. 50°.
    Wind calm. The night became clear, with a breeze ; and
    Thermometer 39° at 11 P.M.
       March 23. — Clear morning; afterwards cumuli formed as
    usual, increasing towards midday. The night was starlight,
    but the stars did not shine bright, and there was a lucid

   the evening.
       March 96. — Fair day; cirrus, &c. in bands stretched
   along. Cirrocumulus of loose indefinite kind aloft ; cumuli
   sail along lower ; the cirri, &c. seemed to be diminished in
   proportion as the cumuli increased in size and density.
   Towards evening the cumuli disappeared, and high cirrocu
  mulus with obliquely descending bands of cirrus appeared.
  Therm. 11 P.M. 36°.
      March 27. — Fine day, with crimson forms of cirrus in
  the morning ; through the day large and dense cumuli
  formed, and at times obscured the sky. Fine dry warm

  during    the  day.
      March 28. — Clear morning, cirri flimsy and changeable
  with cumuli through the day ; cumulostratus broke out,
  when the cumuli below cirri increased in size and density.

Towards evening the cirri, &c. aloft were lost, and cumu-
lostratus covered the sky.         Therm, al 3| P.M. 65°. at 11
P.M. 53°. There was a strong electric smell at night like
the smell after showers have fallen on dry ground in sum
mer.

above large cumuli, &c.        Therm,     at 11 P.M. 34°.
    April 3. — Cold wind and slight showers of snow, which
did not lay on the ground ; in the intervals it was fine ; the
cumuli were very roeklike and tuberculated in the middle
 of the day, with cirrus above, and scud flying along below
them ; some of the latter passing rapidly along in the
wind in the evening, was in such a state of fusion that
it looked like loose and light-rcoloured smoke.           For several
days past the wind has been southerly, and to some electric
peculiarity is probably owing the low temperature of the
air with a wind frorh that . quarter.             Clear cold night.
Therm, at midnight 34*.
    April 4. — Clear, and cumuli through the day; at night,
?ome flimsy large features of cirrocumulus, &c. and a burry
moon.      Thermometer 51° at 4 P,M., at 11 38°. Wind

    Tk    Qn the Equilibrium       of a  Combination    of Beams, Blocks,

                                To  Mr. Tilloch.
     Sir, — Although            several   authors, who have written on
     Arches, Roofs,     8cc. have treated     the subject of Equilibrium
     Very extensively and with great adroitness, I have not stent
     in any work a problem of the precise nature of that which-
     herein follows; and which I conceive may be of consider
     able utility in practice, being easy of application.
         In all those problems bearing on the present point, that
     I have noticed, the centre of gravity of each block or beam
     is supposed to be in the right line that joins the points o£
     abutment; but cases occur, in practice in which that does
     not take place, and to these is the present problem pecu
     liarly adapted, though it is advantageously so to others:
     For instance, the rafters and slates of roofs have their com-
     inon centre of gravity higher than the rafters, though it is
     these which sustain the whole ; and fig. 3. herein referred
     to will point to other cases; and it will -be seen that this
                                                                          "
      circumstance is material to their position of equilibrium.
         The language of authors on this subject is not -always
      distinct, and is very likely to have been mistaken in regard
    to the words bars and beams, which are frequently used in
      problems of the kind in question under the supposition,
    .of. their possessing no weight, without its being so exr
      pressed ; and even when it is, it does not appear to me to
    "have been properly treated.                 "."•.•"       c - 1
    -    All  the authors . I .have consulted, speaking of a number
  -   of beams supporting each other in equilibrio, say the forces
      are in the directions of the beams ; and, certainly, -when
   : these    have no weight, but are merely props sustaining
    .weights at their angles, this proposition is true; but al-
   "low the bars or beams to gravitate, and to be the only gra

  -follow as if actually united weights were substituted for
      them ; yet it must be allowed that this is not matter of fact,

      and that neither the quantum of force, nor its direction,

      shown, as I trust will- soon appear.

322       On the       Equilibrium of a Combination of Beams,
    Let the beams AB, BC, and CD, fig.                         10. be      connected5
together by cords BB and CC, and freely suspended from
A  and D, and suppose them by their gravity to have taken
the figure represented, and consequently   that of equili
brium,    dcntinue the lines BB and CC both ways, and
their intersection at t will necessarily be in the vertical
that passes through the centre of gravity of the beam BC
at b.  Let a and c be the centres of gravity of the beams
AB    and   CD, from which                   let fall the verticals     as and cw,
•nttting       BB and CC continued, in s and tu Draw
            the lines
.«A and uD. The directions of the forces which sustain
the beams AB will be sA and sB; of those which
sustain     BC,         t B and /       C    ; and   of those which sustain
CD, uC and ?zD. But obviously and necessarily these are
not parallel to the beams, as generally shown in diagrams
of this kind : for taking any individual intermediate beam,
the directions of those which adjoin it not necessarily in
tersecting each other in the vertical that passes through its
centre of gravity, any forces supposed to act in their di
rections to sustain              it,
                       are not qualified to produce the equi
librium, and therefore do not subsist in fact.
   From     continue the line tBs to n, and parallel to uCt,
            s
and    Dw; draw sp and sr.                      The sides Aw, ns and              sA of
the triangle           Ans       are   proportional to the weight                of the
beam      AB,     to the force acting at             B   (=    the tension       of the
cord   BB) and to that acting at A, and in the same direc
tions.      The sides np,              ps,    and sn   of the triangle nps, are
proportional to the weight of the                      beam BC, to the force
acting at              (=   the tension         of the cord CC") and to that
                B, C
acting at              equal and contrary to that acting at                 B    (= the

D,     and to that at            6     equal and contrary to that acting at

    Now, if the cords BB, 06, were shortened so                           as  to
bring the ends of the beams to touch, keeping                       the latter
parallel, they would take the figure A BCD, and the di
rections and value of the forces would remain the same,
f f this latter figure be inverted, or rather the beams thereby
represented, it is known that the forces which have been
shown to take place, would be merely changed from those
of tension to those of compression, and the short-lines
drawn across the angles at A, B, 6 and D at right angles
to the forces which connect the beams, are such as, when
inverted with the beams, their ends should conform to, to
attain any degree of stability; but here is no indication of
these lines (representing planes) bisecting the angle formed
by the contiguous beams, as one author has informed us
 they ought.
     By these remarks, T do not intend in the smallest degree
 to impute blame to those authors I have had in view, but
 merely to point out what appears to me erroneous or de
 fective.

  keep the block AB in equilibrio, is also the same which is
  taken to represent the opposite force which helps to sustain
 the block BC; action and reaction being equal and oppo

     For it is known by mechanics, that if a number of bodies
 be sustained in equilibrio by two forces, their directions
must intersect each other in a vertical line that passes
 through the common centre of gravity of the bodies.
     It will also be found in the line ab joining their respec
 tive centres of gravity; and the intersection o of these lines
will be the common centre of gravity of the two blocks.
Also, for similar reasons the centre of gravity of the three
blocks A to D will be in the vertical dp; it will also be in
the line which joins the common centre of gravity of the
two first blocks, and that of the third CD, and at the in
tersection p of these lines will be the centre of gravity of
the three first blocks.     In like manner the centre of gravity

    LI.  OnEgypiian Ophthalmia.             By  William      Adams, Esq.
                             Surgeo"n   and   Oculist.
                                To  Mr. Tilloch.

    Sir, — The         violence and extensive dissemination of the
    purulent inflammation of the conjunctiva, under the appel
    lation of Egyptian ophthalmia, has made it too generallv
    known to require now any description of it ; and though
 "
    it has certainly become less destructive since very copious
    bleedings have been emploved, yet it has seldom, if ever,
    been completely subdued at its commencement                  by this or
    any   other  practice.      Under    this  state  of  practical  know
    ledge, in   the   treatment-  ot  a  disease,  the  rapidity  of w hose
  -progress     professional     men have     such frequent occasion to
    witness, it became a desideratum to obtain some remedial
    process which should arrest the morbid actions before the
    eye had sustained any serious injury. The success which has
    attended a mode of treatment suggested by mc for several
    persons labouring under this disease in the St. Panrras work
    house, has made me hope that this desideratum is now ob
    tained.
       The Egyptian ophthalmia had existed, in a most active
    and virulent state, among the children in the above esta
    blishment, for nearly two years; and had infected the at
    tending surgeon and the nurses.             During this period, the
    modes of treatment recommended in the publication of an
                    •
»                                                                   eminent

    *S30            . .".  On Egyptian Ophthalmia.
    eminent oculist, were tried to their fullest extent, under the
    euperintendance of himself and his son; and, though the
    vio-ence of the complaint was reduced, it was not eradi
    cated.
       On my being officially requested, by the acting com
    mittee of this parochial establishment, to undertake the
    treatment of -hese patients, I stated to the attending sur
    geon* of the house, Messrs. Uppom and Lewis, of VVarren-
   -*treet, Fitzrov -square, that some facts had come within my
    knowledge, which led me to beiieve that this alarming dis
    ease misiht be stopped iu its progress by the energetic use
    or" emetics.    Mr. Lewis, under whose care the ophthalmic
    patieeis princiallv came, undertook to superintend the ex
    periment in the first cases of the acute form of the disease
  .•winch should be brought to the infirmary.
       The process was simply to give such a quantity of emetic
    tartar as would keep up constant sickness and vomiting for
    eight or ten hours ; at the same time applying within
  .the eve lids some of the ung. hydrarg. nitrt oxyd. This
    succeeded perfectly.       Vomiting was then tried without the
    ointment, and was equally successful.
       The following extract from a document, written by Mr.
    Lewis, and sent to His Royal Highness the Commander in
    Chief, states a series of facts explanatory of the process,
    and its success.
       (t During the first fortnight of the
                                             present month (Janu
    ary 1813), thirteen patients with the Egyptian ophthalmia
    were admitted into the infirmary of the St. Pancras work
    house.    The treatment suggested by Mr. Adams was im
   mediately put in practice, and perfectly succeeded in re
   moving the disease in a few hours in every case except one,
   that of John Kenny.         This man had the ophthalmia three
   months since.         By large bleedings and blisters, his eyes
   were preserved, and the acute inflammation subsided; but
   tht disease ot the inner membrane of the eye-lid still re
   maned, and every trifling cold caused a relapse of violent
   inflammation.       At this time he had an attack of the acute
   disease in one eye.      In less than eight hours after the me
   thod proposed by Mr. Adams had been employed, the iuflam-
   mation was completely removed.           A few days after, the
   oiher eve became similarly affected.       For five days he per
   verselv delayed the methods which had preserved his other
   eve; when extensive ulceration of the transparent cornea
   took place, and vision in this eye was entirely destroyed.
       "  In all these cases, the extreme pain which attended the
   onset of the disease, together with the rapidly increasing
,                                                     inflammation,

        On    the geographical Position          of Lynn in Norfolk.       331
Inflammation, became almost immediately attested, by
Mr. Adams-s mode of treatment, and the patients have
been generally discharged from the infirmary in two or three
 days, with their eyes in as healthy a state as they were be
fore the attack of the disease."
    Since the above was written, Mr. Lewis has employed
this practice, with similar success, both in private practice
and in the infirmary.
    The powerful results of this practice, I think, fully en
title it to general consideration; and I hasten to lay them
before the public with the view of inducing its extensive
adoption, and of obtaining, through the medium of your
Journal, the information of that success which i anticipate.
    The only direction necessary is to exhibit the aniim.
tart, in doses adapted to the age and constitution of the
 patient, as soon ajter the commencement of the disease as
possible.       The ulcerative process frequently begins in ten
or twelve hours after .the accession of inflammation ; and it
is evident that the remedy, when that stage of the disease
 has begun, must be ineffectual, as is strongly exemplified in
 the case     of John Kenny*.

 Sir, — The         observations from which the following results
were deduced, were made in a room which stands about
 206 feet south of the ridge of St. Nicholas-s chapel in Lynn,
 and about 79 feet east of the meridian of the weather-cock
 upon the steeple of the same building : these distances were
 measured from the object glass of the transit telescope.
    The mean of 27 observations on the meridian altitude of
 the sun, taken with a sextant of 12 inches radius, made by
 Mr. Stancliffe, gave the latitude 52° 45' 23",7G N. And
    • The importance of this communication, containing a practical fact of
 such decisive utility, we trust will make a due impression on our readers;
 and that every opportunity will be taken to ascertain how far its efficacy
 extends.    In the instance before us, which we hope the experience of other
 practitioners will fully confirm, we see a disease of the most alarming nature,
 rapid in its progress, and speedily destructive in its results, arrested at itji

   passed through Lynn, called on me to know the time here.

   the result of the astronomical observations which he had
   made in Norfolk.       As he has settled the latitude and longt-i
   -tude    of a point of land, interesting to the" geography of
   this county, 1 lcok upon this part of his communication
   of too much value to be lost. I have, therefore, extracted
  "the following article from his letter. -

  Toiirt, Ke ihe most northerly point of Norfolk.                        In

    had many opportunities of trying.

   lias set these points often when one came open of the

    out further at Holm Point than it does at Scolt.              Now,       I
    bad six tolerably good obse; vat ions for the latitude of Scolt

LIU,   An Attempt to determine the definite and simple Pro
  portions, in which the constituent Parts of unorganic Sub

                      XII. Iron         and Oxygen.
The     examination of the degrees of oxidation of iron is in
jnore than one respect of great importance; its determina
tion being particularly concerned in the analysis of almost
every mineral.     Bucholz has shown by a series of very in
teresting experiments, that our knowledge of this subjecE
js very deficient, and he has endeavoured to supply the de
 ficiency.   But he employed for his experiments common
bar   iron,  which  contains a considerable portion of char
 coal ;  and not having taken this circumstance into the ac
 count; his results are become erroneous.
                               A.   Oxide   of Iron.
    1.) I dissolved four grammes of harpsichord wire, No. 6,
 in muriatic acid, applying a gentle heat, and collected the               -
 gas evolved by means of rain water.    It amounted, together
 with the atmospherical air of the vessel, to 66 decimal cubic
 inches, or thousandths of a cubic foot. The gas was burnt,
 by mean9 of an apparatus arranged for the purpose, in oxy
 gen, which had stood for several days over lime water, so
 as to be freed from carbonic acid.    During this combustion
 of the hydrogen some carbonic acid was formed; and
 this acid, when received in lime water, threw down a pre
 cipitate of carbonate of lime, which, when placed on a filter,
 and dried in a heat a little above the boiling point, weighed
 •165 gr.    Now, according to my analysis, the carbonate of
 lime contains 43-6 per cent, of carbonic acid ; consequently
 the • 1 65 gr. contained -07 1 95 of carbonic acid, the carbon
 of which weighed -02 gr. that          per cent, of the weight
                                             is,
                                               \
 of the iron. The solution             in
                                  the muriatic acid was greenish,

                      On definile Proportions,                3S3
and not perfectly transparent, but deposited no precipitate
after standing a few hours.        It was mixed with nitric acid
and boiled, in order completely to oxidate the protoxide :
the caustic ammonia then afforded a precipitate, which
when washed, dried and ignited, weighed 5-74 gr. Conse
quently 4gr. of this iron had gained 1-74, 100 parts having
taken up 43-5 of oxygen.         There was no reason to attribute
any part of this addition to the solvent, or to the precipitant,
both being volatile; and if they had not been perfectly washed
away, they must have volatilised ako some of the oxide.
Bucholz obtained from 100 parts of iron only 142 of the
red oxide; so that either some circumstance in his mode of
conducting the experiment must have occasioned a loss,
or his iron must have contained much more carbon than
mine.
     If now we subtract the carbon contained in the iron,
 there will remain 3-98 gr. of the pure metal, which afforded
 5-74 of red oxide; and 5-74 : 3-98= 100 : 69-34, so that
 the oxide of iron consists of                                   ,

                   Oxygen     3066          44-25
     This subject was so important as to require that the ex>
 periment should be repeated.         In order to obtain iron of a
ttniform quality, I had a large nail filed clean and divided
 into several pieces. .
     2. ) A piece of this nail, which weighed 7-1 grammes,
 was dissolved in diluted sulphuric acid, and afforded 117
  decimal cubic inches of gas, which, when burnt in oxygen,
  produced -285 gr. of carbonate of lime, containing -0344 of
  carbon, or not quite      \ per cent, of the quantity of iron.
  In the solution a black powder was deposited, which
  after drying weighed -006 gr. and was found to be silica
  blackened by a little carbon.
      3. ) Of the same nail five gr. were dissolved in pure nitric
  acid in a glass flask, evaporated to dryness, and ignited in
  the flask.    The oxide obtained weighed s-0025 gr          Con
  sequently 100 parts of the iron had taken up 43 -25 parts of
  oxygen.
      4. ) Another portion, weighing 3-5 gr. was dissolved in
  aqua regia, and precipitated by caustic ammonia.              The
   precipitate, after ignition, weighed 5 05 gr. ; so that 10O
  parts of iron had taken up 43-75 of oxygen.
      5. ) I dissolved 5-6 gr. of a thick polished iron wire in
  muriatic acid.      The gas obtained amounted to 93 decimal
   cubic inc ties, and afforded, after it hud been burned in oxy
   gen, -S25 gr. of carbonate of lime, containing -Q279 gr- of

    out this  essay 44| as the true proportion of oxygen in the
  red oxide with 100 of irdn.
      It is a remarkable inference from this, experiment, that
  our common and most malleable iron still contains carbon,
  which however does not exceed the proportion -of               pet     \
  cent.     In ill-m-anufactured bar iron, the quantity is cer
   tainly much greater, and hence may arise imperfections,
 .where no foreign substance can be discovered by the usual
 -modes of analysis.       The presence of silica, or rather of its
 •base, in "malleable   iron,   may also serve as a proof, that if
  an ore of iron contains an oxide of any other metal, this
  metal, which must always belesscdmbustible than silicium,
  must also continue mixed with the cast iron, and even not
. be completely separated      in the manufacture of bar iron, but/-
  always    remain  mixed   with  it in a small quantity. And the
  same must be true of sulphur and phosphorus.            Hence k
  appears how necessary it          in the examination of the faults

       If, for example, we add caustic ammonia to recently          a
    prepared solution of iron in muriatic or sulphuric acid, aad
    prevent the access of atmospheric air, even    considerable a

excess  of ammonia will not in this case be able to throw
down the whole quantity of iron ; the precipitate is white,
and the liquid standing over it retains its former colour.
If we admit the air, the fluid is immediately covered with
a blue pellicle, which becomes continually thicker, and ac
quires first a green and then a yellow colour; and the same
change of colour takes place in the white protoxide whicb
has already been precipitated.         The easiest mode of ex
plaining these appearances      would  be to suppose that iron has
three degrees of oxidation, that the white oxide is in the
lowest degree that it is present in these solutions, and that
it has in some respects a stronger affinity for the acid than
ammonia; but that when the air is admitted, it is further
oxigenized, is converted into the black or blue oxide, and
precipitates.     This explanation I have long thought satis
factory.
    If we leave a saturated and recently prepared solution of
iron in the muriatic acid, standing undisturbed for some
time in a high cylindrical vessel, and exposed to the open
air, and then introduce, by means of a glass tube, some
drops of caustic ammonia at different heights in the glass,
we shall find the precipitate at the top green, below this
blue, still lower grayish blue, dirty white, and lowest of all
quite white ; according to the degree in which the oxygen
 of the air has been absorbed.      If we digest iron filings with
a solution of sal ammoniac in a glass nearly full and- well-
 corked, a part of the iron will be dissolved in the sal- am*
moniac, the fluid will become alkaline, and will deposit
blue, green, and yellow oxide, when exposed to the air.
But with finery cinder the solution of sal ammoniac under
goes not the slightest change.       ,
    It was probably on this foundation that Thenard consi
 dered the white precipitate produced in these experiments as
 a protoxide in its lowest state of oxygenization ; and as he
 thought that he found for each oxide salts of different de-r
 grees of saturation, he has hence derived an astonishing
 number of sulphuric and prussic salts of iron."
    Bucholz, by a series of laborious and ingenious experi
 ments, has determined the quantity of oxygen of the prot
 oxide of iron to be 23 per cent., 100 parts of iron coitit
 bining with 29-88 of oxygen. If we calculate from the
 sulphur contained in the sulphuret at a minimum, the
 quantity of oxygen taken up by 100 parts of iron should
 be 20-4 or 29-5.      We have further seen that, in the sul
 phate  of the   protoxide,  100 parts of acid are united to so
 much    of   the  protoxide as will furnish 99"22 of the red

  oxide, containing 68-78 of metallic iron.      Now, 100 part*
 of sulphuric acid require, in the base by which they are sa
 turated, 20-29 of oxygen, and 68-78 : 20,29=100 : 29-5 ;
 a result which    agrees   very accurately with  Bucholz-s    ex-
 periments.
     I exposed ten grammes of crystallized sulphate of the
 protoxide of iron, in a retort, to a heat which was kept be
 low ignition, in order to drive off the water of crystalliza
 tion : they lost 4-63 gr. They were then kept in a state
 of ignition, until the acid was completely expelled, and they
 afforded 2-82 gr. of red oxide; which had consequently
 been combined with 2-842 gr.of sulphuric acid, and which
 pontain 1-95 gr. of iron.      The acid, the iron and the water
 amount together to 9-422 gr. The remaining -5/8 must
 have been the oxygen of the protoxide; and 1-95 "578 =
 100 : 29 6; so that 100 parts of iron were united to 29"6
of oxygen.
    Since in the dry sulphate of the protoxide of iron 100
 parts of sulphuric acid are combined with 68-78 of iron,
and the oxygen necessary for its oxidation, this oxygen must
 either be 29 5, according to the foregoing calculation, or
 22 I 25, half of that which is contained in the red oxide, for
 300 parts of iron.    It is easy to show that the latter suppo
 sition leads to consequences which do not agree with the
experiments ; and the former being supported by two dif
ferent modes of calculation, we may consider it as sufficiently
established that the protoxide of iron consists of
                 Iron         77-22        100-0
                 Oxygen . 25-78             29-5
    The truth of this assertion may be thus demonstrated.
If   we burn the -sulphate of the protoxide in a properly re
gulated temperature, the protoxide becomes" converted into,
an oxide at the expense of the acid, a part of which is de
composed, while another part passes over undecomposed,
or remains behind, according to the degree of heat em
ploved : the salt containing, for 100 parts of sulphuric acid,
84 or 89 07 of the protoxide, land requiring for its complete
oxidation in the first case 15-22 parts of oxygen, in the se
cond 10-15. Since in this process the1 sulphuric acid is
only reduced to the sulphurous, 15-22 parts of oxygen
would imply that three-fourths of the sulphuric acid, or
76j parts, but 10-15, that half only was decomposed, and in
the latter case we should be able to obtain from the salt oxi-
dased by ignition more than one-fourth of the sulphuric
acid unaltered.     In order to determine between these alter
natives, I took a portion of sulphate of the protoxide, cry-
                                                        stallize4

Stallized   in fine grains, having been lately prepared by the
solution of iron filings, and well wa"shed from the adherent
liquid; I filled with it a small glass retort 1{ inch long
and   J  of an inch in diameter, and exposed it in a sand
bath to a heat which was gradually raised to ignition. The
water of crystallization was collected in a receiver luted to
the retort, and the gas was carried off by a tube which
opened under water.         When the mass had been weakly
ignited for about an hour and a half, the evolution of
sulphurous     acid was almost entirely discontinued, and
drops of sulphuric acid appeared in the neck of the retort.
I now stopped the process, and suffered the apparatus to
cool. The residuum left in the retort was dissolved in
water, and afforded a reddish yellow solution, in which
caustic ammonia occasioned a red precipitate, without any
trace of a mixture of blue or green oxide.      The part which
remained undissolved in water was dissolved by boiling in
pure muriatic acid, and caustic ammonia was added to
both solutions. The red oxide thus obtained, weighed, after
ignition, 2-4 gr. and was not in the least magnetic, even
when it was rubbed into a fine powder, so that it contained
 no protoxide.     This oxide supposes the presence of 2-415
 gr. of sulphuric acid in the sulphate.      To the solutions in
 water and in muriatic acid as much more of this acid was
 added as was necessary for saturating the excess of am
 monia which had been employed; and then by means of
 the salt of baryta a precipitate of 2-92 gr. of sulphate of
 baryta was obtained, containing one gr. of sulphuric acid
 that  is, somewhat more than one-third, but not quite half
 of the whole sulphuric acid, that which was distilled over,
 as well as that which was converted into oxygen and sul
 phuric acid gas, being excluded from the account.          Since
 therefore less than three-fourths    of the whole quantity of
 acid is required for the conversion of the protoxide into ihe
oxide at its expense, the protoxide must contain more than
2"2-125 of oxygen for iOO parts of iron, and the former, not
the latter, of the proportions mentioned must be the true
one.
   Iron therefore has in this respect the same relation to
oxygen that sulphur has: in its highest degree of\pxy-
genization   it combines   with only half as much more
oxygen   as in its lowest: unless future experiments should
show that some lower stage exists in particular combina
tions of iron, which are yet little known; for example,
in the colouring substance of the blood. This circum-

   stance also explains why none of the salts of the oxide o£
   iron ohserves the same proportions with any of the known
   combinations of metallic iron and sulphur.
      What may be the difference between the white, the black,
   the dark blue, and the green precipitates from the salts of
   the protoxide, I must confess myself unable to explain.       Is.
   it not possible that they may be subsahs, the white of the
   protoxide, the dark blue and green, triple combinations,
   like the triple neutral salt, and containing the oxide and
   protoxide in different proportions ?    This at least appears
   to me to be the most probable conjecture.
      [In a future number, the reader will find a more satis
   factory account of the nature of these substances by Mr.
  Hausmann : Gilbert.       We have not yet seen Mr. Haus-
  mann-s Essay; but in the 6th number of Gilbert for 1811,
  we find the following remarks of our author: " I am im
  patient to read Mr. Hausmann's Essay on the Hydrates of
  Iron : he has communicated to me some results, which
  however do not agree well with my principles.             I have
  often tried in vain to obtain a pure hydrate of iron.       It is
  therefore impossible to  determine  the question satisfactorily>
 since the presence of a third body often influences the quan
  tity of water taken up, as my experiments demonstrate.
 My opinion of the nature of these precipitates is confirmed
 by the frequent occurrence of such compounds in nature.
 The black magnetic iron ores, for instance, contain an
 oxide of w hich the oxvgen is two, three or four times as
 much as the oxygen of the protoxide, notwithstanding the
 powdered mineral exhibits no traces of a red or un magnetic
 oxide.     The grass-green vitriol of iron, and Prussian blue,
 are both triple compounds of the protoxide and the oxide
 with the same acid."]

     From the experiments which I have here circumstantially
 related, the simple law of chemical affinity, which I stated
in the beginning of this essay, is demonstrated in a pretty
 satisfactory manner. They show also the truth of the re
lation which follows from this law ; that every acid re
quires an equal, quantity of oxygen in every base with
which it forms a neutral salt; so that the quantity of the
base, by which an acid is neutralised, depends on the ca
pacity of its inflammable radical for oxygen.         I consider
myself therefore as now authorised to employ these laws in
the analysis of the alkalis.

  sulphuret was powdery, and dark gray, without metallic
  lustre. I at first attributed this to impurities in the lead which
  I then employed ; but T afterwards found that it depended on.
  the presence of hydrogen. I had mixed ten grammes of re
  cently prepared sulphuret of lead with 40 gr. of ignited
  oxide, of tin, and heated the mixture in a small glass retort ;
  hence I obtained, with some sulphurous acid gas, a few-
  drops of water.       The same happened a second time; and
  as   1 had the instant before ignited both the substances, and
  had mixed them while still hot, the water could be derived
  from no other source than from hydrogen in the sulphuret.
  In fact, when I ignited some sulphuret of lead which had a
  metallic lustre, and had been prepared in a white heat, to
  gether with some oxide of tin, I obtained only a very slight
  trace of water, which clouded the neck of the retort.
      I was hence induced to make some experiments on the
  hydrogen contained in sulphur.           In these experimenis it
  was observed, that most powdered substances, which I had
  freed from moisture by ignition, when they were again ex
  posed to the open air, and then, without anv alteration of
   the moisture or temperature of the atmosphere, after some
  hours again ignited in a small glass retort, afforded some
  water in the neck of the retort, which however was only
  extricated after the temperature had been raised far above
  the boiling point.       Hence it is very difficult in such ex
   periments    to  avoid  the moisture, which adheres mechani-
- cally   to the  substance, and which always makes the result
  somewhat too great.
      Five grammes of sulphur, which had before been dried
  by fusion over a spirit-lamp, were mixed with fifty of the
  ignited protoxide of lead, and exposed, in a small glass re
  tort, to a temperature which was gradually raised. The
  retort was furnished with a small receiver, out of which the
   sulphurous acid gas was conducted into a glass tube, filled
  with muriate of. lime. When the retort had been ignited
  for half an hour, it had lost "9 gr. in weight, while the re
   ceiver had gained -157.         The water in the receiver was
   tasteless,  and  had a slight sulphureous smell.        Hence the
   sulphur in this experiment had afforded 3-15 per cent, of
   water. It could not have contained the whole of this
   quantity as adhering moisture, having; been previously in
   fusion: and the water must have been formed from the
   hvdrogen in the sulphur and the oxygen of the protoxide
   of lead. There remained in the retort a mixture of sul
   phate of the protoxide and sulphuret of lead.         The quan
   tity of water obtained indicates somewhat less than -4 per
                                                                cent.

  hydrogen bears no proportion to that which is contained
  in sulphuretted hydrogen, it can only be considered as an
  accidental impurity, arising from the mode of preparation
  of the sulphur, and inseparable either by fusion or by
  sublimation.      It appears therefore to be unnecessary to.
  consider sulphur, according to the ingenious hypothesis of
  Davy,    as a triple combination of sulphur, hydrogen, and
  oxygen ; for, if this idea were true, the quantity of hydrogen
  contained in sulphur would be required to be expressed by
  a number obtained by dividing the hydrogen of sulphuretted
  hydrogen by 2, 4, or at most 8 j which however is not the
  case.
                       B. Protoxide of Lead.
     Since the composition of the protoxide of lead has served
 as   the foundation of most of my computations, I have
 endeaVoured to examine this body with the greatest possible
 accuracy in the continuation of my experiments; I have
 not however been able to remove every difficulty, even after
 the repetition of the experiments which are now to be de
 scribed*
     I dissolved Q5 grammes of the same purified lead, which
 I  had employed in the experiments above described, in a
 class flask, in pure nitric acid j I dried the solution in the
 flask, and ignited the salt carefully, until the air which       I
 drew out of the ignited flask with my mouth through a
 long glass tube, no longer contained any nitrous vapour.
 The flask had now acquired an addition of 26925 gr. in

 the former series relating to the composition of the prot
 oxide of lead, and shows that this protoxide consists of
          Lead..      92-85          1000         12987

    From other calculations,      I think I may venture to assert,
that if these numbers represent the quantity of oxygen as
somewhat greater than the truth, it cannot still be less than
 7-633 for 100 of lead.       It is unfortunate that the bodies
which are the best adapted to afford foundations for compu
tation, take up the smallest quantity of oxygen, so that any
unavoidable inaccuracy in the experiments made with them
is proportionally of the greater consequence.
    f have therefore possibly been in an error when I have
set down the oxygen in the protoxide of lead as very pre
cisely equal to haff the quantity of sulphur which saturates
the same lead.

     1. ) I  dissolved 30 gr. of pure lead in nitric acid, put the
  solution into a platina crucible, with sulphuric acid in ex
 cess, dried it carefully, and ignited iu The sulphate of lead
-weighed 43-9 gr.          Consequently 100 parts of sulphuric
 acid were saturated by 278 77 of the oxide, precisely as in
 the former experiments.
     2. ) Thirty grammes of pure protoxide of lead were dis
  solved in nitric acid, decomposed by an excess of sulphuric
 acid, and dried and ignited in the platina crucible. The
 dried protoxide weighed 40-77 gr.; so that 100 parts of
 sulphuric acid had united with 278-55 of the protoxide.
  If I omitted to employ the sulphuric acid in excess, a part
 of it was driven away at a high temperature, by the nitric
 acid, and I obtained a mixture of the sulphate with the
 simple protoxide.
     3. ) I dissolved    15 gr.  of the protoxide of  lead  in nitric
  acid, evaporated the solution to dryness, dissolved the salt
 in water, and precipitated the protoxide by the addition of
 the sulphate of ammonia.           A little more sulphate of lead
 was separated from the clear fluid by the addition of some
 caustic ammonia.         The precipitate, collected and ignited,
 weighed     20-36   gr.
     4. ) The same quantity of the same protoxide treated with
 nitric and sulphuric acid in a platina crucible, gave 20-365
 gr. of sulphate of lead.
    According to these last experiments, 100 parts of sul
 phuric acid would saturate 279-59 of protoxide of lead. In
 my future calculations, I shall take for the proportions of
 sulphate of the protoxide of lead
           Sulphuric acid . . 26-385         100      35-8
           Protoxide of lead 73-615          279     100-0
    From all this it may be observed, how extremely difficult
 it is to obtain a perfect coincidence in the results of analy
 tical experiments; a portion of the weight which is scarcely
 if at all sensible on a loaded balance, has frequently a ma
 terial influence on the result of our calculations,       in which
 the error is often multiplied.
                          D. Sulphuric Acid.            ,
    I  have shown by my earlier experiments that the sul-
 phuret     of lead and the sulphate of the protoxide contain
 sulphur and lead in the same proportions. 1       If  now, accord
 ing   to the  first of  these  experiments on the sulphate (C),
 and according to my former experiments, 100 parts of lead
                                                               afford

                           On definite Proportions.                  345
afford 146-33 of sulphate of the protoxide, and according
 to the experiments on the protoxide (B) 7-7 parts must re
 present the oxygen of the protoxide, there remain for the
 sulphuric- acid 38-63, which must contain 15-42 of sulphur,
 that is,  as much as combines, with 100 parts of lead (A).
 Consequently         if38-63 ,parls of sulphuric acid contain
  15-42 of sulphur, this acid consists of 39-92 sulphur and
 60-08 oxygen.        But since in my experiments the quantity
 of sulphur       the sulphuret of lead
                 in                              all probability repre
                                                 is
                                                 in
 sented as somewhat too small, the sulphuric acid may pos
 sibly contain      very little more sulphur than this proportion.
                      a
 I    shall show, in the second part of this essav, that, to
judge from the calculations of the oxygenized carburetted
 hydrogen gas, of the oxide of carbon, and of sulphuretted
 hydrogen,       adegree of oxidation corresponding to that of
 the carbonic oxide must be possible for sulphur and that   ;
 the sulphur must -be to the oxygen very nearly             in the pro
 portion of two to one; and hope to make
                                    I                  itprobable that
 this state of oxidation of sulphur         found in the sulphuretted
                                            is
 muriatic acid. In this case, 15-42 parts of sulphur must be
 combined with 7-7 of oxygen.             The same quantity of sul
 phur,   with  2X7-7,    that   is, with  15-4, of oxygen, will con
 sequently constitute the sulphurous acid, and with              3x 7-7,
 or 23-1, the sulphuric.         According to this view of the sub
ject, the sulphuric acid must contain in 100 parts 40 03
 of sulphur, and 59-07 of oxygen, the sulphurous, 49-968
 of sulphur, and 50 032 of oxygen.                If
                                                  we calculate for the
 sulphate   of  the   protoxide    of lead,  according to these pro
 portions,   we  have 14-62      of this  sulphate for 10 of lead;
 and this   is precisely the result of the first of my former ex
 periments on this substance.
    From this view of the subject we may derive another
 mode of computing the composition of the sulphuric acid.
 We see that the protoxide of lead, which saturates given        a
 quantity of sulphuric acid, contains exactly one-third as
 much oxygen as the acid; and              must contain exactly half
                                           it
 as much oxygen as the sulphurous              acid by which        it
                                                                     sa
 turated, since the sulphites,        in becoming sulphates      by i?
                                                                     the
 absorption of oxygen, do not alter their state of neutralisa*
 tion. Now, since 279 parts of the protoxide of lead satu
 rate 100 of sulphuric acid, and these 279 parts contain
  19-95 of oxygen; consequently the sulphuric acid must
 contain in 100 parts 59-85 of oxvgen, which differs only
 by  To'0O from the former determination.               Supposing the
 analysis of the sulphate of the protoxide of lead to be slightly
 incorrect, and that for instance 100 parts of sulphuric acid
                                                                saturate

  346        Account   of a Meteor   seen at  London,  $&c.
  saturate 279-66 of protoxide, the experiment will perfecify
  agree with this calculation.     The difference of the propor
  tion thus determined for the sulphuric acid from that of
  40:60 for the sulphur and oxygen is so inconsiderable,
  that we may safely assume these numbers as the true ones.
  Hence the quantity of Sulphuric acid required for saturating
  a given base may be found by multiplying its oxygen by
  5 ; and that of the sulphurous acid, by multiplying the
  oxygen of the base by 4.
      VVe cannot expect to obtain complete accuracy in these
  analyses until we shall have ascertained, by a very accurate
  comparison of the specific gravities of oxygen gas and sul
  phurous acid gas, the exact component parts of the latter,
  as in the case of the carbonic acid.

  LIV.    Account of a Meteor seen at London and other
     Places on the Night of Monday, March 22, 1S13. By
     Joseph Steevens, Esq.
                          To  Mr.  Tilloclu
  Sir, — As     every phaenomenon in meteorology, however
 trivial, furnishes certain facts towards the improvement of
 that science, I take the opportunity of communicating some
 particulars relative to one that appeared on Monday night
 last. Being in the centre of Moorfields at 9h 22m, viewing
 the configurations of the satellites of Jupiter, (which at
that time were
                     *       •              *   *
                                     O            nearly) a meteor
of    the shape of fig. l. (Plate VII.) presented itself almost
in the field of the telescope ; its diameter was about 15', and
at first nearly stationary and not very bright ; it appeared
near the margin of the small thin black cloud from whence
it proceeded westward, which was in the direction of its
larger end.     By the time it had passed through 20°, it had
acquired a great brilliancy, at which, period it was so much
elongated as to occupy a space of 3° or 4°, the head being
very much flattened in the front, and the tail terminating
in a well defined point forming a very acute isosceles tri
angle.     At its first appearance there were several radiating
points projecting from it ; but after having proceeded about
30% the rays in front had formed themselves into globule*
of light, some of them perfectly unconnected with the
meteor, but still driven before it during its whole passage.
It proceeded westward, bearing rather to the north, and
                                                         described

             on the Nigkl of Monday, March 22, 1S13.       347
 described nearly a right line passing about 3° north of the
 Pleiades, and became extinct near another black cjpud,
 having passed through a space of" about Co0. However,
 irom its proximity to the earth, its apparent place, direc
 tion, figure of its path, &c. would vary very materially to
 spectators only a few miles asunder.
    1 understand    from a person who saw it at Hounslow,
 that it at first appeared to the east of the zenith, and (pro
 ceeded due west; and from another, who saw it at Harrow,
 that it appeared to descend almost perpendicular, and uearJy
 due south : he conceives that its duration was nearly half*
 minute.
    It appeared-as viewed from Hackney, by Mr. C. Parois-
sien, to be dpe west, and that it came nearly in contact
 with the apparent horizon before it was extinct. He con
 ceives its apparent diameter to be equal lo half that of the
 moon, and the intensity of the light much greater than that
of the moon. Its distance certainly could not be very
great, as I distinctly heard a hissing noise, like that of a
squib, as also a crackling like that of a cat-s back when
briskly rubbed with the hand.        Several sparks from the
 back part of its head were detached during its passage.
 It first appeared (as seen from the point where I was sta
tioned) about 2° north of Jupiter, in a line between him
 and the star Castor in Gemini, and proceeded in the direc
 tion laid down in fig. 2. Before it vanished, its velocity
considerably abated, and its brilliancy was very much re
duced.      Several of the globules of light were much en
larged, less luminous, and had receded to a distance nearly
equal to twice the diameter of the meteor ; the whole dura
tion was about 3".
    Having been engaged during the day in some experi
ments on the Croydon canal, which only occupied my at
tention at intervals, I had an opportunity of observing a
variety of changes in the atmosphere.        The morning was
•bowery    ;  the wind variable from SW"  to NW. Barometer
30,6 ; thermometer 44, at 9 A.M. The middle of the
day was more fine, sometimes quite calm, and the sun
bright ; about two o'clock several dark but thin clouds
arose in the south-west, occasionally approaching and re
ceding from each other, and at some times nearly stationary ;
but on their arrival near the zenith, slight squalls and
showers ensued : this continued at intervals for about an
hour until six o-clock, when it was perfectly calm along
the line of the canal, although the windmill of the grand
Surry (and which is 100 feet lower than the bank of the

 tion with two of the sails partly furled.          Ciouds now be
 gan   to  form  round   the  whole   horizon,    of  a dark colour,
and appearing to indicate thunder; the general mass re
 mained nearly stationary in the horizon, while small thin
 ones passed the meridian, most of them giving out a few
 drops of rain ; this continued till about a quarter past nine.
 Most of the clouds near the zenith disappeared, and two
 or three small meteors or falling stars displayed themselves,
 by darting nearly perpendicularly downwards.

 Analysis of the Qualities of tJie Painters of the middle Age,
    and their Parallel with those of the most eminent modern
    Painters.
       e now come to Raphael. Not only was this celebrated
 genius nearer antiquity, from the time in which he lived j
 but I am convinced that he formed in the midst of his
 career his taste and ideas rather upon ancient models which
 he incessantly studied, than from the influence of the works
of his eminent contemporaries.          The latter assisted him, it
 is true, in this imposing execution of clair-oscur, and
steadiness of pencil which have since constituted the best
 part of the grand style : but to the ancients and to his pre
decessors he was indebted for his chaste love of truth, and
 simple nature: it was to the ancients that he was indebted
 for that simplicity which charms in his figures and in his
dispositions; and above all for that expression which was
so much in unison with his great mind.            Who can explain
his sensations when he designed the animated figures of
 Masaccio, or studied the bas-reliefs and paintings of the
ancients ; or finally, when he translated into a better lan
guage     so  many images of the      painters of preceding cen
turies,    and whose     reputation    still resounds throughout
 Italy? This is impossible; but         it is beyond a doubt, that
what constitutes the difference         of succeeding     painters is
the union of the same qualities         which have     so  long after

        Dissertation     on the   Paintings     of the middle Age.        349
his time       constituted     the difference between the ancients
and the moderns ; and it is also beyond a doubt, that the
same man who exposed the drawings of Albert Durer in his
workshop, collected all those which the paintings since his
time could furnish, and which he frequently imitated.                     We
know besides, that this great painter maintained draftsmen,
even in Greece, in order to profit by all the models which
he thought could be useful.              Such therefore was the su
periority of this man           :  he   was   nourished by those very
fruits which we would reject, and found infinite resources
in pictures which we can neither appreciate nor bring into
use.
     I have only cited Raphael, as yet, for the sake of a more
striking comparison : nevertheless, every body knows how
infinite was the number of the painters of the sixteenth
cenAiry who were eager to drink at the same fountain.
How grand is the reflection thus presented to the mind !
It is clear that the art had degenerated, when we no longer
follow the excellent models of the middle age, or those of
antiquity, and when artists have recourse only to the mo
dern works of the mo'st famous masters of their own cen
tury. Indolent artists found it more easy and convenient
to march in the steps of the latter, than to go hack to more
ancient models, which have now perhaps vanished.
     Painters previous to the time of Raphael had therefore
studied the art by referring to ancient models ; but after
this great man, they consulted only recent productions ; so
that, in this art, the order of the elements has been per
verted, and there appeared on the earth a new and unnatural
style of painting, of which no nation was acquainted ; for,
if Apelles or Ztuxis were to visit our modern temples
and palaces covered with all the works of the art from the
Primatici to Svl"imene and Conca*, in spite of all the
talent of the painters who filled up this interval, these two
Grecian artists would have understood nothing of the style
 of painting of the three last centuries.                 I am of opinion
 that we might here indulge in a crowd of new specula
tions, by endeavouring to demonstrate the influence of a
degraded style of painting over the Christian religion, and
worship, — an influence recognised by all the followers of
paganism ; and which Christian priests have not always
    * When it is considered that these most
                                               famous artists of tire Neapolitan
school   exercised their arc in the finest climate of the world, just over the
ruins of Portici and Herculaneum, and those of several monumen"* which
they could examine daily ; we cannot help being keenly affected with this
influence of the schogls over the dictates of nature and good sense.
                                                                         taken

 taken into proper consideration.       What have we to oppose,
 in the schools of recent times, to the great and essential
qualities which have been perpetuated by the study of
the fragments of the ancients ?        An academic luxury, — an
abundance of shadows without substance, a corruption of
taste, and an absurd inclination of the human mind : finally,
a degradation of the art, which lost its nobleness and its
original objects : we ought here to confess, that since the
revival of letters under Leo X, the moderns have always
been too stupid or infatuated with all the pompous appa
ratus of new and increasing knowledge.            From this time,
pride    laid down   barriers  in  the schools, which isolated us
from antiquity; and notwithstanding the great examples of
some admirable men, contempt and a blind attachment to
routine exercised full sway.        What I here mark as worthy
of reproach, is rather, as has been shown, the vice of the
schools than that of artists in particular, and many painters
of undeniable talents permit us to guess how devoutly
they would have followed truth and nature : none of them,
it is true, had the liberty of profiting by the knowledge which
we have since acquired, nor the models which I have al
luded to ; for this return of good sense was reserved for the
artists of the present century.
    Before undertaking the analysis of the important qualities
which we trace in the productions of the middle age, w-e
ought to attempt a definition of the situation of all those
who are occupied         the cultivation of the arts; and we shall
                       in,
soon be convinced that the greater number are guided in
their theory, more by habitude, the dicta of authors^ the
exclamations of would-be amateurs, and the party spirit of
the day, than   hy  the effects of philosophy, and of constant

    If all the painters of Europe were at present agreed as
to the manner in which they ought to study the ancients
both as to style  in   general, and as to drawing in particular;
if  we saw them all marching with       a  uniform pace, and en
deavouring to lay hold of the grand maxims of antiquity,
which render the arts so durable,      it would certainly be very
absurd to propose^ to them as the subjects of their contem
plations, the productions of those very ancients impo
verished and almost extinguished, and to vamp up certain
works of the fifteenth century, which would have disgraced
the best days of Greece      :but as the innumerable collections
of all the modern schools present them with models of so
many different and opposite kinds, as authors, amateurs,

and rich speculators, do not cease to boast in the very
 same language of the myriads of pictures of all taste-s, all
styles, and all manners ; it is not surprising that amid this
confusion which astounds artists more and more, the
paintings of antiquity have lost their credit j and those
who praise them, only do it when forced to           it,
                                                    and without
endeavouring   to be  acquainted  with  them.   In   this state of
things   we  must  successively go   back  to the  fundamental
principles of the art.        If
                               we only derived from the com
positions of the middle age, the advantage of better appre
ciating the fine paintings of the ancients,        considerable
                                                     a
profit would he the result, and perhaps some docile artists
would be more easily brought back to the true path, whea
this same painting of recent times, which         less removed
                                                     is
from our present schools, would appear to them more esti
mable than they had hitherto imagined.

  When we attempt to study the disposition  the works      in
of the middle age, we always recognise an emulation of
the ancients, and we cannot doubt the respect which they
have maintained for the most famous models.            Whatever
certain amateurs of pictures of genii grouped and arranged
academically may say, the noble, simple, and uniform dis
position of these paintings         owing to the study of bas-
                                   is
reliefs, cameos, and engraved stones, which so many
routine authors interdict painters from imitating, as well as
from the study of ancient monuments, almost all of which
excel in the order of the arrangement, and           by
                                                     delicate cal
culations which are incomprehensible to vulgar organs.
Raphael, as well as other painters of his time, has fre
quently imitated this fine method; but subsequently the
influence of the Florentine style, the obstinate love of no*
velty, and of extreme variety, which was gradually intro
duced, altered the exquisitely       sim,p)e taste of this great
man.     We   see  him    collecting and sometimes crowding
his figures with  a  difficult art in given spaces     he seemed
                                                          :
to think of multiplying his plans more and more              comby
posing with richness; and hence that taste for arrangement
which at present deserves the blame of unprejudiced ama
teurs when they examine some of his paintings           so true
                                                           ;          it

and graceful.     But not only did Raphael, in his best in
spirations, and the immortal Poussin arrange like the an
cients, and like the most excellent painters of the middle
age; — the most eminent painters of the present day have
followed the same method : the picture so justly celebrated
of the Horatii, for which we are indebted to the pencil of
the first painter among th^ moderns, astonishes by the sim
plicity of arrangement. The pictures of Phaedra, of Pyrrhus,
of Psyche, Atala, and so many others, which have embel
lished the public buildings of Paris, received much of their
eclat on this account: in a word, all the sagacious artists in
Europe have added to their reputation by imitating the
maxims of the ancients*.

    Let                   to mention here the character of the
            me be permitted
figures,  before speaking of the action.
    We cannot hesitate to recognize, in the greater mosaics,
 the figures and even the most shapeless sculptures of these
 times, that noble taste and grave simplicity of ancient
 Greece, as well as that poetical style which we endeavour
 to gather from ancient mythology; and notwithstanding the
 perspective of the extremities of these figures, which hurts
an exact geometrical eye, the air of these divine and
apostolic heads, their dress, the form and masses of their
traits, the wisdom and dignity of their appearance, although
lessened by the feebleness of the art — every thing imposes
upon criticism; and the Saints so adroitly painted, so care
fully represented by the pencil of so many moderns, cannot
support these grand comparisons.        Let it not be thought
strange, if in speaking of an art which so many persons re
gard as a simple amusement, I boast of that gravity, a little
removed from our manners it is true, but which instead of
excluding expression permits it to appear with more unity
and force ; that calm gravity, which among the most an-
   * I cannot refrain from remarking here the fine arrangement of a paint
ing which Santa Bartholi has substituted for another, which is almost de

cause  it  exhibits several personages grouped.    As to arrangement in the
paintings of the middle age, Bosio, who has shown this quality in      a  great
number vof Roman sarcophagi, furnishes us also with examples in various
paintings.   I     shall quote among others that of the cemetery of Santa Ca»

Ciampmi, tome iii. pp. 16 and 17. We may also quote as models of good
arrangement, several pictures of the collection of M. Artaud, among others
that of Dello, No. 10, which unites several figures.

natural to mankind, as we may be convinced among all
nations; and as I have mvself remarked amidst (he bar
barous nations of America, Africa, and even of Italy, which
I have studied in this respect in these different climates*,.
   As to the pantomimes which express action, it must be
admitted, that since the period of the paintings of the ma
nuscript of Terence in the Vatican, attributed to the time
of Constan-tine, to the most trifling paintings of the same
kind which are to be met with, thev are clear, natural, and
significant. The subjects are understood easily, and at a di
stance ; no useless movements,           no equivoques, no forced
complications.       The  signs   are  not  so numerous as to be
more striking.       What may we not erect upon such simple
and solid bases, and what force may we not add to these
elements of expression, true science, and the cultivation of
drawing-?     Is     not these very pantomimes, strong

clearness,  and   so  expressive in   point of naivete,  which  still
constitute the glory      of Raphael, Foussin, and the greatest
painters of our days         ?   useless to recall here those heads
                                 It    is
full of life which have excised the admiration of the critics.
But even    if we should not have our own eyes as judges,
could we withstand the sentiments of some writers who
have been struck with the expression of the painters of
these times, and among others with the testimony of St.
Gregory Nazianzen, who informs us that he never cast his
eyes on    apicture in which was represented the sacrifice of
Isaac, without being violently moved and without shedding
tears, — so well can painting pourtray this tender scene                         !
Finally, from the pious resignation of the virgins rfnd
martyrs — from the ferocious image of the executioner, to
the chaste and ingenuous grace of the Mater Dei                these  ;

 354 Dissertation on the Paintings                    of   the middle       Age,
  what all the world has observed ? I wish to speak of that
  trivial corruption of taste in this particular work to be
  ascertained in the succeeding schools,        who abandoned
  that fine arrangement  which    we  admire in  ancient dresses,
  and which have been preserved down to the time of Ra
  phael, when so many artists were influenced both by the
  ridiculous usages of the habits and eccenrric formed stuffs
  of those times ; and by the mannerism introduced by some
  rash master; a character which was so easy of imitation,
 and to which we owe that enormous heap of stuffs, and
 those barbarous adjustments which are insupportable to the
  sight. I ought to add here, that the art of the most emi
 nent painters of our days is still related in this respect
 with antiquity : and notwithstanding the respect which we
 owe to the Carracci, to Guido, who have been constantly
 imitated and praised in this respect, who has not remarked
 how much success modern art has obtained by this single
 reform ?    And who does not prefer the taste of the costume
 received in our best paintings to those conventional        and
 shocking lazzi with which a depraved taste loads our
 most famous pictures ? It is proper to add here, that the
 veneration for the schools of Italv still propagates doubts,
 that the writers who have determined the limits of the two
 arts of sculpture and painting have gone too far, and have
 exaggerated the demarcations in order to justify so many
 celebrated painters : finally, that the best method of fixing
 our ideas on the subject of the draperies in our art, is to
 contemplate the examples left by the ancients, and to me
 ditate upon the effects still exhibited in this respect by the
paintings of the middle age*; and it is so very true that we
have few things to change in painting, in the imitation of
the draperies of ancient sculpture, that in the decorations
in which the painters are liberated from the trammels of
the school, and where they have literally translated the an
cients, these same draperies bear an excellent character ,not-
 Messiah, that of the Virgin anil the Infant Jesus, or the naivete of the young-
 persons who throw draperie* under the footsteps of our Saviour when en
tering Nazareth, we find several paintings remarkable for a sage and
 well reasoned expression.      See that of the Cemetery of Saint Priscilla,

     It is totally useless to speak here of the ornaments of
the paintings. of the middle age: the unanimity of opinion
on the delicate taste of those models which are perpetuated
without mixture renders this analysis unnecessary.                       I shall
now conclude by a few reflections on their colouring.
                             On their Colouring.
     I shall not dwell long upon the colouring of the paintings"
of the middle        age.     I shall only remark, that the crudity
and discordance of the colours are much less revolting when
the whole system of colouring is lively and luminous, like
that which was employed in those times, than when the
colours are dull and heavy like those used with oil. This
 reflection may involve a question on the subject of colour
ing, which it is unnecessary to explain here. I merely
throw out the idea, to diminish the aversion which those
have for brisk and entire colours who do not take any but
oil paintings into the comparison. To conclude: the fine
Guido of Sienna of the height of six feet, which is to he
seen in the cabinet of M. Arlaud, is painted in a most de
licate tone, and with that commixtura colorum of Pliny
which brings to our recollection the best schools of the
ancients.
     I have endeavoured in another Essay*, by quoting some
 pages from the second edition of M. Artaud-s work, to
 prove that painting in oil had deprived the art of its naivete"
of colouring.          I have ai tempted to show the inconveniences
of this painting so much spoken of, and which was pro
bably known and rejected by several nations on account of
its interminable         obscurity, and of which latterly John of
Bruges was unable to foresee the slow carbonisation.                             I
shall not here repeat the ideas which 1 then hazarded; but
I shall content myself with saying, that I am convinced
that the restoration of a more natural and true process
may have a very important influence upon the arts by the
analogy of expressed truths : full of these ideas, and guided
by the desire of being useful, I have made constant efforts
 to recover the material painting of the ancients.                       I hope
 that the experiments which I purpose to make known, will
 determine all unprejudiced artists to employ the processes

of an unalterable and          easy   description, and which can hand
down to posterity the glory and genius of our artists*.
     I think I have demonstrated that the principal parts of
painting were preserved in the middle age, and that as soon
as the art of designing had loBt its strength and accuracy,
the claire-oscure was almost forgotten, the art of colour
ing" very little cultivated, and the execution very often
despicable       :  what remained nevertheless formed those qua
lities which were most difficult to recover among altered
manners, qualities grand and simple, which constitute the
character and dignity of the art, and the loss of which th«
 boldness of our most intrepid artists can never repair.
                                   Conclusion.
      T  conclude from all these observations,            that the paintings
 of the middle age are the records of the precious doctrines
 of ancient art; that they are not vitiated, and that they
 ought not to be confounded with some barbarous and man'
 nered works painted during the sixteenth and seventeenth
 centuries in the north of Europe ; that they have formed
 our greatest painters; and that those only have a right to
 neglect them, who have attained the climax of the best
 models of antiquity : — in a word, that artists ought to ob
 serve and study them without intermission, and as easy
 versions, calculated to explain the secret idioms of a lan
 guage which is of most difficult attainment.
      * It ought to be remarked , that most of the paintings of the middle age,
 existing in cabinets, have very rarely preserved their primitive colours, con
 sidering the practice of reviving them by means of varnish. I shall not
 here speak of all the ravages or decompositions which may result from this
 method, when indiscriminately employed upon paintings the materials of
 which have not been previously studied.          In general, it is very rare to
 find paintings, either antique or Gothic, which are really originals (vierges),
 and which do not exhibit some alterations proceeding from restorations.
      It seems that the famous painting of Colantooio, dated 1436, which is pre
 served at Naples, was the occasion of so manv disputes, only because it was
 afterwards covered, like many others, by a slight coat of oil : the same per
 haps may be said of those contained in the Gallery at Vienna ., one is dated in
  109O, the other in 1292.     This last i3 the work of Thomas Mutina, a Bohe
 mian gentleman.        Some others of the same gallery are dated in the middle
 of the fourteenth century, and are by Theodoric of Prague and Nicholas
  Wurmser of Strasburg.      Now John of Bruges died about the middle of the
  fifteenth century, in 1441.    Upon the whole, without having recourse lo
  numerous works upon this subject, it is scarcely credible that the use of oil
  in painting had never been, imagined before the existence of that celebrated
  Fleming, who being a chemist could perhaps put in practice ancient recipes,
  the principles of which were well known.                       /

  tVIT.    Case    of Hydrophulia aired in India ly Bleeding,
 ..  By John Shoolbued, M.D.                    From the Supplement        to
     the Calcutta Government Gazette, June 8, 1812*.
     Tuesday, May 5, 1812. — About 3 P.M. Ameir, a Mu,
  selman Bhestie, from 25 to 30 years of. age, and middle
  stature, in the service of Mr. John Wood, schoolmaster, at
  Chowringbee, was brought to the Native Hospital, labour
  ing under the most unequivocal symptoms of hydrophobia.
     The note from Mr. Wood, requesting admission for this
  patient, and the friends who accompanied him, stated that
  he had been bitten in the leg about three weeks before, by
  a dog believed to be mad, and that the symptoms of his
  disease had appeared that morning, the 5th.
     I visited him in the hospital, the moment I heard of his
  arrival, and found him sitting on the side of a cot, with an
  attendant holding him by each arm.                 The first view was
  sufficient to satisfy me of the nature of his complaint. H"i3
  body, arms, and throat were affected with constant and un»
  controlable spasmodic startings.             The muscles were thrown
  into quick convulsive action at each inspiration, drawing
  back the angles of the mouth, and at the same instant de
  pressing the lower jaw, so as to communicate                  the most
  hideous expression to the countenance.               His eyes appeared
  starting from their sockets and suffused with blood ; some
  times fixed in a wild and terrific stare ; at others, rolling
  about, as if they followed some ideal object of terror, from
  which he apprehended immediate danger.                  A viscid saliva
  flowed from his mouth, which was always open, except
  when the lips were momentarily brought together for the
  purpose of forcibly expelling the offensive secretion that
  adhered to them, and which he effected with that peculiar
 Jcjnd of noise, which has been often compared tq the bark
  ing of a dog.         His temples and throat were bedewed with
  clammy moisture.          His respiration was exceedingly hurried,
  and might more properly be called panting than' breathing;
  or, it still more nearlv resembled thai short and uninter
  rupted kind of sobbing, that takes place when a person
 gradually descends into the cold hath.              He was exceedingly
  impatient    of  restraint,     and    whenever he could get a hand
 disengaged, he immediatelv struck the pit of his stomach
  with it — pointing out that part as the seat of some unde-
-scribable uneasiness.            From the constant agitation of his
  whole frame and the starlings of his arms, it was impossible
    11 Our readers will recollect that

  to count his pulse with exactness ; it was, however, very
   unequal, both in strength and frequency; at times scarcely
   perceptible, and then rising again under the finger; some
   times moderately slow and regular for a few pulsations, and
  immediately after, so quick as not to be counted ; but con
  veying, upon the whole, an idea of a greatly oppressed and
  impeded circulation.       His skin was not hot ; and though
  his head was in incessant motion, accompanied with such
  savage    expression and contortion of countenance as might
  easily have alarmed those unaccustomed to such appear
  ances, he made no attempt to bite ; which is far from being
  a frequent symptom of the disease, and, when it does oc
  cur, must be considered merely as an act of impatience at
.being held — and no more than the peculiar noise above no
  ticed, as indicating any thing of the canine nature imparted
  hy the bite, an opinion which has been sometimes fancifully
  but absurdly entertained.
      When questioned concerning his own feelings, or the
 cause of his illness, he was incapable of making any reply;
 being prevented, it is probable, either by the hurried state
 of his respiration, or bv his mind being too deeply absorbed
  in the contemplation of horrible ideas, to admit of his at
  tending to the queries addressed to him.
      I desired water to be offered to him ; at the mention of
 which he started with increased horror and agitation, arid
 endeavoured to disengage himself from those that held him.
 When one of the attendants approached with a cup of wa
  ter, he looked at it wishfully, and after some efforts, with
 apparent reluctance, stretched out his hand to take hold of
 it; but before he could reach the cup, his hand was sud
 denly drawn back by a convulsive motion : at the same in
 stant he turned away his head, and writhed himself round
on the bed in an agony of terror and despair, wholly in
 conceivable by any person who has not been a, witness of
 the horrors of this most dreadful, and hitherto, it may be
 added, most irremediable of human maladies.
     Such was the state of the patient at the moment of his
 admission, and for the few minutes that necessarily elapsed
 while these appearances were passing under my observa
 tion.
     Of the nature of the complaint there could not exist a
                                                    "
 shadow of doubt ; and having 60 recently read in the
 Madras papers a case of hydrophobia successfully treated
 by Mr. Tymon, of His Majesty-s 22d dragoons, by bleed
 ing, mercury, and opium, I determined on the immediate
 adoption of the same plan.
                           .
                               Z4                        I there-

360     Case   of Hydrophobia  cured in India  ly Bleeding.
   I  therefore without delay opened- a vein in the right arm
by a large   orifice, out of which the blood sprung with un
common impetuosity, and of so florid a colour as to resem
ble arterial rather than venous blood.        By the time that
sixteen or twenty ounces of blood had flowed, the spasmo
dic starlings of his arms, body, and neck had considerably
diminished, his breathing had become more calm, with less
contortion of countenance, and he audibly acknowledged
that the pain about the praecordia and region of the stomach
was upon the decline.        Encouraged by these incipient ap
pearances of amendment, I allowed the flow of blood to
continue ; and w hen about two pints were taken away,
seeing him greatly composedj I desired water to be again
offered to him — when,. equally to ftiy astonishment and de
light, he took the cup in his left hand, the blood still flow
ing from the right arm, and calmly — but with indescribable
expression of satisfaction, drank two or three ounces of
water— the sight of which but a few minutes before had
thrown him into the most dreadful agonies.             Soon after
swallowing      the water, he retched  three  or  four times, but
ejected nothing but saliva from his mouth and fauces ; and
finding now thai his pulse was 104, weak, soft, and regular;
that he was become faint, and that all appearance of un
easiness had ceased, so as to allow him to take a second
draught of water, about four ounces, I closed the vein and
laid him down on the bed.        At this moment he expressed
a desire to have a natural alvine evacuation,      and wished to
go nut -of the hospital for that purpose; but as that could
not be complied with, he took no more notice of it at this
time.     It is worthy of remark also, that during the bleed
ing    he made   a sign to have himself fanned, a thing I never
knew a hydrophobic patient to do before ;— their distress
being so uniformlv increased by any current of air blowing
upon thtm, that, according to all my experience, the dread
of air in motion is as constant an attendant on the disease
as the dread of water itself.
    After the bleeding he remained perfectly quiet, and fell
into a slumber for about an hour; — -another circumstance
 which also 3ifongly marks the abolition of the disease, as
 no hydrophobic patient     was ever known to sleep.       When
 he awoke, he exprts-ed a wish to have some sherbet ; which
 was immediately given lb him, and he drank four ounces
 of it with perfect ease. He then fell into another slumber,
 during vt hich seme convulsive startings were again per
 ceptible about his arms, chest, and face, bui not strong
 enough to wake him.        At a quarter past five he spontane

      Case  of Hydropholia    cured in India by Bleeding.   361
ously awoke, and appeared again somewhat agitated, with
more suspicion in his looks, and of apparent doubt whether
he could swallow as well as before; for when he took the
cup, he put it to his lips with a quick motion, and gulped
down about four ounces of water in a hurried manner, as if
afraid that the difficulty of swallowing would be increased
by a moment-s delay.       He also put his hand to the region
of the stomach, ana said that the pain in that part was re
turning.    These threatening appearances of relapse deter
mined me to hazard a further detraction of blood.       I there
fore immediately opened a Vein in the left arm, and allowed
the blood to flow again till he completely fainted ; but pre
viously to this effect of the bleeding, the pain at the sto
mach had ceased ; and while the blood was yet flowing he
had again drunk four ounces of water without fear- or
disgust. When he recovered from the fainting fit, he
retched several times, but, as before, discharged nothing
but saliva.
    At the end of the first bleeding his pulse was 104 5 im
mediately before the second, it was 96, with a slight degree
of sharpness in the beat ; and after recovering from the
fainting occasioned by the second bleeding, it was 88, re-
        soft, and feeble, and he now complained of nothing
fular,
   ut extreme weakness, and giddiness of the-head.          And
at this stage of the case, I apprehend, it will be allowed
that the cure        of the hydrophobia was complete —
whether it would be permanent or not, remained yet to be
seen.
    When I began the treatment of this patient, it was my
intention, as I have said, to follow in every circumstance
the practice pursued in Mr. Tymon's successful case ; and
accordingly, a draught with 100 drops of tincture of opium,
and an enema of 300, were in readiness to be administered
immediately after the bleeding.       But seeing the surprising
effects of the bleeding alone, and feeling convinced that the
disease was, for the present at least, completely annihilated
by the copiousness of that evacuation, I determined to pre
serve the treatment as shnple as possible, in order that, if the
 patient did finally recover, it might with certainty be known
to what he owed his safety ; and that thence the applica
 tion of the same practice to future cases of hydrophobia
might with the greater confidence be recommended : — a re
solution in which I was the more confirmed, from having
 heard some medical friends, whose opinions are entitled to
every degree of respect, ascribe Mr. Tymon's success to
the mercury he had used, rather than to the bleeding.

   362    Case   of Hydrophobia    cured in India by Bleeding.
      I am now fully persuaded, however, that I might safely,
   as far as the hydrophobia was concerned,         have omitted all
  remedies after the bleeding; but thinking that calomel and
  opium in repeated doses were more likely than any thing
  else, to induce that state of the system which would be
  least favourable to a relapse ; and also that if the patient,
  notwithstanding his present promising appearance, did not
  finally recover, it would certainlv be said that I had not
  given him a fair chance, by departing in any particular from
  the treatment which had proved so successful in the hands
  of Mr. Tymon, I was inclined to conform to it so far, as
  to order four grains of calomel and one grain of opium to
 be given every three hours.
     The first pill was taken at a quarter before six ; but it was
 immediately rejected, followed by some water.            A second
 was given five minutes before six, and remained.          He now
  slept  till  seven —  then drank   some  more  water, and   had a
  natural   evacuation    of his bowels  ; — another circumstance
  which, confirmed me in the belief that the disease was
 completely and permanently subdued — having never before
 seen in my own experience, nor read in any history of the
 disease, of such an occurrence as a natural action of the
 alimentary canal in a case of hydrophobia.
     At nine he took another pill, and again at twelve — and
 continued to slumber and drink water as often as he/
 pleased.
     Wednesday, May 6th — (2d day) six A.M. Has passed
 the night well. Took a pill at three, and another now.
 Has drunk water frequently. Pulse 84. Skin cool. Tongue
 clean at the edges — some remains of betel, eaten before he
 was taken ill, covered the centre part.         Two more alvine
evacuations during the night.          Complains of head-ache— •
but is entirely free from uneasiness about the stomach.
     On examining the blood drawn yesterday, it is found not
to be in the least convex — neither does it exhibit the slightest
appearance of what is called the buffy coat.          The quantity
first drawn, making allowance for the evaporation of the
night, measures 40 ounces ; and the last between seven and
 eight.
    Nine A.M. — Took another pill, which was followed by
another       evacuation ; and in half an hour afterwards he
ate eight ounces of sago.        Is quite composed, and can an
swer questions distinctly concerning the accident and sub
sequent occurrences, till the time he was taken ill.

      Case   of HydropJiolia cured in India hj Bleeding.         363
 Russapuglah,     to his master-s at Chowringbee, he saw a
 pariah dog   seize  a fisherman, and bite him.         Several peo
 ple were collected     at the spot —   he  also approached, when
 the same dog. ran at him, and as he was retreating before
him, bit him in the back part of the right leg, about six
 inches above the ankle, where he shows t*o scars at the
 distance of an inch and a half from each other, but with
 out any appearance of inflammation or thickening of the
 integuments.      The dog, after biting him, disappeared, and
he does not know what became of him or of the fisherman.
The wounds bled a good deal ; but not being very deep, they
 soon healed without any application.           He took no remedy,
except, on the day     he  was  bitten,   a  small  piece of scarlet
 cloth (soaltanee lanat) wrapt Op in a piece of ripe plantain,
which was recommended to him as an infallible antidote
against infection from the bite of a mad dog.              He never
 saw any one in hydrophobia ; and though he had heard that
persons bitten by a mad dog were liable to such a disease,
jibe apprehension of it never dwelt on his mind, or scarcely
 ever occurred to him after the day on which he was bitten.
 He continued in his usual health till the 4th instant, seven
 teen days after the bite, when he found himself dull, heavy,
 and listless, with loss of appetite and frequent apprehension
 that dogs, cats, and jackalls were about to seize upon him.
He also felt a pricking sensation in the part bitten. When
his mother-in-law brought him his breakfast, he was afraid
to eat it. He continued his business, however, of taking
.water from the tank to the house, till about noon of that
.day, after which he could not bear to look on or to touch
 the water, being constantly harassed, whenever he at
tempted to-do so, with the horrible appearance of different
animals ready to devour him.          He now, for the first time,
thought of the disease arising from the bite of a mad dog,
was convinced that was the cause of his present distress,
and fully believed that he should die of it.        He ate no sup
per, nor drank any water that night, in consequence of the
horrible phantoms that incessantly haunted his imagina
tion. In the morning, all his horrors were increased, the
spasms came on, accompanied by anxiety, oppression, an<J
pain about the pra^.cordia a.ud stomach ; and those about
him say that he continued to get worse in every respect,
until he arrived at the hospital in the state already described.
He does not himself distinctly remember any thing that
happened during the whole day.            He has some faint recol
lection of having been at his own house ; but how he got
therer-rwhen. he left it — or by what means he was brought

  564     Case  of Hydrophobia cured in India by Bleeding.
  to the hospital, he does not at all know.        The first thing
  he can recall to his mind is drinking the sherbet — and he
  savs he has had his senses perfectly since that time — and
  that all his fears then left him, and have not since returned.
  This however is not entirely correct, as he acknowledges
  that he does not recollect the second bleeding, which shows
  that the disease had then so far returned as again to disor
  der his mental faculties.
      Half past ten A.M. — Complains of severe head-ache,
  and his eyes are more suffused than they were in the morn
  ing. No return of other symptoms.
      Head shaved, and six leeches applied to each temple.
     Three P.M. — Took a pill at twelve, and another just
  now. Leeches bled freely.          Head-ache relieved. Took
  eight  ounces  more  of sago  about noon.
      Six P.M. —  The same. Has now taken 28 grs. of calomel
  and seven of opium. To take from this time only two grs,
  of calomel and half a grain of opium every three hours.
      Nine P.M. — Has slept for two hours.       Pulse 80.    Took
  another of the pills last ordered ; also some more sago.
  Copious bilious evacuation.       Still complains of giddiness,
  but  not  head-ache.
     Thursday, the 7th, (3d day,) six A.M. — Took a pill at
 twelve, but refused one at three, saying his mouth was sore.
 Took one now. Has been rather restless in the night.
 Threw up some bile this morning.
     Ten A.M.— Exceedingly distressed with excessive secre
 tion of bile, which he is frequently throwing up and also
 passing downwards in great quantity ; and of a dark green
 colour.     Pulse 110. Some heat of skin — expression of
 uneasiness in his countenance — burning sensation all over
 the abdomen j but quite different, he says, from the former
 pain about the stomach.       He was ordered a pint of infusion
 of camomile, which brought off much bile. At eleven,
 eight grains of calomel, and at half past twelve, half a dram
 each of jalap and magnesia.       From the effects of these re
 medies, he was much relieved in the evening ; though the
 complaint continued to disturb him in the night, and it was
 necessary on
     Friday morning the Sth, (4th day,) to promote the further
.evacuation of bile by senna, manna, and cream of tartar ; and
 to order an enema of conjee to allay local irritation.       Pulse
 only 80, soft.     Burning removed from the abdomen.           Ate

    Saturday 9th, (5th day,) nine     A.M. — Has    passed  a good
                                                             night.

  night.     Excessive secretion of bile has ceased.         Clamoro-is
  for food — but I allow him only rice and sago— declij.is
  milk. He appears now to be free from all complaint.
  After this time nothing remarkable occurred. He had a
  strong appetite, and was allowed vegetable curry. For se,
  veral evenings some heat of skin and acceleration of palsy
  were perceptible ; but these soon went off, from cold bathing
  and a constant attention to keep his bowels in an open
  state.
      Monday, May 18th, (14th day.) — Has been for some
  days past on the usual hospital diet — and feeling himself
   well in every respect, now expresses a wish to be discharged
   and return to his usual business ; but as the weather is ex
   ceedingly hot (thermometer in the shade from 95J to 100°),
   I have prevailed upon him to continue in the hospital till the
   setting in of the rains. — r shall then, if possible, persuade
  him to remain in my own employment for the next twelve
  •months; lest, if he were discharged, and should happen to
   die of whatever disease, it might be alleged that he was aiter
   all carried off by a relapse of the hydrophobia.

    The     author has very laudably endeavoured to render the
    difficult subject of crystallography familiar to persons un
    acquainted with geometry.            The task was somewhat ar
    duous; but those who cannot comprehend his figures and
    descriptions, may have recourse to his models, which super
    sede the necessity of mathematical knowledge.               His mo
    dels amount to fifty, his figures to 103,             which  embrace
    nearly all the different forms of crystalline bodies.               As
     crystallography is rather a new science, the necessity of ele-
.   mentary or introductory treatises on it must be obvious.
     Hitherto nothing of the kind has appeared either in France

commenced to solidify, was decanted from the crystallized
part." Water also crystallizes by the abstraction of caloric,
and snow is often found crystallized in stellae with six

though Dr. Hooke many years ago published similar figures.
   Benzoic acid furnishes a familiar example of crystalliza

The instances of crystallization produced by chemical affi
nity are very numerous. The most simple and easy ex
periment of this nature          is,   by
                                 adding highly rectified spirits
to aqueous solutions of the salts, when the spirits and
water unite, and the salts immediately resume their crystal
line state. The crystallizations of silver, lead, zinc, &c.
are now become nursery amusements.             Large and perfect
crystals, however, are still rarely produced           byart.  Mr.
Sims,    of  Norwich,    has  been more   successful  in obtaining
curious and magnificent crystals, than any other chemist
of the age. Time, space, repose, light and air, are neces
sary to crystallization.      The effect of Tight on solutions of
muriate of ammonia and prussiate of potash, when placed
to crystallize,      curious, and tends to prove the materiality
                     is
of light. The crystallization of those salts may be directed
at pleasure     bythe introduction of light at one side or an
other of the vessels containing their solutions. Camphor
displays the same affinitv for light.       The electricity of cry
stals is    also noticed         Mr. A. The principal crystals

    April 29. — The Society met after the holidays.           The
 Earl of Morton in the chair; when the reading of a paper
 an the Alcohol of Sulphur, or Sulphuret of Carbon, by
 Professor Berzelius of Stockholm, and Dr. Marcet of
 London, was read, which, together with an Appendix by
 Professor Berzelius, occupied three successive meetings of
 the Society.
    The series of experiments related in this paper were per
 formed in the months of July, August, and September last,
 during Professor Berzelius-s stay in this country, and the
 leading points of the inquiry were then ascertained.          The
 singular oily liquid  which   is  the object of these experiments
 was discovered in 1796 by Lampadius, and has since been
 the subject of much speculation and experimental contro
 versy.    Indeed there arc few substances the analysis of
 which has given rise to so much diversity of opinion, as
 the alcohol of sulphur.         Lampadius believed it to be a
 compound of sulphur       and    hydrogen..   Clement and Des-
 ormes considered it as a combination of sulphur and eharr
 coal ; Berthollet, as a triple compound of sulphur, charcoal,
  and hydrogen ; and Berthollet junior, as well as Davy,
  adopted the opinion of Lampadius.            In France, very re
  cently, Mr. Cluzcl, from an elaborate series of experiments,
  concluded that the alcohol of sulphur consisted of sulphur,
  carbon, hydrogen, and azole ; but Messrs. Berthollet, The-
  nard, and Vauquelin, the reporters of Mr. CluzePs inquiry,
  having made some experiments of their own upon the sub
 ject, concluded that the liquid in question was a compound

                         Royal Society.                                 369
of sulphur and carbon only, a result which agrees perfectly
with that of the paper before us.
   The alcohol of sulphur, when rectified by distillation, is
a perfectly transparent  fluid, which is insoluble in water,
and has great refractive powers and considerable specific
weight. It is exceedingly volatile, more so even than ether;
is highly inflammable, is capable of dissolving phosphorus
and sulphur, and is itself soluble in alcohol and ether.       It
combines with the new discovered detonating oily com
pound without exploding, even if phosphorus or oil be pre
sent and heat applied.
   The authors ascertained the chemical nature of the alco
hol of sulphur by various methods.       By exploding       in    it,    a
state of vapour, with oxygen gas, sulphureous acid gas and
carbonic acid gas are formed, without any production of
water.    From this, and various other experiments, the ab
sence of hydrogen was proved, and the presence of carbon,
ascertained.    But the process    bywhich the proportion of
sulphur and carbon in this compound was ascertained, con
sisted in  causing a  known quantity of the alcohol of sul
phur, in vapour, to pass through red hot oxide of iron. The
oily liquid was thus resolved into sulphuret of iron, sul
phureous acid gas and carbonic acid gas      and
                                               ;         by
                                                        careful
                                                              a
examination of these products, the authors were enabled to
conclude, that the alcohol of sulphur was composed of
about 85 parts of sulphur to 15 of carbon, which, in Mr.
Dalton's mode of expressing proportions, correspond to
two atoms of sulphur \o one of carbon.
   May 20. — Earl Morton in the chair.         paper was read
                                               A
describing  a  newly-invented lamp, designed to be used in
coal-mines, and to prevent the dreadful explosions of car-
buretted hydrogen gas, which are still so common and so
destructive, notwithstanding the advantages of ventilation.
The description would not be intelligible without        draw a
ing;   but the principle was merely that of completely iso
lating the lamp from the atmosphere, enveloping            in  it        a
large globe, surrounding   the base of the burner  with water,
and conveying the atmosphere of the mine to             it,

  a
lamp so situated could never be affected       by
                                              any sudden cur
rent of inflammable gas, and would answej every purpose
of affording light to the workmen.    appears that during

       Thomas Brandram, Esq. of Lee, Kent,
 were severally elected members of the Society.
    The reading of Dr. MacCulloch's paper on the Geology
 of certain Parts of Scotland was begun.
    The first article in this paper treats of the granular quartz
rock of the island of Jura. This, by some denominated
granite,     and- by others granular     quartz, but by all who
have hitherto described it considered as a primitive, rock,
                                                        constitutes

                          Geological Society.                 37 1
Constitutes     the  principal and fundamental rock of the
island: in particular, the three well known conical paps of
Jura, of    the height of 2500 or 2600 feet, are entirely com
posed of this mineral.        It is disposed in regular uninter
rupted strata six or eight feet in thickness, and rising for
the most part at a considerable angle towards the west.
These strata do not appear to be traversed by veins, except
of quartz, nor do they alternate with any other rock. On
the shore, however, the dip and direction of the beds vary
considerably.       The mineralogica! composition of this rock
presents several varieties.     Sometimes it is extremely com
pact, being made up of grains of quartz of various degrees
oi magnitude united without cement.           Sometimes besides
the quartz it contains felspar, seemingly in rounded frag
ments, and often decomposed into clay.
     In one specimen a manifestly water-worff pebble of
 quartz is inclosed : and upon the whole the rock may be
 considered a kind of sandstone consisting of quartz and
 felspar, the former in the larger proportion.        In some of
 the beds the sandstone passes into grauwacke slate by mix
 ture with pieces of mica slate.
     From these circumstances Dr. M. considers the quartz
 rock of Jura as a mechanical deposit formed from the
  fragments of older ones, and not as belonging to the Wer-
 nerian primitive class.       According to Professor Jameson,
 however, this very rock rises from below the micaceous
  sehistus. We must therefore admit, either that the micaceous
  schistus described by Professor J. is not primitive, or that
  the circumstances     under which the primitive rocks were
 formed were such as to exclude at the same time the pro
  duction of a mixed mechanical deposition.
     The next article in this paper contains some miscellaneous
  remarks on the geologv of the island of Rona.         The prin
  cipal rocks that here make their appearance are gneiss and
  hornblende rock (including under the latter denomination
  both hornblende slate and green-stone slate). . Where these
   two rocks come in contact, the gneiss is irregularly:
   curved and contorted.     The gneiss is traversed by numerous
   and thick veins of graphic granite in which wolfram oc
   curs.
      The district of Assynt, forming the western part of
   Sutherlandshire, is the subject of the next article.        The
  mountains and higher ground of this district consist of the
   same rock as the so called granular quartz of Jura, forming
   here, as1 in the last-mentioned island, smooth conical hills
   of considerable elevation, snow white at their summits, and
                                 Aa2                     singularly

singularly steril and arid. The white colour of the rock is
however only superficial,          the recent fracture exhibiting
gray, yellow,     and   brown    tints.   It is distinctly stratified,
and rises at a high angle.          The texture of this rock is va
rious, from imperfectly conchoidal to loosely granular,
composed of rounded grains, and in some beds of angular
fragments.       It divides naturally into rectangular blocks, on
the surface of which is the appearance as if of cylindrical
bodies imbedded in the mass, forming a number of circular
protuberant spots, of a white colour and more compact
texture than the rest of the rock. A section at right angles
to the natural surface of these blocks, shows that the above-
mentioned circular spots are occasioned by the cross frac
ture of straight cylindrical bodies, which are perhaps the re
mains of some species of sabella.              Associated with this
grit are compact gneiss, hornblende slate, and syenitic gra
nite, but their relative positions Dr. M. was unable to as
certain.      Subordinate to and apparently alternating with
this grit is a great deposit of limestone in two very thick
 stratified beds, with a thick kind of grit interposed : in some
 parts the section of these beds forms a continuous and even
line, but in other parts is so curved and broken that the
 stratification can scarcely be perceived.
    The limestone is a dark gray or nearly black, of an
earthy aspect and minute granular fracture, and smelling
offensively when rubbed.            It does not appear to contain
 organic remains, but is traversed by veins of red or white'
 calcareous spar.      It contains grains of sand, and therefore
gives fire with steel.      Its surface is covered for the most
    rt with a loose calcareous tufa, which in some places
    ing rendered solid by an infiltration of calcareous matter
 constitutes a hard breccia.
    In the same valley of the Tain, of which the above rock
forms the precipitous        side, occur insulated masses rising
 through the gross of unstratified granular marble, varying in
colour from pure white to gray, the geological relation of
which Dr. M. has not been able to determine.
    This is the white marble mentioned by Williams in his
<c
    Mineral Kingdom," and which has since been wrought
with some success by Mr. Toplin, of Gateshead.

      The continuation of Dr. MacCulloch's paper on the
  Geology of different parts of Scotland was read, and thanks
  were voted for the same.
      The granular quartz of Isla appears to be precisely the
  same rock as the sandstone of Jura already described.
  From the observations of Prof. Jameson, coinciding with
  those of Dr. MacCulloch, it appears to alternate with
  mica slate and clay slate, and with a very important forma
  tion of limestone. This limestone is more or less granular,
 and contains no organic remains, nor any beds of fetid
  limestone : when inclosed between beds of clay slate, it is
 of a dark blue colour ; when in contact with mica slate, it
  is gray or white : both varieties pass insensibly into the
  slate within which they are inclosed j and the limestone,
  the schisms, and the sandstone, are evidently members of
  one formation.
     The structure of SchehaUien is the subject of the next ar
  ticle.   This mountain consists of a central ridge in vertical
  strata, flanked on every side bv beds of mica slate nearly ver
  tical, and containing subordinate beds of limestone.       The
  rock composing this central ridge, though it has been de
  nominated granite by some mineralogists of no mean name,
  is in fact the same as the granular quartz of Jura, being
 composed of highly compacted grains of quartz, with inter
  spersed grains of earthy felspar.        The same quartz rock
  appears in the valley of the Lyon, to the south of Schehal-
  lien,and it seems that the mica slate alternates with beds of
  quartz rock, and is therefore of the same aera as this latter.
     The vicinity of Crenian, which is the subject of the next
 article, is remarkable for presenting nearly vertical beds of
                                  A  a 3              ,      well

well characterized grauwacke and grauwacke slate, with
equally well characterized beds of clay slate and chlorite
slate.
     The structure of the rocks bounding the vale of Aberfavle
is next described.       On tracing this country up to Ben
 Ledi, alternations of grauwacke and grauwacke slate with
 clay slate first occur : then comes a fine roofing slate ap
 proaching in parts to mica slate, but distinguished by a
 true grauwacke structure, that is, of grains united by a
 slaty cement : only in this case the" cement is not clay slate,
 but mica slate : beyond this the true mica slate makes its
 appearance.
      The general deduction from these facts is, that those
 rocks which have been ranked as primitive schist alternate
 with rocks of recomposed materials, which belong to the
 transition class of Werner : but this alternation throws
  great doubt on the reality of transition rocks, as distin
  guished from primitive, and rather tends to bring back the
 Original division   of rocks into primitive and secondary.

      The attention of the Society has lately been directed to
  two Lectures on Pneumatic Chemistry delivered by the
  Registrar, Mr. Miers.
      After some prefatory observations intended as an intro
  duction to the study of the science, he proceeded to give
  an abstract of the various theories of chemical affinity,
  commenting particularly on the beautiful svstem of relative
  proportions of Mr. Dalton, and the grand yet simple doc
  trine of electrical energies of Sir H. Davy, — doctrines
  which lead us fairly to indulge in the hope of our being on
  the eve of an important period, when chemical laws shall
  be submitted to calculation, and the whole science eluci
  dated by mathematical principles.       Al' kinds of matter ex
   isting in the universe  that are cognizable to our senses, and
   that may be denominated elementary, of which there are
   forty-six, he divided into two classes — Combustible, and
   Supporters of Combustion.         The individuals of the latter
   class, comprising only oxygen and chlorine, are distin
   guished principally by ranging themselves round the posi
   tive pole in the Voltaic circuit ; the former class compre-
 "
   hendingall the remainingforty- four undecom pounded bodies,
   which are distinguished as ranging themselves round the
   negative pole in the Voltaic circuit, and as opposing them
   selves in the relations of affinity to the bodies of the other
   class.   He then entered on, the cbnsideration of the known
                                                        properties

  tion euchlorine. Hydrogen next followed, its combination
  with oxygen — water, — and with chlorine, muriatic acid
  gas.   With respect to the naluie of chlorine and muriatic
  acid gas, Mr. M. entirely coincided with the views of Sir
 H. Davy on this subject: Independent of the principal
 classic property of chlorine, that of its being like oxygen
 an indecomposable- body ranging itself round the positive
 pole in all Voltaic circuits, facts have arisen from discussions
 in the scientific journals, which have satisfied most che
 mists as to the simplicity of its nature.       What has tended
 most to' the confirmation of this opinion is the discovery
 of phosgene gas, (a combination of chlorine and carbonic
 oxide gases,) by Mr. John Davy.               According to the
 French system, the union of these two gases should have
 produced carbonic acid and muriatic acid gases ; but what
 ultimately decides the correctness of Sir Humphry Davy-s
 notion is the formation of this new gas, which possesses
 characters    so peculiar.     Agreeing entirely with Sir H.
Davy    in the  nature  of  chlorine,  he, however, differed with
 him in the nomenclature proposed by him for the designa
 tion of its combinations. Sir H. D. proposes to distinguish
the salts formerly called muriates, which are according to
him combinations of chlorine with metals, by the termi
nating syllables ane, anea, anie : independent of the pro
bability of mistake in expressing the last syllables, there                          is-
in all cases an objection to making distinctions of species"
in verbal terminations          and as the combinations with
                                    ;
oxygen are called oxides, there          no sufficient reason why
                                                  is
those with chlorine should not be called chlorides          and as         ;
distinctions of the proportions of combinations, there may
be given — prochlorides, deuchlorides,       trichlorides, and an
swering to those proposed           Dr. Thomson, of protoxide,

tions with oxygen, nitrous oxide gas, nitrous gas, nitrous

oxygen, existed        instate of chemical combination in at

 From its possessing no other properties than those of the
  individual gases, and from artificial mixtures in various pro
  portions always comporting themselves in similar relations,
  it has been universally agreed to be merely a mechanical
  mixture of the two gases. But, as the composition of the
  atmosphere is uniformly the same in whatever situation it
  is found, this opinion seemed to the lecturer somewhat pro-
« blematical.     As so vast a quantity of oxygen is constantly
  consumed in respiration for the support of animated crea
  tion, and as the proportion of the oxygen to the nitrogen is
  ever invariably the same, it has never been satisfactorily ex
  plained how the equilibrium is restored.      There most pro
  bably   exist some   unknown   processes in nature,  by which a
  quantity of oxvgen is generated corresponding to that con
  sumed by animals, by the combustion of inflammable bo
  dies, &c.      To this it has been said, that the vege-able
  world is the organ by which this supply is effected ; that
  the leaves of plants absorb the carbonic acid formed in
  respiration, which retain the carbon and give out in return
  the oxygen. To this however the lecturer stated many ab
  jections.     How is it that in the depth of winter, when a
  complete check is given to vegetation, when plants possess
  no leaves to effect a supply, when at the same time the
  consumption of oxygen is so considerably increased by the
  combustion of inflammables for the generation of warmth,
  &c. how is the oxygen in such times restored ? This ob
  jection it does not appear easy to obviate.         There most
  probably exist some provisions of nature of which we are
  entirely ignorant, and these perhaps are only to be found in
  the nature of nitrogen.
     With respect to the nature of nitrogen he entered at
  some considerable length, and gave a minute history of the
  earlier e.periments of Priestley, of Gottling, Wiegleb, and
  Crell ; of Dieman, Van Stroostwyck, of Van Hausch Juch,
  Van Mons, of Girtanner, and of Berthollet and Lagrange.
     The German chemists had found water converted into
  nitrogen v\htn passed in a state of vapour through ignited
  earthen tubes, and hence concluded nitrogen to be a com
  pound of ^ater and caloric.       The Dutch chemists denied
  this conversion of water into nitrogen, conceiving its pre
  sence to have been derived from the introduction of atmo
  spheric air through ihe interstices of the tube.      Girtanner,
  on the contrary, asserted the correctness of the German
  chemists, and confirmed       by experiments   of his own the
  formation of nil rogeu, though he differed with them as to- its
  nature.     He conceived nitrogen to be a combination of hy
                                                            drogen

               Philosophical Society of London.            377
drogen and oxvgen, or water deprived of part of its oxygen.
 He found nitrogen to be produced in all cases where water
in a state "of vapour was passed over any matter at a high
degtee of heat, that would abstract part of its oxygen. , He
denied that this change was ow ing to the introduction of
atmospheric air through the pores of the tubes, for he found
the same when they were covered externally with a glass,
or with a glass tube placed in an earthen or metallic one,
provided any metallic body were placed within.       Berthollet
and La Grange, however, were induced from their im
portance to repeat the experiments of Girtanuer, but with all
their attention to accuracy could not detect the smallest por
tion of nitrogen. This positive contradiction of two chemists
so justly famed for the accuracy       of their experiments,
brought the assertions of Girtanner into disrepute, who,
from the looseness of his style, was perhaps justly considered
as an inaccurate chemist and an enthusiastic theorist.    This
opinion of chemists concerning the nature of nitrogen was
most perfectly settled : since this time it continued to be
considered as a simple body, till the brilliant discoveries of
Sir Humphry Davy burst forth on the science of chemistry
with a most dazzling splendour, and diffused a new light
on the nature of the material world.     Sir Humphry Davy,
induced by his discoveries of the nature of the fixed alkalies
and earths, was led to examine the volatile alkali ammonia,
and, from some experiments detailed in his second Bakerian
lecture, concluded that oxygen entered into its composition.
This he could only account for by supposing either hydrogen
to be an oxide of nitrogen, or nitrogen to be an oxide of
hydrogen. About the same time Messrs. Allen and Pepys
were engaged in experiments on the products of respiration,
who found that under certain circumstances        there was a
loss of oxygen and a considerable production of nitrogen.
Sir H. Davy, continuing his experiments, found a consider
able loss of nitrogen during the action of the fusible com
pound of potassium and nitrogen on matter containing
oxygen, its place being supplied by a corresponding pro
duction of hydrogen and oxygen ; he hence concluded that
"  the decomposition and composition of nitrogen seem
proved, allowing the correctness of the data, and one of it9
elements appears to be oxygen."       Sir H. Davy, however,
from his more recent researches and more refined experi
ments, began to doubt the accuracy of his previous con
clusions ; he has now in a great measure renounced his
former views of the nature of nitrogen, and now again
classes it among the simple substances.

378             Philosophical Society   of London.
    Towards the beginning of the last year^ the attention of
 the lecturer was drawn to this subject by some experiments
 he was then performing, where he found nitrogen produced
 from water when he was certain it could not have been
 derived from the atmosphere.            From the results of these
 experiments he was led to consider nitrogen as a combina
 tion of hydrogen and oxygen, or of water with hydrogen.
 As results of such importance require to be confirmed by
 the most decisive and unequivocal proofs, and as experi
 ments of so much magnitude, involving in them such weight
 of consequences to the present theories of chemistry, de
 manded, before they were ushered into public notice, the
 most clear and decided results, they were unavoidably re
 served for more refined experiments, which from circum
 stances had been deferred to the present time. He men
 tioned his intention of immediately resuming his labours,
 which, when sufficiently mature, he should lay before the
 Society. There are many analogies - he pointed out that
 lend us to consider it a compound body ; but did we possess
 no other knowledge of this substance than such evidences,
 we might be led to consider it a simple body. The principal
 objection ruvw urged against such a conclusion      is,that nitro

 potassium and other i.ifiammable substances, no change         is
 perceptible.    These objections he conceived ought not to
 have -any very considerable weight, as we know that the

    May lgt.h. — A paper   "  On the question whether alcohol
be   a product   of fermentation or of distillation,"   was read
by   M. Donovan, Esq. Secretary.
    The paper commenced with a sketch of the ancient opi
nions on the question, and of the evidences upon which
they were founded.       It was then stated, that perhaps the
first chemist who doubted the existence of alcohol in fer
mented liquors was Kouelle the elder, who was led to this
supposition from reflecting on the fact that spirit is not
produced until the wine or other liquor begins to boil.
Nearlv the same opinions, it was observed, were afterwards
maintained and enlarged upon by Fubroni. The Florentine
philosopher found that by means of sub-carbonate of pot
ash he could detect -rs-oth part of alcohol purposely added
to new wine; while, when pure wine was employed, the
same test produced no appearance whatever : from this and
some other experiments        he concluded    "  that alcohol is
a product of distillation, and not of fermentation."         After
noticing    the  remarks  and  opinions  of several   other   che
mists, it was observed, that no experimental objections of
any importance have been offered to Fabroui-s assertions
                                                              until

   380              Imperial Institute     of France.
   until lately, when a most ingenious paper by Mr. Brande,
   appeared in the Philosophical Transactions (1811).           Upon
   the reasonings and experiments of that excellent chemist
   several observations were made, all of which terminated in
   the following conclusion,         " that his refutation of the
   grounds of Fabron"1'3 objections to the common opinion,
   was decisive and complete j" but it was observed that still
   a few experiments tending to prove that the common opi
   nion is correct, might not be considered superfluous.
      The author then remarked, if the temperature specified
   by Fabroni as adequate to the decomposition of wine be
   really so low as 63, that the legitimate consequence would
   be directly in contradiction to the opinion which the Flo
   rentine philosopher laboured to establish : for in almost all
   cases oj fermentation      in the large way, the temperature
  rises to, and most frequently much above 63.
      Several experiments were then detailed which tended to
   prove that the alcohol is produced in the process of fer
   mentation. A fermentation was conducted which never
   rose beyond 57 : by peculiar management, the vapour of
  alcohol was extricated from this wash, which was capable
  of catching flame from an ignited body.             From another
  portion   of the same   wash,   the  alcohol   was separated in the
  insulated form perfectly pure, very strong, and highly in
  flammable.      Yet in all these experiments the temperature
                                   j
 never rose to 60, which is 3 degrees below that stated by
 Fabroni as necessary to the formation of alcohol.
     After detailing the remainder of his experiments, the au
 thor stated, that from all these he thought he was war
 ranted in concluding " that alcohol is a product of fermen
 tation, that it exists ready formed and perfect in fermented
 liquors, and that it exists in them in a state of very loose
 combination with water and vegetable matter."
     Mr. Donovan repeated the principal part of his experi
 ments before the Society.

                        [Continued from p. 316.]
                  Botany and Vegetable Physics.
     Most physiologists have long admitted that there is in
plants an ascending sap, which proceeds from the roots to
the branches, and contributes to the development of the
branches in length; and a descending sap which descends
from the leaves to the roots, a/id to which some ascribe the
chief agency in the development of the wood, and conse
quently in the swelling of the trunk.                        M. Fe-

                 Imperial Institute of France.             381
                                                                -
   M. Feburier,  a nurseryman   at Versailles, has endeavoured
to collect these two kinds of sap separately : with this view
he made a deep cut in the trunk of a tree, and filled a blad
der to the lower aperture, so that nothing sho\ild enter but
the liquid coming from the parts of the tree situated be
low : he then made another incision, and placed the bladder
at the upper part of it so as to receive nothing but the sap
coming from above.
   M. Feburier regards the sap collected in the lower blad
der as ascending, and the other as descending juice, and gives
numerous observations on the proportions of both under
various circumstances.     Wishing afterwards to be certain
as to the  route which each sap takes in the interior of the
vegetable, he plunged alternately by the two extremities
branches of trees into coloured tinctures.       In both cases,
these tinctures appeared to him to follow the ligneous fi
bres of the medullary canal, which made him ascribe the
same progress to the two saps, in which he is at variance
with the result of other experiments made by M. Mustul.
   M. Feburier is also of opinion that the ascending sap
contributes chiefly to the development of the branches: the*
descending sap to that of the roots ; but he thinks that the
cambium, or that humour which transudes horizontally
from the trunk, and which has been regarded as the matter
which gives to the tree its growth in thickness, results, as
well as the peculiar juices, from the mixture of the two
saps.
   The presence of the leaves necessary for producing the
descending sap is also of consequence for trie increase in
thickness; but the buds, which M. du Petit Thouars makes
to play a great part in this operation, have really no share
in it according to M. Feburier; for it takes place, he in
forms us, while the leaves exist, and it ceases immediately
when they are removed, whether buds are left or not.
   So far as regards the flowers and fruits, M. Feburier says
he has observed that the ascending sap, when it predomi
nates, tends to determine the production of the simple
flowers and the complete development of the germs ; that
the descending sap, on the contrary, where it is superabun
dant, produces the multiplication of the flowers and the
petals, and the enlargement of the pericarps, and con
sequently of tKe pulpv part of the fruit: principles from
which it will be easy to draw many useful hints, and which
will also explain several practices already adopted:
   According to M. Feburier, the soft part of the wood
when laid bare, but protected from the contact of the air, is
                                                        capable

capable of reproducing, by means of the cambium, the libef
and the bark necessary for covering           it,
                                         as the bark produces
habitually, and even when       it  partly removed from its
                                     is
trunk, liber and soft wood. In this point he has for his
antagonist our colleague M. Palisot de Beauvois, who has
also directed his attention to these difficult questions re
specting the progress of the sap and the formation of the
wood. According to this botanist, this oozing out of                           a
glairy matter, which some physiologists suppose to flow
irom the old wood, and which contributes to the formation
of the liber, isnot founded upon real experiments.     On the
contrary, when part of the bark of tree has been removed,
                                          a
and the wound well rubbed, so as to leave no liber nor
cambium, neither the soft wood nor the wood itself -pro
duces any thing, but the lips of the solution of continuity
made in the bark stretch out, cover the wood left bare, and
then produce liber and soft wood incontestably emanating
from this bark. M. de Beauvois announces that he will
 soon explain this proposition fully, which he has merely-
hinted at in memoir on the marrow of vegetables.
            a
    The opinion of physiologists has been hitherto much
divided, as to the utility and functions of the pith of
vegetables.   According to some, this organ       necessary to
                                                       is
the life of the plants during their whole existence        ac         :
cording to others,    it   useful to them only during the
                           is
first year and only during the whole of the time that                     it   is
green and succulent, and when        may be still easily con
                                      it
 founded with the cellular texture.
    M. de Beauvois has made upon this subject some obser
vations which tend to show that the marrow exercises,
during the whole life of the plants, functions,         not of   if
an absolute necessity to their existence, at least very im
portant to their progress, and the development of their
branches, leaves, and particularly the organs necessary for
their reproduction.
   He1has remarked that the medullary canal,        e. the cir

of the pith, has always     aform corresponding to the ar
rangement and the disposition- of the branches,        boughs,
and leavesj    that in the vegetables with vertical furrowed
(verticillces) boughs and leaves, for instance, the horizontal
section of the medullary tube shows as many angles as
thete are boughs at each stage and at each verticille.
   Thus the medullary canal of the red laurel presents an
equilateral triangle  ifthe branch below the ver/icilles has
three boughs and three leaves b,ut   ;     wc cut
                                               if    below the

lowest verticille, from which a leaf and a bough frequently
fall off, there will be two angles only, and the vestige of a
third equally abortive.      This la\v is constant, even in the
herbaceous      plants.
    M.tleBeauvois has begun similar observations on the plants
with opposite leaves, tho.-e alternating, distie, repeated spiral,
and composed of four, five, and a greater number of boughs
and leaves.        He thinks it probable that there are the same
 relations   between the form of fhe medullary canal and the
disposition of the branches, the boughs, and the leaves.
 For example, the opposite leaves seem to necessitate a
round medullary canal, and which becomes oval, having the
extremities more and more acute the nearer it approaches
 the point of insertion of the boughs and leaves.
    When the leaves are alternate, the circle is less perfect,
 the-extremities    are thinned off equally, but alternately, and
each on the side on which the -bough ought to appear.
    When the leaves are spiral, the number of the angles of
the medullary canal is equal to that of the leaves of which,
 the spirals are composed.        It is thus that the medullary
 canal of the linden tree has only four angles ; that of the
 oak, the chesnut tree, the pear, and almost all fruit-trees,
&c. has five angles more or less regular, because the spirals
are multiplied, and succeed constantly by fives.
    Grew and Bonnet seem to have been the first to make
these observations.       The former had observed very singular
forms    in   the  medullary canal, particularly in that of - the
             roots of pot-herbs ; but he has not seized the re-
  ations of these forms with the dispositions of the boughs
 f>ivoting
and the leaves.       The latter directed his attention to distin
guish    the  vegetables with; opposite leaves verticillated, al
 ternated, spiral, but has not made a comparison of these
 dispositions with the form of the medullary canal.
    M. de Mirbel has continued his researches in the struc
 ture of the organs of fructification in vegetables, in which
 he has been most zealously seconded by M. Schubert, who
 was sent to France by the Government of Warsaw to ac
 quire the science of botany preparatory           to his publicly
 teaching it in Poland.
    These two botanists have examined all the genera of the
 family of the prickly trees, or the coniferae ; trees of the
 first importance, on account of the singularity of their or
 ganization, the magnitude of the species, and the utility of
 their products.      Every person can distinguish at the first
 glance the cedar, the pine, the yew, the juniper, &c; but
although botanists have studied with particular attention
                                                               the

  the organs    of reproduction   in these vegetables, they  are not
  agreed   as to the characters  of their female flower ; or rather,
 most    of them a^ree     that the stigma of the pine, the fir-
  tree, the cedar, and the larch-tree, is still to be found.
 We mav therefore say that these trees are in this respect
 species of crvptogama.          Messrs. Mirbel and Schubert go
  still further : they assert that the female flower of the yew,
 the juniper, the cypress, &c. is no better known, and that,
  without exception, all the genera of the family of the coni
 ferae have a common character, which has hitherto deceived
 observers, anil which consists in the existence of a cupule,
 not like that of the flower of the oak, which covers the
 basis only of the ovary, but much more hollow, concealing
 entirely the ovary, and closed like a spout at its orifice.
 The female flower contained in this envelope has escaped
 observation.       In the arbor vitae, the yew, the juniper,-the
 cypress, &c.     the   cupule is folded back, and by an error
 accounted for by the extreme smallness of the organs, from
 time immemorial the orifice of this cupulus has been taken
 for the stigma.       In the cedar, the larch, the pine, and
 fir-trees, the cupule is reversed, and the orifice is scarcely
 discernible. It is only of late years that it has been ob
 served in England by Mr. Salisbury, and in France by
Messrs. Poiteau, Mirbel, and Schubert. These botanists
have not hesitated to consider it as the stigma ; which was
natural, since it has been agreed to place the stigma of
the yew, the arbor vitae, the cypress, &c. at the orifice
of the cupule. But ulterior researches have undeceived
Messrs. Mirbel and Schubert.              By means of a delicate
anatomical inquiry, they have ascertained that what is ge
nerally taken for the female fiowqr in the coniferae is no
thing else than the cupule; the form of which closely imi
tates that of a pistil, and which contains in its cavity the
true flower, which is provided with a membranous calyx
adhering to the ovary, and with a stigma sessile in all the
genera except in the ephedra.
     It maybe easily conceived that this structure, so different
from what had been hitherto imagined, brings with it great
changes in the description of the characters of the family
and of lhe•genera.
     According to M. Mirbel, the female flower of the plants
of the family of the cycas has an organization analogous to
that of the coniferae ; which supports the opinion of M.
Richard, who places these two families beside each other
among the dicotyledons : but M. Mirbel thinks, that while
the characters of vegetation will serve as a basis to the two
                                                               grea*

great divisions of vegetables with visible flowers, the cy-
cadeae could not be far removed from the palm trees.
   The organization of, the male flower of the mosses has
been also the subject of the researches of Messrs. Mirbel
and Schubert.      After Hedwig, it would have been difficult
to discover anv new facts on this subject.        But the rupture
of the antheiae and the emission of the pollen were phaeno
mena which several botanists call in question. Our two bo
tanists assert that they are presented in the most unequivocal
manner to our eyes. The organs which Hedwig calls males
in the polytrichum commune, placed upon water, are cleft
into a beak at their summit, and sent out an oleaginous li
quor, which extended like a slight cloud over the surface of
the liquid.    Messrs. Mirbel and Schubert then submitted
comparatively to observation       the pollen of a great number
of phanerogamous plants, and thev saw that it acted in the
same way as the male parts of the mosses : which leads
them to believe that those parts designated under the name
of  antherae by Hedwig, might       possibly be nothing else than
simple grains of naked pollen      of a particular form-
   M. Mirbel by himself has        continued his inquiries into
germination. He remarks, in        spite of the opinion generally
received, that the radicle does not always first come out.
For instance, in many cyperaceae it is constantly the plu
mule which first appears.
   The same boiantist has thrown new light, with, impor
tant modifications and additions, upon his opinions respect*
ing the organization of the stalk, their development, and
the structure   both  internal   and external   of the organs of
fecundity in plants.
   M. Henrv de Cassini, the son of one of our members
whose name is so well known as an astronomer,            has pre
sented to the Class a memoir which augurs happMy for his
future success in another science.        He has examined with
particular care the style and the siigmata throughout a
whole family of plants well known by the names of com*
posites, syngenesia, or svnanihcreae, and organs so incon
siderable presented to him a crowd of curious variations^
which appeared to him strong enough to ray the foundation
of a division of these plants rounded solely upon the mo
difications of those two parts of the pistil.
   We regret that we are unable to follow this accurate ob
server through all the details upon which he has entered,
and which he has described and drawn with singular preci
sion : it cannot be doubted that thev will one day serve to
perfect the classification     of this family, which is so nu-

   merous and so natural, and the subdivision of which ought
   consequently to be more difficult than anv other.
      There are few families of vegetables so directlv useful to
  tnan as that of the grasses, among which we reckon oats,
   barley, wheat, rice, maize, the sugar cane, hay, &c. &c.
  The bare mention of the name of these plants is suffi
   cient to show the importance of any work which shall de-
   »cribe them with accuracy.
      The characters hitherto have been generallv regarded as
   insufficient.     At everv step the observer is arrested : and
   it is difficult, nay, often impossible to discover the true
   genus of the plant under examination : frequently also, the
   characters adopted agree with certain species only, and are
   ji" longer recovered in the rest of the genus.
      M. Palisot de Beauvois has undertaken on the subjects
   of this family a general work which he has entitled, An
  Essay upon Agrostography. He has endeavoured to remove
   all confusion, and to give to each genus signs which are
   constant and easily discovered, so that no observer can b»
  mistaken.
      With   this view he has been obliged to adopt new bases,
  which he has already announced in his Flora of Oware and
  Benin, and which chiefly belong to the separation or junc
  tion of the sexes to the composition of the flower and the
  number of its envelopes.
      Twenty-five plates, in which all these characters are re
  presented, facilitate the study of these plants which in
  terest all classes of society, and even those who do not
  study botany as a science.
      M. Beauvois continues his Flora of Oware and Benin, the
  thirteenth number of which is published ; and his History
  of Insects, collected in Africa and America, the eighth
  number of which has appeared.
      M. de la Billardiere has continued and finished the col
  lection of his rare plants of Syria and Liban, by the publi
  cation of the fourth and fifth numbers.
      The same naturalist has communicated to the Class se
  veral interesting observations in natural history which he
  made in his voyage to the Levant, the publication of which
  was interrupted by the longer and more dangerous voyage
* which he since undertook along with d-Eutrecasteaux, and
  the account of which has been before the public these many
  years.
        M. Gouan, corresponding member of the Class at
  Montpelier, has published a description of the generic cha
  racters of the ginko-biloba, a singular tree of Japan, which
                                                              had

     The leguminous plants are not less important, as furnishing
 a number    of nutritious articles of food for men and animals^
 various pharmaceutical substances^ several gums employed
 in the arts, and some precious woods : but, like all the-very
 natural families, it is difficult to subdivide them with pre
 cision ; which is nevertheless the more important, as the
 number of the vegetables which it contains is already very
 considerable, and more are discovered every day.
     M. Jaume Saint Hilaire has presented to the Class a
 memoir accompanied by several drawings made by himself,
 in which he claims new characters for the leguminous
 plants, founded chiefly upon the form of the fruit, and
 which appear to this botanist more constant and more easy
 to seize than those formerly employed.            He adds beside*
 several new genera to those which are already admitted.
     There is a family much less important in its uses, but
 much more singular in its characters, and which is only to
 be found on the sea-shore: this is the family of the fuci
 and analogous marine plants.          M. Lainouroux, professor
 of natural history at Caen, has made them one of the chief
objects of his study.     He gives them the common name of
 Tnalassio-phytes, and divides them iuto several tribes, the
characters of which he was obliged to take from all the
 parts of the vegetable, for want of finding a sufficiency iu
the organs of fructification, which generally serve as a basis
to these kinds of distributions, but which are too little
known in most of the fuci to enable us to have recourse to
them solely.
     We regret that wc cannot enter more fully into this
valuable paper, and have to add our wishes for its speedy
publication.
         Zoology, Anatomy, and Animal Physiology.
    M. Geoffroy Saint Hilaire, who has repeatedly directed
his researches to the natural history of the bat, and has-
made us acquainted with so many interesting species, pur
poses to give a general view of all the species.            As a
prelude   to this work,  he has  written  a dissertation upon  the
rank which these singular animals ought to occupy among
the mammiferae.       They have been long regarded as an in
termediate genus between quadrupeds and birds, and it is
at least equally true that they hold a kind of middle place
between quadrumanous and carnivorous animals. In short,

amid the multitude of arrangements proposed by naturalists,
thev are alternately (according to the last edition of Linnaeus
and Brisson) allied to the quadrumani, and (according to
the plan and the former edition of Linnaeus) they are
placed anions: the lesser carnivori or insecto carnivori, like
the mole and hedge-hog.       Some naturalists, among whom
are Messrs. Storr and Cuvier,       place them at the head of
the carnivori, and before those insecto-carnivori just men
tioned, and immediately after the quadrumani; with this
difference, however, that M. Cuvier distinguishes them more
particularlv, and as a subdivision.       Others also, such as
Kay and Blumenbach, Lacepede and Niger made a separate
order of them, and this order is placed by Ray and Lacepede
in some measure out of its proper place : by M. Blumen
bach between the quadrumani and the other animals with
long nails, at the head of which this naturalist places the
gnawing animals : lastly, by M. llliger after theedentes and
before the carnivori, at the head of which stand, as in the
arrangement of M. Cuvier, the insecto-carnivori.
    It may be easily conceived that all combinations must
necessarily   depend upon the organs to which each na
turalist may have paid rhost attention.       Those who have
paid most attention to the skeleton, to the intestines, to
the organization of the feel, to the form of the nails, and
to the grinders, have allied the bat to the carnivori, and this
appears to be the most generally received opinion : those
who have particularly noticed the incisores, the position of
the mammae, and the pendulous penis, have, allied this ani
mal to the quadrumani.
   M. Geoffroy, in the work above alluded to, insists most
upon these last resemblances, which he thinks have not
been sufficiently attended to ; but he shows        particularly
that the singular prolongation of the anterior extremities,
the general tendency of the skin to stretch excessively, and
the peculiar properties which bats thence enjoy both with
respect to their sensations and their motions, require that
a separate order should be formed      of these mammiferae, at
the same time that I heir various resemblances with the
quadrumani and the carnivori show that they ought to be
placed between them.       We may look with much anxiety
for the subdivision of this order, as well as the detailed his
torv of ihe species which M G"eofTfoy has promised us.
    M. de Lamarck, .who is intrusted with teaching at the
Museum of Natural History every thing connected with
animals without vertebrae, published some years ago the
work which serves as the basis of his lectures, in which he
                                                        explains

                  Imperial Institute of..Frunce.            389
explains in a way peculiar to himself the classes, orders
and genera or" these innumerable animals : but as travellers
have since discovered many new species and genera; as
anatomists have better developed their structure ; and lastly,
as the discrimination of M. de Lamarck has discovered se
veral new relations between them, he has published an
abridged syllabus of his course according to this perfected
method, in which he contents himself with indicating the
characteis of the superior divisions, and meiely gives the
•simple nominative enumeration of the genera.
    He follows in point of arrangement, the order of the de
grees of complication, commencing with the most simple
animals. Supposing that those which have no nerves ap
parent, are moved only in virtue of their irritability, he de
nominates them apathic animals: he gives the name of
sensible animals to others without vertebrae, and reserves
that of intelligent animals for those with vertebra?.    To his
old classes, which are already well known to naturalists,
he adds that of cirrliipedes, which comprehends         the sea
glands, and their analogous genera, and which he places
between these anelides and mollusci ; that of epizoary or
intestinal worms, \shich he places among his apaihic ani
mals ; and that of the infusares, or microscopic animals
without mouths or apparent intestines.           He leaves the
echino-dermes among the radiurii and the apathic animals,
and in a greater degree of simplicity than that in which he
places the intestinal worms.
   We regret that want of room does not admit of our
making known the other changes introduced bytM. i!e
Lamarck in his orders, nor the numerous additions whicu
he has made to the list of genera ; but naturalists will not
fail to examine them in the work itself.
   Notwithstanding the success of the anatomical researches
respecting animals without vertebrae for these few years
past, there still remained one of their families, the funda
mental organs of which were not yet well known : these
are the echino-dermes,     which comprehends the sea stars";
and analogous genera.      The Class having proposed a prize
for the improvements of this branch of comparative ana-
tomv, it was gained by Professor Tied man of the University
of Laudshut.       The memoir of this eminent anatomist
makes known for the first time, with rare precision, many
 particularities of organization peculiar to these singular
animals. A kind of circulation is easily perceived between
their organs of digestion and of respiration, without pre
senting however a complete double circle : besides, the
                               B b3                    branches

 branches cannot be followed into the    external  organs,    nor
 into those of motion : it even seems,  according to   M. Tied-
 man, that a vascular system totally    different is distributed
 to the numerous pedunculi, which       in these animals serve
 as instruments of locomotion.
    The organs of respiration differ materially according to
the genera ; in the holothurii they represent hollow trees,
the vessels of which are filled or evacuated from the ex
ternal water, and are interlaced with a vascular net-work.
In the sea stars and bears, the water penetrates immediately
}nto the cavity of the body and visits every part of it.
    This elegant work was accompanied by some very fine
drawings executed by M. Martin Miinz, doctor in physic,
and appeared to the Class well deserving of the prize, from
the quantity of new facts and observations which it con
tains, and from the addition which it must make to our
knowledge of the echino-dermes, although the problem
proposed as to their circulation has not been resolved in a
planner completely satisfactory.
    A family much simpler in its organization than that of
the echino-dermes, but much more numerous in species,
that   pf the corals and other animals composed of a solid
case,   has been specifically   arranged by M. Lamouroux.
This naturalist has made an extensive collection of those
•whose   base is not stony, and which present forms often
singular and agreeable : by comparing with great care the
form, the mutual position of the cellules from which the
polypi issue, and all the other different appearances, he
purposes adding twenty-eight new genera.         This is a work
of unquestionably great utility to the improvement of our
knowledge of the animal kingdom, but from its nature it
does not admit nf an abridged analysis.      A speedy publica
tion of the entire memoir will be highly gratifying.
    M. Cuvier, purposing soon to commence the printing of
his great work on Comparative Anatomy, which has occu
pied his attention for so many years, has presented to the
Glass the table of the divisions according to which the
animal kingdom ought to be distributed in this work. For
a long time naturalists were struck with the greatdifferences
which distinguish the invertebral animals from each other,
while the vertebral animals resemble each other in so many
respects.    Hence resulted a great difficulty in drawing up
their comparative anatomy; the animals with vertebrae be
ing easily generalized, but not the others: a remedy how
ever has been suggested for this difficulty : from the way
in which the propositions relative to each organ were

•Sways    grouped, M. Cuvier concluded that there exist
among animals four principal forms, the first of which is
that with which we are acquainted under the name of ver
tebral animals, and of which the other three are nearly com?
parable to it by the uniformity of their respective plans.
The author denominates them mollutci, articulated animals,
and radiated animals or zoophytes, and subdivides! each of
these fortns or ramifications into four classes, according to
motives nearly equivalent to those upon which the four
classes rest which are generally adopted among the verte
bral animals.     He has derived from this in some measure
symmetrical arrangement, a ureat facility in reducing under
general rules the diversities of organization.
    The comparison which the same member has drawn of
the osteology of vertebral animals, has furnished him with
some new ideas as to the osseous structure of the head in
this branch, and which he has also presented to the Class.
    It had been long since ascertained that oviparous vertex
bral animals, j. e. birds, reptiles, and .fishes, had several
common relations of organization, which made them differ
from the viviparous or mammiferous vertebral animals ;
M. Geoffroy Saint Hilaire had even presented some years
ago an extensive and elegant work, of which we gave an
account at the time, in which he proved among other
things the identity of structure of the heads of all the ovi-
pari, and the relations of the numerous pieces which enter
into their composition, with those which we distinguish in
the foetus of the maminiferae, in which, as is well known,
the bones are much more subdivided than in adults,
    M. Cuvier, adopting the views of M. Geoffroy, has en
deavoured to determine in a certain manner, to what bone
of ihe head of the mammifera? each groupe of bones of the
head of the different ovipari     answers; and he thinks ha
                                                              "
has attained this, by adding to the analogy of the foetus of
the former, the consideration of the position and of the
functions of the hones: i.e. by examining what organs
they protect, to what nerves and vessels they give a passage,
and what muscles are attached to them.
    M. Jacobson, surgeon major in the armies of the king
<>f   Denmark, has made the Class acquainted with an
organ which he discovered in the nostrils of quadrupeds,
and with which no anatomist          seems to have been ac
quainted,     h consists of a narrow sac, lying along the
cavity of the nostrils, defended by a cartilaginous      pro
duction,    covered internally by a mucous        membrane,
doubled in pari, by a glandulous texture, receiving some

very remarkable nerves which are very distinct divisions at
the first pair, and opening chiefly into the palate, behind
the inci sores, bv a channel which passes through the hole
denominated incisive by anatomists.              This organ does not
exist in man, and is more distinct in most of the herbi
vorous than of the carnivorous animals.              It must be pre
sumed that it is connected w ith some of the faculties which
nature has granted to quadrupeds,                and refused to our
species; such as the faculty of rejecting venomous sub
 stances, or of distinguishing the sex and state of heat,&c.
    The particular history of animals has been enriched with
many important works and interesting observations.
     M. de Humboldt has published the first volume of his
 Observations oh -he Animals of America, in which he en
ters not only upon different inquiries as to the condor, the
 electrical eel, the crocodile, and many other subjects which
 we stated in our preceding analysis ; but he has also given
 several entirely new memoirs, particularly- one upon the
 apes of the new world, eleven or twelve species of which
 onlv had been described by Buflfbn and Gmelin, but which
 M. de Humboldt, by adding his own observations to those of
 M. d-Azzara and Geoffrey Saint Hilaire, extends to forty-six.
     He has recently read to the Class another memoir in
 tended for his second volume, and in which he describes
 two new species of rattlesnakes which he discovered in
 Guyana.
     The tempests which agitated the            sea last winter, drove
 several large whales on shore on the French coast: the
 Class directed the information which thev received on this
 subject to be examined bv a committee consisting of MM.
 Lactpede, Geoffrey Saint Hilaire, and Cuvier.
     These naturalists have remarked, that several of these ani
 mals were little if at all know n, and that the subject, as in
 teresting to the commerce and fisheries of France, deserved
 the attention of Government.             They have given a descrip
 tion of the species cast ashore in great numbers near Saint
 Brieux : M. I^emauot, naturalist and apothecsrv of that
 place, having carefully collected all the essential parts, it
 was easy to discover among them a kind of dolphin, which
  had escaped the attention or all the methodical naturalists,1
 and of which there was only one verv bad figure in Du-
 hamel's Treatise on Fishes.           Its head is distinguished by a
  globular   form,   almost   similar      to an antique helmet.     In
  length it was nearly 20 feet.                                        1

The       admirers of Grecian antiquities will hear with plea
sure that an important discovery has lately been made in
Peloponnesus. The Zante Gazette gives the following par
ticulars: — " Manv artists and foreigners, lovers of the fine
arts, had obtained permission to search in the temple of
Apollo, situated in Mount Cotylius, in Arcadia. This
search led to the complete frieze of the interior of the tem
ple, composed of reliefs in marble, with nearly 100 figures,
each more than two feet in height, and very little injured."

     Mr. Singer    has recently constructed an Electric Column
of twenty thousand pairs of zinc and silver plates; its
electrical effects are powerful, but it has not the slightest
 chemical agency.         Pith ball electrometers diverge consi
 derably by its actions; sparks are also produced, and jars
 charged with facility.       The plates in this extensive appa
 ratus are small ; a series of three thousand have been con
 structed larger; and the effects of these, though proportion-
 ablv less, are more promptly produced.         In a late course of
 lectures, Mr. Singer compared the results of the above ap
 paratus with different Voltaic batteries excited by various
 menstrua; one of the batteries employed consisted of a
 thousand pairs of plates; another of four hundred, and a
 third of 64 pairs ; the surfaces increasing as the numbers
 diminished : some curious effects were produced, apparently
  proving as Mr. S. stated, that the electrical and chemical
  powers of the Voltaic battery are distinctly separate phe
  nomena.

     April   15. — Fine clear day,  with small yellowish or rather
 copper-coloured cumuli, a           sort which accompany hot
 weather, which approach to the nature of those which pre
 cede storms, and are contrasted to the large white or silvery
  kind which appear in the intervals of cold snow showers.

      April   16. — Much cloud in moving         nimbus appeared
  in many places, with rocklike and tuberculated cumuli, cir
  rus, &c. By sunset the lofty cirri and cirrostrati refracted
  rich red colours.       In the NW bars of alternate red and
  yellow were made by alternation of strata of cirrostratus
  and common haze between them. Wind westerly. Therm,

   the usual phaenomena of loose kinds of cirrocumulus, cirrus,
    &c. in the clear intervals.    Wind in gales.
       It is remarkable, that lately many appearances indicating
   rain have been observable, but they did not end in actual
    nimbification till after the occurrence of cold weather on
    the 21st.

   Meteorological Observations made at Cambridge, from                  April
                           29, to    May 11, 1813.
       April   29. — Rainy morning, and cold, cloudy, and windy
   afternoon; with cold northerly gales. The thermometer1
   at » 1 P.M. was 42°.
       April 20.— *Cold, rainy, and windy morning ; it became
   warmer in the evening, and held up; but the night was
   dark and calm ; and thermometer at 11 P.M. 44°.
       May 1. — Cloudy, with a good deal of small rain. Ther
   mometer      at midnight 46®.         Wind easterly.
       May    2. — Clouds and threatening rain in the morning ;
   the day cleared, and was calm and warm, with large con
   fluent cumuli; cirrostratus and red haze in the west in the-
   evening. Thermometer at 1 1 P.M. 43°.                  In the day were
   occasional and gentle gales of wind from the north*.
       May 3. — Overcast early, afterwards clear. About ten
  ©'clock in the morning, looking up I noticed the following
   phaenomena : large beds of cirrus of flimsy but fibrous
   structure, changed into larger and more discriminative cirro-
• stratous
              lines, and afterwards into cirrocumulus whose nu-
  beculce were small ragged pendulous and confluent aggre
  gates, which continually changed their forms ; while others
  were added at one extremity of the bed, by an apparent de
  position of mist which separated into rows, and lastly be
  came cirrocumuli by subdivision : such phaenomena ap
  pearing and disappearing continued above, while cumuli
  sailed along below with motions not uniform either as to
  direction or velocity. Through the day cumuli increased
  in number, and cirrus appeared above ; in the evening the
  clouds were confused and in different altitudes with a hazy
  moon.        Thermometer 2 P.M. 66°, at 11 P.M. 51°. Wind
  below easterly.       Showers came on in the night.
      May 4. — Warm morning with gentle showers, and
 nearly calm air in variable currents.            A thunder-storm oc
  curred about two P.M. the thermometer just after it was
 63°.      After one of the flashes of lightning the rain came
 down with redoubled violence, mixed with hail. This
 augmentation of the strength of the shower often succeeds
 a discharge of lightning        f.     Thermometer at midnight 5a0.
     * A  thick and sudden fog of short duration happened near London thi»
 day at about one o-clock.    At Cambridge there was only a mistiness in the
 middle of the day.                                          • -    -.  -
   . f In ihe formation of thunder-storms, I have noticed that where the rain
 actually begins to form and descend, the intensity of the blackness is not so
 great as where the mmulosiratus is only going into a state of nimbus.      If
 therefore the density is increased in the formation of drops of water, the
 blackness must depend on some other peculiarity of structure.
                                                                        May

like scud.         Cloudy at night. Thermometer midday 65° ;
 11 P.M. 55°.
     May 6. — Fine warm day, but cloudy and misty in the
morning; after it cleared, the haze continued, and large
masses of cumulus prevailed of mountainous appearance.
Therm, at 3 P.M. 68°. In the evening much cirrostralus.
Therm, at 11 P.M. 51°. Wind northerly.
     May 7- — Clouded morning; various clouds ; warm day
when it cleared ; thunder-storms about, and some rain fell
here.       Clear night, with thermometer at 5 P.M. 50".
     May 8 — Clouded early, with a mist like what in Corn
wall is called the pride of the morning ; fair day with cumuli
and cirrus above ; at night a faint halo round the moon.
The large clouds did not evaporate or disappear till late *.
Therm, at midday 67°. Midnight 53°. Wind variable
 and quiet.
     May g. —Warm still day, with much cloud in the morn
 ing, and an appearance of nimbification at a distance, fine
 red sunset when the clouds broke ; at night large confluent
 cirrocunmlative masses. Thermometer 3 P.M. 69°. Mid
 night 56°.
      May 10. — Warm close day with thick haze, through
 which much cloud was seen, generally cumuli, which in
 the evening appeared copper-coloured                  through the mist.
 At night there          were   cirrocumuli    in   beds, at considerable
 altitude.       Thermometer at 1 1 at night 55°.
      May 11 — Overcast morning, and somewhat cooler. The
 swift (kirundo apus) made its first appearancef. In the course
 of the day much cloud. No sun at times, and showers in
 the evening.          Therm, at 1 1 P.M. 56°. -
     * If the nocturnal descent of the watery particles depend only on their
 comparative gravity being increased by a diminution of calorific repulsion,
 and the consequent uniting of the particles into minute drops of water; and.
  if their reascent in the morning depend on a correspondent Increase of
 levity by the acquisition of calorific repulsion ; it would follow that water
  was much more expansible by heat than airs ; since, by an alteration of
  temperature they were made at times much lighter, and at others heavier,
  than the particles of air.
     f The swallow (hinmdo Tuslica) was seen in the middle of April ; and the
  martlet (kit undo iitrlica) at the latter end of April.   It would be well if
  meteorologists   would notice the earliest appearance of migratory birds in
  their journals, as the irregularities in their appearance may be dependent
  cn atmospheric causes.

LXI.  An Attempt to determine the definite and simple Pro~
  portions, in which the constituent Parts of unorganic Sub

  i-ius, Professor of Medicine and Pharmacy, and M.R.A.

                               XIV. Potass.
A.    Separation      of the Base of Potass [Potassium]           by means
                       of   the   Electrical Column,
I have
column
         employed in these experiments the same electrical
            in those which have already been published ; it
             as
consists of 26 pairs of zinc and copper plates soldered to
gether, each ten inches square, and their surface conse-
quently containing 100 square inches each.      Between the
plates  were  placed pieces of pasteboard, dipped in a satu
rated solution of common salt.
   I was for a long time in the habit of performing the de*
composition in a glass tube, one end of which was closed
round a wire of platina, which projected somewhat within,
it.    I poured quicksilver into          it,
                                        so that   stood above the
                                                       it
level of the wire       and upon this
                        ;                   saturated solution of
                                                a
caustic potass, containing some undissolved crystals                   ;I
then brought the platina wire of the positive pole of the
column into the alkaline solution, and made             communi
                                                            a
cation between the fixed platina wire of the tube, and the
negative pole of the column.         While the column was in
strong    action,  that is,  commonly, for the first two day3, the
potass    and  the  water   were decomposed together; but when
 the action was weaker, the potass alone was decomposed.
 Since in this apparatus the affinity of potassium for oxygen
 appeared to be weaker than that of hydrogen,             thoughtI
 that   itmerely depended on the too great intensity of the
 discharge, that any water was decomposed                   by
                                                          and theit
                                                                  ;
 cause of this intensity seemed to be the too small dimen
 sions of the discharging surfaces in comparison with those
 of the columns, and with the quantity of electricity dis
 placed.     I  therefore hoped that an extension of the dis
 charge to        greater surface would diminish the intensity,
                  a
 and thus prevent the decomposition of water, and the con
  sequent waste of electricitv, and afford       larger quantity of
                                                       a
  potassium, since the whole electricity would be confined to
  this object.    According to these ideas, altered the appara
                                                       I
  tus; I   poured quicksilver to the height of about      line into
                                                                  a
a   little dish of glass, with        fiat bottom, and about two
                                         a

402                   On definite Proportions.
inches in diameter, and on it the solution of potass ; I in
troduced the iron wire of the negative pole into the quick
 silver, and brought a spiral wire of platina, which com
municated with the positive pole of the column, into the
 solution, at the distance of about a line from the surface of
 the quicksilver : its coils were nearly in one plane, and
 parallel to the surface of the quicksilver: a plate of platina
 would have been less fit for the purpose, since its lower
Surface would have become continuallv covered with bub
bles of oxygen, which could not have escaped.               In this
 apparatus    the  decomposition    of  potass  took place very ra
 pidly;   and   in   24  hours  the  quicksilver,   which  weighed
 about 80 grammes, or <2\ ounces troy, was so impregnated
with potassium, that it was no longer fluid. It is evident
that by a greater number of plates the intensity of the
 charge might have been so much increased, that this en
larged surface would still have been too small for the de
composition of the potass only.
    Since in the operation of the column upon a saturated
solution of potass, when quicksilver forms the negative
conductor, the affinity of potassium for oxygen appears the
 w-eaker, it seems to follow that potass alone should be de
composed when the force of the column is infinitely small.
In order to examine this point, I constructed a column
with 20 pairs of zinc and copper plates, \ \ inch in diame
ter, placing between them pieces of cloth moistened with
a solution of salt.       When I exposed a saturated solution
of caustic potass to the operation of this column, in the
apparatus first described, the positive wire emitted oxygen
in small quantities, while no extrication of gas was obser
vable at the surface of the quicksilver. At the expiration of
six hours, a globuleof quicksilver taken out of the apparatus
already exhibited evident traces of potassium ; and after
24 hours I found the quicksilver strongly impregnated with
it,  so that
           it   caused an extrication of gas in pure water for
several hours.
    What has hitherto been mentioned, relates more to the
physical properties of the electrical column than to the
decomposition       of the alkalis  :    deserved however to be
                                        it
noticed,   as a   caution to those  experimenters, who have the
command of column of large plates, in order that they
                  a
may be aware of the danger of failing to obtain the greatest
possible effect in saturated solutions, like those of the caustic
alkalis, hy    employing too small      asurface in the immediate
operation    of decomposition   :  while  in the decomposition of
the alkaline earths, as will be seen hereafter, another mode
                                                                of

                       On definite Proportions.                403
of proceeding     is required.      The greater the surface of the
plates, the greater must be the extent of the decomposing
surface.     Each point of it possesses indeed a less intensity
of the electrochemical operation than in a smaller surface,
but the sum of all the decompositions is greater.          There is
however for everv given magnitude of the plates a maximum
of the extent of the decomposing surface, beyond which
the effect will not be increased.         If the two surfaces are
not parallel, the intensity of the discharge is increased in
those points which are nearest to each other, and at the
same time the sum of all the effects is diminished.          If the
battery   acts powerfully,     a vegetation   of potassium   shoots
up from the negative conductor opposite to these points,
but does not come into contact with the positive conductor,
before the battery is weakened, and the evolution of gas
 from the positive wire, which has kept it at a distance, is
diminished.       If now the potassium touches the positive
conductor, it discharges the column without any further
decomposition, until the potassium is again oxidated, and
 converted into potass.
    The quicksilver acts, in all these experiments, a very re
 markable part.      Its affinity to the base of the alkali has so
 great a share in the decomposition, that with the column
 which I have mentioned, taking every possible precaution,
 I have never been able to separate the component parts of
  potass without its assistance.        I was very much surprised
 to find that even in Davy's battery, which was nearly thirty
 times as powerful as mine, the alkaline earths only afforded
 their bases distinctly when quicksilver was employed.              I
  was first induced to employ this method in order to collect
  the very minute portions of metal which are set at liberty
  at the negative conductor, and dissipated by the evolution
 of gas: it was some time after 'this that I observed, that
  the quicksilver operated also by its affinity, as will hereafter
  be shown by a direct experiment.          When the negative wire
  is taken out of the quicksilver, the decomposition of the
  potassium ceases together with the negative state of the
  quicksilver, and the wire emits, as long as it continues in
  the alkaline solution, only hydrogen, without the slightest
  trace of a separation of potassium.         Here then the affinity
  of hydrogen to oxygen appears to be the weaker, the de
  composing operation of the electricity on the fluid being no
  longer strengthened by the affinity of quicksilver for potas
  sium.
      While the quicksilver contains         no more than -j-J-j- of
  potassium,   it remains fluid   ;  but afterwards, that part of it

which combines with a greater portion, crystallizes, and
swims on the rest.         If the operation of the column i*
powerful, crystals are formed, which are small, irregular,
and sometimes needle-shaped, and commonly vegetate to
wards the positive conductor, when hydrogen begins to be
evolved, and the decomposition of potass to be diminished,
if we neglect to push downrthe vegetation into the general
mass ot\the quicksilver.      As the power of the column is
exhausted, the crystallization becomes more regular, and
sometimes very large hollow cubes are formed, consisting
of large quadrangular funnels, exactly like those of com-"
mon salt.      If these are collected, crushed into pieces, dried
on blotting paper, and exposed, in a closed vessel, to a tem
perature of 50° Cels. [122*], they melt, and harden in
cooling into a crystalline crust, consisting of small solid
cubes, exactly as happens in the hasty evaporation of a
small portion of culinary salt.       When treated with water,
their mass loses -0127 of its weight, and consequently con
tains little more than 1 \ per cent, of potassium.
    If we distil an amalgam of potassium in a small appa
ratus filled with dried hydrogen gas, over the flame of a
spirit lamp, at first pure quicksilver passes over ; but after
wards, when the metals remain in nearly equal volumes,
some potassium accompanies it ; and lastly, when nothing
more passes over at a low red heat, there is found left in
the retort a melted metallic substance, which when cold
adheres so firmly to the glass, that the retort must be
broken in order to obtain it. In the flexure of the retort
some congealed drops are always found, perfectly resembling
an amalgam of lead or tin. The residuum has a faint me
tallic splendour, is of a gray colour, inclining to red, and
changing in a short time in the open air into dark brown
or black : it is by no means pure potassium, this substance
being, according to Davy, fluid at a moderate temperature,
like quicksilver, but greaily resembles the protoxide of
potassium, which Davy- obtained by melting dry potass
 with potassium.       When thrown into water, this substance
 sinks immediately to the bottom, and hydrogen gas is
 evolved with the greatest violence; at last a globule of
 quicksilver remains, which occupies -fa onlv of its original
 volume. If this residuum is heated in the flame of a can
 dle, it swells and changes into a saline mass, but does not
inflame. I have proposed to myself three questions re
 specting this substance, neither of which I can satisfactorily
answer: Is it a combination of the protoxide of potassium
with quicksilver, that is, of a metal with an oxidated sub
                                                          stance  ?

                    On definite Proportions.                      405
Stance?   Or, can so small a quantity of quicksilver be suf
ficient to disguise so completely the properties of potas
sium ? Or, are both substances in the form of protoxides ?
When      I   had kept a portion          of this substance about a
month in a small stopped bottle, I found it surrounded by
a gray brown cracked crust, in the middle of which a centre
of the amalgam of potassium was found, containing so
much quicksilver that it was completely fluid.       I took off
the gray brown crust, and threw it into water, in which it
occasioned a very brisk extrication of gas. When moisten
ed with a drop of water, it evolved hydrogen with the
greatest violence, with heat and smoking.      The water con
tained potass, and left behind yellow oxide of mercury.
The gray brown crust therefore contained again a combi
nation of potassium with quicksilver, in a condition of
which I cannot form a distinct idea. During the most
violent extrication of hydrogen gas, the quicksilver exhi
bited itself in the highest degree of oxidation.      Can this
be explained by an electrochemical       polarity within the
fluid ? I think scarcely ; for the effect is the same upon
glass, as upon platina or wood.
    Since, according to Davy-s account, a greater heat, than
that in which I distilled the amalgam of potassium, destroys
and perforates the glass, I give up the hope of obtaining
potassium pure by means of my electrical battery.
    An unsuccessful attempt to separate the base of ammonia
from a boiling solution of sal ammoniac by means of Rose-s
or D-Arcet's fusible mixture of bismuth with zinc and tin,
induced me to attempt to collect potassium by means of
the same compound.        I had hoped, that if the former base
could be collected in      it, would be easier to separate
                                 it                                   it

                                           than the amalgam
 with quicksilver; but in this hope was disappointed.
                                            I                         I
employed      this experiment
              in                 glass tube,

              a                             On this wire put      I
the metallic compound,        poured on      the concentrated

alkaline solution, and melted the metal      means of lamp,   a
which was kept burning throughout the experiment.          The
battery acted powerfully; and      considerable extrication of
                                      a
gas took place, both from the metal and from the positive
wire. The solution became more and more saturated, and
after two or three hours     began to dry up.

the vapour of vinegar, they did not restore its colour: when
thrown into boiling water, they melted, without the extri
cation of any air; nor did the water become in any degree
alkaline.    YVas the temperature, or the want of affinity of
the compound for potassium, the cause that none was ob
tained ?    I at first suspected the former, and therefore ex
posed, in the same apparatus, a solution of potass, with
quicksilver, to the heat of the same lamp.         The quicksilver
at first emitted much gas, but its quantity continually di
minished as the solution became more concentrated by the
effect of the heat: and the quicksilver, when poured out,
was found to be strongly impregnated with potassium. The
elevated temperature had consequently not prevented the
decomposition of the potass in this experiment, but only
in the beginning reduced the solution to the state in which
it is found at common temperatures when less concen
trated; and this experiment affords a positive proof that
the quicksilver, in the decomposition          of potass, operates
not merely by collecting the product, but also by an affi
nity, which is wholly wanting in Rose-s fusible compound.
   B. Attempt     to ascertain the Composition     of 1Potassium.
    It would be    a fruitless labour to endeavour to add any
thing   to the excellent    essay of Davy on the properties of
the bases of potass and soda, even if it were possible to ob
tain these substances as readily as he did without the assist
ance of mercury.         On the other hand, his attempts to in
vestigate the proportions of these compounds seem to re
quire some confirmation ; since they were made on too
small a scale, and the weight of the bases burnt was ascer
tained indirectly, so that small errors may have had a very
material influence on the results.
   i have attempted to perform the analysis of the alkalis
in such a manner as to obtain a result on which more de
pendence may be placed, notwithstanding the many diffi
culties to which my method is liable.          I suffered a portion
of the amalgam of potassium of known weight to oxidate
itself in water; I saturated the potass thus obtained with
muriatic acid, and fused the salt that was formed.             From
 the weight which the mercury had lost, I inferred the
 weight of the potassium, and from the analysis of the mu
riate of potass that was obtained, that of the potass formed.
In the beginning the experiments disagreed very much
among themselves ; and in order to discover the cause
of the difference, I was obliged to repeat the same experi
ment 20 or 30 times.            The first cause of the uncertainty
                                                                 was

                   On definite Proportions.                     407
was the small quantity of potassium contained in the amal
gam ; for I have often been obliged to take 60 grammes,
or more, in order to work with one-third of a gramme of
potassium.      If now the larger weights are uncertain even
to t^stt, we may easily obtain, when they are changed
after the extraction of the potassium, a result too great or
too small by a milligramme, which is of some importance
in the calculation. I therefore always employed, in weighing
the amalgam, some small weights, which amounted to little
more than the potassium I expected to find, in order to be
able to make as few changes as possible.            The different
degrees of dryness of the amalgam, before and after the ex
periment, may be a second cause of error.         I therefore left '
the amalgam, which I obtained, in a small well stopped
<U+25BC>essel, of which it filled four-fifths, for some time, on a very
hot sand-bath, so that all the water adhering to it wis de
composed by the potassium ; I then poured the pure mass
into a little phial, which it filled to the neck, and weighed it-
After the extraction of the potassium, I dried the mercury
again in a strong heat, so that it was completely freed from
water.     The amalgam must be weighed in a stopped [Sw.
not "dried" as G.] vessel, otherwise it acquires weight
during the operation, by the formation of drops of a solu
tion of potass on its surface.      An error may arise in the
third place from the different effect of the solvent.      If   the
amalgam was oxidated in pure water, the hydrogen escaped
without the slightest smell, even when the oxidation pro
ceeded pretty rapidly : but when I added muriatic acid, the
hydrogen acquired a strong smell, resembling that which
is perceived during the solution of zinc in this acid.       Con
sequently the gas     must  have    held  something in solution ;
and this could be nothing else than potassium : hence the
experiments, in which the muriatic acid was used for the
solution of the potassium, always gave a smaller result
than the rest.      The same circumstance occurs when an
amalgam      of the  base of one of the earths is dissolved      in,
diluted muriatic acid even
                        ;      if    instead of the acid we only
add sal ammoniac    ;    while   in  this case such an addition  is
the more necessary,     in order to obtain the earth in  a    state
of solution.
   The numerous experiments which      Ihave made, respect
ing the  component parts of potass, gave at first the propor
tion of oxygen varying from 16 to 20 per cent.          Ishall
here only adduce those which were conducted with the
greatest care, and of which the results agree tolerably well
with each other.    They indicate     greater proportion of
                                      a

oxygen than Davy found, although most of the causes of
error tend to lessen the apparent quantity of oxygen.
    1. ) I collected several portions of the amalgam, and
weighed them before and after the extraction of the po
tassium.     The potass obtained was mixed together and
saturated with muriatic acid, the excess of which was eva
porated in a small glass vessel, and the salt, together with
the washings of the glass, was dried in a small golden cru
cible, weighing about three grammes, and then melted and
weighed in the crucible.     The whole of the potassium had
weighed -4575 gr. and the melted muriate of potass -8675.
Now the muriate of potass contains          64-19 per cent, of
potass, consequently the "8675 gr. answer to -5568 gr. of
pure potass ; and potass consists, according to this experi
ment, of 82-166 of potassium, and 17-834 of oxygen.
Some chemists have objected to this mode of determination,
that the fused salt might possibly still contain some water.
But not to mention, that the calculation for this salt gives
almost the same quantity of potass, (see Ltirb. i. kem. I.
399.) it is well known that in a melting heat neither the
muriate of potass nor that of soda is altered by charcoal,
by phosphorus, or by iron, which would necessarily happen
if they contained water, at the expense of which these
combustible bodies would be oxygenized.
   2. ) The different operations of weighing might have oc
casioned inaccuracies, which might be singly unimportant,
but of material consequence when added together.            I there
fore repeated the same experiment with a single portion
of amalgam, which weighed 30-0775 gr.            It  gave, by treat
ment with water, - 1275 gr. of potassium       ;  and this, satu
rated with muriatic acid, boiled, and melted, -25 gr. of
muriate of potass, containing -160 gr. of pure potass:
whence we have 80 of potassium to SO of oxygen.
   3. ) The difference of these results being very consider
able, I repeated the experiment with a greater quantity of
a hardened amalgam, which weighed 67"003 gr.                  It lost
 -32 in water, and gave -609 of fused muriate of potass,
which is equivalent to -39027 of pure potass. Hence 100
parts of potass contain 82 of potassium and 18 of oxygen.
    According to these experiments, 100 parts of potass
Seem to contain about 18 parts of oxygen,           and 82 of po
tassium.     And if we examine this result by the rules in
vestigated and developed in the first part of this essay, we
shall find it very correctly confirmed. The sulphate of
 potass consists, according to Bucholz's experiments on
precipitation (Scherer x. 396) of 45-34 of the acid and
                                                               53-66

                    On definite Proportions.                  409
8366 of potass, with one part of water; or 100 parts of
sulphuric acid are saturated by 1 18-35 of potass. Now, if
the loo parts of sulphuric acid require in the 118-35 of
potass, according to the foregoing analysis, 20-29 of oxy
gen, 100 parts of prftass must consist of 17-152 oxygen
and 82-848 of potassium.
   From five grammes of melted muriate of potass, dissolved
in water and precipitated by nitrate of silver, I obtained
9-575 gr. of fused horn silver.       Rose obtained from loo
grains  of this muriate I9lj of horn silver; which exactlv
agrees with my experiment.        Consequently    the muriate   of
potass consists of
                                             -

parts of potass 30-49 of oxygen, 100 parts of potass must
consist of 1 7 "03 oxygen and 82-97 of potassium.
   The difference between the results of the calculation      and
of the experiment amounts to somewhat          less than one per
cent, and  1 have good reasons for considering that of the
calculation   as the more accurate.       Consequently potass

   The bases of potass and soda are, according to Davv-s
excellent investigation, but little different, consequentlv
they must be affected nearly in the same manner bv the
operation of collecting them in quicksilver by means of
the electrical pile.    The most material differences that J
have observed are the following.
   «.) The caustic soda is less readily decomposed than tlvc
potass, since the solution of soda is not so easily concen
trated, and crystallizes sooner.
   b.) The amalgam of sodium does not crystallize, and the
appearance of the quicksilver is little changed, until it is
strongly impregnated with it: but then the sodium forms
sharp and silvery vegetations, which, as the proportion of
the sodium to the mercury increases, assume a leaden gray
colour, and the form of a cauliflower, exactly like the base
of ammonia, which attaches itself to an iron wire covered
with amalgam at the point.         In the open air, its surface
becomes moist much sooner than that of the amalgam of
potass ; and as soon as one portion of the solution of soda
has been wiped away, another appears in increasing quan

tity.    This circumstance renders the analysis of soda stifl
more    difficult, since"the amalgam can scarcely be put into
the vessel in which it is to be weighed, without an increase
of its weight by the moisture which it acquires             Hence
the results of my experiments on soda agree still less with „
each other than the foregoing, although they were per
formed with equal accuracy, and founded on the same bases.
    1. ) From 28 grammes        of amalgam, byr digestion with
water and a little muriatic acid, which does not here, as in
the ease of potassium, produce a fetid hydrogen gas, I ob
tained "1386 for the quantity of sodium. The soda afforded
 •365 gr. of fused common salt, which indicates -198 gr. of
dry soda; whence we have for 100 parts of soda exactly
 JO of sodium and 30 of oxygen.
    2. ) From 37 gr. of amalgam I obtained "175 of sodium,
whence "46 gr. of fused salt were formed, containing -2496
of pure soda. According to this experiment, soda con
 tains 70-11 of its base, and 29-89 of oxygen.
    3. ) From 76 gr. of amalgam I obtained -439 of sodium,
which afforded 1-1 18 gr. of fused salt ; containing -606,6
of pure soda. Hence we have, for 100 parts of soda, 72-37
of sodium and 27-63 of oxygen.
    The last experiment having been performed with the
largest quantity of the substance, and at the same time
 with the greatest accuracy of which analyses of this kind
 are susceptible,     I think it probable that its result comes
 nearest to the truth.     Several other experiments, performed
 with smaller quantities, gave proportions of oxygen varying
 from 27 to 36 percent.         It seems superfluous to describe
 them more particularly, as they are in all respects less to
 be depended on than this.        I always found the proportion
 of oxygen apparently       the  greater as the quantity of the
 base, with which I worked, was smaller.
    If we calculate the composition of soda in the same
 manner     as we have done that     of potass, we shall find here
 a similar agreement.
    Bucholz obtained, from 1000 grains of crystallized sul
 phate of soda, 698 of sulphate of baryta, and he attributes
 to the salt 568 grain3 of water of crystallization.        Conse
 quently 100 parts of dry sulphuric acid must require for
 their saturation 62 09 of dry soda.         But several calcula
 tions for different salts, proceeding with these numbers,
 convinced me that there must be some error in them, which
 probablv arises from the uncertainty respecting the dryness
 of the Glauber's salt, and the quantity of its water of cry
 stallization, the latter not being capable of so accurate a
                                                    determination

for such experiments as these.
    I there-tore dissolved five erammes of ignited sulphate of
soda in water, and added to it nitrate ot baryta ; the pre
cipitate, when ignited, weighed 8-2 gr. answering to 2-769
gr. of sulphuric acid.       In a second experiment J obtained
from the same quantitv 6-16 gr. of ignited sulphate of
baryta.      According to Bucholz-s experiments, I ought to
have had but 8" 125 gr.          The difference is not great, but
sufficient to cause a considerable variation in the results.
According to this experiment, the sulphate of soda consists
of            Sulphuric acid . . 55-76            100-00

    Five grammes of ignited        muriate   of soda,  dissolved    in

of fused horn silver. Rose obtained from the same quantity,
 12-175 gr.      These 12-23 gr. of horn silver answer to 2-287
 of muriatic acid ; hence the muriate of soda consists of

     These analyses of the two salts may be submitted to a
 test in the following manner.          According to these experi
 ments, 100 parts of muriatic acid are saturated bv 179 "f
 potass, and by 1 18-627 of soda: on theosherhand, 100 parts
 of -sulphuric acid require 11835 of potass and 79"34 of
 soda for their saturation ; but 1 79 : 1 1 8-63= 1 16-35 : 78-43 ;
 A result which agrees to'erably        well with the experiment,
 but shows that even in these four experiments there must
 be some error, which causes the difference.
     The 100 parts of sulphuric acid suppose, in 79-34 "f
 *oda, 20-29 of oxygen, that is 25-56 per cent, with 74-44
 of sodium : and 100 parts of muriatic acid require, in the
  118-627 of soda, 30-49 of oxygen; whence 100 pans of
 »oda must consist of 25-71 oxygen and 74-29 sodium.
-    These experiments do not indeed a<rree so well together
 %i in the case of potass ; but still sufficiently to enable us
  to conclude that we have in some degree approximated to
  the truth.    As \ have no reason to prefer one of these re

large scale, and found, that when pure metals are used, the
•potass contains about 15 per cent, of oxygen, the soda 25

 with respect to soda, pretty well with mine.    [And in the
last Bakerian Lecture we find that 100 parts of potassium

                      XVI. Ammonia.
   It would be useless to relate here all the fruitless experi
ments which [ performed, nearly in Dary-s manner, in
order to obtain the base of ammonia in a separate stale.       It
is utterly impossible to dry an amalgam of this basis, which
is formed in a fluid.     I therefore endeavoured to obtain it
by  the operation   of  dry bodies.   For this purpose I mixed
dry amalgam of potass with dry sal ammoniac, finely pow
dered, in a tubulated retort, provided with a receiver. Both
vessels were previouslv filled with hydrogen, which I had
caused to pass through a long tube filled with fused mu
riate of lime.    The sal ammoniac began, after some time,
to be decomposed, and the retort, in an hour and a half,
was filled with an amalgam of the consistence of butter.
When I wished to distil the mass, the amalgam subsided
into the original volume of the mercury; and when the
apparatus was opened, ammoniacal gas and hydrogen gas
escaped, with a slight explosion.         The neck of the retort
was full of drops of water.      This result is easily explained
when we consider that sal ammoniac contains water of cry
stallization, amounting, according to the analysis hereafter
to be related, to 19 per cent.       The potassium is oxidated
at the expense both of the water and of the ammonia
in the salt, and this latter is reduced to a metallic form :
but it is converted again at the expense of the water of a
neighbouring portion of the salt, into ammonia; so that
after the completion of the whole operation, only the oxy
gen of the water has vanished, having been employed in
the formation of the potass, by which the sal ammoniac
has been decomposed as a salt.
   In order to separate the newly formed amalgam from the
powder of sal ammoniac adhering to        it,
                                            I   made an instru
ment of   a   glass  tube,  at the   ends  of  whichI   blew two
bulbs, one of them running into       a   long  and  thin point:
it was filled at the temperature of the freezing point, under
boiled quicksilver, with dried hydrogen gas, passed through
the point, which was then sealed, and stuck through      a  thick
cork, which had been previously fitted to bottle, in which
                                                a
                                              '               was

                        On definite Proportions.                 413
was a large quantity of the amalgam of ammonium, pre
pared from sal ammoniac and amalgam of potassium.                The
bottle was opened, the point quickly broken off, and the
cork made air-tight in the neck of the bottle, in such a
manner, that the point of the tube entered the amalgsm.
The bali was then warmed, and the hydrogen forced into
the bottle ; as it cooled, the amalgam began to force itself
into the tube, but it was of such a consistence that it stuck
half way within the tube. By the application of wafmth
it acquired a greater degree of fluidity, but was still driven
back. After repeated trials, i at last succeeded in getting
a part of the semifluid mass into the ball ; but it soon be
came covered with a thin coat of saline dust, so that I was
obliged to content myself with the smaller portion of amal
gam, which I had been able to collect in tolerable purity.
 When I had melted >together the sides of the tube a little
 above the bottle, I tried to distil the amalgam contained in
it from one bulb into the other.          The- saline powder, which
had entered with        it,
                         lay  on   the  metallic   surface asa   gray
 mealv covering.      The mass was first heated over the flame
 of an oil lamp the saline powder was thus still further
                    ;
 decomposed, and the amalgam swelled to twice its volume:
 the salt in the mean time became agitated, and was con
 verted into    a fine snow white dust of muriate of potass.
 The amalgam was now almost entirelv hardened, and du
 ring a  whole hour, while the heat of the lamp acted on             it
 without interruption, and raised its temperature far above
 the boiling point of water,       itunderwent no further change
 whatever.      Ithen put      a spirit lamp under the bulb      : the
 mass then became black, and was covered with           a  dark crust,
 while the quicksilver returned to its original dimensions.
 By continuing the process, this crust disappeared, and the
 quicksilver was distilled over to              of its volume. The
 product of the distillation was not quite so fluid as pure
 quicksilver; but the difference was inconsiderable.            When
I   opened, the apparatus under water, after       ithad been cooled^
  the quicksilver ran out, the water forced itself in, and oc
  cupied somewhat more than            of the receiver; a   proof that
  there  was  some-ammoniacal         e;asin   the apparatus, having
  been left in the gaseous form, unaltered         by the amalgam re
  maining  in  the retort. The quicksilver, which ran out, gave
  indistinct marks of an evolution of gas, which            I    could
  however   by  no means attribute to the passing over of the
  base of ammonia       since this base, when the amalgam sub
                        ;
  sided,  had  certainlv   oxidated itself at the expense of the
  tvater in the powder of sal ammoniac.            The amalgam left
                                                                     in

in the bulb of the retort was crystallized.        When brought
near a glass stopple, moistened with muriatic acid, it exhi
bited no more vapours : consequently the base of ammonia
had been completely destroyed in ihis experiment.
    Having learned, from this result, that the base of am
monia cannot be exhibited pure by experiments with the
amalgam of ammonium, I performed several experiments
in different ways, in order to determine whether and in
what form this base can be exhibited separatelv.              But I
have hitherto been able to obtain no satisfactory determina
tion of the question.
    I have related, in the description of my electrochemical
experiments, performed in common with Dr. Pontin; that
the base of ammonia, combined with a small quantity of
mercury, forms a leaden gray flocculent amalgam, which
floats on water.      This amalgam may be obtained without
 the immediate operation of electricity, if we mix the re
siduum lett after tfie distillation of the amalgam of potas
 sium, with a concentrated solution of sal ammoniac, in a
strong and well stopped vessel. The decomposition begins
immediatelvvand the newly formed amalgam swells some
times to 150 or 200 times the volume of the quicksilver,
which remains after the complete oxidation of boih the
bases.     It emits at first a little gas ; but this extrication of
gas soon diminishes, and becomes at last, as the pressure
of the air in the vessel increases, totally imperceptible.
The amalgam then floats on the surface of the fluid, in the
form of 'd porous, round mass, putting out vegetations on
all sides.    If we open the vessel, hydrogen gas is forced          .
out with an explosion, and the newly formed amalgam
begins to be decomposed, with a violent hissing.                  If
the experiment is performed in an open vessel, the base
of ammonia is oxidated almost the instant that it i3 pro
duced.
   Some attempts to combine the amalgam of the base of
ammonia with sulphur, or with phosphorus, afforded me
no satisfactory results.      When, for example, I shook the
amalgam of potassium with the sulphuretted hydroget [or
hydrotiieate] of ammonia, I obtained nothing but the sul
phuretted hydroget [hydrotheatej         of potass, and the usual
buttery amalgam.       Sulphuret of potass had no perceptible
effect on the amalgam of ammonia, although the mercury
alone would have blackened it; but when the amalgam
shaken with sulphuret of potass, alter being washed with
pure" water, was put into a solution of lead, it afforded evi
dent marks of containing a little sulphur ; which however

                 On  Mr.  Bennet's  Electrometer.            4 15
did not appear to have the slightest effect on its external
characters.
    It is totally impossible to investigate the quantity of oxy
gen in ammonia by direct experiments on the amalgam of
its base; I shall hereafter proceed to relate some experi
ments made in order to ascertain it.          The whole of our
knowledge of the base of ammonia, that problematical and
yet in every respect highly interesting substance, consists
almost entirely in our being assured of its existence under
certain circumstances.

                      By Ez. Walker, Esq.
                          To  Mr. Tilloch.
Dear Sir, —       I  do not remember to have seen any further
account of the properties of Mr. Helmet-s Electrometer,
 than what the inventor has given us in the Philosophical
Transactions for 1786, which relates mostly, to its extreme
 sensibility, in distinguishing small quantities of electricity.
This instrument, however, has other properties, which
  merit the attention of electricians.
    An excited surface being brought near the top of this
 instrument, but not so near as to produce as park, the gold-
 leaves will diverge in the same state of electricity as the
 excited surface ; but as soon as it is removed, the gold-
 leaves will collapse, and instantly diverge again in a con
trary slate ; and these changes will take place every time
 that the excited surface is moved to and from the cap of
 the instrument.
    There is no work on electricity with which I am ac
 quainted, that takes notice of these phaenomena, nor was
it till after I had made many experiments that I could form
 any thing like an explanation.
    But after I found that there is a positive and a negative
 point, at every interruption of an electric circuit, or that
 the top plate of the instrument is negative, at the same
 time that the gold-leaves are positive, the phenomena no
 longer appeared inexplicable.
     Place a slip of leaf-gold, about half an inch long and
 one-tenth of an inch broad, upon the top of the instrument,
 and let one end of it be fixed to the plate, with paste, gum-
 water, or varnish ; then, if a glass tube, excited by rubbing
 it with silk, be, brought near the top of the electrometer,

4i6      Case    of Hydropholia     cured in India by Bleeding.
the slip of leaf-gold will stand erect, being attracted by the
excited tube ; which shows that the top plate is possessed
of the resinous or negative electricity; and the gold leaves
within the glass will at the same time diverge with the
vitreous or positive electricity, the same as the excited tube.
     But. as soon as the excited surface is removed, the gold-
leaves will collapse and instantly diverge again, and when
examined will be found to have received the resinous elec
 tricity, the top plate still possessing the same fluid.
     Now, as part of the vitreous fluid has been repelled from
 the cap through the gold-leaves and tin -foil into the earth,
 the cap must necessarily possess less of the vitreous than
its natural share ; and consequently, when the excited tube
is removed, the resinous fluid in the cap will attract the
vitreous out of the gold-leaves : but this being too small
 a quantity to restore the equilibrium, the cap will still con
 tinue in a negative state, and communicate the negative or
 resinous fluid to the gold-leaves, which will cause them to
 diverge a second time           and as the cap is insulated it will
 continue electrified for some time after, if the instrument
 be a large one ^.
     This experiment also shows, that electricitv by induction
 or position doe3 not vanish as soon as the excited surface
 is removed, though Professor Robison and other writer!
 on electricity are of a contrary opinion.

 LXHI.       Case   of Hydrophobia      cured in India      by Bleeding.
     By John Shoolbred, M.D.                  From the Supplement ta
     the Calcutta Government Gazette, June 9, 1812.
                            [Concluded from p. 365.]
     x                           REMARKS.
 On       hearing that a recovery from hydrophobia has been
 effected in the short space of two hours, by the single re
 medy of blood-letting, a doubt may probably occur to a
 person acquainted with the previous history of this formi
 dable malady, and the nearly uniform failure of all attempts
 hitherto made for its cure ; whether the disease now said
 to be cured, was in reality a genuine case of hydrophobia,
    * The
           glass of an electrometer for these experiments  should not be lew
than four inches in diameter, and nine or ten indies high.
                                                                 produced

       Case of Hydrophobia    cured in India  ly Bleeding.   417
 produced by the bite of a rabid animal.      I admit the scepti
cism to   be reasonable ; for, in the relation of a case which
 has terminated so differently from all others yet on record,
 (not even excepting the case so successfully treated by Mr.
Tymon,) it is natural to suspect either some misconception
or misrepresentation of facts, or some fallacy in the de
ductions derived from them.                                        ,
    An attentive perusal of the preceding narrative will, it is
 presumed, remove these doubts from the minds of the ma
jority of readers. Yet, as some individuals may not be
convinced by that evidence which to others appears full
and satisfactory ; and as it is a matter of the utmost im
 portance to future sufferers from hydrophobia, that no
doubt should be allowed to remain, either as to the existence
of the disease itself, in the case above related, or that the
 bleeding was the sole remedy, I shall, as briefly as possible,
 endeavour to establish the certainty of both those facts be
 yond the possibility of contradiction.
    To a person who has never seen a case of hydrophobia,
 I acknowledge the difficulty, nay, almost the impossibility,
 of conveying by words an adequate ndtion of the disease.
 The horrors of that state must be seen to be fully conceived;
 but being once seen by a medical observer of any discern
 ment, they are indelibly fixed in the mind ; and I contend
 that it would then be highly improbable that he should ever
 mistake any other disease for hydrophobia ; or take hydro
 phobia for any of those affections to which it has been said
 to bear some resemblance ; — so deep and so permanent,          I
 am convinced, would be the impression left on his mind by
 the contemplation of even a single case of hydrophobia.
 But when I state that my situation as surgeon to the Cal
 cutta Native Hospital, for the last eighteen years, has af
 forded me opportunities of seeing the disease, which have
 fallen to the lot of few individuals in any country, and that
 no less than seventeen or eighteen cases, of it have come
 under my observation within that period, in all of which
 both my diagnosis and prognosis (with the single exception
 of the latter in the case under consideration) have unhappily
 been but too fatally verified, it is not, I trust, laying claim
 to too great a share of discernment to assert that I could
 not easily be mistaken in a case of hydrophobia; and that
 I should consider my being so as unlikely, as that an ex
 perienced surgeon should ever confound two diseases the
 most opposite in their nature, because, to an uninformed
 eye, they might both exhibit something of tke same, ex
 ternal appearance.

  4 1S      Case   of Hydroplwlia   cured in India  hj Bleeding.
       Further  :   it has been usual  with me, on the admission
   of a case oFhydrophobia into the hospital, to send for some
  of my medical friends, not only that they might see a dis
   ease    seldom occurring in _ private practice, but that           I
  might have the benefit of their suggestions in regard to
   the treatment.        On the present occasion, the promptitude
. necessary to the practice I had determined to adopt in
  the first case that occurred, and its astonishing effect in so
   suddenly and effectually subduing the disease, deprived me
   of the advantage I should now have derived in establishing
  the point in question from the concurring testimony of a
  judicious medical friend. But though not permitted to
   give direct evidence as to the existence of the disease in the
   case above detailed, these gentlemen can yet vouch, that
   they were never called by me to see a case of hydrophobia
  in which there existed the slightest doubt of the nature of
   the disease; and it will hardly be contended that            I  was
   more liable to mistake       it in this case  than on any former
   occasion.
       If these   facts and reasonings, combined with the account
   of the accident ; the time that elapsed before the appearance
   of the symptoms; — the statement given by the patient of
   tlje commencement of the disease; — and by his friends, as
   to the state in which he appeared before he was brought to
  the hospital ; — the symptoms under which he laboured
   when he arrived there; — should all be deemed insufficient
   to establish the real nature of the disease, I confess myself
   at a loss to conjecture what species of proof would be ne
   cessary for that purpose.         The only defective point in the
   evidence     appears to be our ignorance       whether the dog by
   which Amier was bitten was actually mad or not ? and
  though this cannot be proved by direct testimony,1 yet as
  it is known that the disease was prevalent among dogs,
   about that time, as will be hereafter noticed, it is presumed
   that this is an objection of very little weight.       If therefore
   any individual, after duly considering all these circumstances,
   still continue in doubt as to the nature of the disease, may it
   not in conclusion be permitted to ask him what it was, if
   not hydrophobia ?
      That the disease, whatever it might be, was removed,
   and that almost instantaneously, by bleeding alone, admits,
   in my mind, of equally little doubt.
       In Mr. Tymon-s successful case, the symptoms only

    system was evidently under the influence of the mercury
    before he could be said to be free from the disease, an opi
    nion might still be entertained, and actually was so, by
.   many with whom I have conversed on the subject, that
    the cure was, after all, effected by the mercury, and not by
    the bleeding.
       Dr. Berry himself, to whose rare and laudable zeal for
    the promotion of useful science, even at the period of clos
    ing a long and honourable career of public service, the
    world is indebted for the knowledge of Mr. Tymon's un
   precedented case of success, alleges that the bleeding
                                                           " saved
   Mason-s life by diminishing violent action, and admitting
    the effect of medicines that in all former experience had uni
  formly foiled."
       As this notion too corresponds with the most prevailing
   theory of the disease — though that theory has not in a single
   instance been verified by the success of the practice to which
   it gave rise, I consider it of great importance to correet
   it; lest, by still expecting some good from mercury and
   opium in hydrophobia, the attention of the physician
   should be diverted from a sufficient abstraction of blood,—
   on which, and on which alone, as far as a single case can
   prove any thing, the life of the patient seems entirely to
   depend.
      That the first bleeding in the case above related, wholly
   though not permanently, removed every symptom of the
   disease, was proved, [presume, in the most ample manner, by
   the followingsix remarkable circumstances : first, theremoval
   of the spasms; 2d, the freedom of respiration ; 3d, the re
   storation of the power of swallowing fluids, and the ab
   sence of horror at their approach ; 4th, the desire, instead
  of the abhorrence, of a current of air ; 5th, the inclination
  for a natural alvine evacuation ; and 6th, the power of
  sleeping. — All these unequivocal indications of recovery
  took place during or immediately after the first bleeding;
  and as none of them "ever happened before to a patient in
  hydrophobia, except near the close of the melancholy scene,
  .when they denote an enure sinking of the powers of life,—
  rather than the cessation of disease, — it seems but fair to
  ascribe them to a remedy which had never before been
  used as it was on this occasion — or, if so, unluckily not at
  the time when ii was capable of doing good.
       When a recurrence of the disease was threatened in
  two hours afterwards, the power of the remedy was again
  conspicuouslv manifested, and a second bleeding ad deli-
  quium instantly stopped the progress of the symptoms,
                                                   '          and,

before a single particle of medicine of any kind had been
given, permanently extinguished                the morbid condition,
whatever it may be, in which the essence of the disease
consists.
    These two points, therefore, appear to be fully proved ;
namely, that the disease was hydrophobia, and that the cure
consisted in blood-letting alone.
, But notwithstanding this unprecedented                 success,    Iam
not so sarfguine as to believe that venesection will cure
every case of hydrophobia.             It is probable that there is a
period   in the   disease  beyond which its curative effect can
not extend.       What that period            cannot be known with
                                             is,
out   amore enlarged experience.            But this very uncertainty
affords only      amore powerful reason for losing no time in
resorting to the copious abstraction of blood, upon the very
first appearance of unequivocal symptoms of the disease, as
the delay of only          few hours may prove fatal to the pa
                           a

    In referring to notes which have preserved of fourteen
                                      I
cases of hydrophobia,           Ifind that eight of the patients died
within six hours after admission. In these cannot believe that
                                                       I
bleeding would have done any good.                 But of the remaining
six, who lived respectively 11, 13, 15,20, 36, and 49 hours
after admission,       it   iscertainly reasonable to believe that       it
might have saved three or four. In                case so entirely hope
                                                   a
less, however, there could scarcely be harm to the indivi
dual, from trying          at any period of the disease.

                                                                is
sirable than otherwise that they should be made.                 One dis
advantage however, eventually arising from such trials, re
quires to be guarded against.               The medical profession,
taught      byinnumerable disappointments,             admit very cau
tiously   the  claims      of
                            any    new   mode     of practice to general
adoption.      If  several    patients   in  hydrophobia, therefore,
should happen to be bled            in an advanced stage of the dis
ease, and die, — as they inevitably would do whether they
had been bled or not, — auch cases would be quoted against
the new practice as failures, and might tend so far to bring
the remedy into discredit, as to prevent its being used even
in cases where        might have proved the certain means of
                      it
saving life.
 I   am the more desirous of noticing the unfavourable effect
upon the adoption of the new practice, which may eventually
arise from bleeding at too late   period of the disease, and
                                         a

    the remedy from such instances of failure, in consequence
    of the circumstance having very nearly happened to myself
    only three days hefore the occurrence of the case of Amier.
         On Saturday evening, the second of May 1812, a native
    of Arracan employed in Calcutta as a cook was brought
i   to the hospital labouring under symptoms of hydrophobia.
    I   went to him that moment, with the full determination of
    putting in practice the plan that had succeeded in the hands
    of Mr. Tymon; but I found that the unfortunate sufferer
    had been ill, according to the account of his friends, for
    56 hours.        His pulse was imperceptible, his skin cold,
    and his features sunk.         I therefore got him to swallow 100
    drops    of  laudanum,     which    he effected, as frequently hap
     pens,   with  greater   ease  than is usual in an earlier stage of
     the disease j and T ordered an enema with 300 drops.               The
     patient was dead in half an hour.               Now what I wish to
     impress upon the mind of the reader is — that                   if,
                                                                     in this
     case, the disease had been somewhat less advanced, the pulse
     still perceptible, and the strength less sunk,            Ishould cer
     tainly  have  bled  the  patient  —  which
                                             ;    at  such    period could

                                                                         so,
     might consequently have had the effect of preventing my
     pushing the bleeding in the case of Amier to the extent
     necessary to the cure.         I must therefore here insist, that
     numerous failures in an advanced stage of the disease will
      form no just ground for the rejection of               remedy which
                                                              a
     has been so incontestably proved to have cured the disease
      when used at an earlier period.         As well might the practi
     tioner reject bleeding in the commencement               of peripneu-
     mony     or  enteritis   in    robust

      each disease there      is   period after which the detraction of
      blood, so far from curing, would serve only to hasten the
      fatal event.
          Nothing, however, can fix the real value of the remedy
      but experience.     It        highly desirable that this may be
                                   is
      speedily   obtained;    and  as the disease does and must very
      frequently occur in this country, whether we possess the
      means of curing    it   or not, we cannot doubt that but          very
                                                                           a
       short time will elapse without further trials of this remedy
       andit  may be presumed that the medical practitioners, wh
       are so widely distributed throughout India, will fairly an.
       circumstantially communicate to the public the result cf

blood  is not the practice.  The vein must be opened by s
large orifice, the blood quickly evacuated, and allowed to
flow, without regard to measurement, ad animi deliquium.
Nothing less than this is capable of at once arresting the
progress of the disease, relieving the spasmodic affection of
the heart and arteries, suppressing excessive sensibility and
irritability; and, in short, of admitting the restoration of
that due balance of action and influence, both in the cir
culating and nervous systems, on which the continuance of
life and health seems to depend.
    But I lay no stress on this or any other pathology of the
disease.    Well authenticated trials of the remedy in an
early stage of            it,
                    are what      desire to see.

used hundreds of times, and for          series of years, have

     With respect to the subsequent treatment of the patient,
it   isscarcely necessary to make any remark.          The case
cjearly shows that for the hydrophobia no subsequent treat
ment was required.      But as this and many other cases on
record   show    great disposition to disordered and excessive
                      a

                  ?           however, that bleeding has often
been tried.    But owing, probably, to the evacuation not
being pushed far enough, when used in an early stage of
the disease — or to the period for its beneficial employment

       Case of Hydropholia cured in India by Bleeding. 423
and its classification with diseases of the nervous kind,
accompanied by great debility, tended directly to discourage
all lowering plans of cure, and to point out antispasmodics
and tonics as the only resource in hydrophobia.
    Dr. Mead, who was very confident that he had found an
infallible preventative of the disease, in a little liverwort
and black pepper, aided by bleeding and cold bathing before
the commencement of the course of medicine, says,         " as to
all other ways of curing the hydrophobia, I own I have not
been so happy as to find any success from the many I have
tried.    Bathing at this time is ineffectual.      I have taken
                                                                  1
away large quantities of blood ; have given opiates, vola-
tile salts, &c. &c. &c. — All has been in vain, because too
late." Notwithstanding his disappointment, he still con
cludes, " if any relief could be expected in this desperate
state, I think it would be from large bleeding even ad animi
deliquium, before the fibres of the membranes have lost their
natural force by convulsions.     But after all it will generally
happen, that (as the Greeks said upon deplorable cases)
 ' Death will be the                               This, though,
                      physician that cures.'"
a recommendation,      was certainly no great encouragement
to blood-letting.
    The doctrines of Boerhaave also led him and his pupils
lo recommend and practise bleeding in hydrophobia. The
celebrated Leyden Professor savs, " the distemper is to be
treated as one highly inflammatory, -upon the first appear
ance of the signs which denote its invasion, by blood-letting
from a large orifice, continued till the patient faints away ;
and soon after by enemata of warm water and vinegar,"
&c. &c. and he adds, " that this practice is supported by
some small number of trials."       But the particulars of this
successful practice are not given.
    I find, however, a trial of it at Edinburgh, more than
60 years ago, by the late Dr. Rutherford, a pupil of Boer-
haave's, who took away gradually sixty-six ounces of blood
from a patient who had already been bled the same morn
ing. As this patient lived forty-eight hours after the large
bleeding, it is probable that it was used somewhat early in
the disease, and should, therefore, it may be said, have suc
ceeded.     Why it did not, it is impossible now to tell ; but
I am persuaded the circumstances attending its failure had
great weight in deterring others from pursuing the plan re
commended by Boerhaave, and in giving an entirely dif
ferent direction to the practical views of physicians on the
Subject of hydrophobia.

who then          with great reputation            filled the practical chair
of the most celebrated school of medicine in Europe, can
didly retracted an opinion which he had learned from
Boerhaave, and which had directed the measures he took.
He declared in his public lectures, that               "
                                           he was convinced
now, that the hydrophobia         spasmodic and not
                                        is.   a           high         a
inflammatory disease     that though bleeding may be use
                              ;
ful in preventing furiousness, neither that nor the proper
antiphlogistic method      to be depended upon as the pro
                              is
per  cure  of hydrophobia;  that in such cases, after bleeding
once or twice, he would order sal succini, musk, opium, and
perhaps blisters."    Thus, at once sending abroad into all
       of the world the opinion that large bleeding was use-
 ess in hydrophobia, and inculcating the use of antispasmo
{>arts
dics only.
   Dr. Cullen says scarcely any thing on hydrophobia,
further than that his chief reliance would be on mercury.
Macbride asserts that " Doctor Nugent was the first that
pointed out the true nature of hydrophobia — which before
his time was generally considered as an inflammatory dis
ease.   Dr. Nugent-s patient was largely blooded, and took
moreover large quantities of musk and cinnabar as well as
opium and toward the close of the cure opium was given
           ;
along with camphor, musk, and assafcetida. But the opium
is what we are chiefly to rely on."    Thus again withdrawing
the attention of the practitioner from the large abstractionof
blood, to which the cure       this case was most probably to
                                   in
be ascribed.
     It needless to multiply quotations to prove, that nearly
          is
the same opinion of the disease, and the remedies most ap
plicable to      it,
               have prevailed with little variation up to this
day, with the single exception perhaps of Dr. Rush, who
in consequence of his peculiar notions about inflammation,
but which do not seem to be countenanced           the appearby
ance of the blood drawn from hydrophobic patients, again
inculcated the necessity of blood-letting.
   Finding therefore so many authorities against bleeding

        Case   of Hydrophohia       cured in India by Bleeding.       425
necessary to produce a decided effect upon the disease,
I  confidently trust that its failure nearly up to the present
day, will not be considered as militating against the
expectation of success which I think we are now fairly
entitled to entertain from its future employment.
   It is at any rate highly encouraging to know, that, in the
only three cases in which it has been trusted to as the
principal or the sole remedy, it has succeeded to our ut
most wishes.
   The first case is that by Dr. Burton, in America, which
was suggested by Dr. Rush-s lectures, and was published
about seven years ago in different periodical works.         But
unfortunately, in consequence of the case not being very
accurately related, and its being combined with some fanci
ful theory, it does not appear to have been acknowledged
as a clear instance of hydrophobia ; and the benefit which
might otherwise have been derived from it was wholly lost
to the world.     Whether it was actually a case of hydro
phobia or not, is not now worth disputing, being in pos
session of Mr. Tymon's case, and of that which has given
rise to these already too greatly extended remarks.
   I cannot, however, conclude without saying a few words
on the practices which have been principally in use up to
this time.    Never having seen Dr. Nugent-s case, the only
instance of well authenticated recovery from hydrophobia
with which I was acquainted, previous to these three, is
one related by Dr. Shad well, in the Memoirs of the London
Medical Society, in which, on the authority of a Greek
manuscript, oil was used both externally and internally.
Relying on this example, I gave oil a very fair trial in se
veral of the first cases that fell under my care.        But al
though I often got the patient to swallow a considerable
quantity of      it,
                  and applied      frequently
                                     it             by
                                                  enema, as well
as to the skin             by
                        almost incessant frictions,    never ap
                                                             it
peared to do the least good.         therefore abandoned it.
                                      I
    I have subsequently used every mode of treatment that              I
have ever heard or seen suggested, with equally little suc
cess, except arsenic, which, though with no better hope,
was to have been my next trial, had not Mr. Tymon-s case
fortunately occurred, to point out the practice which has
already so well justified the confidence reposed in it.
    On those occasions, besides the full trial given to oil,            I
used opium to       jireat extent, in every possible way; mer
                       a
 cury, musk, camphor, blisters, galvanism, and enemata of
laudanum and infusion of tobacco, all to no purpose.         No
 thing ever alleviated     symptom except the two last, which
                                a
                                                         «        certainly

     certainly did lessen the spasms; and therefore, when bleed
    ing may hereafter be used too late to succeed, I would re
     commend them as remedies, capable, though not of pre
    venting death, yet of allowing the fatal event to take place
    with less suffering to the unhappy patient than any thing
    else with which I am acquainted.
        On the recommendation of Dr. Bardsley, of Manchester,
    a gentleman      who has with unwearied zeal endeavoured to
    investigate   the  nature of hydrophobia with a view to the
    discovery   of its  cure, I also gave a very fair trial to volatile
   alkali. Contrary to all expectation, I succeeded in getting
   into the stomach no less than three drams of carbonate of
   ammonia made into boluses with crumb of bread.                  But
   the event was unhappily just the same as in all former
   cases.
       Dr. Bardsley was led to this suggestion by the perusal of
   Mr. Williams's cases of recovery from the bite of cobra
   de copello by means of eau-de-luce, and he endeavours to re
  commend its adoption by^the following observation : " surely
   in the treatment of so fatal a disease as canine madness, it
   is proper to adopt any method of cure founded on rational
  principles. Analogy under these circumstances seems to
   be our surest guide."
       It is melancholy to relate, that though hydrophobia has
  T>een unusually frequent in England of late years, and many
  cases of it have been treated by the most eminent practi
  tioners in London, both in hospitals and private practice,
  yet not a single case of recovery is recorded.            Dr. Parr,
  author of the Medical Dictionary, published for the express
  purpose of exhibiting the state of medical science up to the
, present time, after telling that every thing has been tried,
  and that every thing has failed in effecting a cure, consoles
  his reader by acquainting him with the infallibility of
  cutting out the part as a preventive, adding emphatically, in
  Italics : "In short, full, effectual and complete excision
  of the wounded part is the only certain means of relief ; and
  this is certain." But still leaving us in the same hope
  less condition as to any means of cure after the disease has
  actually taken place.
       Dr. John Hunter concludes a most able paper on the
  history of the disease, and the trials made for its cure, with
  these words: "after the symptoms of hydrophobia have
  appeared, no medicine or remedy that has hitherto been
  used has relieved, much less cured, the disease." And finallv,

  nual Register for 1808, after presenting a sketch of the

practice that had been pursued in London during that year,
and noticing the failure of every expedient, sums up his
history with this opprobrious sentence : " On the whole,
therefore, we may be considered as remaining in the most
entire ignorance both of the nature of the disease, and of
the method of cure, or even of palliating a single symptom."
    Such was the disheartening language universally held on
the subject of hydrophobia.      I humbly trust that it can be
held no longer ; that the case above related, coming so soon
after that of Mr. Tymon, entitles us to indulge more ani
mating views for the future ; and that it will not be long
before additional experience shall serve to confirm the hope,
which seems now to rest on so promising a foundation,
that a remedy has at length been discovered for this hitherto
uncontrollable disease.
    It is mortifying to the pride of science to acknowledge
it, — but further trials of bleeding ad deliquium shall con

the disease,     it  nevertheless impossible to conceal that

this solum et unicum remedium has apparently been hitherto
overlooked in consequence of an overweening fondness for
system, which led medical writers to class hydrophobia
with diseases of the nervous kind, and to dwell particularly
on its resemblance to tetanus.      That disease being consi
dered as highly asthenic, blood-letting, perhaps without
sufficient reason, has been thought inadmissible.        Anti
spasmodics and tonics have been employed in all quantities
and forms    ;and though        by
                               such remedies scarcely one case
of tetanus in fifty has ever been cured, the same treatment

ceeded even in tetanus itself, we now transfer to tetanus,
and perhaps to other diseases of the same kind, the practice
which has been inconstestably proved, in two instances at
least, if not in three, to have been successfully employed
in hydrophobia ?
    Almost all authors have spoken of this analogy,                         and
some have gone so far as to affirm that tetanus may be
easily mistaken for hydrophobia.                 I confess myself to be           ,
of    a  different opinion ; being fully persuaded that no per
son who has often seen both diseases could ever mistake
the one for the other, and that for the following reasons :
first, in tetanus the lower jaw is immoveably fixed, and the
 patient speaks by the motion of his lips only, with a hissing
kind of noise; — whereas in hydrophobia the lower jaw is
 moveable to any degree ; and is in fact, in the exacerba
 tions, almost in perpetual motion, often resembling the
 action of hawking or retching, for the purpose of bringing
 forward and expelling the viscid saliva which constantly
 collects about the fauces ; — and in the second place, thit
 though the swallowing of fluids may be difficult or im
 possible in tetanus, and the attempt even accompanied with
 convulsions of the face, throat, and chest, yet the obstacle
 is confined to the actions connected with deglutition alone,
 and the name, the approach, and the touch of fluids, have
 never in my experience thrown the patient into the agony
 of horror, distress, and despair, which is invariably wit
 nessed in hydrophobia.

            I
  Sib, — take the liberty to solicit you to lay before the
  Society of Arts, &c. an instrument which I presume will
  facilitate several operations in surgery, and which I have
  named an annular saw.              It is particularly well adapted for
  the division of cylindrical bones, surrounded by muscles,
  blood-vessels or nerves, and with less injury to those parts
  than by any other instrument in present use.
      In operations upon the cranium it has the superiority
  over the trephine, and Mr. Hay-s saw, as it can be applied

  tures, and Commerce, for 1 8 12.      .The gold medal of the Society was
  Toted to Mr. Machell for this communication.

to ihc cranium in every form or posture, and remove any
depressed portion of bone with the greatest safety and speed.
Mr. Cline and Mr. Whatley have seen the instrument, and
expressed their opinion that it would be found a very use
ful instrument in many operations.
   My business as a surgeon, and pressing avocations in the
country, prevent me from staying more than a few days in
London.     I should therefore esteem it an additional favour
if the Society would soon take it into consideration, that
I may personally explain its use.
   The principle of this machine will be found useful for
many mechanical as well as surgical purposes.

             coloured Bodies.            By M. Gay-Lussac*.
The     various colours presented     the different bodies of

pass from one tint to another when they are exposed to                                                a
certain temperature.     There would be nothing remarkable
in these changes,          if
                      they were owing to     chemical altera-        a

tion      ;  but T shall only regard those here, which, being sub
ordinate to the intensity of heat, cease to take place imme
diately when the temperature resumes its primitive state.
I    shall divide this memoir into two parts: the first will
contain a detail of facts, and the second their relations with
other phaenomena.
                                  First Part.
      I   ought to premise, that in the following experiments                I
have not taken an exact account of the temperature to which
the coloured bodies have been exposed.                   I generally con
tented myself with heating pieces of porcelain upon burning
coals, and afterwards throwing coloured bodies upon them:
sometimes however I exposed them upon an earthen plate
at the heat of the sand-bath, but never lower than 100°, or
higher than 400°.               Lest I should inaccurately define the
various changes of colour produced by heat, I requested
M. Merim6e, who is well versed in the colour business, to
be present at my experiments, and to write down the re
sults with his own hand.                  I cannot do better, therefore,
than faithfully republish the notes which he took upon that
occasion.
                  Experiment 1. — Chinese Vermilion.
     Its colour is not a pure red : it contains yellow. On ex
posing it to the heat of the sand-bath it became deeper, and
assumed the carmine shade.
Experiment 2. — Oxide of Mercury " ohlained by the Calcina
                     tion of the Nitrate of Mercury.
     Its colour is orange. At the temperature of 100° it as
sumed a deepish red, and approached the colour of com
mon cinnabar : at a stronger heat it became of a fine cin
nabar red, and at a still stronger heat about 300° it passed
to the wolet colour, first assuming a blue colour.                        Ths
colour of this oxide being orange renders it capable of
passing to a brilliant red, but not to a fine violet*.
                         Experiment 3. — Red Lead.
     It    presents nearly     the same     phaenomena with the oxide
of mercury ; but, as its orange colour is finer, heat makes
it assume a more brilliant red. The violet colour which is
developed in it afterwards is not finer than that of the oxide
of mercury.
    • When we pound this ciide of mercury, it takes an olive yellow shade
deeper ihao its      in jt-ve colour, and which is developed   the better, the
itir.ie ihc- mide is pounded.       This new colour gets deeper when heated,
        -        of » cinnamon colour.
                                                                    Expert

        Experiment 4. — Nitrate of Cobalt slightly dried.
                                                                      *
    This sal,t, which when cold is of a wine red, becomes
 blue the instant its temperature is a little raised: when
 cooled it resumes its primitive colour, and thus passes suc
cessively from one tint to another, when we vary its tem
 perature, independently of the influence of humidity.
     Experiment 5. — Red Sulphur et of Arsenic, or Realgar.
     When in the mass it is red : but when it is pounded it
 has an orange colour mixed with a chesnut red.                On ex
 posing   it to  heat, it takes  the colour  of colcothar.
                Experiment 6. — Glass     of Antimony.
     It  presents when pounded an orange yellow colour
clouded with a good deal of gray.           At a heat of about 400"
it assumes a brownish red, as if it had been mixed with the
red oxide of iron.
 Experiment       7- — Oxide of Bismuth prepared by decomposing
                   the Nitrate of Bismuth by Heat.
    Tts  colour is a dirty white mixed with a little orange yel
low. On gradually raising its temperature, it becomes of
a very fine yellow, and passes progressively to the chesnut
red : upon cooling it resumes its primitive colour.               We
ought to remark, that it does not pass by the pure orange :
thus the red tint which it acquires is not a pure red, but
that ot the rust of iron.
Experiment 8. — Oxide         of Tin prepared     with Nitric Acid,
                             and calcined.
    Its colour is similar to flowers of sulphur sullied by a
little gray.     When heated it assumes a yellower shade with
a little red.                                                .
                    Experiment g. — Oxide of Zinc.
              -
    Upon calcining nitrate of zinc exempt from iron, an
oxide was obtained which when cold is of a straw colour :
a heat of about 300° gives it a colour like that of Naples
yellow. At a higher temperature the shade is yellower, and
compared with that of the chromate of lead is greener, and
more intense.
              Experiment     10. — Flowers  of Sulphur.
   The first stage of heat produced a more lively yellow, in
which we remarked the gray tint which accompanies this
colour. When they began to fuse, the shade became olive
yellow, and the colour increasing it became red.
Experiment      1 1. — Yellow   Sulphuret  of Arsenic, or Orpimenl.
   We may regard this colour         as the   purest which mineral

substances can furnish.     When exposed to heat it is at
first orange, and afterwards takes the red colour of the oxide
of iron.
            Experiment 1 £5.— Turbith Mineral.
  Its colour is of a very fine yellow resembling the ranun
culus; when heated it becomes of a brick-red colour.
            Experiment 1 3. — Chromate of Lead.
   When cold, it is of a very fine yellow mixed with a lit
                                               it,

                                               it
dots not become so brilliant as might be expected.

                              a

         it        chesnut colour.
                         a            Red therefore has been
added to its primitive colour.
                   Experiment       15. — Green          Oxide     of Chrome.
     When projected                upon    a    piece of earthen ware almost
red hot,       it       of an olive colour,
                     becomes                                       as   if   we had        mixed

    Its colour is a deep gray containing a little brownish red.
 On exposing it to heat, it becomes blacker, which proves
 that it has taken from the blue which has neutralized the
 red and the yellow.
                Experiment 2 1 . — Deutoxide of Iron.
    It is of a gray colour, retaining very little of the brownish
red. Heat produces blue, and its colour becomes of a purer
gray, which by opposition makes the former appear redder.

§ V. Heat developed in            the Combustion      of Spirit of Wine
                               and Alcohol.
As      the constituent parts of these inflammable liquids may
be regarded as well determined, by the results of M. de
Saussure-s excellent work, I undertook a second time to
examine them, with a view to what were the quantities of the
heat which are developed during their combustion.                     I had"
begun     this  business   five  years ago;      but   after having made
a considerable number of experiments,                 I abandoned it ori
account of the great difficulties which I met with ; but the
instant I found means to make my apparatus more perfect
I  recommenced.
    Before giving the details of my experiments,                I ought to
say   a  few   words  upon      the  difficulties   which    attended the
enterprise, even since I possessed my new apparatus, and
upon the means I used to surmount them.                       There were
even dangers to which I was exposed, which it is necessary
                                                                   I should

     in Comlustion, and in the Condensation     of Vapours. 435
I   should detail, in order to caution those who undertake
the inquirv.
     When i made experiments with highly rectified alcohol,
and particularly with ether, I found it very difficult to pre
vent a remarkable part of these volatile liquids from escap
ing in vapour from the mass of the liquid which remained
in the lamp.      I constructed a small lamp in the form of a
round tobacco box, with a beak rising from the centre of the
circular plate which forms the top : and upon this I fixed a
small reservoir to contain cold water, intended to cool the
beak, and prevent the heat from descending to the body of
the lamp: but this precaution was ncJt sufficient when         I
burnt ether, as I learned to my cost. Although the re
servoir was twice as large in diameter as the lamp, and it
was filled with cold water, this water was so heated in a
few minutes that there was an explosion of ether in the
state of vapour which took fire in the open air, and burned
with a flame which touched the cieling, threatening to set
 fire to the house.
     Rendered cautious, by this accident, I constructed a new
 lamp, much smaller than the former: it was only an inch
 in diameter and three-fourths of an inch in depth, and its
 beak, which was only two lines in diameter, was three-
 fourths of an inch high. In order to keep ibis small lamp
 cool while it was burning, it was placed in a small tub, and
 kept constantly submerged three lines below the upper ex
 tremity of its beak in a mixture of water and pounded ice.
 These precautions were sufficient to prevent explosions,
 but did not prevent the evaporation of the ether or of
  the alcohol,    f was convinced of this fact by observing,
  that alwavs, when I made two consecutive experiments
  without filling the lamp afresh, the alcohol constantly ap
  peared weaker in the second experiment than in the first.
      It was not difficult to account for this phaenomenon :"the
  most volatile, and consequently the most combustible parts
  of this liquid being dispersed in vapours in the interior of
   the lamp, found means to escape at the beak, with part of
  the liquid which had passed through the wick, leaving the
  alcohol which remained in the lamp sensibly weakened.
      In order to remedy this imperfection, I constructed a
   third lamp, which I have presented to the Class. It is
  made of copper, and has the form of a small cylindrical
                                                                 -
  vase an inch and a half in diameter, and three fourths
  of an inch in height, swelled a little at top and hermetically
  closed by a stopper of copper, which being ground with
  emery is wedged into the neck of the vessel.

     This stopper    is    perforated    at    its axis by   a   small vertical
hole, which is wholly closed or partly opened, when re
quisite, bv means of a small vice with a copper nut.
    A small pipe about a line and a half in diameter, and two
inches six lines in length, issues horizontally from the
sides of this vase, and very near its bottom. At the
distance of an inch and four lines from the vase this pipe
forms an elbow, anil afterwards ascending vertically forms
the beak of the lamp.
   This small pipe is very thin throughout, except at its
tipper extremity, where 1t is thicker, in order to give it a
form convenient for receiving a very small cylindrical ex
tinguisher five lines high by three and a half in diameter,
intended to close the beak hermetically, without touching
"or deranging  the wick at the instant the lamp ceases burn
ing, and to keep it constantly shut when the lamp is not
burning.
     Without this precaution, in experiments made with
ether, so great a quantity of this volatile liquid would
escape in vapour, by the beak of the lamp, during the time
taken up in weighing               it,
                           that there would be no way of de
termining the quantity burnt.
    To support the beak of the lamp,            stayed bv two

 which I had to surmount before discovering the means of
 governing the combustion of inflammable liquids which,
 are very volatile.
    As the apparatus which I used in ray experiments is now
 well known, it will be easy to follow their details and ap
preciate their results.       I shall endeavour to describe them
with precison, but at the same time- as rapidly as possible.
    Alter faying in a stock of common spirits of wine and
alcohol of different degrees of purity, I determined with
the greatest care their specific gravity at the temperature of
 60° (Fahrenheit), taking that of the water at the same tem
perature = 10000(!0.         I made choice of this temperature,
in order to determine afterwards with more facility the
.quantities of water which each of these liquids might to
contain, according to the tables which were formed from
the results of the experiments of M. Lowitz.
    By the following table we shall see . the specific gravity
of each of these liquids, and the quantity of pure alco
hol of Lowitz, and of water, which it contains.

    Such are the results of the experiments which were made
to determine the quantifies of heat which these liquids fur
nish in their combustion.
    In three experiments made with spirits of wine, the
quantities of heat manifested were :
    In the first. . . . 53-260 pounds of water at the freezing
point, carried to ebullition.

    As one pound of this liquid contains only 0-7788 pound
of alcohol regarded as pure by Lowitz, the other parts
 = 0-2212 pound, being water only which does not burn:
in order to    see how much water at the freezing point could
be    boiled by one pound of pure alcohol of Lowitz, we
have only to divide the quantity which is the measure fcf
the mean heat developed in the experiments with spirits of
wine, by the fraction which expresses the quantity of the

     In two experiments made with common alcohol, I had

developed in the combustion of one pound of this liquid.
    According to this result, one pound of pure alcohol of
Lowitz ought to furnish a sufficiency of heat in its com-
 busVton to raise the temperature of"67-57 pounds of water
to 180° of Fahrenheit, for it is ££ff}-=67-l01.
    On taking the mean between the results of the eight ex

quids, we shall have for the measure of the heat developed
in the combustion of one pound of pure alcohol of Lowitz,
67-317 pounds of water at the temperature of freezing
carried to ebullition.
    It will be very interesting without doubt to know if this        •
quantity of heat agrees with the quantities of combustible
matters (carbon and hydrogen) which exist in this alcohol :
this is precisely what we shall see.
    According to the analysis of M. de Saussure, one pound
of alcohol of Lowitz contains

§ VI. Heat        developed in the Combustion of sulphuric Ether.
   I have already mentioned the difficulties which I over
came before being able to regulate the combustion of this
substance in such a way as to render the results of my ex
periments regular and satisfactory; but I met with still
further difficulties in the course of this delicate inquiry.
   As alcohol is necessarily employed in making sulphuric
ether, and as these two liquids may be united in any pro
portions, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to se
parate them entirely ; and as both are colourless and limpid,
either when mixed or separate, we can scarcely judge of
the degree of purity of the ether, except by its specific gra
vity, and even in this way but very imperfectly.
   The most highly rectified sulphuric ether which                 I could
procure, and which I employed in my experiments, wa3
prepared in M. Vauquelin-s laboratory.               Its specific gravity
is 72834 at the temperature of 16° Reaumur.                       As that
which was employed by M. de Saussure in his analysis was
only of the specific gravity of 717,at the same tempera
ture ; by regarding the ether which I employed as being a
mixture of the same degree of purity with that of M. de
Saussure, and the pure alcohol of Lowitz having a specific
gravity of 792, we shall find upon making a calculation,
 that the ether which I employed was a mixture of 85 parts
of ether of the specific gravity of 717, and 15 parts of pure
alcohol of Lowitz of the specific gravity of 792.
    On burning this mixture under my calorimeter, after
having brought my apparatus to the highest degree of per
fection, I obtained the following results :

               Researches vpon the Heat developed    -
    Continuing to make use of the estimates of Crawford,
for the quantities of heat developed in the combustion of
hydrogen and carbon, we shall see if these estimates are
sufficient to account for the heat manifested in these five
experiments.
    As the ether employed was a mixture of 15 parts of pure
alcohol of Lowitz, and 85 parts of ether of the specific
gravity of 717 at the temperature of 16' Reaumur, and
consequently similar to the. ether analysed by M. de Saus-
sure, we shall begin by determining the quantity of heat
which ought to to be developed in the combustion of these
fifteen parts of alcohol.
    As M. de Saussure has shown that in one pound of
Lowitz-s alcohol (of the specific gravity of 792) there are
0-4282 pound of carbon and 0-1018 pound of free hydro
gen, v.e ought to find in 0"15 pound ot this same liquid,
0 06423 pound of carbon, and 0-01527 of free hydrogen.
    According to the estimate of Crawford, 0 064 23 pound of
carbon ought to furnish a sufficiency of heat in its combus
tion to raise the temperature of 3-7002 pounds of water to
ISO0 Fah.; and 0 01527 pound of hydrogen ought to fur
nish enough     to raise to the same temperature 6-2607 pounds
of water    ; and these two quantities of water making toge
ther o-qGoo pounds, is the measure of the quantity of heat
which must be developed in the combustion of the 15 parts
of alcohol which are found mixed with 85 parts of ether,
in order to form the combustible liquid employed under the
name    of sulphuric ether in my experipienls.
    Now, as one pound of this mixed liquid has furnished
in its combustion enough of heat to raise to 180° of Fah
renheit tO-304 pounds of water ; if we deduct from this
mass the quantity of water which the 15 per cent, of alco
hol must heat ( = 9-909), that which remains ( = 70-3431
pounds of water) will be the measure of the quantity of
heat developed in the combustion of 85 per cent, of ether
of the gravity o;-7l7, which exists in this combustible li
quid.
    According     to the analysis of sulphuric ether made by
M. de Saussure, we ought to find in one pound ot this
liquid (of the specific gravity of 7 17)
    Carbon                                             0-590 lb.

    Consequently, we ought to find in 0-85 pound           of the
                                                             same

same kind of ether,    the following quantities  of combusti
ble substances ; viz.
   Carbon                                          0-50 15 lb.
   Free and combustible hydrogen                    01 651
   We shall now see if these quantities of combustible sub
stances are sufficient to account for the heat which is mani
fested in our experiments.
   The 0-5015 pound of carbon ought to furnish sufficient
heat to raise 28-89 pounds of water to 180° of Fahrenheit ;
and the O-lo-Sl pound of hydrogen sufficient to heat 67-64
pounds to the same degree.
   These two masses of water form together 96-53 pounds;
but we shall see that the quantity of heat furnished by the
85 parts of ether in the experiments cannot be greater than
that which is necessary to heat 70-3431 pounds of water to
 160° Fahrenheit.
   As the experiments have been made with the greatest
care, and frequently repeated, and always with very uniform
results; and as the estimates which we have adopted,
with respect to the quantities of heat which are developed
in the combustion of hydrogen and in that of carbon,
have been confirmed so as to leave little doubt upon this
subject : upon investigating the cause of the great difference
between the. quantity of heat actually developed in the
combustion of the 85 parts of sulphuric ether burnt in the
experiments which we have examined, and the quantity
given by calculation, we are compelled, in my opinion, to
admit that there is an error in the analysis of this liquid,
and that it does not contain so much free and inflammable
combustible matter as M. de Saussure ascribes to it.
   As it seems to me to be much more probable that an
error has been committed in determining the quantity of
free hydrogen in this substance than in determining the
quantity of carbon, I shall suppose with M. de Saussure
that there is really in one pound of sulphuric ether (of the
specific gravity of 717) 0-50 of carbon; but instead of
estimating the quantity of free hydrogen ;n this liquid ac
cording to the results of M. de Saussure, I shall adopt the
estimate of Mr. Cruickshanks.
   This excellent chemist concluded from his experiments,
that in the vapour of sulphuric ether the carbon is to the
hydrogen as 5 to 1.
   In the 0-85 pound of sulphuric ether (specific gravity
 717) which were mixed with the 0-15 pound of alcohol, in
order to form one pound of the mixed liquid employed in
my experiments, there were 0"5015 pound of carbon; and
                                                      dividing,

4-18              Researches upon the Heat developed
dividing this number by 5, we shall see that this carbon
ought to be united with 0-1003 pound of free hydrogen*
instead of being united with OM65I pound, as we shall
suppose according to        M.    de Saussure.
  Let us now see            if,     by   adoping   the analysis   of Mr.
Cruickshanks with respect to the hydrogen instead of that
of M. de Saussure, the calculation will agree better with
the experiment.
   We have seen that the quantity of water .heated to 180°
Fahrenheit, which represents the quantity of heat which
must be developed in the combustion of the 0-15 pound
of alcohol, was                          .-     9-9609 lbs.
   And that the quantity answering to 0-5015
pound of carbon, which exists       the 0-95 of
                                              in
ether, was                                      28-89
   We shall for the present add that which
answers to the combustion of 01003 pound
of free combustible hydrogen, which, according

   These three quantities of water together arc
the measure of the heat which must be deve

   This coincidence between the calculation and the ex
periment     doubtless too remarkable to be owing to chance,
              is
but     am ready to prove that
        I                            occurred without being
                                              it
foreseen or expected.
   From all these results we may conclude, that one pound
of sulphuric ether of the specific gravity 717 at the tem
perature of 16° Reaumur, or of the same species with that
employed       M. de Saussure, this liquid should have fur
                   by
nished      combustion enough of heat to raise to 80° F.
             in                                                   1

    If the    proportion of free hydrogen in the ether analysed
it byM. de Saussure was really such as he has determined
   to be, one pound of this liquid ought to furnish- suffi        a
ciency of heat in its combustion to raise to 180° of Fah
renheit 113-566 pounds of water, viz.
                                                                       That

   But F can the less persuade mvself that this liquid can
furnish in its combustion so much heat, because one pound
of white wax furnished no more than what was sufficient
to heat 94-682 pounds of water to the same degree.

     The elements      of water exist most assuredly both in al
 cohol and ether    ;  but there is good reason to believe that
 water does not exist in its natural state of condensation in
 these two substances, neither when they are in a state of
 liquidity, nor when, being sufficiently heated, they -are trans
 formed into elastic fluids.
     When we mix water with alcohol, there is a considerable
 change both in temperature and volume, which indicates a
new arrangement of elements, or a chemical action ; and
what proves in a still more certain manner that this action
has taken place, the liquid which results from this mixture
may be distilled, i. e. vaporized by heat, and afterwards
condensed, without being decomposed : but it is above all
in the little heat which is developed in the condensation of
the vapour of alcohol and ether that we discover certain
proof-s that the oxygen and hydrogen which exist as ele
ments in these liquids do not exist in the state of water.              I
shall recur to this subject again.

w       hen in 1784 the bodies were dug up which had beta
buried in the Cemetery des Innocens at Paris, those only
were disturbed which lay three or four feet below the sur
face, but ihsre were pits of more ancient formation lower
down, the bodies in which were not yet consumed.                             Aa
 opening     was    made    to  the  very  bottom     of one  of   these  lower
pits, in which the solid mason-work which supports the
lower basin of the fountain of the Innocents was built.
From this pit a most fetid smell was exhaled, which would
haw infected ihe whole neighbourhood if the apparatus of
M. Guvton had not been resorted to. This apparatus wa*
 composed of four earthen pots, in which were mixed in the
 requisite proportions, sulphuric acid, oxide of manganese,
 and muriate of soda.                The mixture was renewed every
 morning when the workmen began their labours, and every
 night when they left off, by which means the pots were left
 all night in the pit. Not onlv were the inhabitants thereby-
 preserved from all annovance, but none of the workmen, of
 whom there were one hundred, experienced the slightest
 accident, although the work was executed in the months
 of June, July, and August I 8O9.

     f The serious accidents produced by cadaverous emanations when burial-
 places are incautiously opened, are too well known. Dr. Haguenot ha*
 published some shocking instances, and no place has been more remarkable
 in this respect than the churchyard of the Innocents.           It appears that
 during the latter years of its existence as a burial-place, no less than 3000
 bodies were annually deposited there.       Ever since 1724, the inhabitants of
  the adjoining homes had called the attention of Government          to the dan
 gerous effects of this gie.it focus of putrid infection; and in 1765 they suc
  ceeded in obtaining a decree of the Parliament of Paris, ordaining its sup
  pression, and the removal of all places of sepulture beyond the barriers.
  Notwithstanding all this, in 1781, the reports made by order of the
  Police, and presented to the Academy of Sciences and to the Soaeti de Mide-
  cine, proved that the insalubrity of the atmosphere had so increased as to
  occasion repeatedly in the vicinity diseases of a putrid character, and that
  animal food recently prepared speedilv underwent a fetid alteration, and
  that the walls of the cellars were so impregnated as to cause pimples in the
  hands of those who touched them, accompanied by excoriations, Sec These
  effects were attempted to be removed by throwing quick-lime to the ddf>:h
  of six inches into the nits, but in a few days the deleterious- gas burst forth
  again. — Note of the Editors of the Ann. de Chimie,

    The        various  phaenomena of heat are most easily con
 ceived by refeiring them to the operation of a peculiar fluid
 possessing extreme activity/and diffused through all bodies."
 It constantlv endeavours to maintain its equilibrium or
 equal diffusion among bodies, and its accumulation in any
 substance is generally marked by a corresponding expan
  sion.      The extent of this expansion in different bodies
 varies as they transmit heat more or less rapidly, or have
 divers conducting powers.            Air is found, in like circum
  stances, to expand five times more than alcohol, 20 times
  more than mercury, 160 times more than platina, and
 even 580 times more than glass.                 The thermometer is an
  instrument contrived to measure its own expansions ; but
  it can mark only the heat of its own bulb, as affected by
  external communication, and any further inferences drawn
  from its different indications are merelv the result of some
  process of reasoningf.
      " Heat combines "with different substances in proportions
  widely varied, and depending in each on its peculiar and
  intimate structure.        In general, it is more copious in liquids
  than in solids, and in the aeriform fluids than in liquids.
  But still the allotment among the different bodies, appears
  to be as various as their distinctive properties.              Under si
  milar circumstances, hydrogen gas will hold or absorb ten
  times as much heatj as an equal mass of atmospheric air ;
  water twice as much as olive oil, and three times as much

as concentrated    sulphuric acid ; sulphuwc acid, again, twice
as  much   as  glass; and glass itself, twice as much as silver,
and five times as much as mercury.          If a pound of water
heated 30 degrees be poured into another pound of water
at the temperature     of the .apartment, the surplus heat will
become equally shared between the two masses, the infused,
portion losing 15° of its heat, and the recipient gaining
15°.     But if a pound of mercury heated 30 degrees above
the standard be poured into a pound of water; while both
of these now acquire the same temperature, the xnercury
will lose 29 degrees, and the water gain only one degree.
Hence, in the state of quiescence, mercury contains 29
times! less heat than water, and has its temperature 29 times
more affected by equal accessions of that elementary fluid.
But even the same substance, if its form be mutable, will
exhibit similar differences, according to the aspect which it
assumes.      Thus, ice is more easily heated than water, and
water than steam.        The same addition of heat which would
raise the temperature of ice 10 degrees, would only raise
that of water 9 degrees, and that of steam 6 degrees.          At
each stage of transition, there is hence an apparent pause,
attended with a corresponding absorption         or evolution of
heat.
    "Thus, if a vessel filled with ice be suspended over a steady
fire, the ice will continue at the freezing point, till, per
haps in an interval of half an hour, it be entirely melted ;
it will then grow regularly warmer, till, after 40 minutes,
the water begins to boil : nor will the temperature of the
liquid now receive any further increase, the subsequent ac
cessions of heat being wholly expended in the formation
of the expelled steam, and which would require the space
of three hours and a half. In the act of thawing, there
fore, and again in the process of ebullition, there is a suc
cessive absorption of heat, amounting respectively to a dif
ference of temperature in the water of about 75 and 525
of the centigrade degrees, or 135 and 945 on Fahrenheit-s
 scale.   But the heat thus absorbed is nowise distinguished
 from the rest, or fitted to perform any different function ;
it blends its action and its expansive energies with the ge
 neral fluid, and merely serves to restore the equilibrium that
 had been disturbed by the enlarged capacity, or rather the
 Increased attraction, of the mass with which it com
 bines."
    " The gaseous substances are so loosely constituted, that
 a difference in their composition is sufficient to alter ma

    terially their intimate properties.  Thus, common air, on
    being condensed 30 times, has its capacity for heat reduced
    to one half; and, if suddenly compressed to 20 times its
    ordinary density, it will disengage so much heat as to show
    an elevation of tempeiature equal to 90O degrees by Fahren
    heit-s scale, and sufficient for the inflammation of most
.   bodies.     On this property is founded a pretty contrivance
    lately made, the stroke of a small condensing syringe being
    employed to set on fire a bit of tinder.  An opposite effect,
    when air is suddenly rarefied, takes place ; a certain quan
    tity of heat being now absorbed, or an apparent cold pro
    duced.
         "The increased capacity of rarefied air is the true cause
    of the cold which prevails in the higher regions of the at
    mosphere.       From the unequal action of the sun's rays and
    the vicissitudes of day and night, a perpetual and quick-
    circulation is maintained between the lower and the upper
    strata ; and it is obvious, that, for each portion of air which
    rises from the surface, an equal and corresponding portion
    must also descend.        But that which mounts up, acquiring
    an enlargement of capacity, has its temperature propor
    tionally diminished ; while the correlative mass falling
    down carries likewise its heat along with               it,and, con
    tracting  its capacity,   seems     to diffuse   warmth   below.   A
    straium at any given height in the atmosphere                  hence
                                                                  is
    alike affected     bythe passage of air from below, and            by
                                                                      the
    return of air from above, the former absorbing heat, and the
    latter evolving it.     But the mean temperature at any height
    in the atmosphere       is  still on the whole permanent, and
    consequently     those   disturbing causes must be exactly ba
    lanced, or the absolute measure of heat           is really the same
    at all elevations, suffering merely some external modifica
    tion from the difference of capacity in the fluid with which
    it has combined.       That temperature      is   hence inversely as
    the capacitv of air possessing the rarity due to the given
    altitude. Having therefore ascertained,            by  some delicate
    experiments, the law which connects the capacity with the
    rarity of air, it  w as not verv difficult to trace the gradations
    of cold in the higher atmosphere, and even to mark the
    precise limit where the rei»n of perpetual congelation must
    commence.        Thus,  I    find that, under the equator, the
    boundary     of  the  frozen     region begins at the altitude of
J     5207 feet,  in  the parallel of 45° at 7671 feet, in the Iati*

   The mode by which heat is conducted through sub
stances differently constituted is various: in solid bodies it
is by successive impressions : in fluids the mobility of the
particles affects the modeof operation: the proximate portion
of the medium, dilating as it becomes warm, is gently forced
to recede; and being likewise rendered specifically lighter it
rises to the surface, diffused in horizontal strata, the hottest
particles occupying the highest part : hence heat descends
in fluids very tardily and with extreme difficulty ; a circum
stance which accounts for the great coldness of water at
the bottom       of   deep lakes.
     "The   increasing coldness of the water drawn up from
considerable depths in the ocean has lately been proposed
as a sure mark of the approach of soundings, if not of the
land itself.
   " Since water, on beinsx heated, expands in a rapid pro
gression, the portion of heat which it abstracts from a body
immersed in       it, by means of the recession and incessant
change    of  its contiguous affected particles, must be greatly
augmented in the higher temperatures.                Near the freezing
point, this influence becomes extremely small, and water
is there scarcely       better conductor than iee
                        a                                ;but, as     ap   it
proaches to ebullition,         acquires
                                 it         such  an  increase   of  mo
bility, as to conduct heat five times faster than in its torpid
state.    In other liquids, the increase of temperature will
occasion     a  similar alteration of the conducting powers,
though not so marked, as their expansions deviate less from
an uniform progression.
   " But, through air and other gaseous fluids, the con
veyance of heat         still move complex; and
                        is                               aclose investi

perties of matter, has led to some very unexpected and
interesting results.         A new principle appears to combine
its influence, arid the rate of dispersion, in aeriform media,

    The rest of the heat, consisting of 1 part from the naked
    metallic surface, and of 10 parts from the cased surface, is
    propagated through the same medium, but with a certain
    diffusive rapidity, which in a moment shoots its influence
    to a distance, after a mode entirely peculiar to the gaseous
    fluids. The very superior propellent energy of a surface
    of glass or paper in comparison of that of a metallic one,
    lies within the compass even of ordinary observation.               If
    a glass caraffe or a pot of porcelain be filled with boiling
    water, on bringing towards it the palm of the hand, an
    agreeable warmth will be felt at the distance of an inch or
    two from the heated surface; hut if a silver pot be heated
    in the same way, scarcely any heat is at all perceptible on
    approaching the surface, till the fingers have almost touched
    the metal itself.
         "It is curious to inquire how such a singular diversity
    can arise.   If  the silver ball be covered with the thinnest
    film of gold-beater's      skin, and which exceeds not the
    3000th part of an inch in thickness, the power of disper
    sion will be augmented from 1 to 7 ;        if" another pellicle be
    added, there will be   a  further increase of this power, from
    7  to 9; and so repeatedly growing, till after the application
    of five coats, when the propellent energy will reach its ex
    treme limit, or the measure of 10.          In this case, the me
    tallic surface is  precluded  from  all contact   with the air, and
    it must, therefore,   act  in consequence    of  its mere approxi
    mation to the external boundary.          We may thence infer,
    that air never comes into actual contact with any surface,
    but approaches much nearer to glass or paper than to po
    lished metal, from which        it separated
                                         is           by
                                                       an interval of at
    least the 500th part of an inch.        A vitreous surface, from
    its closer proximity to the recipient medium, must hence
    impart its heat more copiously and energetically, than              a
     surface of metal in the same condition     ;    and the metal, to
    a  certain extent, can act in reducing the power of the other.
     When pellicle was applied, the metallic surface imme
             a
     diately under it repelled partially the atmospheric boundary,
     and reduced the darting efflux of heat from 10, which
     would have been thrown         by
                                     the skin alone, to about      7> or
.    only    6 moie than the efficacy of the naked metal.           The
     repelling influence of the metallic plate was sensible even
     under four coats, or at the distance of the 750th part of an
     inch from the external surface.
        " By what process the several portions of heat, thus de
    livered to the atmosphere, shoot through the fluid mass,            it
     seems more difficult to conceive.      They are not transported
                                                                        by

by the streaming of the heated air,     for they suffer no de
rangement from the most violent agitation of their medium.
The air must therefore, without changing its place, disse
minate the impressions that it receives of heat, by a sort
of undulatory commotion, or a series of alternating pulsa
tions, like those by which it transmits the impulse of
sound.     The portion of air next the hot surface, suddenly
acquiring heat from its vicinity, expands proportionally,
and begins the chain of pulsations.       In again contracting,
this. aerial shell surrenders its surplus heat to the one im
mediately before          it,
                     and which     now     the act of expansion
                                               is     in                       ;
and thus the tide of heat rolls onwards, and spreads itself
on all sides.    These vibratory impressions are not strictly
darted in ladiating lines, but each successive pulse, as in the
case too of sound, presses to gain an equal diffusion.      Dif-;
ferent obstructions may, therefore, cause the undulations
of heat to deflect considerably from their course. Thus,                    if
successive rings of pasteboard be fashioned into the twisted
form of      cornucopia, and its wide mouth presented at
                a
some distance to the fire,     strong heat will, in spite of the
                                        a
gradual inflection of the tube, be accumulated at its narrow
end     ;  the same manner probably, as waves, flowing from
            in
an open bay into       narrow harbour, now contracted and
                           a
bent aside, yet without being reflected, rise into furious
billows.
    " But the same pulsatory system will enable the atmosphere
to transmit likewise the impressions of cold.        The shell of
air adjacent to    frigid surface, becoming suddenly chilled,
                      a
suffers    corresponding contraction, and which must excite
            a
   concatenated train of pulsations.        This contraction
                                                                             a is

portion   of heat  from  the  next  succeeding shell, itself now
in the act of contracting; and the tide of apparent cold, or
rather of deficient heat, shoots forwards with diffusive
sweep.     The energy of transmission        subject, in this case
                                                         is

fected surface.    Thus,     goblet filled with pieces of broken
                                  a

snow and salt, will, at               a a a
                               moderate distance, yet excite                   a

of superficial absorption and that of reflection                  are therefore
exactly contrasted, and the one always supplies the defi

tions of heat are mostly driven back, or turned aside from
their attack.     A sheet of paper, opposed to the aerial tide,
will absorb the whole impression, pane of glass will re

   "The very different powers of -a vitreous and of metallic        a

are well contrasted        an experiment of the simplest and
                                by
easiest kind.     Let small pane of glass about four inches

square have one of its sides half covered with smooth tin
foil ; or, what       more elegant, let

                                                      a
mica have one side plated half over with silver leaf. On
holding the partly covered surface of the glass or mica op
posite and very near the fire for the space of few seconds,   a
and then passing the finger lightly over the posterior sur
face, scarcely any warmth        perceptible under the metallic

sheath, but an intense degree of heat will be felt behind the
naked portion of the plate.       Again, reversing its position
and exposing the uncovered side to the fire, an opposite
though less marked effect         observed
                                        is     the coat of metal

is allowed   to accumulate  in that part of the screen.   In this
latter case, the difference of temperature produced in very
nearly the double, and in the former it is no less than ten
fold. But effects of the same kind, and which are alike
contrasted, though inferior in degree, will be perceived, if
a thin pellicle be spread over the compound surface of the
glass and tinfoil, or of the mica and silver leaf, the mere
proximity of the metallic surface repelling the atmosphere,
and consequently enfeebling the powers of absorption and
emission.
   "  The very singular and unexpected facts now detailed
merit attention, and suggest a variety of improvements in
the practical management of heat.        A vessel with a bright
metallic surface is the best fitted to preserve liquors either
long warm, or as a conservatory to keep them cool. A
silver pot will emit scarcely half as much heat as one of
porcelain ; and even the very slightest varnishing of gold,
platina or silver, which communicates to the ware a certain
metallic gloss, renders this new kind of manufacture about
one-third part more retentive of heat. The addition of a
covering of flannel, though indeed a slow conductor, far
from checking the dissipation of neat, has directly the con
trary tendency ; for it presents to the atmosphere a surface
of much greater propulsive energy, which it would require
a thickness of not fewer than three folds of this loose sub
stance fully to counterbalance.     The cylinder of the steam-
engine has lately been most advantageously sheathed with,
polished copper.
    " The progress of cooling is yet more retarded, by sur
rounding the heated vessel on all sides, at the distance of
near an inch, with a case of planished tin ; and the addi
tion of other cases, following at like intervals, augments
continually the effect. With an obstruction of one case,
the rate of refrigeration is three times slower, with two
cases it is five times slower, with three cases it is seven times
slower, and so forth, as expressed by the succession of the
odd numbers. By multiplying the metallic cases, there
fore, and disposing them like a nest at regular intervals, the
innermost could be made to retain the same temperature
with little variation for many hours or even days. Such an
apparatus would obviously be well calculated for various
 culinary and domestic purposes.
    " In the conveyance of heat by means of steam, the sur
face of the conducting tubes should have a metallic lustre;

paint, to facilitate their discharge      of heat.       For the same
reason, metallic pots are more easily heated on the fire,
after their bottoms have become tarnished or smoked.                  If
a bright surface of metal be slightly furrowed or divided by
fine flutings, it will emit heat sensibly faster, because the
prominent ridges, thus brought closer to the general at
mospheric boundary, will excite the pulsations with aug
mented energy.

screen.      A smooth sheet of pasteboard, gilt over both sides,

gant     screen   might   be  composed of two parallel sheets of
China paper, placed about an inch asunder, and having
their inner surfaces gilt, and their outsides sprinkled with
flowers of gold and silver.
    '' Since, in a still atmosphere, the momentary flow of
heat from any vessel, whatever this may contain, depends
merely on the condition of its surface, the whole accumu
lated discharge, during similar descents of temperature, is
evidently proportional to the time elapsed.           Hence a very
simple and accurate method is suggested, for ascertaining
the capacity of different liquids or their specific attraction
to heat.      Into a glass ball, two or more inches in diameter
and blown extremely thin, with a narrow short neck, and
having a delicate thermometer inserted through            it,
                                                          the liquid
to be examined, which had been previously warmed                afew
degrees,    is carefully introduced  by   means of funnel.
                                                     a          The
ball  is  then made to rest against the tapering points of three
slender glass rods at the height of several inches above the
table, and sheltered from any irregular agitation of the air
of the apartment       by   a large receiver passed over it.    The
number of seconds which the thermometer now takes to
sink from one given point to another, or to the middle of
its distance from the limiting temperature,       is noted      by
                                                                help
of a    stop-watch ;    and the ball being thoroughly emptied
and again successively filled with other liquids, the like ob
servations are repeated.         These several intervals of time,
allowing    a  slight  correction  for the matter of the shell       it
self and of     the inserted  bulb  of the thermometer, will con
sequently express the proportional quantities of heat con
tained     inequal bulks of the successive liquids.       But their
densities being already known,         it    ishence easy to com
pute their respective capacities, or the quantities of heat
which equal weights of them are capable of containing.
By process grounded ou the same principles, the capacity

                                                                     of

of  a solid, when broken or reduced to      a gross powder,    may
be determined.
    " The same regulated mode of cooling will serve to de
tect with precision the expenditure of heat, and to discri
minate its various allotment, in the different gases.          For
this purpose, a ball of about three inches in diameter, and
formed of bright and very thin silver, is preferable ; and it
may be successively covered with a pellicle or with cambric,
or painted with a coat of ivory-black.       Not to multiply un
necessary details, it will perhaps be deemed sufficient to
cite the case of hydrogen gas, which is by far the most
distinguished. The portion of heat emitted in this ener
getic species of gas by the system of pulsations, whether
from a vitreous or a metallic surface, if not exactly, is very
nearly the same as in atmospheric air ; but that other por
tion which is abstracted by the gradual recession of the
nearest heated particles of the fluid, exceeds no less than
four times the corresponding discharge in the ordinary
medium.        Why such a striking difference should arise, can
hardly    be   conjectured. Hydrogen gas, though ten times
lighter than air, yet contains, in the same volume, an equal
quantity of heat; and it is fitted, by its very superior elasti
city, to transmit the pulsatory impressions more than three
times faster.     It must, therefore, as a counterbalance, re
ceive those impressions three times slower from the heated
surface.     But if such influence be confined, as it would
seem most probable, to the mere boundary of the medium
or its thinnest conterminous shell, the measure of heat im
bibed at a given rise of temperature from the attenuated ex
 panse, would be diminished between two and three times.
This mutual compensation of effect nearly agrees with the
 actual result.     With respect to the quadrupled increase of
 that portion of heat which is abstracted by the slow but con
 tinued renewal of the adjacent stratum of the fluid, we must
 refer it chiefly to the very great mobilitv of hydrogen gas, ex
 ceeding three times that of common air.       If these strata were
 supposed    to have   in both cases the same thickness, they
 would each of them carrv off" the same share of heat.
    " The portions of heat transmitted by pulsation through
 hydrogen gas, from 3 painted and a metallic surface, being,
 as before, expressed respectively by 10 to i, the other por
 tion, which is altogether independent of the nature of the
•cooling surface, and is dispersed by abduction, or the inces
 sant retreat of the strata of the fluid as they come to be
 successively affected, will amount to 40.         Under like cir
 cumstances, therefore, the whole expenditure of beat from

a painted and a   metallic surface, and which in atmospheric
air was denoted by 20 and 1 1, will in hydrogen gas be re
presented by SO and 41.         Those opposite surfaces are thus-
less contrasted in a medium of hydrogen gas, their different
rates of discharging heat being nearly in the proportion of
5 to 4. The silver ball cased with cambric, eools 2{ times
faster, if immersed in hydrogen gas ; but when exposed
naked in the same fluid, it loses its heat almost four times
as fast as in common air.
    "  The superior mobility of hydrogen gas accelerates re
markably the dispersion of heat, by the process of abduc
tion. But the exposing of a heated body to the action of
any current of a fluid substance, will occasion a similar ex
penditure of heat, and which is exactly proportioned to the
celerity of the stream.       If a very large bulb of a thermo
meter be suddenly plunged into water flowing at the rate of
one-third of a mile in the hour, it will be found to lose its
lieat twice as fast, as when immersed in the stagnant pool ;
 and a current of two miles in the hour would, therefore,
 cause through the liquid a dissipation of heat no less than
 seven times more rapid than usual.         A similar acceleration
 of effect is produced, by the impulse of a stream of air.
 With a velocity of about four miles in the hour, the su
 peradded influence of a current equals the ordinary power
 of abduction. Hence the play of a breeze of eight miles
 an hour will double the rate of cooling from a painted, and
 will triple that from a metallic,' surface ; but a wind sweep
 ing with a velocity of forty miles in the hour, would ac
 celerate the cooling of the painted surface six times, and
 that of the metallic one no less than eleven times, thus
 bringing them both near an actual equality of performance.
 In general, the hourly velocity of wind might be computed,
 by multiplying; eight miles into the proportional surplus
 effect exerted in the refrigeration of a vitreous or painted
 surface.
     "  But even in still air, if the body exposed to Its action
  have a very considerable elevation of temperature, the pro
  gress of cooling will be sensibly quickened, by the continual
  ascent of the heated portions of the medium, and which form
  in fact a stream, varying in force according to the intensity
  of excitement.     Supposing the excess of temperature to be
  30 centesimal degrees, or 54 by Fahrenheit-s scale, this
  gentle perpendicular flow of heated air will conjoin an in
  fluence equal to the ordinary abductive dispersion of heat,
  and therefore corresponding to that of a current whick
  moves at the rate of four miles an hour.         Hence, if the
                                                              silver

. silver   ball be 90 centesimal degrees hotter than the encir
  cling air, the effect of the vertical stream is tripled, or the
  aggregate expenditure, from.the painted and from the naked
  surface, will be expressed by 50 and 41, the dissipation
  arising from the increased flow of the medium amounting
  in each of them to 30. By a singular coincidence, this
  proportion is precisely the same as what obtains near the
  equilibrium of temperature in an atmosphere of hydrogen
  gas.      But hydrogen gas betrays in its own constitution still
  greater modifications.        At the same elevation of 90 cen
  tesimal degrees       of temperature,   the combined      powers  of
   cooling which its exerts on the contrasted surfaces, are ex
   pressed by 170 and 161. — It would be fatiguing, however,
   to pursue this intricate analysis much further."

   May 27. —      Earl     Morton      in the chair. — Mr. Brande,
   through the medium of the Society for promoting Animal
   Chemistry, furnished some additional observations on the
   use of magnesia and acids in the case of calculous diseases,
    where alkalies had failed or proved injurious.          He related
    the case of a gentleman of the law, who was closely con
    fined to business during terms, and in consequence of such
   sedentary habits suffered severely by calculi.          The use of
    magnesia     in this and  several other cases effected  a complete
    cure, even where the patients suffered by the passage of
    stones from the kidneys to the bladder, and where the use
    of alkalies had only aggravated their sufferings by impairing
    the digestive powers of the stomach.          In all such cases,
    however, the stone or gravel consisted of uric acid and
    phosphate of lime, which were recognised by the red colour
    of the urine and its sediment.        But another species of cal
    culus was discovered by Dr. Trolleston about fifteen years
     ago, being a triple salt and consisting of ammoniacal mag-
    nesian phosphate of lime. No remedy has hitherto been
     proposed for it. This calculus is known by its whiteness,
     the whitish sediment, and the thin shining crystalline pel
     licle swimming on the urine. It. is not soluble by magne
     sia, but yields to the muriatic, citric, and carbonic acids : the
     latter was found the most effectual, and least offensive to the
     stomach.
        June 3. — The conclusion of Mr. Brande-s paper was
     read, and the result of his observations and experiments
                                                                   must

must be gratifying to all calculous patients, as furnishing
them with some well -grounded hopes of a speedy and cer
tain remedy.        The use of muriatic and carbonic acids con
tinued for some months effected permanent cures, even
where the patients had been previously cut for the stone.

    June    17. — The right hon. Earl of Morton in the chair.
A    letter from Mr. Exley of Bristol to the President, and
by htm communicated           to the Society, was read, on the
Theories of Electricity and the difficulties attached to them.
The author prefers the Frauklinian theory to all others, and
endeavoured to explain those parts of it which are least
compatible wilh the known facts.            He defined the terms
plus    and   minus   or positive and negative electricity some
what in the usual manner, assumed that attraction and re
pulsion depend on the similarity of electric conditions, and
showed why non-electric are good conductors, and vice
versa.      He purposes pursuing the inquiry.
    June 24. Part of a paper by Sir E. Home was read,
containing additional remarks to a former paper on the
anatomy of the Squalus maximus.            The most remarkable
fact was the existence of a small fin between the anus and
the tail, which was overlooked in his preceding observa
tions, and which contributed to lead naturalists into serious
errors.      Sir E. entered into some details, which were illus
trated by drawings, on the general structure of this squalus,
which was thirty feet long, and that of a dog-fish of only
three feet.       The inquiry respecting the supply of air to
fishes was also touched on, and Sir E. made some experi
ments on the effect of pressure of water at a considerable
depth, and particularly in a well 680 feet below the surface
of the Thames, belonging to Mr. Coutts. The object was
to prove that the atmospheric air in water at that depth
was the same as in water near the, surface.          Sir E. made
some remarks accompanied           with speculations on the ex
panding and contracting powers of the vessels in the gills
of sharks, which enabled them to sustain the pressure of
water at 150 fathoms below the surface.

    An account of the Isle of Man, by S. F. Berger, M.D.
M.GiS.     was read.
    The  length  of the Isle of Man from NE to SW exceeds
thirty English miles, and its breadth varies from eight to
fifteen miles.    About five miles from the northern extremity
a mountainous tract commences running parallel to the
eastern coast of the island, and also forming the small de
tached island called the Calf of Man situated at the southern
extremity of the larger one.       This belt or chain of high
land is divided by three transverse valleys, of which two are
situated in the larger island, and the third forms the strait
that separates the one island from the other.        The highest
mountains are situated in the northern division, the most
elevated of which, called Sneifeldt, is 2000 feet above the
level of the sea.
     The rocks of which this country is composed belong
 chiefly to the transition class of Werner.        Small grained
 granite occurs only in one or two places, and at an elevation
 of not more than three or four hundred feet above the sea.
 Gneiss and mica slate appear to be entirely wanting, as also
 are the oldest members of the clay slate formation.           The
 newer portion of the clay slate formation occupies the most
 elevated parts of the island, where it appears under the form
 of horn slate, roofing slate.
     From these rocks the passage to the transition class takes
 place by insensible degrees : and of this the oldest member
 that presents itself is gray wacke.       The tract occupied by
  this latter rock is for the most part less elevated than that
  where the clay slate makes its appearance and incloses it.
  The beds dip south more or less to the east, and this in
  clination varies from vertical to about 35°.      In this forma
  tion  occurs   gray wacke, gray    wacke   slate, and granular
  quartz, slightly micaceous ; in none of which rocks are any
  organic remains to be perceived.
      The preceding formation is covered by a deposit of lime
  stone less elevated above the sea than the gray wacke, and
  at an inclination approaching nearer to horizontal.       It con
  sists of  beds   of shell limestone, resembling     that  of Kil
                                                            kenny,

 kenny, and of Westmoreland, Cumberland, and Durham,
 together with magnesian limestone, sometimes in separate
beds, and often in distinct patches, inclosed within the other.
This magnesian limestone, except in a single instance, ap
peared destitute of organic remains, but in some places in
 closes roundish nodules of glassy quartz.
     In one or two places the limestone is covered by an un-
stratified mass of transition amygdaloid ; the base of which
is a greenish wacke, containing nodules of lamellar cal
careous spar invested by a thin coating of iron pyrites.
     Of the flcetz or secondary rocks the only one that occurs
is the oldest sandstone, some of the beds of which are so
coarse-grained as to merit the name of conglomerate,          in
which case it consists chiefly of fragments of quartz, with a
few scraps of decayed slate, and a little iron pyrites.     The
colour of the sandstone is red, or grayish white; it is more
or less slaty, according to the proportion of mica that it con
tains: it lies unconformably over the gray wacke, and dips
NW at an angle varying from 35* to 15°.
     On the sea shore, and on the slopes of several of the
mountains, are loose blocks, in great abundance, of granite,
of mica slate, and of porphyry.
    The only mines in the island are at Loxey, at Foxdale,
and at Brada head : at present however they are all aban
doned!      The ore is galena mixed with pyrites, and with the
carbonates of ltfad and of copper.     The rock through which
the veins run is gray wacke: but at Foxdale they have
been followed into the subjacent granite.
    The paper is terminated by two tables. Of. these the
first is a register of the temperature of several springs as
certained during the month of June 1811.            From this it
appears    that  the  mean  temperature  of  the island 49°. 99,
exceeding that of Edinburgh by about 2°.2, and inferior to
that of London by about 1°.
    The second table contains the elevation of 78 different
spots in the island, deduced from barometrical observations.
Of these there are twenty-one the height of which is be
tween 1000 and 2000 feet above the level of the sea.

    The reading of Mr. Webster's paper "On the Fresh
water Formations of the Isle of Wight, with some Observa-^
tions on the Strata lying above the Chalk in England," was
begun.
    The observations in this paper were in part suggested by
the recently published memoir of MM. Cuvier and Brong-
niart, concerning the strata in the vicinity of Paris, in which
they have described two marine and two fresh-water for
mations alternating with each other, the whole lying above
the chalk, which latter rock has hitherto been very ge
nerally considered as one of the most recent deposits.
    It is to Sir Henry Englefield that we are indebted for the
first observation of highly-inclined strata of chalk in the
Isle of Wight.
    A circumstance so material for the theory of the forma
tion, or of the revolutions undergone by the more recent
strata   of the earth, demanded a leisurely and careful sur
vey, which was intrusted by Sir H. Englefield to the well-
known accuracy of Mr. Webster. The present paper is the
result of this inquiry.
    An elevated ridge of hills runs through the Isle of Wight,
in a direction nearly E and W, from Culver Cliff to the
Needles. These hills are composed of strata sometimes
nearly vertical, but generally forming an angle with the
horizon of from 60° to 80°, dipping northward. The
 strata consist of the upper and lower beds of chalk, that is
 the chalk with and without flints, covering the chalk marl ;
 and these again are underlaid by calcareous sandstone with
 subordinate beds of chert and limestone, clay and car
 bonized wood.        To the north of these strata occur, at
 Alum Bay, other vertical beds of sand and clav, one of
 which corresponds in its fossils and other characters with
 the blue clay containing aptaria, usually known by the
 name of the London clay.
     The whole series of vertieal beds exhibits no marks of
 partial disturbance: but it is evident, from the occurrence
 of these very same beds in other parts of the country in a
 nearly horizontal position, and from the impossibility of
 some of them (consisting of loose sand with water-worn,
 nodules    of flint) being deposited in the vertical position in
 which they are     at present, that the whole mass must have
                                                             been

been bodily raised or depressed by some unknown force
applied to them, subsequently to the formation of the bed
of London clay.                                                 ,
   If a line in the direction   of the central ridge of the Isle
of Wight, be extended westwards into Dorsetshire, it
will be found to coincide nearly with the direction of a
ridge running from Handfast Point to Lulworth, and with,
that already described; and which therefore may be consi
dered as a continuation of this former.
   The nearest tract of chalk to the north of this ridge is
the South Downs, the strata of which, together with their
superimposed beds up to the London clay, dip gently to
the south.    Hence the space between may be considered as
a great basin or hollow, occasioned probably by the rup
ture and subsidence of strata originally horizontal.        , . .
   Within this basin at its southern edge, that is on the
northern coast of the Isle of Wight, occurs a large mass of
horizontal strata in many parts visibly resting on the edges
of the elevated strata above mentioned, and therefore be
longing to a period subsequent to that in which the forma
tion or the basin took place. This horizontal deposit differs
in its geological situation, in its mineralogical characters,
and in the fossils which it contains,          from any others
that have1 hitherto been discovered in England ; but re
markably corresponds in many of its members with the
beds found in the basin of Pans, and recently described by
MM. Cuvier and Brongniart ; authenticated specimens of
which, sent by the latter of these gentlemen to the Count de
Bournon, have been by him deposited in the cabinet of the
Geological Society.
   These beds as they appear in the Isle of Wight consti
tute four formations : the first of which is the lowest fresh
water formation ; the second is the upper marine formation ;
the third is the upper fresh-water formation ; and the
fourth or superficial is an alluvial bed.
   The particulars of these are described in the subsequent
part of Mr. Webster's paper, which has not yet been read
before the Society.

   The following curious relation was mentioned by Dr.
Lettsom, as occurring to an old and esteemed school-fellow.
His propensity    to spirits had become so irresistible, that
when he had been debarred from the more grateful flavour
of gin, rum, and brandy, he had purchased privately the
                                                      nauseous

nauseous substitute of the volatile tincture of valerian, and
the acrid stimulus of the tincture of gum guaiacum, to in
cite the insidious pleasure of intoxication.            One night in
this    state he rolled  out of  his   bed,  which  was  approximate
to a fire, the flames of which extended to his saturated
body, and reduced it to a cinder, without materially injuring
the bed furniture.        (A case not less extraordinary is to be
found in the lxivth volume of the Philosophical Transactions
for 1774, by Dr. Wilmer of Coventry).
      From these curious occurrences Dr. Lettsom passed on
 to the most infuriate state of madness from intoxication,
 which is excited by the use of bang combined with opium,
 and producing that fatal practice of running a muck, a
 practice that has prevailed time immemorial in Batavia, on
 the Malabar and Coromandel coasts, and throughout most
 parts of India, wherever the Malays have extended their
  settlements.       Addicted to gaming, they indulge this passion
 to the greatest extent, until they have lost every thing they
 possessed, even to their wives and children; and thus lost
  to every possession, to drown misery, they are impelled to
  smoke a plant called bang with opium, till they are excited
  by intoxication to the highest degree of fury and madness.
  In this infuriate state they rush into the street, armed with
  a poisoned creuse or dagger, and kill every man, woman
  and child they encounter,        till they themselves are killed or
  taken bv the populace.
      The degrees of mischief arising from diluted liquors, less
  active in their effects, but eventually not less painful or
   dangerous, fell next under the lecturer's consideration ; and
    after relating a few instances of misery and destruction
  from the inordinate use of fermented liquors, he proceeded to
   histories of morbid effects arising therefrom.         The lecturer
   concluded by observing, that " painful as it has been to
   present scenes of human infelicity, often incurred by per
   sons of social and amiable dispositions, with hearts dis
    posed to conviviality, and with minds formed for friendly
   intercourse,     who have mistaken the means of rational en
   joyment, by the influence of vivid imagination and of
    unaffected friendship, for noisy familiarity ; I now cheer
    fully conclude, with earnestly impressing, that true happi
    ness depends upon the ceconomy and just estimate of en
   joyment.       It is the abuse, not the use, of wine I would de
    precate.    Far be it from me to proscribe such conviviality.
    It expands cordiality ; it knits together friendships; it en
    larges the social affections ; it opens the mind ; it dissipates
    care ; it animates pleasurable sensations, and urges to pro
                                                                  mote

  mote them in others       ;  it opens the avenues of charity, and
 in being blessed it seeks to bless others.               Without social,
  convivial, and rational intercourse, no liberal mind would
  court existence : but in these unaffected enjoyments, let us
  guard our best passions, and overlook the ebullitions of joy
  in our friends, and the human imbecilities sometimes flow
  ing from innocence, mirth, and confidence, and which
  6hould never transpire or extend beyond the convivial and
  enlivening table.
                              When you smooth
              The brow of care, indulge your festive vein
              In cups by well inferm-d experience found
              The least your bane; and only with your friends;
              These are sweet follies ; frailties to be seen
              By friends alone, and men of generous minds."

     The Society having concluded the session of the present
 year we shall lay before our readers an abstract of an ad
 dress delivered by M. le Chevalier MacCarthy " On the
 Rise and Progress of Learning, and the beneficial Influence
 of Literary and Scientific Societies."
     The address being of considerable length, and composed
 of a number of particulars, we shall select only the leading
 topics, and endeavour as much as possible to maintain the
 concatenation ; although, from the nature of the matter,
 an air of hurry or even of confusion is nearly unavoidable.
     Towards the commencement of the session <£ An Histo
 rical Review of the Scientific Literary and Philosophical
 Works of the late Richard Kirwan, Esq., LL.D. F.R.S.,
 Sec." was read by J. O-Reardon, Esq., M.D.                      Of this
 also we would have given an abstract ; but that it was im
 possible to condense the subject matter, with the commen
 taries of the author, into a compass sufficiently small for
 this place, without rendering the whole uninteresting and
 spiritless.
<U+2666>The Right Honourable the President having left the chair,
    M. le Chevalier MacCarthy took his seat, and delivered
    his address, of which the following is an abstract :
    During a series of ages which were to the natural sciences
 what the seventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries were to
 literature, we are compelled to wade through the impene
 trable shades of a long tedious night.                In vain do a few
 feeble stars occasionally diffuse a transient illumination on
 our way ; every step is delusion, error, uncertainty, or con
                                                                 jecture.

                  Kirwanian Society of Dublin.                  46*
jccture.      When at length in the revolution of time, we.
 emerge from this profound obscurity, we shall be cheered by
 the dawn of the sun of knowledge shedding around his ge
 nial rays, and dissolving those phantoms, creatures of ima
gination, which in the uncertainty of darkness had assumed
 the appearance of reality.     In this important aera we find
 vanishing like dreams in the morning, those antiquated and
 distorted systems which rested upon no other foundation
than doubtful or mistaken facts, the abortive offsprings of a
 wild and luxuriant imagination. Such great effects have
 been produced by literary associations ; and we must be
 convinced that their introduction was the first great and de
 cisive step towards the increase and diffusion of the light
 of reason.
    The mania of system-framing has been in ancient times
 productive of the worst consequences.        Systems that were
 maintained for ages by the most celebrated characters, now
 appear contemptible.       In what light do we now look
 upon    the  " transmigration" of Pythagoras, the       "  hooked
 atoms" of Democritus, the cosmogony of Ptolomoeus, the
 more modern whirlwind of Descartes, and the theory of
 Leibnitz ? Systems should be adopted with caution; they
 should be employed as helps, but must never be mistaken
 for science.
     It was not for want of understanding, talent, or applica
 tion, that the ancients were thus deficient in natural
 sciences; this mania was a principal cause : but there were
 others.     Each individual obstinately maintained his own
 fanciful conceptions ; the self-security of enthusiasm was
 incompatible with the modest caution of deliberate investi
 gation : each was insulated with regard to philosophical
 communication ; the means which we now possess in the
  art of printing, of diffusing what is known, was want
                                                                     "
 ed, and there was no common repository for fact and bb-
  servation, from which alone truth could be deduced. Thus,
  without detracting any thing from the merits of the an
  cients, we can account satisfactorily for their- deficiencies.
     Yet so admirable is the disposition of human affairs, that-
  even these deficiencies were productive of the most salutary
  effects. In the infant state of society, the first efforts of men
  were to supply the necessities and comforts of life ; next, to
  lay the foundation of laws, morality, and religion.           At a
  more advanced period, the study of human nature, of poetry,
  oratory, cosmogony, and metaphysics,            was successfully
  cultivated.    Natural appearances no less striking in their
  grandeur than perplexing in their variety, were witnessed
     Vol. 44. No. 182. June 1813.            Gg            although

although net understood.     Nature proclaimed her wonders
to an astonished world Terror enforced the belief of
                              ;                        su                 a
pernatural agent    men sunk with reverential awe before
                     5
that invisible power which they could neither discover nor
avoid, and their very ignorance compelled them to acknow
ledge the great, the incomprehensible Creator of the world.
     Not   so had the ancients been   possession of our expla-<
                                          in
nations     of natural phaenomena    they would have raised
                                          :
their thoughts no higher than effects, without reflecting on
the necessity of an ultimate cause        in fine, they would
                                                 :
have sunk into the careless apathy of deism, perhaps of
atheism.
   In these early ages we find even the philosophical poets
endeavouring to account for the formation and continuance
of the world without allowing the interference of Divine
                                                                   in a
power. By their supposed success we find them             great       a
degree  divested of those terrors about  futurity which other
wise prove so powerful     check upon human passions. This
                              a
appears evidently from the following passage in the
                                                         " Dc
Rerum Natura" of Lucretius            :
            Nam simul ac ratio fua ccepit vociferari
            Naiuram rerum haud Divina meute coortam,
            DifFugiunt animi terrores, &c.
  Even the sweet Mantuan muse breathes the same spirit                         in
that beautiful apostrophe near the conclusion of the second
Georgic    :
            Felix, qui potuit rerum cognosce™ causas,     -
            Atque metus ornnes et inexorable fatum
            Subjecit pedibus, strepitumque Acheroiitis avari   !
,  Notwithstanding the deficiencies of the ancients, and
our necessary advantages over them, we should not be                          in
flated with     consciousness
                a               of superiority   we should    :
survey their useful labours with gratitude and respect.    If
we have surpassed them, they traced out our course, and
we enjoy lights which never shone upon them. What they
for ages sought with exemplary but unavailing perseverance,
we possess without      search, being presented with these
                          a
sublime  truths     by
                   no less    promulgator than the Divine
                                  a
Author of all knowledge. They are perhaps superior to us
in  constancy, application, and labour   and as to their de
                                                     :
ficiencies, they should rather be attributed to want of neces
sary means, than to any avoidable insufficiency.         With
what rapture and amazement would aftertimes have looked
Upon Aristotle, Theophrastus, Pliny, or even Dioscorides,
had they possessed our stock of experience and observation                     !

 which dep.. itu upon experience were not attainable.

 here t; ' cue, nay the necessity, of those associations where
 men oi learning accumulate an invaluable store or" know
ledge, o!" the materials from which the most exquisite
system* are afterwards to he constructed.
    The origin of these associations is not to be placed at
 that remote epoch in which Ptolemy Soter or Theodosius,
 the younger founded literary institutions ; not even when
 Charlemagne had established one, nor for long succeeding
 ages.     Feudal tyranny was daily extending its dominion,
 and strengthening its power, under the successors to the
 vast empire but not to the genius of Charlemagne.         Igno
rance was then the prerogative of nobility ; learning moul
dered in the recesses of monasteries ; even imagination, that
everlasting source of exquisite delight, was paralysed in the
general torpor.       In such a manner were passed six long
centuries : little ehe had been cultivated than the art of
disputation, or of perplexing every question by an inter
minable controversy.
   But from this period opens an illustrious aera ; the mists
of ignorance begin to dissipate, and the cheering dawn
prepares us for the splendour of the approaching             day.
The    art  of- printing produced  a   new  appearance  on every
thing, and the long neglected works of great men began
to be disseminated.        The venerable shacks of the illustri
ous writers of antiquity seemed to rise from their ancient
monuments, and to be revivified for ever.             From this
happy period a long line of great names may he enume
rated 5 their labours have perpetuated their glory, and they
will ever be remembered with gratitude and veneration.
It is too true that in these ages the opinions of great
men were sometimes wild and extravagant, although in
genious, bold, nay sublime. Of this an extraordinary in
stance occurs in the philosophical romances of Descartes,
which will ever be remembered with interest and amaze
ment.       This great man overthrew the chimaeras of the
Peripatetics, even by means of other chimaeras          The. two
phantoms fought, they both fell, and after their destruction
 Keason reigned triumphant.
   At length the period arrives in which literary associations
begin to be formed; the memorable Academy at Rome,
founded in 1603, was the first: amongst its members are
found Galileo and Coluaina.          It died with its founder in
1630, and in 1650 was succeeded by the Academy Naturae
Curioiorum.

468                Kirwaman Society     of Dublin.
     In   1654 the renowned Academia del Cimento, the fir3t
truly experimental society, made its appearance : it enume
rates the celebrated names of Galileo, Torricelli, Aggi-
uuti, and Viviani.         In this academy first originated the
custom of publishing Transactions.
     During the gloomy administration of Cromwell was
formed the embryo of the since celebrated Royal Society of
London.        Its original members were Boyle, Evelyn, Hook,
Needham, Willoughby, Ray, Lester, and Grew.                Of the
subsequent members much might be said, had not their fame
rendered it unnecessary : to eulogize, were but to name
them. There was one, who, had he been the only philoso
pher amongst all, would have perpetuated the fame of the
Society, — the illustrious, the immortal Newton, not less
 the lover than the beloved favourite of Nature.
      In- 1666 was established the famous Academy of Sciences-
 at Paris.     Amongst its early members, we find the names
 of Dominic Caseini and Huygens.
     The splendid reputation, indefatigable labours, and incal
 culable services of these three academies, in England,
 France and Italy, excited a spirit of emulation in every
 part.      Every monarch was ambitious of being a protector,
 and every man of talent an associate, of some learned so
 ciety.     The number of academies tbat sprung up at once
 was amazing ; no Jess than 550 have been enumerated in
 Italy alone.
       In 1700 an Academy of Sciences was founded at Berlin,
 by Frederick I. of which Leibnitz was the chief promoter.
  The celebrated Maupertuis was afterwards appointed its
  president by Frederick III.
       Peter the Great with the assistance of Leibnitz and Wolfe
  first projected the plan of the Imperial Academy of Sciences
  at Petersburg, which was established in 1 725 by the Czarina
  Catherine I.
       About 1739 Linnaeus with a few men of letters formed
  a private society at Stockholm, which was in 1741 incor
  porated by the king under the title of " Academy of
  Sciences," and of this Linnaeus was appointed president.
       At length, after some unsuccessful attempts in Dublin, a
  number of gentlemen began to hold meetings and to read
  essays ; and soon enlarging      their plan, they were in 1786
  incorporated under the name of the Royal Irish Academy,
  which unites the advancement of science with the history
  pf mankind and with polite literature.
        A number   of societies have of late  years sprung up, the
   latest pf which    is the Kirwanian Society    of Dublin.   The
                                                           original"

                 Meteorological Observations V               469
Original members, anxious to cooperate with other institu
tions in promoting the cultivation of natural sciences, de
termined at the commencement to confine their attention
to those objects exclusively, and to interfere as little as
possible with the more, extended views of those already
established in Ireland.    They resolved also to enroll them
selves under the name of some philosopher who had di
stinguished himself in those branches of knowledge which
they intended to profess.      They naturally therefore turned
their attention to the late celebrated and venerable Kirwan:
they were anxious to do honour to the name without
obliging themselves to the adoption of peculiar opinions.
    [Here the Chevalier took a retrospect of the progress
and labours of the Kirwanian Society ; but as we have for
merly given abstracts of their proceedings, they need not in
this place be repeated.]
    It is unnecessary to enlarge   upon   the invaluable  benefits
resulting from the introduction of academies : the period
 of their establishment may indeed well be called the golden
age of literature.     At that happy period a brilliant con
 stellation of superior minds rose together, which illuminated
 the horizon of Europe with its lustre.        France, England,
 Sweden, Germany and Ireland, may be proud of their li
 terary career during the last century : much has been done
 for the benefit of society, and it ought to be the ambition
 of the new century before us to do as much for posterity
 as our ancestors have done for us.       The ambition of that
 man, observes Lord Bacon, who attempts to establish or
 enlarge the dominion of the human species over the uni
 versality of things, is unquestionably      more excellent and
 more exalted than any other : because the empire of man
 over things, has for its only base the sciences and arts, and
 tt is only by obeying nature that we can learn to com
 mand her.

    among very numerous and dissimilar appearances of the
    clouds, pendulous lobes as it were hanging from a sort of
    dense sheet, which formed a sort of depending ckrocumulus ;
    afterwards a deep red was conspicuous in the cloud oppo
    site to the set sun, as well as red in the western haze.
       May 22. — Fair early ; showers came on in the day, and
    much cloud ; evening fair, except a mistiness.                 Therm. 11

   Therm, at 3 P.M. 62°, at 1 1 P.M. 50°.
       May 25. — Still showery with westerly gales, but more
   clouds today than rain. Therm. 63 1 in the middle of the
    day, at 1 1 P.M. 55°.
       May 26. — Some shower* during the day, various ap
   pearances of the cumulostratus, and in the intervals towards
   evening heavy nimbi appeared about and a rainbow *. Some
   cumulostrati in the west refracted a ri ch sort of mahogany
   colour. Orange was the precise colour of the haze. Therm,
   at 3, 62°, and 1 1 P.M. 44°.             Wind westerly today.
       May 27. — Fine morning, much cloud through the day ;
   fair evening; the colour of the haze red ; fading upwards as
   usual. Therm, at 3, 64° ; at 1 1, 52°. Wind westerly.
       May 28. — Fair dav, with large masses of cumulus ; to
  wards evening very clear and dry, but cirrus in abundance
   variously figured about and coloured by setting sun ; also
  some cirrocumulus           and cirrostratus in mottled beds had
  a pretty appearance.            Colour of the haze in the west red
  dish. Therm. 4 P.M. 62° ; 11, 51°. The owls hooted more
  than usual ; a frequent sign of fine weather, as noticed by
   Virgil.
       May 29. — Fair hot day, very clear in the morning;                   du

     * The arc was partly seen in the blue sky, a circumstance which seems
  to show that the particles of the nimbiform cloud may be very thinly diffused,
  so as hardly to alter the appearance of the sky, and yet be sufficient to pro
  duce the rainbow. This circumstance, when considered in reference to the
  incapability of other clouds to show the iris, may be regarded as affording
, collateral evidence of the peculiar change which takes place in clouds to be
  come nimbi.
