       I. On the Physiology        of Botany.       By Mrs. Ibbetson.
                              To Mr. Tilloch.
SIR,    —As I   am precluded from presenting to the public that
work now ready for the press, by an opposition that in my pre
sent state of weakness I am wholly unable to stem; yet I can
not but make one effort more to introduce to my countrymen
that beautiful series of facts in botanical physiology, which ap
pear to me unanswerable, and could only have been procured
by means of progressive dissection, following each ingredient of
flower-bud, seed, pollen, &c. &c. from the place in which they
were made, and from the moment of their formation in the                       in
terior one year, till they are completed, and then decayed at the
exterior the meat year.
   In my application to booksellers I was assured, that after
consulting the first botanists, it was decided that no new facts
were wanted. I confess I was so simple as to think, after a long
progressive study, that no part of the physiology of a plant was
known; that we neither knew where the flower-bud was formed,
the embryo of the seed protruded, and particularly what caused
the very visible motion so apparent in a plant; nor did we un
derstand how the root differed from the stem, or the stem from
the new shoot.     Yet       all
                           these points are the chief foundation               of
vegetable oeconomy, the laws              by
                                     which they are governed, and
follow each other with such perfect precision, that the first ray
be  said almost mathematically      prove the rest.
                                          to
  It     the
        is   opinion     of
                         botanists   general, and

       View Plate I, fig. 2: these are the flower-buds of beginning
    branches, forcing their way through the wood, and thus dis
    played by the bark being taken off. How could these excrescences
   be formed outwardly, when botanists make the whole force to
   act in a contrary direction ? for if they are supposed to run back
   into the wood (rather a strange method of proceeding forward),
   would they have made an excrescence at the exterior            Besides,
   at l l there are many young buds that have not yet reached
   the bark; they cannot have formed in the alburnum, for they
  have not yet touched          and          it:

which is made on purpose to cover               and inclose     it,from the                it
air;  it generally contains two          three buds, and conveys them

     Iam assured that it is supposed I am trying to alter the pre
 sent system, which my sort of botany touches not, or the                                                    Lin
 mean, on which the whole of my discoveries are really founded.
 But there are two very different sorts of botany: one is the ter
                                                        -
 minology of plants with the sexual system and names; mine the
 physiology of plants, and their resemblance to animal life: no
 two sciences can differ more, though they are both absolutely -
 necessary to each other.

II. Reflections on the Noachian Deluge, and on the Attempts
  lately made at Orford, for connecting the same with present
  Geological Appearances.    By A Correspon DENT.
                                             To     Mr. Tilloch.
SIR,      -I AM one of those, who, without surrendering my Rea
son to the Priests of any of the almost innumerable Sects, whose
selfish interests, so frequently oppose them bitterly to each other,
delight, not only generally “to look through Nature up to na
ture's God,” but in a particular manner to do so, through the
grand and highly impressive phaenomena, which Geological re
search has brought to light, and in considerable degrees explained,
since about the year 1792, when our ingenious and deserving,
although hitherto much neglected countryman, Mr. Hºm. Smith of
Mitford, began his practical investigations of the Strata of our
 Island, and of the astonishing number and variety of the Organic
Remains, with which                    its
                            Strata are enriched, and          the Alluvia        as   to
which covers those Strata: and which Remains were,                his sa                    by
gacity and perseverance, for the first time,         far    my   Reading   so     as
extends, made useful,         without doubt their beneficent Author
                                           as
intended them,         promoting and extending the knowledge                                              of
 Man, into much               of in

before the Era alluded to,                        he
                                  was little acquainted,     any correct              to

 he inhabits.
 I    have been induced        make the above remarks, from having
                                           to
just perused Professor Buckland’s “Inaugural Lecture,” delivered
in  May 1819,      Oxford, and observed, that
                         at                           therein labours      he                             to
prolong those errors and delusions, respecting the evidences, which
  Geological phrenomena were                           so
                                        confidently said       present                to                  or
 afford,    the occurrence and circumstances attending the Mosaic
           of
Deluge.
 I   remember having secn Mr. Bakewell commended                    your                         in
Work, for having        the year in
                                  1813   abstained, from    introducing
the Deluge      Moses into his “Introduction
                    of                               Geology,”        the  to                        as
previous Writers had almost invariably done,              the manifest          to
injury     Geology
           of                         on

disuse, while the number        writers                          on
                                            Geological subjects, have

the exploded notion, that any           the phaenomena   of    this time               at
visible,        within the Earth, are, with any proper regard
               on   or                                                                                    to

                 Reflections on the Noachian Deluge.                                        ll
   It is undoubted that the surface of the Earth, almost universally
presents the evidences, of a most violent and over-whelming
Torrent, or rather, perhaps, a succession of such, the Waters of
which (assisted perhaps by some Tidal reversion of the action of
Gravity, as has been inaintained by Mr. Farey in your work) were
able to move vast masses of earthy Matters, mixed with gravel
Stones and even with large Bolders and very heavy Blocks of
Stone, and to lodge them on tops of Hills, and on the surfaces of
Plains of considerable elevation; such Hills and Plains, and the
Valleys which intersect them, having most evidently existed in
their present form and shape, at the time of these early or gravel
Floods, which most evidently did not excavate the Valleys, or in
any material degree abrade or alter the contour of the Hills.
   Now the mistake of Professor Buckland, and of all those who
have preceded him, in referring these tumultuous events, to the
Deluge happening in the days of Noah, consists, in not having
carefully considered the words used by Moses in describing the
Noachian Deluge, which if they had done, instead of taking on
trust, the absurd interpretations of those words, or rather the fa
brifications which were framed by Dr. Woodward and many
other writers of the two last Centuries, the Professor must, by                                  .
this examination of Moses’ words, have found, that the same,
throughout, refer to a quiet effusion of Water upon the surface
of the Earth, for the avowed purpose and for no other, but that
of drowning the degenerate race of Mankind, whose crimes and
violences had filled the Earth; and that in point of fact, accord
ing to Moses, the surface of the Earth, was not torn up or moved,
so as in any material degree to disturb and root up the Pegetable
races /;   nor did it annihilate any of the race of Fishes, not
even the most torpid and helpless of the species of Shell-Fish !
The vegetable earth or Mould,        for the growth

(the  evidently slow result     long periods
                                     of          decomposition,   of
                                                                  and
the accumulation        decayed vegetable matters) was not, ac
                          of
cording    toMoses, either washed away,      covered,     naked and
                                                             or                   by
fresh-moved Rublish, because Noah          quitting the Ark,

   Whereas, the Gravel Floods which the Professor has laboured
to  identify with this Noachian Deluge, must, undoubtedly, have

pears to me, as it seems also to have done to Professor Buckland,
to refer to the complete formation of the Earth, including the
creation of the myriads of living Beings which existed, between
the successive creations of the Matter, composing the Strata
which inhume them; of the subsequent account by Moses, of
the creation of Animals and Plants, to people the surface of the
Earth (already formed as at present, by long exposure to the
elements, fitted to receive them) nothing therein contained, seems
capable of contradiction, or having doubt thrown upon                                                     it,   by

                              To
 SIR,           the remarks on eclipses by    Mr. Yeates, inserted in the
 last volume of the Philosophical      Magazine, this gentleman     seems
 desirous of proving, that the entire revolutions of the D are          li
 mited to a period of 912 solar years, in which time her relative
 motions, with respect to the G), and the whole phaenomena of
 eclipses are completed.        On examining the solar and lunar mo
 tions during the above period, I find that 912 solar years" con
 tain 11279.8602955 lunations; consequently the                  has not
 completed her last revolution, wanting 50° 17' 37’ of the line
 of conjunction : the time in which the             would pass through
 this space would occupy about four days, two hours.            The D's
 perigee also falls short of the same time by 28° 56'46"; from
 which circumstance the D's anomaly would evidently be 79°
  14°  23'  short of the same line of conjunction. The longitude
 of the D's node also falls short of conjunction 49'         7".      The
 acceleration of the D's longitude during this period amounts to
 only 14° 23"; consequently from the above statement it is not
 possible to prove that 912 solar years constitute a complete lunar
 period; for either the solar year must be longer by 6' 30".842,
 or the synodic revolution of the D must be 31'.6 shorter, than
 at the commencement of the present century, neither of which
 obtains, or is known to be the fact.          In examining every con
junction of the G) and        )  that can take place during a period of
upwards of ten thousand years, I find that the nearest coinci
dence of the solar and lunar periods obtains at the completion
of 687 solar years, which are equal to 25092.1° 9° 45' 36".0.
This period contains 8497 lunations, or 25092.1° 9° 44' 31".6:
the difference in time is 1' 4".4; the            having passed the line
of conjunction by 32".72. The acceleration of the                 in this
period amounts to 8' 7".72.
    * The solar year is here taken as stated by Mr. Delambre in his Theo
retical and Practical Astronomy, 3 volumes quarto, 1814; and the lunar
motions from the 4th edition of M. Laplace's System of the World.
                                                                       I rt

                   Remarks on the Lunar Theory.                     15
   In 39512 solar years are contained 488695 lunations, wanting
about 5” only of the line of conjunction of the G) and      ).    The
 N's acceleration during this period amounts to upwards of two
complete revolutions of the D to the G), or nearly 760°.          The
acceleration of the D's longitude in a period of 600,000 years,
according with the present established theory, would exceed her
mean motion by 3373 revolutions of the ecliptic!!!         Hence the
absurdity of instituting such long periods is evident.      If in any
period we could recognise a coincidence in the solar and lunar
motions (including their anomalies and accelerations), the same
circumstance would not again obtain, from the known perturba
tions in the lunar theory, or at least not till after a lapse of per
haps millions of years; for, on account of the irregularities in
the lunar motions, their circuits must undergo new computations,
in order to assign their relative situations during a preceding or
subsequent period. The Chaldean Period is the most ancient
and correct of any established; it consists of 223 mean lunations,
which, according to mean motions at the commencement of
the present century, is performed in 6585" 7" 42° 24”.4; the
motion of the )'s anomaly 11° 27° 10' 9".4; the G)'s anomaly
0, 10° 29' 34".7; G) to the D's node—l 1* 29° 31' 33”.5;
whence the comp. G) to the D's node 28' 26".5.            Mr. Fergu
son states it at 28 12".5. There is about 18° on each side
of the D's node within which there is a possibility of eclipses;
consequently the period of eclipses, so far as it affects the earth,
contains a space of about 36° about that node, which taken from
360° leaves 324° remaining for the eclipse to travel in the        er
pansium; and as this 36° is not gone through in less than 1370
years, the remaining 324° cannot be so gone through in less than
 12330 years.    The falling back of the line of conjunctions or
oppositions of the G) and ) being 28' 26".5 with respect to
the line of the nodes in every Chaldean period will wear it out in
process of time, or in about 1370 years, as above stated; and after
that time, it will not return again in less than 12330 years. The
eclipses of the G) which happen about the ascending node, and
begin to come in at the north pole of the earth, will advance a
little southerly at each return, till they go off the earth at the
south pole; and those which happen about the descending node,
and begin to come in at the south pole of the earth, will proceed
a little northerly at each return, till at last they quite leave the
 carth at the north pole.
   The entire period of any respective eclipse is comprised in
about 760 Chaldean periods, or about 13700 years; the whole
terrestrial phaenomena being completed in about 76 Chaldean
periods, or 1370 years. But the irregularities in the lunar mo
tions may lengthen or protract
                           t      this period 100 years. The D's

acceleration          in an entire period is 66° 27' 12".7; in a terrestrial
period      32°   43'-3. This period of eclipses, although longer than
Mr. Yeates    appears to see through, is notwithstanding the least

  truth; whereas they now give it to within ten seconds, and ge
 nerally much nearer.        The principal object of importance to
  wards   cultivating   more perfectly the lunar astronomy is a long
 and continued series of correct observations, whereby to furnish
 theory with the true data, in order to approximate more cor
  rectly to the inequalities in the lunar motions.         And on insti
 tuting calculations on the solar and lunar theory, their present
 mean motions ought to be applied as deduced from the most
 correct observations, with the application also of the accelera
 tions, otherwise we cannot expect to elicit from the theory of
 gravitation the various perturbations in the lunar theory.
     Lastly; with respect to the astronomical question to be        in
 quired into, viz. Whether the recession of the conjunctions of the
  G) and ) in the ecliptic is any real and absolute anticipation,
 or whether it is produced by some unknown variation of the ca
 lendar reckoning during the above period. In answer to the
 above, I beg to remark that the ancient eclipses have been care
 fully examined by several of the most eminent astronomers and
 chronologers, in order to establish particular epochs; and also
 the lunar theory: by which means the y's acceleration was
 discovered, and which has been since completely verified and
 established by M. Laplace on the Newtonian theory of universal
gravitation; it is therefore very improbable, and further, I may
venture to add impossible, that a mistake of that magnitude:
should have crept into their calculations; for had this been the
case, the lunar tables could not have given the D’s motions,
agreeably to what they have been found to be from observation
during the last 50 or 60 years only.

Sir, — As        a necessary supplement      to what I have advanced
respecting the lunar periods, as the same appears confirmed by
the testimony of the eclipses recorded by the ancients, and at
tested by numerous corresponding examples, I beg permission
to intrude a few notices of the lunar cycles and periods celebrated
among the Chaldeans, the justly reputed fathers of astronomy,
and as the     same were afterwards improved by the Greeks.

     l.The lunar cycle among the Chaldeans was called the saros
and  sara,   from SYTD, sahara, the moon.             This cycle it is said
contained two hundred and          twenty-three     synodical  months, or
eighteen Julian years, ten days, when the same cycle or period
contains five leap days, and eleven days when it contains four leap
days, seven hours, forty-eight minutes, and one-fourth; in which
time       the corresponding new and full moons and eclipses re
           all
turn  again.

    4. If instead of eleven days the correctors of the calendar had
expunged fourteen, the natural order of the days of the week
would have stood common to both styles, thus:
    1. Tuesday; 2. Wednesday; 3. Thursday; 4. Friday;
5. Saturday; 6. Sunday; 7. Monday; 8. Tuesday; 9. Wed

Wednesday.
    5. The year 1800, and the fourth year after a bissextile, was
no bissextile; it being that centenary year when one whole day
was to be taken out of the calendar, which was the 29th day of
February: thus, out of the two days, lost in the weekly cycle,
one has been recovered, although the elapsed time since the cor
rection of the style has not amounted to half a century, and the
Julian excess to little more than the third part of a day. In
short, had two whole weeks been abolished in the September of
 1752, the style had been more conveniently corrected for three
centuries without disturbing the weekly cycle at all, as I have
proved above.
    6. But the grand object of the correctors was to restore the
equinoxes and solstices to the true times of the year, as regulated
by the motion of the sun, with the express design of marking
the seasons in their proper places in the calendar; and this was
the only reason why they determined not so much upon the
weekly cycle as upon the precise days of the month when the
sun made his passage through the celestial equinoxes and tro
p ics.
    7. The autumnal equinox having fallen back eleven whole
days; viz. to September 12th in the year 1751, the year pre
ceding the new style, the addition of so many days brought it
up to the true time of the equinoctial passage of the sun, and to
the same day of the same month of the year it was placed at the
council of Nice A.D. 325; namely, September 22d, when the
sun was observed to enter Libra.
    8. The sum of the years between A.D. 325 and A.D. 1752 is
1427 years: in one day of twenty-four hours are precisely 1440
minutes, and eleven days gives the Julian excess for 1440 years,
at the rate of eleven minutes per annum, which is very nearly
the account.
    9. The alteration of the calendar in the addition of the eleven
days of the month, and in making the third day of September
for the new style to be accounted and reckoned the fourteenth day,
                                                                Was

24                 Remarks on Ancient Eclipses.
was in fact adding so many days to the Julian time, which clearly
demonstrates that the Julian time was too slow, and that astro
nomical time was by so much faster; and therefore this numerical
adjustment was absolutely necessary, and safe from the more
known quantity of a solar year.
    10. The days of the week are however of that importance in
the computation of time, and especially long periods, that could
it be known for certain on what days of the week certain eclipses
of the sun and moon happened a century or many centuries ago,
or other events, it would help to determine more accurately and
positively the exact time, and greatly contribute to the perfection
of astronomy, chronology and history, and for this plain reason,
that the weekly cycle is as old as the creation, and is an account
of time kept up inviolably, not by a few isolated astronomers and
mathematicians, but preserved by the perpetual and unchange
able custom of whole nations !
   To illustrate the excellent method of computing time by the
cycle of weeks, I shall produce one example from the moon's
motion for one hundred years, where the terms of this period are
defined by the known days of the week. In the year 1715, O.S.,
April 22d, there happened a memorable eclipse of the sun on a
Friday: the middle of the eclipse was observed at fifty-one mi
nutes after nine o'clock in the morning, which we will take for
the instant of the new moon.      To correct this date for the new
style it answers to May 3d, and from this date to May the 3d
 1815, is one hundred years exactly.    But the new moon which
happened in May 1815, according to the Ephemeris, was on
Tuesday the 9th day of the month, which by the cycle of weeks
is found to have happened four days later than the cycle ending
on the Friday nearest to May 3, 1815.     Now it being impossible
that an error of a whole week can fall into this reckoning for one
century, and the day of the week being known when the new
moon in April 1715 happened; and also the day of the week
when the corresponding new moon fell in May 1815, the calcula
tion is indubitably certain without any possibility of error as
to the precise day and number of days from one new moon to the
other.
   In 100 Julian years are 5218 weeks, less one day: therefore
from Friday April 22, 1715, to Friday May 5, 1815, are precisely
5218 weeks, or 36526 days, to which add the four days, and it
will bring it up to the new moon in May 1815, and the day of
the month and week as found in the Ephemeris, viz. Tuesday,
May the 9th, and the measure of time in days is 36530; but the
new moon in April 1715 was on Friday morning at fifty-one

 is highly probable, that the wootz is steel accidentally combined
 with the metal of the earths; and the irregularity observed in dif
 ferent cakes, and even in the same cake, is in accordance with
 this opinion. The earths may be in the ore, or they may be
 derived from the crucible in which the fusion is made.                             -
    In making the alumine alloy for the imitation of wootz, we
had occasion to observe the artificial formation of plumbago.
Some of the carburet of iron before mentioned having been
pounded and mixed with fresh charcoal, and then fused, was found
to have been converted into perfect plumbago.           This had not
taken place throughout the whole mass; the metal had soon
melted, and run to the bottom; but having been continued in
the furnace for a considerable time, the surface of the button
had received an additional portion of charcoal, and had become
plumbago.     It was soft, sectile, bright, stained paper, and had
every other character of that body: it was indeed in no way                        di

the glass proved to be oxide of titanium, with a little oxide of
iron.   These experiments have led us to doubt whether titanium
has ever been reduced to the metallic state.    From the effects
of the heat upon the crucibles, which became soft, and almost
fluid, sometimes, in fifteen minutes, we had in fact no reason to
suppose the degree of heat inferior to any before obtained by a
furnace:—that used in these last experiments, was a blast fur
nace, supplied by a constant and powerful stream of air; the fuel
good Staffordshire coke, with a little charcoal; both Hessian
and Cornish crucibles were used, one being carefully luted into
another,   and even three have been united, but they could not
be made to stand the intense heat.

  We attempted to make imitations of the meteoric irons with
perfect success. To some good iron (horseshoe nails) were
added three per cent. of pure nickel; these were inclosed in a
crucible, and exposed to a high temperature in the air-furnace
for some hours.      The metals were fused, and on examining the
button, the nickel was found in combination with the iron. The
alloy was taken to the forge, and proved under the hammer to

fused some of the same good iron, with 10 per cent. nickel; the

disposed to crack under the hammer.       The colour when polished

we were, however, able to detect the silver, even to less than one
in 500.
    In making the silver alloys, the proportion first tried was one
silver to 160 steel; the resulting buttons were uniformly steel
and silver in fibres, the silver being likewise given out in globules
during solidifying, and adhering to the surface of the fused but
ton; some of these when forged gave out more globules of silver.
 In this state of mechanical mixture the little bars, when exposed
to a moist atmosphere, evidently produced voltaic action, and to
this we are disposed to attribute the rapid destruction of the me
tal by oxidation, no such destructive action taking place when
the two metals are chemically combined.                   These results indi
cated the necessity of diminishing the quantity of silver, and one
silver to 200 steel was tried. Here, again, were fibres and glo
bules in abundance; with l to 300, the fibres diminished but
still were present; they were detected even when the proportion
of 1 to 400 was used. The successful experiment remains to be
named.      When l of silver to 500 steel were properly fused, a
very perfect button was produced; no silver appeared on                      sur                its

lity enables us to continue our experiments on this alloy: these,
with whatever else may be worth communicating, will be given
in a future of number of this Journal.            The proportions we
have used are from 1 to 2     per cent.    The valuable properties of .
the rhodium alloys are hardness, with sufficient tenacity to pre
vent cracking either in forging or in hardening.           This superior
hardness is so remarkable, that in tempering a few cutting arti
cles made from the alloy, they required to be heated full 30° F.
higher than the best wootz, wootz itself requiring to be heated
full 40° above the best English cast steel. Thermometrical de

       BANKs, Bart. G.C.B. President of the Royal Society.
Sin     Joseph BANKs is said to have been descended from a noble
Swedish family; but, whatever truth there may be in this assertion,
it is certain that he did not trace his pedigree higher than the
reign of Edward the Third, when his ancestor, Simon Banke,
married the daughter and heir of         Caterton, of Newton in
Yorkshire.     By this marriage, the manor of Newton, in the wa
pentake of Staincliffe, came to the family of Banke, with whom
it remained until it was sold in the middle of the seventeenth
century.                                                            -          -                                          -
    From this Simon Banke, Sir Joseph was the eighteenth in lineal
descent.      His grandfather, Joseph Banks, Esq. was High She
riff of Lincolnshire in the year 1736, and some time Member
of Parliament                 for
                      Peterborough.      He possessed        ample fortune,                     an
which was inherited           the  subject  bythis memoir.          of       -
    Sir Joseph   was born December          13,  1743.     After      suitable                             a

 upon leaving the University of Oxford in 1763, went on a voyage
 across the Atlantic, to the coasts of Newfoundland and Labrador.
 That voyage was not without         difficulties and dangers; but

storm, they at last, and with much difficulty, made their way
back to the beach, and were received on board the ship; but,
three of the persons who accompanied them were lost.
   At Otaheite, where the Endeavour arrived on the 12th April,
1769, the voyagers continued three months, occasionally visiting
the smaller contiguous isles, surveying the coasts, cultivating the
friendship of the natives, collecting specimens of natural history,
and making those scientific observations which constituted a
principal object of the voyage. Quitting these islands, they next                      R
visited New Zealand and New Holland, where the same re
searches were as industriously pursued with considerable advantage;
but the vessel unfortunately striking on a rock, injured it so much
as to threaten the destruction of all on board.     This occasioned
a considerable injury to Mr. Banks's botanical collections, a
great part of which were entirely destroyed. From this coast they
steered for New Guinea.      At Batavia, which they afterwards.
visited, every person belonging to the ship became sick except a
sail-maker, an old man between seventy and eighty years of age,
who got drunk every day. Seven died at Batavia, and three-and
twenty more in the course of six weeks after the departure of the
ship from the harbour. At length, on the 12th of June, 1771, the
survivors brought the vessel to anchor in the Downs, and landed
at Deal,                                     f

    Mr. Banks was received in  England  with   eager admiration and
kindness; and the specimens which he brought at so much risk
and expense to enrich the science of natural history, placed him
above every other person of rank and fortune in the age, both for
 personal qualities and as a benefactor to mankind. At court,
 among men of science and literature, he was equally honoured.
    It was not one voyage, even though that voyage should be
 round the globe, and attended with infinite dangers, that could
 satisfy the inquiring mind of Mr. Banks ; and although he did
                                                                                       :

 - At home, his Sunday evening converzationes were attended by
persons the most celebrated in literature and science, whatever
their rank in life; his valuable library was more accessible than
that of any public institution; and he was always ready to give
his advice, or to communicate his opinion, on every subject con
nected with science.   Mr. Dibdin, in his Bibliographical Deca
meron, justly says, “The incomparable library of Natural History

   The first Section treats   the principles    Equilibrium and
                                                 of                                of

Flaming, we are glad to observe, that the curve of equilibrium,
is considered to coincide with the neutral aris, as it must do;
also that this curve, is very properly determined from the nature
of the Load. In these points the Author has followed the best
examples, but by no means the most common ones. A few re
marks found at the end of this Section, are worthy of being im
printed on the memory of every young Student.
   The second Section presents matter of high value: it is on the
Resistance of Timber; whereon we find a just distinction made,
between the strength and the stiffness of Timber; and the latter
is shown to be, the only kind of Resistance that it is of use to
consider.   The resistance to Tension, the resistance to cross
Strains, and the resistance to Compression, are each considered;
with practical Rules, and numerous Tables of Experiments, many
of which are new.
   The third Section is on the Construction of the Timbering for
Floors of Rooms: hereon, the Author has shown the futility of
the common method of Trussing Girders: which embraces the
absurdity, of an attempt to strengthen a Beam without adding
either to      its
             dimensions,     the quality or    materials.   of      its

bers: and      the end,

to   be   sufficiently strong.
    The fourth, fifth and sixth Sections are, respectively,         the             on
Construction        Roofs, Domes and Partitions, with designs for
                      of

which many important and practical maxims and methods of con

consumptive      patient. The recommendation of Smollet brought
 Nice into fashion next; but the fame of that place vanished also
 as the number of tombs in the Croix de Marbre * increased.
 Various other places got subsequently into repute, as Marseilles,
 Hieres, Pisa, &c. But the preference given them respectively,
 being founded not on experience, but on theoretical deductions
 from latitude, vicinity of mountains, and so forth; it is not sur
 prising that we should have only to record a succession of disap
 pointed hopes. It seems now confessed, that on this subject the
 minds of English practitioners are quite undecided.                    had             “I
 abundant   proofs   of this,” says  the author of the work before us,
 “ in the  contradictory    advices which I found some of our most
celebrated physicians had given to the invalids I met with; some
of these being sent to the South of France indiscriminately;
 others being recommended to Marseilles; others to Hieres; many
 to Nice: while not a few of their medical advisers candidly
 avowed their ignorance of the most desirable residence, and left
 the choice to the discretion of their patients.”
    To assist in supplying the blank in our information on this
 subject, is the design of the work now before us, which the au
 thor modestly desires to be considered “literally what it is de
 signated, as detached Notes on a few of the very numerous and
important objects presented to his view” in the course of two years
 residence in different parts of the South of Europe.          The places
which Dr. Clark treats of are          Marseilles,   Hieres,   Nice,   Willa
Franca, Pisa, Rome, Naples, Lausanne, and Geneva.                 He gives
first a short topographical account of each place, but limited to
those circumstances which are interesting in a medical point of
view ; secondly, observations on               climate; and thirdly, re
                                                  it its

    The information which the author furnishes on these heads                                 is
extremely valuable.        His remarks are acute and sensible; and

  period of a hopeless disease.   The medical man who reflects on
  the distresses that such patients must be liable to during such a
 journey, arrested perhaps in their progress by the increase of
 some of those symptoms which attend the advanced stages of con
 sumption,-in very indifferent accommodations, probably, and
 far from any medical advice in which they can confide,-will
 surely long hesitate ere he condemns the fated victim of this re
 morseless malady to the additional evils of expatriation: And his
 motives for hesitation will be increased, when he considers how
often the unfortunate patient sinks a prey to his disease long be
fore he reaches the place of his destination; or, at best, arrives
at it in a much worse condition than when he left England, and
doomed, shortly, to add another name to the long and melan
choly list of his countrymen that have sought out, with pain and
suffering, a distant country, only to gain in it an untimely gravel
     “In  the foregoing observations I have perhaps viewed mat

 found information; habits of keen observation and persevering
 inquiry; sensible,   candid  and    ingenuous; M. Dupin has
brought with him exactly those qualities which are best fitted to
enable him to form a just appreciation of the merits of our in
stitutions, and to recommend them to the notice of his country
men.     The highly favourable impression left upon us by the vo
lume which he published in 1818, “Sur la Marine, et les Ponts
et Chaussées de France et d’Angleterre,” made us turn with avidity
to two additional volumes embracing the same course of inquiry;
and it is with pleasure we have to record the increased satisfaction
with which we have perused this continuation of his valuable            la
bours.
   The present volumes are devoted to the military branch of our
establishments.     The first relates to the organization of the army
and ordnance; and is especially of a political nature.        The se
cond treats of our military schools, our arsenals, our forts, and
other works of defence; and is accompanied with an atlas of
plates in folio, satisfactory enough in point of accuracy of draw
ing, though inferior in every other respect to the productions of
our own school of engraving.        In this part we meet with a good
deal of matter which is strictly of a scientific nature; and in
some of our future Numbers we shall take an opportunity of
bringing what is of this description more particularly under the
notice of our readers.

that he has broached opinions in these pages which “will ap
pear to the chemist and philosopher not only perfectly new, but
the very contrary of what have been universally admitted, and
on which the fabric of science at present is built.” Mr. P. how
ever entreats a dispassionate investigation of the principles he
has laid down, and this on a ground which might justify a higher
tone of challenge.    “So far as they are sufficient to account for
the  phaenomena   of nature without any exception whatever—so
far  only” does he ask that they should be considered “worthy of
attention.”
   The inquiry embraced by this new theory, is of too general a
character to admit of any justice being done to it within the
space to which our analytical notices of new works is restricted.
We must therefore content ourselves with referring the reader
to the work itself, which he will find at least ingenious in its
conceptions, if not invincible in      its
                                   conclusions, and withal clearly
and well written. The following outline              of

                              ASIATIC SOCIETY,
     On Saturday evening, the 13th Nov. 1819, a meeting of the
 Asiatic Society was held at the Society's apartments in Chouring
  hee, the Marquis of Hastings in the chair.
     The Committee elected for the present year consists of the
  Bishop of Calcutta, Sir E. H. East, Colonel Hardwicke, W. B.
  Bayley, Esq.Vice-presidents; Messrs. G. Swinton, H. Mackenzie,
 J. Bentley, J. Atkinson, G. J. Gordon, Rev. J. Parson, Rev. Dr.
 Carey, Dr. Wallich, and Capt. Roebuck, Committee of Papers:
 Captain Lockett officiates as Secretary during the absence of
 Mr. Wilson from the presidency.
     A letter was read from Dr. MacCulloch, of Baltimore, who
 some time ago presented to the Society his ingenious Essay on
 the Aborigines of America.        He has been induced to make some
 inquiries interesting in the history of the human family, and of
 especial use in the particular investigation he has long been em
 ployed upon, which he has addressed to the members of the
 Asiatic Society. He conceives it highly desirable to obtain further
 descriptions, and, if possible, drawings of the Morias (Hindee,
 Muré) and other monuments to be found in various islands of the
 Pacific Ocean, particularly those of the Friendly, Society, Sand
twich, and Eastern Islands.         The island of Tinian, one of the
 Marianne Islands (see La      Perouse,  and subsequent navigators),
 contains some singular monuments which Dr. MacCulloch says
 are entirely unknown to him, except from the very brief descrip
 tion given of them by Lord Anson in his voyages *.
    * The Jesuit Gobien has published a particular history of the Ladrones,
or Marian Islands. See also the Supplement of De Brosses,       ii.   492, for   an
ample account  of the Ladrones.

  The deities worshipped in the islands of the Pacific he recom
mends as deserving of investigation, no particular account of them
having hitherto appeared.
   Dr. MacCulloch observes, that Gen. Valancy has stated, in the
87th page of his Irish Grammar (Dublin 1781), that the Persians,
instead of intercalating, as is customary, one day every four
years, to adjust their years with the course of the sun, regarded
no hours until they amounted to 30 days, which does not take
place in less than 120 years.  These thirty days were then added
to the year (making a year of 13 months), which year was called
Bihreck.    This mode of intercalation is said by Dr. MacCulloch
to bear a singular resemblance to the method of the Mexicans;
and he is therefore anxious to ascertain, through the medium of
the Society, whether there are any other parts of an astronomical
system to be found among the Persians, to which such a mode of
intercalation would seem properly to belong.
   At the last meeting, Mr. Palmer presented to the Society a
marine production, called the Soonge plant, obtained on the coast
of the newly acquired island of Singapore.    Colonel Hardwicke,
one of the most distinguished naturalists of this country, has fa
voured the Society with a description of         He observes, that   it.

   On the 2d of October he pitched his tent on the crest of the
Brooang Pass, 15,095 feet above the level of the sea. It is                                   si
tuated in lat. 31°23' and long. 78° 12'. The country is secluded,
rugged, and barren, and the villages verythinly scattered, not
more than one or two occurring in a stage. The inhabitants
wear a frock of white blanket, often twofold, reaching down
to the knees, and having sleeves, a pair of trowsers and girdle of
the same, a cap of black blanket like a bonnet, and shoes of which
the upper part is woollen, and the sole alone leather. The peo
ple are very dark and extremely dirty. The villages are generally
 large, and the houses spacious, and even elegant. . They are
built of stone or wood, and either slated or flat roofed ; the last
 is most common.    The temples of the Deotas (Delties) are mag
 nificent, and adorned with a profusion of ornaments.      In Koo
 nawur the crops are extremely poor; and in time of scarcity small
 pears and horse chesnuts, after being steeped in water to take
 away their bitterness, are dried and ground into flour.     Bears
 are very numerous; and the dogs are of a large ferocious breed,
covered with wool, and generally chained during the day, otherwise
it would be dangerous to approach a village. The language dif
fers much from the Hindee, most of the substantives ending in
ing and ung, and the verbs in mig and nig.
    At Rispé he first saw Lamas, and near that place he passed
several tumuli, from 10 to 40 feet in length, two broad, and about
four high. They are constructed of loose stones without cement,
and upon their tops are numerous pieces of slate of            shapes              all
and sizes, carved with strange characters. They are called Mané,
 and are erected over the graves        the Lamas. There are inva

                                        of
 superstitious custom, always leave them         the right hand, and

the Bank to witness the comparison there made on the 4th inst.

Specimen of an Art invented by him to prevent Forgery, and not
having seen the wood-cut limitation, can say nothing respecting
it;  but we have examined the copper-plate Imitation then pro

the Copy produced                 by

seem   that a deduction of A DAY from the hundredth lustrum
was  thus symbolized by the astronomers of Egypt. They knew
full well six hours was too much in addition to the 365 days to
make up the year's complement; therefore by reckoning 366 days
for the fourth year's, an ideal existence of a portion of future
time was assumed: this error they at first considered insignifi
cant as a worm (whether in reference to the chrysalis, or to the
spiral motion of the sun, I am not bold to affirm); but in the
calculation of revolving years the priests of Sol were thoroughly
 versed in the respect due to the great arbiter of time; they
 feigned that deity to avenge the insult offered to his dignity by
 the constant flight of the swift-winged phoenix, but suited the
god's patience with the vain bird's endeavour to the convenience
 of an epoch best adapted for their astronomical renovation of the
 flow of time. The bird of fable was supposed to have out-stripped
 the sun, but before distancing the luminary a full circuit of the
 earth, the orb of light and heat must be repassed. Urged on by
 its ambitious nature the bird persists        the attempt, although

XI. On     the true Measure of a Lunar Cycle, as compared

                                    To
SiR,            true quantity of a mean lunation is obtained by
taking the precise number of days, hours, &c. between two                                             di
stant solar or lunar eclipses, or the known times of new or full
moons, and dividing the elapsed period by the number of luna
tions from the one to the other. By this means, whatever errors
may be committed by stating the times of the mean conjunctions
or oppositions, those errors will become divided among so many
humations, as will render insensible the error of one or any small
number of lunations affected thereby, so that the greater the
distance of time and number of lunations, the precise quantity of
one mean lunation is the more safely ascertained.
   But this measure of time between any two distant eclipses,
conjunctions,  or oppositions of the sun and moon must be limited
within reasonable and well defined bounds, or the calculation
will be subject to fatal mistake. The space of one hundred years
seems preferable   to any smaller number, and is certainly prefe
rable to that of a thousand years. It is on this principle, and on
the indubitable method of computing by the weekly cycle, that
I have attempted to ascertain the mean quantity of a lunation
from an indisputable epoch, one hundred years distant from                                                its
corresponding new moon,        quantity  have stated

   This difference arises from the variation of the lunar quarters,
and the excess of one quarter above another, as I shall show
presently.
    If from   the New moon in September 1801 to the New moon
in September 1820, we would know the exact interval, and con
sequently the mean of 235 lunations, we proceed as before.

   The difference in the aggregate amounts to no more than five
minutes in 19 Julian years, or 6939 days, 18 hours, which con
vincingly shows that this method of calculating by the -lunar
quarters, and bringing their variations into the account, is the
most correct way of ascertaining the true mean quantity sought.
   The aggregate sum of the times between the corresponding
quarters according to the Ephemeris of 1801 and 1820, stands as
follows:

   This difference in 48 cycles or 912 years amounts to six hours,
by which the moon anticipates the sun. Could we proceed in

     This computation so nearly approximates with Julian time,
 that whatever equations may be requisite in conforming it with
 solar tropical time, there is a stability given to the lunar reckon
 ing which cannot fail to recommend it as a basis in all, and espe
cially large calculations, as I shall now explain.
     In 912 Julian years are 48 lunar cycles, and 940 lunar years,
 consisting of 11280 complete lunar months, in which time the
 moon anticipates the sun eight hours, three minutes, 24 seconds.

 three numbers given to find the fourth; viz. 912 : 940 :: 1461 :.

    This measure of a mean lunation corresponds with Julian time
 exactly, and differs not a minute in the lunar cycles and periods
 above named: so that if a table was constructed on this plan,
 eight calendar years would contain 99 synodical months, and
 the sun and moon's place very nearly correspond; this was a
 period of the ancient astronomers, which added to eleven more
 years, constituted the cycle of 19 years, called the Enneadecae
 terida, as I have noted in a former number.
    It is a curious part of historical astronomy to see how philo
 sophers have exercised themselves in these investigations in dif
 ferent ages; and notwithstanding their differences between them
 selves in former and latter times, it is admirable to see how nearly
 the ancient astronomers agree with the moderns in the general
estimate of the lunar motions.

    The principal causes of the disparity of these quantities are
the different quantities       assigned to the solar year, and the        dif
ferent denomination        of years, solar, Julian, or sidereal time. One
second of difference in a cycle of 19 years produces 3 minutes,
55 seconds, and in a period of 912 years amounts to 3 hours,
55 minutes; and one minute in a lunation produces 3 hours,
55 minutes in a cycle of 19 years, and in 912 such years amounts
to 7 days, 20 hours; and if in any quantity the measure of 235

 XII.     Account of the Loss            of the French Ship of Discovery,
           Urania.    By Capt.            Louis De FREyciNET *.
  To His Excellency the              Minister of the Marine and Colonies.
                        Malouine Islands, French Bay, April 22, 1820.
SiR,- Expeditions        of maritime discovery would excite little
interest for those who perform them, were voyages of that kind
accompanied by fewer privations and dangers. Hitherto, in ren
dering an account to Your Excellency of the progress of my voy
age, I have had to speak only of the advancement of my labours,
and of the hopes we had cherished of accomplishing without ac
cident the tedious enterprise we had undertaken; but that power
which smiles at the prudence and the vain projects of men had
ordained that we should undergo at the end of our voyage a very
                                     -
severe trial.
   The corvette Urania will never again enter the ports of
 France.In announcing this misfortune to Your Excellency, I at
the same time feel much satisfaction in informing you, that it did
uot occasion the loss of a single individual, and that the stores,     all

that I could recognise my position with certainty.       I found the
wind had driven us so far to the north, that it would occasion
the loss of much time to seek to return to the south in the Bay
of Good Success,
    I consequently preferred putting into French-bay, Falkland
islands, which Bougainville and Pernetti praise so highly, be
cause I judged that place perfectly proper for the business I had
to perform.
    We were off these islands on the 12th of February: but the
maps I had were so inaccurate, that it was very difficult for me
to determine on what point we were. We arrived, however, at
the mouth of French-bay on the afternoon of the 14th, at which
time the weather was fine, the sea magnificent, and the wind fa
vourable.
    We were trying to double a point which I took for that called
L'Aigle by Bougainville, when some little rocks that we observed
in the offing obliged us to bear up. We sounded continually from
the main chains; and the look-out man, placed on the fore-top
gallant cross-trees, was every moment interrogated. .
    Finally, about three o'clock, when we believed that we had
only to sail into a spacious harbour, the ship was              once                                 all   at
stopped           by
               severe shock, occasioned
                       a                     striking against   sub        by                              a
marine rock; our soundings gave       this time      fathoms    at
                                                                 the                   l'A                  on
starboard and               12   on
                      the larboard side.   By backing      the sails,                            all
we got the corvette afloat again without difficulty.
   We did not     first perceive that the corvette had sprung
                            at                                                                                   a

  On his arrival at Valparaiso he communicated    his discovery to
Captain Sherriff of H. M. S. Andromache, who happened to be
there. Captain S. immediately felt the importance of the com
munication, and lost not a moment in making every arrangement
for following it up; he immediately dispatched the William, with
officers from the Andromache : and in this stage the last letter
from Chili left the expedition, with the most sanguine expecta
tion of success, and ultimate advantages resulting from it: and,
if we are correctly informed, a fully detailed narrative has been
forwarded to Government.
  On taking a cursory view of the charts of the Southern Atlantic
and Pacific Oceans, it will be seen, that though Captain Cook
penetrated to a much higher latitude, and consequently drew his
conclusion from observing nothing but vast mountains of ice, it
will be seen also that his meridian was 45 degrees further to the
west of New South Shetland, leaving a vast space unexplored on
the parallel of 62° between that and Sandwich Land, in longitude
about 28° west. He again made 67° or thereabouts, but in longi
tude 137° to 147° west. Perouse ascended no higher than
60° 30'; Vancouver about 55"; other navigators passing the
Straits of Magellan and Le Maire ; and most of them passing
as close to Cape Horn as possible, in order, as they thought, to
shorten the passage to the Pacific, are circumstances that rea
sonably account for the protracted period to which so important
a discovery has been delayed.

 volcanic dust which fell in the bay of Beema; for on mixing any
 quantity of the same dust with water, it soon sank to the bot
 tom of the vessel containing the water, and formed there a firm
 substance, much the same in colour and consistence as the clay
 like matter which our lead and anchor brought up from the bot
 tom of the bay of Beema. It is necessary, however, to mention,
 that although our lead could not penetrate through the layers of
 clay-like matter then on the bottom of the bay of Beema, our
 anchor did, and, on being heaved up when we left Beema, showed
 us both the soft mud which we had before the great eruption

                      lately perused the Essays on the proximate
mechanical Causes of the general Phaenomena of the Universe, by
Sir Richard Phillips, in which he endeavours to eclipse the                                          im
mortal memory of the illustrious Newton, I have been induced
to offer a few remarks respecting the theory of Sir Richard,
which, like many other systems lately published, has, in my opi
nion, little or no foundation to support                          it.

sult of the angular motion of the planets with that of the gaseous
 medium. If the sun and its circumambient medium was ori
ginally put, or continue to be kept in motion by some unknown
contrivance or internal movement in the body of the sun (as
 Sir Richard conjectures), the plane of the orbits described by the
medium ought to coincide with the plane of the sun's equator.
 But that this was not originally the case, appears evident; a
 convincing proof that this mechanical medium was not originally
put, or continues to be kept in motion, by any fanciful arrange
 ment within itself, such as a perpetual motion of unknown contri
 vance, creating or transferring motion to the respective planets,
satellites, and comets, in the solar system. . In fact, this theory
of the planetary motions is more incomprehensible than that of
gravity.

    Pandoo.         By Captain         F. DANGERFIELD, of the Bombay
    Military Establishment *.
 Before     entering on a description of these caves, a slight sketch
 of the wild, mountainous, woody tract of country in which they
 are situated may perhaps be desirable.
    This mountinous tract is contained between the twenty-second
 and twenty-third degrees of north latitude, ranging for a consi.
 derable extent in the direction of the course of the Nurbuddah,
 leaving however generally an intermediate plain, about ten or
 twelve miles broad, between it and the banks of that river.    In
 this  range few towns or  villages are to be found,  it being for
 the most part peopled by Bheels of the wildest description, few -
 having any fixed habitations.                    -
    In the midst of this range, in north latitude 22° 22' 15", and
 in nearly 75° east longitude, is the small town of Baug, three
 miles and a quarter S. S. E. of which the caves are found.
    The town is situated at the foot of a low range of hills about
 one hundred feet high, which forms the western boundary of a
, pleasant valley extending north and south about three miles, by
  an average breadth of one mile.        It contains, within a sma
  area surrounded  by  a low mud   wall, about four hundred houses,
  At the summit and   extremity  of the range near which it is placed,
  overlooking the town, is a rudely built stone fort now falling fast
  to decay. The ascent to it is by a small footpath very steep.
     Baug is on the road leading from Guzerat to Malwa, by what
  is termed the Oudipoor Pass.       From this place the two roads
  leading into the latter province diverge; one constituting the
  Tanda Gaut to the eastward, the other the Tirrella Gaut, leading
  toe<U+017F>ndore, Oujein, or by Rajghui to the northward: this last is
  by far the best carriage road.
     Previous to these last twenty years of anarchy and desolation
 Baug is said to have contained between two and three thousand
 houses, and to have covered a considerable portion of the plain
 in which it is situated; but, with the exception of two or three
 pagodas, few vestiges now remain to point out        former ex       its
 tent.
    As   atown, however, Baug does not claim any antiquity,                            it
 having risen into importance about         hundred years ago, from
 becoming the occasional residence               of a

about six feet above the top of the caves; and it may here be
observed, that it is solely from this stratum that the rock has
given way beneath, causing the destruction of those caves here
after mentioned.

112             Some Account             of the     Caves near Baug,
has, however, almost entirely given way, leaving the rude con
struction of the column apparent.
    Leaving this first cave, and proceeding southward twenty or
thirty paces by a narrow ledge round a projecting part of the
hill, you enter a second cave, evidently never completed, the
columns being left in a rude state with deep marks of the chisel
still remaining.  This cave is nearly the same in length as the
first, by about half the depth.    It has originally been open in
front, but with the exception of a small part it is now choked up
with large fragments of the hill from above. It contains little
worthy of notice.                                                       -
   Leaving the second cave, and returning by the same road, you
descend the stone stairs, and proceed along the bottom of the
hill southward for about a hundred yards, and then reascend by
a rugged steep footpath to the third cave.                           -
   This cave,  which measures     eighty  feet by sixty, has been  nearly
similar in      its
                arrangement       the first; but

     The above is a slight description of these         caves from a short
visit to them during a day's residence at Baug.
    In the total absence of books, or references of any description,
it would be temerity in me to indulge in any speculations, or
advance any opinion respecting the figures or other parts of these
caves.     This part of the subject I must therefore leave to the
slight sketches which my time enabled me to make.
  - Concerning the origin or use of these caves the natives have
no tradition. They derive their name from the same fabulous
tradition as       all
                    remains      Hindu antiquity. They were exca

the thickest parts consist for the most part                           of

it is generally conical, and is considered as a tomb, or mauso
leuin, containing the remains or any of the reliques, sometimes
only a few hairs, of a Bouddh or Bouddhist saint, to whom the
temple is dedicated.—Another circumstance which marks the
origin and design of the excavations is the number and arrange
ment of the small apartments round the temple, called dookans,
or shops: these we might expect to find in such a place: they
are the cells of the priests, who are always found living in a mo
nastic state round the chief Bouddhist temples in Siam, Pegu,
and wherever the religion exists.  The numerous smaller exca
vations at Kanara have the same object, as well as those at Karli.
There is no trace of the Brahminical mythology in the whole                              ex
cavation, except the mutilated figure of Gunesh at the entrance,
which, as Captain Dangerfield remarks, is evidently of a later
date.   There are no unnatural or distorted human figures, nor
any with many heads or limbs.       The largest temple leading up
to the principal object of veneration at Kanara and Karli is
arched; at Baug it is flat; which might be owing either to
choice, or to a necessity arising from the nature of the stone at
Baug, which seems to be in some places deficient in strength.

120                Observations on the heavy Storm.
Contractor's consumption of Oil (and the same with Gas,
Naphtha, &c. in public Lanterns) in the Winter, and in the
Summer half-years, is very nearly in the proportion of 3 to 2:
Strictly speaking, none other of his heads of Expenditure, differ"
much from an equable rate, throughout the year, viz. Interest"
upon, and wear and tear of his dead Stock, with Cotton, and
Wages to his lamp-lighters: but as these uniform Expenses;
have been said, by experienced Contractors, not to exceed 10 per
cent. or ºth part of the whole of the Contractor's Expenses,
including Oil, the proportions of ºths and #ths, in the Winter and
the Summer Half-years, or ºths in each of the Winter Quarters,
and tº,ths in each of the Summer Quarters, seem proper propor
tions, which the Contractor might draw Money, on Account of the
Annual Sum contracted for; or according to which, any single
Quarter might be separately paid for: and with considerably less
unfairness to either party, than either, simply taking : th of the
yearly sum, as applicable to each Quarter, and # thereof for each
haif-year, as is very commonly done; or than, taking 3rds and
3rd, as the proportions of the Winter and the Summer half-years,
as is said to have been contended for, lately, by a Contractor.

 XVIII.    Some Observations made at Clapham Common, Surrey,
    on the heavy Storm that took place on the Night of Sunday.
    the 30th of July 1820.
                             To Mr. Tilloch.
 S. R, - Havis,        for several years paid some little attention to
meteorology, keeping a daily journal, and recording at stated
hours the pressure and temperature, as well as the general ap
pearance of the atmosphere, you will readily imagine the ex
tremely interesting storm that took place on the 30th of last
                                                                        -
month arrested my attention.
    If the inclosed observations on the same should meet your ap
probation, and be deemed worthy an insertion in-your valuable
 Magazine, your making use of them in that way might possibly
 be gratifying to some engaged in similar pursuits, and would at
 the same time oblige a constant reader.

    The  first of the subjoined accounts is a copy of a letter from
  Captain Henderson, of the ship Hercules, addressed to the editor
  of the Calcutta Journal, dated 15th July 1819.-The second is
, the narrative of a Taheitan woman,     transmitted to a gentleman
  of Sydney (New South Wales) by a correspondent writing from
  the Society Islands, published in the Sydney Gazette of 17th July
   1819.    It will be seen that she names some of the Europeans
  who left the other mutineers of the Bounty, at Otaheite, and
  proceeded with that vessel to Pitcairn's Island, differently from
  other accounts.     By John Main, she seems to mean John Mills;
  by Isaac Madden, Martin; and by Adam Smith, old John
  Adams himself.

built on the island at that  time, so that they could not go off.

on this sugar.         It is less fusible than cane-sugar, and better re
sists decomposition in a raised temperature.            By distillation, it
gives a light white sublimate, and an ammoniacal product, which
shows the presence of azote. This saccharine matter seems on
the first view to have some analogy with sugar of milk; but the
latter (as M. Vogel has observed) is changed by sulphuric acid
into a sugar very soluble in water and in alcohol; and besides,
the sugar of gelatine, when treated by nitric acid, gives no mu
cous acid, but a new species of acid, which I have named the
nitro-saccharine, and will be described in the following para
graph.

                        Of  the Nitro-Saccharine Acid.
**   If nitric acid be poured on sugar of gelatine while still co
loured, it does not appear to dissolve in the cold, but becomes
very white, and the acid appears to take up the colouring mat
ter: if this mixture be then heated, a solution takes place, but
without the evolution of red nitrous vapour, and the effervescence
that occurs when other animal and vegetable matters are heated
with this acid. This nitrous solution being now evaporated.
(slowly towards the end), gives a residue which congeals on cool
ing into a single crystalline mass. This, when pressed between
#.          and re-dissolved, yields the nitro-saccharine acid in purity.
      e quantity of this acid is much more than that of the saccha
rine acid from which it is obtained.              It is very soluble, and
crystallises with the greatest ease in beautiful, colourless, trans
parent, flattened prisms, slightly striated like Glauber's salt. Its
acid and somewhat saccharine taste resembles that of the acid of
tartar. When heated by itself, it puffs up considerably, melts
indistinctly, and gives out a pungent vapour.               It produces no
change on earthy or metallic solutions. With potash, it forms a
super-acid and a neutral salt, both of which crystallise in fine
needles, and have a cooling nitrous taste leaving an after-flavour
of sugar. When thrown on hot coals they detonate like salt
petre.        The nitro-saccharine acid dissolves carbonate of lime
with     strong   effervescence, and the liquor, gently evaporated, en

dcliquesce in the open air, are little soluble in concentrated          al
cohol, melt on hot coals, and then detonate.             This acid forms
with oxide of copper a crystallisable salt unchangeable in the air:

up excessively when heated, melts, and leaves a brown spongy
residue resembling a vegetation.             With oxide of lead it gives a

   These are the properties of some of the salts of this acid, which
appears to be a compound of sugar and gelatine with nitric acid,
and it is remarkable that this kind of sugar has its elements so
intimately combined, as to resist the disorganising power of nitric
acid, which decomposes with evolution of nitrous gas the other
vegetable compounds.

small granular crystals, which do not deliquesce in the air, in
which respect it differs from the nitro-saccharate of magnesia.

regular and abundant supply of animal food, which, before their
general cultivation, could only be supplied during the summer
and autumn months: independently, therefore, of the general
amelioration of every crop in succession from turnips, which may
be derived from their proper cultivation, this circumstance may
be considered as a most valuable consequence of their general
adoption.

    though at my entrance, when I took to the crops on the ground,
    I had no more than ten bushels of wheat and fifteen bushels of
    barley  per acre; and last year I cut thirty-two large waggon
    loads of clover, at two mowings, from seven acres.          I am yet
    unable to  speak of more than  twenty-five  bushels of wheat” per
    acre, because wheat being my last crop, after the application of my
    dung, I have yet had but one crop of wheat from the land since
    it has been cleaned and manured; and in 1816, every body
    knows how the wheat crop failed: but in the present, or any
    future year, I am ready to submit my whole rotation of crops on
    the ground to the inspection of any person or persons the Board
    of Agriculture may appoint to examine them; and as the land
    lies within two miles of Clifton, this may be done with little
    trouble and no expense, by any person resorting there, and after
    wards submit the produce of them, for quantity and quality, to.
    a comparison with any other crops of the same description, un
    der any other culture than what is similar to my own, in the
 united kingdom.

                  CURE FOR THE HYDROPHOBI.A.
  Dr. Lyman Spalding, one of the most eminent physicians of
New-York, announces, in a small pamphlet, that for above these
fifty years the Scutellaria lateriflora L. has proved to be an
infallible means for the prevention and cure of the hydrophobia,
after the bite of mad animals.      It is better applied as a dry
powder than fresh.      According to the testimonies of several
American physicians, this plant, not yet received as a remedy in
any European Materia Medica, afforded a perfect relief in above
a thousand cases, as well in the human species as the brute crea
tion (dogs, swine, and oxen). The first discoverer of the re
medy is not known: Drs. Derveer (father and son) first brought
it into general use.

   M. Lemare, director of the Athenaeum of Languages, has      in
vented a utensil which he calls autoclave.    M. Lemare engages
to dress his dinner in less than half an   hour;  and lately made
the  experiment  with complete   success before a numerous com
pany.     He had put into the vessel a piece of meat, vegetables,
and as much water as is necessary for a dish for five persons.
The vessel was placed over a fire, which was kept up with some
pieces of charcoal.   In 36 minutes the vessel was taken off, and
 left a few minutes to cool; and the reporter affirms, that the
broth was excellent, and the meat thoroughly done. It is not
necessary to open the pot to skim it so much as once during the
boiling; for at the end of the operation the scum is found at the
bottom of the vessel, and does not mix with the broth.        The
advantages of this autoclavian cookery are: 1st, that the soup is
excellent, which is very natural, because the apparatus is herme
tically closed, and nothing therefore is lost. 2d. That the produce
is much increased by the quantity of jelly yielded by the bones.
3d. That the cookery is far more expeditious than in the ordinary
kettles, &c.     This mode of cookery will be highly advantageous
to the   poor in particular. We leave the detailed description of
the autoclave to those journals which are especially devoted to
such subjects.     If satisfactory and repeated trials confirm the
utility of the invention, it will become highly important in        its
results, asit will then beevident that cooking may    be

was in the chain, and, what is singular, the dog would never
before allow any poultry to come within his reach: but in this
case he laid aside              all
                      his former animosity, and received his new
acquaintance with every mark        affection.    The goose finding

in the centre    which, among
                          of    the  straw,  she made her nest and
deposited her eggs, which was not known till one          the family                                of

                       THE GREAT ECLIPSE.
                    [From the Norfolk Chronicle.]
  Sir,   The  eclipse,  which is fast approaching, will take place
on the 7th of  September    next, being the largest visible on this
part of the globe previous to the solar eclipse which will happen
in the year 1847. The particulars of this eclipse are calculated
 for the meridian of Norwich, and which are as follows, viz. Be
 ginning of the eclipse 0 ho. 29 min. 25 sec. P.M. visible con
junction l ho. 55 min. 40 sec. true ecliptic conjunction l ho.
 56 min. 48 sec. greatest obscuration l ho. 58 min. 10 sec.
 Eclipse ends 3 ho. 21 min. 55 sec. Total duration of the eclipse
 at Norwich, 2 ho. 52 min. 30 sec. Digits eclipsed 10 deg. 50
 min. on the sun's north limb.
  At Yarmouth and Lowestoft,       1 min. 46 sec. must be added;
but at  Lynn,  34 min. must be deducted from the time at Nor
wich, in order to obtain the respective times at the above places.
   Owing to the moon being nearly at her greatest distance from
the earth, her apparent diameter will be less than that of the
sun; consequently, where central, a beautiful annulus, or ring of
                                                                  a the
light, will present itself, of about one twenty-ninth part of

                                 The Great Eclipse.                                             155
sun's diameter, surrounding the moon's dark body. But in no
part of Great Britain will this appearance be visible. The cen
tral eclipse will commence at 12 ho. 54 min. 40 sec. apparent
 time at Greenwich, in lat, 81 deg. 39 min. 30 sec. north—and
long. 149 deg. 33 min. west of Greenwich. The sun will be cen
 trally eclipsed on the meridian at l ho. 8 min. 15 sec. in lat. 76
 deg. 6 min. 20 sec. north—and long. 17 deg. 3 min. 20 sec.
 west.    It will traverse the supposed polar basin and the north
 east coast of Greenland; the object of so much curiosity at the
 present time; so that if the discovery ships, which sailed in 1818,
 viz. the Dorothea, Captain Buchan and Lieut. Morrel, and the
 Trent, Lieutenants Franklin and Beechey, to the Pole direct,
 should chance to be in those parts, they may probably observe
 the eclipse in those high northern latitudes, as may also the na
vigators returning from the Greenland Whale Fishery, should they
 not be home at the time.
    The centre of the moon’s shadow, after quitting the coast of
 Greenland, passes a little to the west of Mayness's Island; it
thence proceeds up the North Sea, about midway between the
 Shetland Isles and the coast of Norway, leaving every part of
Britain to the west. It thence enters the Continent of Europe, be
tween Embden and the Weser, and in crossing the Confederation
of the Rhine it passes by Cassel, Wurtzburg, and Munich. It
 thence crosses a part of Italy, and enters the Gulf of Venice be
tween Venice and Trieste, and proceeding in                   track itsleaves          it

world, first came in at the south pole of the earth about S8 years
after the Conquest, or in the last of King Stephen's reign, since.

the earth at the North Pole, A.D. 2000, whence no more returns
of this eclipse will take place from the latter period till after a

   M. Encke, Assistant Director of the Observatory at Gotha, has
traced out the track of the comet which appeared in 1786, 1795,
1805 and 1819.      It is by means of an ellipsis of an uncommon
form, if not absolutely unique, that the orbit of this body (rather
to be reckoned among the planets than comets) has been traced.
That this body is not self-luminous, may be considered as fully
ascertained.   That the tail or radiance emanating from         was                                          it,

   The increased weight is ascribed to the oxidizement of the
metals during the analysis.     As observed by the author (Ann.
de Chim. et de Phys. xiii. 441) the above stone is remarkable,
not only from the absence of nickel, but on account of the pro
portions of the other contents, the sulphur and magnesia being
much less, and of the alumina and lime greater than usual. The
author also suggests that the presence of chrome rather than of
nickel should be considered as characteristic of meteoric stones.

XXVI. A       Review of some leading Points in the Official Cha
     racter and Proceedings of the late President of the Royal So
     ciety.         By A CoRResponDENT.
[The writer of the following Review relies upon the established liberality
  and candour of the Editor of the Philosophical Magazine, when he trans
  imits for insertion in that valuable publication an article which may, pro
    bably, run counter to the usual train of his own sentiments and feelings.
    The main object of the writer is to enable the members of   one of the most
    honourable of British Institutions, by a calm retrospect of past occur
    rences to diminish the evil effects which have resulted from them, as well
    as to prevent the recurrence of similar practical errors in future.     He
    has advanced nothing as facts, but what he has carefully verified ; and as
    he wishes those facts alone to make their due impression, he does not
    think it necessary to accompany them with his name.]
The Royal    Society, as Chamberlayne remarks, “chose for                                                         its

   164    A Review  of some leading Points in the Official Character
  by mere theory, but most valued and most promoted those
  sciences which rested on the firm basis of fact.      With the ex
  ception that he had no relish for poetry, he had a well formed
  taste; and he was a man of extensive reading and of deep re
  flection. He was not too much of a philosopher to be ashamed
  of avowing his belief in a divine revelation; but read and thought
  much on the momentous subject of religion.       He maintained for
  some time an active correspondence with the celebrated          Mi
  chaelis, who addressed to him some valuable letters, in Latin,
  on Daniel's Prophecy of the seventy weeks, which Sir John pub
  lished in 1773.
      During the six years that Sir John had the honour of being
  President of the Royal Society, he adopted the practice of de
  livering an oration on the assignment of Sir Godfrey Copley's
  medal to the author of some valuable invention or discovery.
  He was led to this almost entirely by accident; but the addresses
  thus delivered, being intended to point out what was actually
  due to the individual who received the medal, by showing what
  had been effected before in the same department of research,
 became exceedingly valuable as brief historical disquisitions; and
 being each directed to a different topic of inquiry, they evinced
 such an extent and variety of reading, such a correctness of
 judgement, and such a freedom from bias or partiality, as were
  at once honourable to him, and to the Society who had elected
 such a President.      Of  these discourses the 1st was “On the
 different kinds of air,” delivered November 30, 1773, on the
 assignment of the Copleian medal to Dr. Priestley: the 2d,
 “On the Torpedo,” in 1774, on presenting the medal to Mr.
  Walsh: the 3d, “On the attraction of mountains,” in 1775,
 on presenting the medal to Dr. Maskelyne for his observations
 at Schehallien: the 4th, “On preserving the health of mari
 ners,” delivered in 1776, on assigning the medal to Captain
 Cook: the 5th, “On the invention and improvements of the
 reflecting telescope,” in 1777, on assigning the medal to Dr.
 Mudge of Plymouth: the 6th and last, “On the theory of gun
 nery,” was delivered on the day of his resignation, when he pre
 sented the medal in the name of the Society to Dr. Hutton of
 Woolwich, on account of his important experiments on that sub
Jiect.
     Diversified as were the topics of these discourses, their author
 seems “at home” in each.         His researches were often erudite;
his remarks ingenious and solid, sometimes profound; his lan
guage elegant and perspicuous, occasionally passing into a stream
 of genuine eloquence which really enchants and captivates the
reader.
     Sir John was a man not merely of scientific, but of high moral
                                                           character.

 ofintemperance. His manners were kind, respectful and obliging:
 but, says one               of      his
                         biographers, “his sense       integrity and                             of
 dignity would not permit him        adopt that false and superficial
                                                              to

                             men alike, though ever      different                                   so                     in
 point    of

 lity and kindness.”
     Such was Sir John Pringle.                                   Let me now attempt                       to   delineate
 the character of his successor.
       Sir Joseph BANKs (born 1743, elevated        the rank     baronet              to                    of
     1781,) was             good fortune, and

 166       A    Review of some leading               Points in the Official Character
      Almost immediately  after Mr. Banks's return from this
northern voyage, he began to take an active part in some of the
measures then carrying on in the Royal Society; and on the
resignation of Sir John Pringle, in November 1778, he was ap
pointed to succeed him. The world began anxiously to inquire
what were his requisites for this exalted station; but did not
then receive a very satisfactory answer.   He was known to be a
man of enterprise and of strong passions; a warm friend while
his friends were subservient to his purposes, and, if otherwise,
what Dr. Johnson denominated          good hater.”  “a

toriously fond of farming, fond of grazing, fond of gardening,
fond of “damming and sinking *,” and fond of domineering:
these, however, were qualifications for the office so dubious that
the public naturally sought for something more.        What, they
asked, has he published? Where are the volumes that bear his
name * When they were answered “No-where,” they asked
again, What are his pamphlets, and on what subjects        Where
are his papers in the Philosophical Transactions of the Society
over which you have appointed him to preside, and on what do
they treat?    To these and such inquiries no answer could then
be returned: and if similar questions were now to be proposed,
his friends would have little else to say, except they felt inclined
to exult in his little Essay on blight, and perhaps a diminutive
disquisition or two on the manufactory of gooseberry-wine, or
something like            it,

Royal Society?    This train, intricate and involved as it has
usually been deemed, it will not now be difficult to explore.

every one knows, made by the celebrated Dr. FRANKLIN; and,
at an age of the world when this country was agitated by       the                                              all

174    A  Review  of the Character, &c. of Sir    Joseph Banks.
    In proof of this charge, we are told that during the twelve
weeks which, according to the statutes, the certificate recom
mending a candidate hung up in the Society's rooms, it was the
habit of Sir Joseph to prejudice the minds of those who attended
the Soho Square levees, by making known his resolution in
phraseology not very courtly, but suited to the purpose and
varied to accord with the occasion.        “We want no mathema
ticians.”   “No more    worshippers    of old Cardan for me.” “I’ll
have no schoolmasters.”      “Let us have no country surgeons.”
“He why he is an author / Who could think of proposing
him 2 We want no authors;” and so on. If these, and similar
remarks, scattered with great activity during the twelve weeks'
probation, seemed likely to <U+017F>ail in their effect, then “the Presi
dent would run about the room on a night of election, out of
breath with anger and impatience, seducing the ignorant, awing
the timid, and deceiving the wise; cajoling as many as possible
to put in black-balls:” and often “inducing the candidate, or
his friends from an apprehension of rejection, to avoid the mor
tification by taking down the certificate.”
    Among the candidates rejected principally by black-balling, in
the years 1781, 1782, and 1783, were, Mr. Henry Clarke, of
Manchester; Mr. Meyrick (who was black-balled by the Presi
dent asking more than 100 persons in the room to vote against
him, an ascertained fact); Dr. Bates, a physician at Bucking
ham; Dr. Hallifax; Dr. Enfield (here the cry was, “I’ll have
no Dissenters”); Dr. Beerenbrock and Dr. Blane, two eminent
physicians; and Major Desbarres, the friend and maritime tutor
of Captain Cook. Shortly after the “black-balling” of this
latter named gentleman, the following paragraph appeared in
the public papers:
                                                          -
    “Yesterday Major Desbarres kissed His Majesty's hand on
being appointed Governor of Nova Scotia.           This reward, we
hear, has been conferred on this able and spirited officer, for
great national services, in recompense of much time and much
 money, for having saved by his philosophical labours, many of
 the king's ships, and the lives of many of our fellow subjects.”
    The preceding list of exclusions serves to prove, that in the
early portions of Sir Joseph's reign, his antipathy was not merely
 to mathematicians.

               following Essay was written in December 1816,
              to explain the aurora borealis in connexion with a
                                                                             Glasgow, Sept. 23, 1820.
beautiful phaenomenon seen at Glasgow and most parts of the
country on the evening of the 24th September in the above year,
and also on the 11th September 1814.          I had for several years
before the above  periods  entertained an    opinion as to the cause
of the aurora lorealis, entirely different from that generally held.
The phaenomenon alluded to was an illumined arch similar to
the rainbow, only colourless, and formed in a clear serene sky.
This arch I may say demonstrated itself to have the same origin
as the common     aurora borealis; for towards the conclusion it fell
to pieces, and assumed the usual appearance of streamers. This
last circumstance fully confirmed me in my opinion as to the cause
of those phenomena, and I wrote at that time the annexed paper,
but never published                  it.

                           On the Aurora Borealis.
  It has long been a generally received opinion, that the aurora
borealis is the exhibition of immense masses of the electric
fluid in vacuo, or at least at sucha height that the atmosphere
is in an extremely rarefied state.  No circumstance connected
with these phaenomena seem however to favour that opinion,
much less to warrant the unreserved manner in which it has been
adopted.
     The following questions may be proposed, to show how little
is known concerning those phaenomena.
   Why is their appearance confined to particular times of the
year and of the night?
   Why are they always seen in a particular quarter of the
heavens 2
    Why do they in general assume the particular form and po
sition observable, rather than any other
    Why are they under           all
                             their various appearances different                                    in

to   that  of streamers, the former being determined           known                  by

                                               to

                                 such motion?
    Streamers are said        often accompanied with
                                to   be                    hissing                   a              or

                                        borealis, it is the object,
  mion respecting the cause of the aurora
  in what follows, to endeavour in few words to account for the
  phaenomena     in question, so as to remove the objections and fur
  mish answers to the questions above stated.
      It is generally at or near the time of the equinoxes that those
  lights make their appearance in these latitudes, at which times
  the sun's rays would be tangents to the poles of the earth, were
  they not disturbed by the refractive power of the atmosphere.
    *y the refraction, it is obvious that the rays will extend to a cer
  tain point beyond the pole, on the side opposite to the sun, when
  they must of course fall on the immense accumulation of ice
  within the polar circle, and will be reflected with great brilliancy
  towards the darkened hemisphere, undergoing in their course
  another refraction, which bends them still more southward; and
*as the atmosphere possesses also the power of reflecting light,
  those rays will finally fall back on the earth, and will at a certain
  angle and within certain limits be visible to                     its
                                                          inhabitants.
      What      here advanced accounts satisfactorily and with sim
                 is
  plicity for those phaenomena, and also for the annual and diur
  nal times       their appearance.

 180                 An Attempt         to explain the Phaenomenon
 assigned seems adequate.      Many of the movements, however,
 may be the effect of a change from one reflecting surface to an
 other which presents a different angle; for sometimes there seems
 to be a succession of different streamers, at other times only a
 lateral motion to and fro of the same streamer.
    The illumined arch which appeared on the 24th September
last, and that on 11th September 1814, were evidently a modi
fication of the aurora borealis, because they proceeded from the
same quarter of the heavens, and in both cases were resolved into
the ordinary appearance assumed by those phaenomena. These
facts, besides proving the latter position, go far to prove the ge
neral theory here advanced.       If every circumstance connected
with the enlightened arches is duly considered, a doubt can
scarcely be entertained concerning their cause. Their form, po
sition, motion, and time of appearing,                       pointing

bable that the surface from which they were reflected was that
of  the ocean, which stretches       the directionin    which the sun                in
was   during  their  appearance.   But later        the evening, when      in
that uniform surface had passed out     the line             of                       of direction       by

                     It          be
                           obvious, that without the refractive power
of  the atmosphere those phaenomena could have                   existence,                no

the different stations of observation by the observed angle of ele
vation, these intersections will be the height of the arch at such
places.    The above method would not apply so well to common
streamers; but when stationary for a time, circumstances might
be determined concerning them by those or similar observa
tions.
   It is to be observed, that a circumstance has been noticed
in high northern latitudes, which cannot be accounted for other
wise than by supposing an extraordinary degree of refraction to
exist in the polar regions.          The circumstance is the appearing
of the sun above the         horizon,    many days before that luminary
could be expected from the relative position of the earth at the
time, with only the quantity of refraction usually allowed. What
ever is the cause of the increased refraction at the north pole, it
will greatly affect those phaenomena, and must be ascertained at
least before their height can be accurately found. I believe the
cause commonly, and perhaps truly, assigned for the great re
fracting power above noticed, is the dense state of the attuosphere
produced by extreme cold : there is however no certainty that
the singular state which causes mock suns, landscapes, &c. in
the air, may not be concerned here.
   It may be asked, If the cause of the aurora lorealis is as above
explained, why are they not always visible at the two periods be
fore mentioned         The answer                     is,

   For the lowest magnifying power, the whole of the tubes must
be shut up; and when the magnifying power is to be increased,
the smallest of the sliding tubes, A, must be drawn out to either
of the numbers engraved upon it; care being taken not to draw.
out any part of the other sliding tubes, B and C, until the whole
of the first, A, is pulled out; the second tube, B, may then be
drawn out to either of the numbers engraved thereon ; and in
like manner the third tube.     The numbers denote the magni
fying power of the telescope.
   To    change the power, for any less power than the one to
which the tubes have been drawn out, the reverse of the above
described mode of proceeding must be observed; and the largest.
tube must be returned first, and so on, until they have been
brought back to the number required.      Each alteration of the
magnifying power will require a new adjustment of the pinion;
and as the magnifying power is increased, the distance between
the eye-glass and the object-glass must be diminished.

XXX.     Description of the Mooring Blocks now used in Ports
       mouth Harbour.    By Mr. J. PARK of Portsmouth *.
                                           Portsmouth-yard,   March 25, 1818.
Gºrizºns,—I              TRUST    that the communication which              I   am
about to lay before you will not be deemed altogether undeserv
ing your notice.
   In October 1795 I was appointed junior master attendant of
Portsmouth yard; and as the security of his majesty's ships and
all works on float relative thereto are in the master attendant’s
department exclusively, I applied myself as much as possible to
gain a thorough knowledge of the harbour, as well as of the na
ture of the security and disposition of the moorings; and the more
I became acquainted therewith, the less satisfied I was with the
method by which the ground-chain was secured, as a national
evil attended      it,
                    and various other inconveniences     the public
                                                                 to
service.
      The evil alluded    to   was that   of   throwing some thousand tons
   *    From the Transactions    ofthe Society for the Encouragement     Arts,
                                                                           of
 Manufactures, and Commerce, vol. xxxvi. The gold medal          ofthe Society
 was presented    to Mr. Park for this great improvement respecting harbours
 for king's ships; and   a model  of the contrivance  is preserved    the So
                                                                      in
 ciety's Repository.
                                                                                O
                                                                                f

                 now used in Portsmouth    Harlour.             189
of shingle ballast annually on what is called the claws of the
moorings to render them secure, which ballast was by the wash
of the tide carried into the bed of the harbour and lakes where
the ships ride.
    Having arrived at the head of my department in April 1812,
1 ventured humbly to recommend to the honourable Navy Board
considerable alterations in the arrangement of the moorings,
which would not only tend to improve the harbour by giving
more space in the lower part, where the same was required for
ships to pass and repass, but also afford accommodation to a
 greater number of them than hitherto could be laid up : the re
 commendation being favourably received, I was directed to pro
 ceed accordingly.
     These alterations were effected; but the great and growing
 evil of filling up with ballast a harbour already too shallow, still
 continued, and produced an anxious wish for some substitute for
 the claw, by which the application of shingle ballast might be dis
 continued.      I was accordingly induced to make several experi
 ments, and after various trials, I submitted to the Navy Board a
 model of a cast-iron Mooring Block which appeared to promise
 fair to do away every objection arising from the method of se
 curing the ground chain, being at once a substitute both for
 claws and mooring anchors.
     The Board directed two to be cast of such form and weight as
 I wished, and when received in the yard, trials to be made to -
 ascertain what degree of resistance they possessed.
     When received, trials were made under the inspection of se
 veral experienced and distinguished naval officers, and the prin
 cipal officers of the dock-yard; which proving satisfactory,     in
 duced me to address the Navy Board on the 2nd of November
  1814, detailing my sentiments, &c. relative to Portsmouth har
 bour, and the moorings, accompanied by accurate statements
 of the trials made with the blocks, copies of which I have an
 nexed hereto, having first obtained the Board's permission to
 do so.                                                               -
     A trial being ordered on a lighter block, and proving equally
 satisfactory, directions were shortly after given for their general
 adoption, to the exclusion of every thing hitherto used for se
 curing moorings, and a contract immediately entered into for
  the supply of them.
     The superiority of the block in question over both claws and
  anchors is manifest; it will last for ages without repair, will re
  sist much greater power than either, and will completely obviate
  the use of shingle ballast to render the mooring secure, (which
  must hitherto have been extremely injurious to the harbour,) as
                                                                   On

bury itself more and more under the surface until             becomes
fixed;   it likewise free from liability

chors, and the moorings thereby rendered insecure; which has
been the case hitherto,      represented      my letter
                                              as            the Board       in                       to
above  quoted.
 I   now beg leave     notice the Mooring Blocks
                                    to                       economi                            in     an
cal point        of
             view.
   The largest blocks, adapted for first-rates' moorings, are now
supplied for less than half the sum required          provide and fix                     to
what    termed
       is          claw, and about
                           a          quarter    the cost     a moor                 of                 of     a
ing anchor.
  It    must also be considered  that both the anchor and claw
                                               forty
                                to be
would require       replaced
                        to       the course            fifty years,
                                                        in                           of            or
(supposing them     remain  undisturbed,)  besides which the claw
would require frequent repair from the effect    the worm during                          of
that period.
   On the blocks already laid down       this port (although prin   at
cipally     as
          substitutes for claws) there arises  saving     the public                 a               to
of   upwards          of   3,000l.; and where                       it      may          be    necessary              to    lay
them down instead                       of    anchors,         the          saving         will        be      infinitely
greater.
  It may not   amiss    be  mention, that    toopinion prevailed that           an

                                                         Portsmouth-yard,    Nov. 2, 2814.
   HoNoun ABLE siRs,     Having from my first appointment to
Portsmouth-yard as junior master attendant, dedicated as much
time and attention as in my power towards acquiring a thorough
knowledge of the harbour, both as to the depth of water and
quality of the ground, and also to the method of preparing and
laying down moorings, together with any improvements that
might be made, either for their security or for increasing their
numbers by a more advantageous arrangement, or by laying
down additional ones where found practicable:
     have in the course of my practice (which has been now up
     I
wards of 19 years) experienced many inconveniences, which I
have long conceived might be removed by making some alteration
in the manner of securing the ground-chain.
   I have likewise been of opinion from an early period after my
appointment, that many advantageous alterations might be made
among the moorings in various parts of the harbour, as well as
that new moorings might be laid down both for ships of the line
and frigates in the different lakes; and having submitted the same
to your Honourable Board by letters of the 30th April 1812, and
26th July 1814, was directed by your warrants of the 8th May
 1812, and 28th July 1814, to carry the propositions into effect:
in consequence of which, several alterations have been made, and
many new moorings laid down, and much may yet be done when
the other duties of the port will admit: but as I am preparing a
plan of the harbour, which will show the alterations, &c. much
plainer than any written description, I shall decline saying more
at present, and endeavour to describe the manner of securing the
ground-chain, with the inconveniences alluded to.
   The ground-chain of                  all
                              the swinging moorings         the harbour     in
is secured as follows:
   One end     fixedis   what to  termed    claw, namely,

wood, with        iron ring

which claw      buried below the surface from

                                                    as                                      at
spring tides     circumstances will admit, with piles driven
                      as                                              the            in
front, and when completed, the mud which has been removed                                   is
thrown on the claw so as        cover it. to

   The other end             of
                       the chain      secured      is mooring anchor,
                                                                 a
namely, two anchors         about 70 cwt. each,
                                   of                   one stock, with
                                                                     in

192                     Description            of the Mooring           Blocks
of that description, together with the liability of the mooring
anchors, from their construction, to be hooked by the transports'
anchors, much inconvenience, labour and risk have been expe
rienced, and many instances have occurred when it has been
necessary to take up a mooring from end to end, in consequence
of ships having hooked the mooring anchor, and, regardless
of every thing but the recovery of their own anchors, have hove
down unobserved in the night-time at low-water, and by the rise
of tide forced the mooring anchor out of the ground; nor did
I ever find one so displaced, when taken up, entire; but, on the
contrary, one anchor has been lying across the other, the stock
broken or gone, or the chain foul of the flooks, and I have seen
instances when the mooring anchors have been completely upset
 and found with the flooks uppermost.          Having described the
 swinging moorings, and also what I humbly consider objections
 to the anchors, and the principal inconveniences arising there
 from (I say principal, because there are others, particularly where
 the anchors         shoal water, the frequency
                         lie   in                    their being               of                       in

the cable between the anchors became taught, when it was found
necessary to increase the power, which being done, both anchors
started, and continued to come home, until the superiority of

    one of 23 cwt. instead, at the distance of 15 fathoms behind the

became    fixed, but the anchors had drawn 13 feet, and kept

Such mixture I have kept several days, occasionally renewing the
chlorine as it became absorbed by the water, and have not ob
served any diminution in the bulk of the carbonic oxide.       In                                                  all

produced by the more intense light of the Voltaic battery, and                                                                      I
placed the tube containing the mixed gases in a darkened room,
within about an inch of the charcoal points connected with au
apparatus  of one hundred pairs of plates highly charged: upon
making the contact, the effect of the light upon the mixed gases
was very remarkable; fumes of muriatic vapour were instantly
produced, the water rose in the tube in consequence of the pro
duction of muriatic acid, and in about five minutes the absorption,
was entire; but the most curious circumstance was, that in two
instances an explosion of the gases took place the moment they,
felt the impulse of the electric light.
    12. As I have in no case been able to produce an analogous.
effect by any other terrestrial light, however intense, I cannot but
consider the phaenomenon as dependent upon some peculiar pro
perty belonging to the rays of solar and electric light.
   The lunar rays produce no effect upon mixed chlorine and hy
drogen, nor upon chloride of silver ; neither was the whiteness
of the latter in the slightest degree impaired by the most power
ful luminous focus that I could obtain from an olefiant gas flame.
    13. In some experiments connected with the subjects of this
communication, I have availed myself of a photometric thermo
meter, acting upon the principle of that described by Mr. Leslie,
but infinitely more sensible : it is constructed nearly in the same
way as the differential thermometer, but instead of containing air,
the balls are filled with the vapour of ether, and the stem contains
a column of that liquid; it thus forms a very delicate differential.
thermometer.       To convert it into a photometer, the upper bulb
is covered with a thin coating of India ink, and the lower one with
silver or gold leaf; the whole instrument is then placed in a pei
lucid glass tube: when taken out of        case the influence     light      its                                        of

 opinion, and shows that the observations of Dr. Bradley give
 the same result both in summer and winter.   His own observa
 tions also tend to the same conclusion. The observations of Dr.
 Maskelyne, of M. Oriani, of M. Arago, and of Mr. Pond, are in
 opposition    to these ; to which my own may be added.
    It is not likely that this difference really exists; but it is a ques
 tion of some      importance     in astronomy, and the explanation
 thereof   may   throw some    light on other points.
    It is probable the difference arises from some unknown modifi
 cation of refraction.    I find, and I believe other observers have
 found the   same, that at the winter solstice, an irregularity of re
 fraction takes place  for the sun greater than for the stars, at the
 same zenith distance.      The zenith distance of the sun at this
 place is then nearly 77°.
    What Mr. Bessel has adduced certainly tends to render the
 prevalent opinion doubtful.      It therefore appears to me of con
 sequence, that astronomers should pay attention to the observa
 tions at the winter solstice. My observations at that time have
 been much fewer than in the summer, because, on account of
 the uncertainty of refraction, I considered them of less im
                                                      -
 portance.
    It has been proposed to make the two results agree, by an                 in
 crease of the quantity of Bradley's mean refraction; but this
 could not be done without increasing it by a quantity greater
 than can be justified by other determinations respecting refrac
tion.    -
   Considering then this uncertainty respecting the observations
of the winter solstice, it appears better to compare the results
from Dr. Bradley's summer solstices, with the result as deduced
from the mean of the observations of different astronomers.

  The mean of 18 observations near the winter solstice gives me
mean obliquity Jan. 1, 1813, 23° 27' 48", 14.
  The above determination of the obliquity by observations
near the summer solstice gives (taking the annual dininution
0",43),
   Mean obliquity Jan. 1, 1800–23° 27' 56”,0, differing only 1”
from that assumed in M. Delambre's tables of the sun. And as
far as my own observations are concerned, the difference does not
exceed half a second.
   In M. Zach's solar tables, there is given a determination of the
obliquity of the ecliptic computed by M. Gerstner, from a mean
of a great many observations of Dr. Maskelyne's, made at 19
summer solstices.    Although the results of the several solstices
are rather discordant, more so than was to be expected from a
fixed instrument, yet it is likely a mean of 173 observations can
not be far from the truth.                                       -
                 This mean is 23° 28' 11”,0 for 1769,
   when reduced to 1800, is 23 27 57, 7,
which agrees sufficiently near with the present determination, to
show that, if the necessary corrections for the sun's latitude, &c.
had been used, the result would probably have been very exact.
   The mean of 102 observations at 17 winter solstices computed
by M. Gerstner, gives for 1769–23°28'3”; a result which,
after making   all
                 possible allowances for the error   the quadrant,
                                                         of
is considerably less than that deduced from the summer solstices.

                                                   at
then the instrument was reversed, and observations made after
the passage. The results were carefully reduced      the meridian;

the  upper  and lower limbs     being observed, the zenith distance
of the centre was deduced from the instrument itself. This fa

    In the paper which I had the honour of presenting to the Royal
 Society last year, I mentioned my doubts as to the quantity of
 the maximum of the aberration of light; and that, as far as could
 be ascertained from Dr. Bradley's Wanstead observations with a
 zenith sector, we ought rather to adopt 20",00 than 20°,25.
 I also mentioned that it would be desirable to investigate this
 point, and therefore during the last year, I instituted a course of
 observations for this purpose, and I beg leave to offer the results

     By these the maximuli, appears to be 20",80, which is much
greater than I had expected. While these observations were
 going forward, Mr. Bessel's work above mentioned was pub
 lished.   From several investigations in the Greenwich observa
 tions of Dr. Bradley, he also deduced the maximum =20",70,
nearly.    These results certainly appear extraordinary, and are
not likely to be acknowledged by astronomers, unless they shall
 be established by a great number of observations.
     My results were computed with great care, allowances being
made for the ellipticity of the earth's orbit.       It is not likely,
supposing the velocity of the light of                                                           be

   Those instruments which admit of observing each star, with
out a reference to other stars, seem best adapted thereto. It is
not  likely that the maximum of aberration differs in different
stars; yet this ought not to be taken for granted.
     The mean N.P.D. Jan.           deduced from former obser
                                          1, 1818,
vations, have been put down as a proof of the consistency of my
instrument. § Ursae Majoris is the only star in which the dif
ference is worth notice. Whether this difference is from the
error of observation, or from any uncertainty in the proper mo
tion of the star, it is difficult to say. Three results reduced by
Bradley's refraction are as follow.

   A comparison of independent results is for many reasons much
to be desired. I offer the above principally with a view of calling
the attention of astronomers to such investigations.
   It appears to me, that the only method by which an explana
tion of the difficulties that have occurred, from a comparison of
the Greenwich observations and of those made at this Observa
tory, can be obtained, is from an extensive series of observations
of many stars, referring each to the apparent zenith point. I
am therefore pursuing such a course of observations.       Conclu
sions as to the existence or non-existence of parallax, from com
parisons of the relative places of stars taken indiscriminately,
must be liable to much uncertainty, whether the comparisons be
made by polar distances or by right ascensions.       The former.
being affected by the uncertainty of refraction, may, at first view,
be thought more subject to error than the latter; but a careful
consideration of the circumstances attending the latter method,
will show that it has          its
                           peeuliar difficulties*.

Astley Cooper, Rev. W. Crowe, John Leslie, Dr. Richard Pear
son, W. Symonds, and William Thomas, were engaged; but whe
ther all, or any of these Gentlemen furnished any Articles, we are
uninformed.
   We have been sorry to observe, the Date 1819 affixed to the
Title-page of each of the 39 Volumes, instead of that parti
cular Year, in which each Volume was finished; because of the
great number of discoveries and improvements in the useful Arts
and the Sciences, which have been, for the first time, submitted
to the Public, or at least in so methodized a form, in the Volumes of
this Work, by the many able, practical, and scientific Individuals,
who have written Articles in them ; the want of these Dates to
the Volumes, can scarcely fail to be the source of much literary
injustice, and of high regret by the future historians of Scientific
Improvement. We trust therefore, that our Readers will approve
our giving here, a List, containing the Dates of Publication, of
each of the 85 Parts of this extensive Work; and to which we
have affixed the name, of the last Article contained in each of
such Parts.

   Two very considerable improvements have been lately made
in the severe operation of cutting for the stone.—The high ope
ration, as it is called, in such repute in France, will probably be
revived,  in consequence of Mr. Carpue's meritorious exertions
to introduce it into this country, after making himself master of
the evidence for the practice by several visits purposely to Paris,
as set forth in his publication, as well as by actual practice.
Further, Sir Everard Home, with great candour, has performed
the operation several times at St. George's Hospital, with suc
cess, and has made an improvement, which will probably be de
cisive in favour of the high operation as recorded in the next
coming volume of the Philosophical Transactions. On the other
hand, Mr. Earl has made considerable improvements in the       in
strument for breaking the stone in the lateral operation, in those
cases in which it is too large for any opening for extraction to
be made with safety.         By these improvements, the surgical
world must feel highly gratified, and they will now have the
option of determining by experience the advantages and disad
vantages of the two modes in question.
             SPONTANEOUS SEPARATION       OF WARTS.
   In the New (French) Journal of Medicine, Dr. Cheneau -
                                                               re
lates the following singular case:
   “Numerous warty excrescences had long occupied the hands
of a hysterical, highly susceptible lady aged forty-four. On the
night following the decease of her husband, an event by which
she was deeply affected, they    all
                                separated, leaving the spots which
they had occupied wrinkled, but without induration.”
   This fact reminds me     of
                             a  case that came  to my own know
ledge many years ago   in  Scotland. Some silver spoons having
been mislaid, were supposed       have been stolen, and some ex

found to have changed to a pure white during the night.—The

                  MACHINE FOR RAISING WATER.
  A  simple  machine has, it is said, been perfected by a gentle
man of    Shropshire, for raising water from the holds of ships
                                   --
and for  supplying reservoirs, which, by means of a small weight,
will raise a column of water at the rate of 15 quarts per minute,
to the height of 100 feet, and so on, in proportions, double, triple,
or quadruple columns of water, to double, triple, and quadruple
heights.
      LESLIE’s hygroMETER EMPLOYED to AscERTAIN the
                            STRENGTH OF SPIRITS.
  Mr. W. Ritchie, of Perth, has proved by some late experi
ments that there exists a uniform ratio between the cold induced
by evaporation (from the bulb of Leslie's hygrometer) and the
strength of the evaporating spirits.
   The bulbs of three very delicate hygrometers were moistened
—one with strong whisky; another with a mixture of the same
 whisky and water in equal quantities; and the third with water.
 The lowest degree of cold induced by evaporation was carefully
 watched : that of the water was 40, that of the dilute spirits 64,
 and of the strong 88.
    “Hence the following proportion : 24:48:: strength of the
 dilute : strength of the strong spirit.”
    This he tried with different proportions of spirits and wa
 ter, in different states of the atmosphere, and found the same
 property uniformly obtain.—(Thomson's Annals.)
                        THE WARWICR VASE.
    Mr. Thomason, of Birmingham, has lately finished a fac-si
 mile of this vase (of which an engraving was given in a former
 volume) entirely of metal.    The late Earl of Warwick permitted
 him and his artists to have free access to the original, to model
 it in wax, which occupied several months.            These models
 were cast in lead to serve as patterns for the bronze vase. This
 undertaking was commenced in the 54th year of the late King,
 and the vase was raised by the efforts of about fifty workmen,

centre of the pedestal on which the vase was placed.  The vase
is 21 feet in diameter, and weighs several tons. The field was
oxidated by means of a combination of the sulphates and mitrates
urged by a strong heat, which has given it the desired appear
ance of the rouge antique marble: the masks, handles, panther
skins and leaves are oxidated by the acetates, and resemble verd
antique bronze. The whole is a noble performance, and highly
creditable to Mr. Thomason.

great distance to the supposed northern shores, it is probable
that it would take them the greatest part of next summer to
make any very extensive survey of the coast; and that they would
have to retire to the southward during the ensuing winter; but
it was uncertain        where they would take up their quarters, as they
could gain no intelligence of the country beyond the limits of the
fur traders. The officers of the Hudson's Bay and North-west
Companies had paid every attention to the party.

Extract of     a   Letter from an Officer who accompanied General Sir Charles
  Colville in his tour and inspection of the Deckan, containing         a description
  of the memorable Hindu Caves at Ellore, 1st March 1820:
   “These caves are 18 miles from Arungabad, and consist of
more than 20 excavations in a rocky mountain, which forms a
semi-circle of about 2000 yards. The largest of the caves is
called Khylass, or Paradise.         It is cut through the solid rock,
and no other material is used. The chisel seems to have been
the only tool employed. A most beautiful stone temple is formed,
adorned, both inside and outside, with figures in basso relievo,
and separate figures of the most exact symmetry, representing                      all
the Hindu gods, their conquest           Ceylon, &c. There
                                          of                             space

between the     scarped  rock and    temple   with   galleries,   and      ve  a
randa under the former,          which there are 50 gigantic figures,
                                  in
with symbols         their history, &c., forming the whole Hindu
                       of
mythology. The dimensious               of

 140  in  breadth, and the scarp 90 feet            height. The temple

the pillars, which are cut out as if to support the rooms inside.
No chuman (lime) is used. There is some account of these caves
in Colonel FitzClarence's Travels, and some beautiful and correct
views of them by Daniell. They are thought by some superior in
magnificence, though in another way, to the Pyramids of Egypt.”

   The day proved very favourable to the inhabitants of the Me
tropolis and               its
                environs, for the observation    this interesting                 of

     a                                 the eclipse was visible from
the beginning     the end.  The moon, seen through telescope
                            to
of  considerable power, exhibited her inequalities        most                              in  a a           di

ordinary circumstance                   of

                                   To Mr. Tilloch.                      Sept.8.
   SIR,-For        the greater advantage of seeing the eclipse of the
sun on the 7th of September, I walked into IIyde Park. Entering
by Cumberland Gate at half after twelve o'clock, and proceed
ing across the open area within the circular drive towards the
Powder Magazine Guard-house, the following remarkable ap
pearances occurred, and which may be worthy of record : I ob
served several luminous yellow patches upon the grass, spreading
from a distance of twenty yards to the spot on which I stood;
they were not like the partial illuminations of sun-beams from
between scattered clouds, but arose from a semi-opaque yellow
mist in defined patches of about a foot diameter each; they did
not glide along the ground like the shadows and gleams of
moving clouds, but were stationary for several seconds, and dis
 appeared without changing their places.              The bare footpaths,
which were dry at this time, exhibited a yellow hue, as if covered
 by a yellow dust of a turmeric tint.            On the spot where this
 yellow mist fell, the shadows under the blades of grass were of a
 deep indigo hue, and beneath the foliage of white Dutch clover
 the shadows had the effect of dark violet-coloured flowers inter
 spersed among the stems of the clover.
     These strange appearances were not owing to any individual
 optical delusion in myself, because they were equally distinct to
 two children, the one of them nine and the other eight years of
 age, and also to a lady of about thirty.           They continued during
  more than half an       hour,  while we  leisurely advanced to Kensing
  ton  Gardens,     by  the gate  next the   Uxbridge  road.

members        of the Royal Society, nearly forty years ago, were the
causes       of the dissensions by which it was then agitated.     In
the course of these disputes Sir Joseph and his friends formed
the plan of removing Dr. Hutton, then Professor of Mathema
tics in the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, from the office
of Foreign Secretary, which he had discharged with great honour
to himself, and perfectly to the satisfaction of a majority of the

by Sir Joseph Banks, their President, to compel Dr. Hutton to
resign,      &c.”                                                             -
     “Dr.  Hutton is known to be one of the best mathematicians
 in  England:    and he is likewise a very good writer upon the ma
 thematics, which is far from being the case with every person who
 understands them, or is well read in them. He is also remarkably
 industrious, and has furnished the Philosophical Transactions
 with more papers (and those full of ingenuity as well as learning)
 upon mathematical subjects, than, I believe, any other member
 of the Society.    He is also Professor of Mathematics at the Royal
 Military Academy at Woolwich, where he some years ago tried
 a variety of most curious and useful experiments upon the force
 of fired gunpowder, and the initial velocity of cannon-balls, si
 milar to those which had formerly been tried upon the like sub
jects with respect to musket-balls, by the late very eminent ma
 thematician and engineer Mr. Benjamin Robins. And he after
 wards drew up an account of these experiments upon cannon
  balls, which was presented to the Royal Society and printed in
 the Philosophical Transactions; the Society rewarding           learned                       its
 author      by
             giving him Sir Godfrey Copley's medal.”

the value of time to waste much of it at the Soho Square break
fasts; and lastly, to be really fond of his own profession (with
out attempting to depreciate those of other men, whatever they
might be): these, it was generally understood at the time, were
the reasons why Sir Joseph Banks wished to deprive him of the
secretaryship.   But, knowing that the Doctor's character and
reputation had made him many friends, he determined to “let
him down easy” by a ruse de guerre.        The manner in which
this was to be accomplished will appear by another quotation
from the pamphlet last cited.
    From the preceding inquiry,                            “it

Dr. Hutton's diligence in discharging the duties of the said
office, Sir Joseph Banks proposed to the Council, in a meeting
held November 20, 1783, to remove Dr. Hutton from his said
office of Foreign Secretary, alleging in general terms, that he had
neglected the duties of                      it,

   The whole of Dr. Hutton’s conduct            this affair was marked in
 by     his usual mildness and gentleness;
                                         and furnished      singular                        a

bers which was not  easily extinguished.   Warm discussions took

 and Proceedings of the late President of the Royal Society.245
place on the question of the treatment experienced by Dr. Hut
ton. Governor Pownall made a motion, which was seconded by
Mr. Glenie, “That if Dr. Hutton hath been, in the opinion of any
member of the Society, criminated, it is the opinion of the So
ciety that he hath fully justified himself.”          This motion was
carried by 49 against 15. In subsequent meetings the great
room of the Society became the arena for regular debate: Ca
vendish, Anguish, Horsley, Maskelyne, Maseres, Poore, Glenie,
Watson, Maty, Lord Mulgrave, and others, took their parts in
the several debates; some with considerable talent, eloquence,
and calmness; others with talent, but with unbecoming impe
tuosity.    As the discussions proceeded, it was found that Sir
Joseph was daily losing strength; so that there would have been
no difficulty in removing him from his office. But just at this
crisis of affairs, it was perceived that Dr. Horsley began to aspire
to the Presidency.       He was a man of real and varied talent; and
in some respects of profound knowledge; but in violence of tem
per he was nearly, if not quite, on a par with Sir Joseph: hence
it was thought better to            let
                                 Sir Joseph remain       his place, than in
to  remove one     despot

                               make    way  for another.    Dr. Hutton,
therefore, and several        his friends, retired from the Society,
leaving     the President with his train
            “                                  feeble amateurs, and the

   Hutton, Maskelyne, Horsley, and others who retired           that                              on
occasion, did not, therefore, discontinue

directed his attention more  exclusively    theology, having passed,

 246      A   Review         of   some leading           Points in the Official Character
 Dr. Maskelyne evinced itself most frequently in the Board of
 Longitude, of which he was, er officio, a member.    Sir Joseph
 was altogether ignorant of nauticai astronomy, of the construc
 tion of nautical instruments, and the principles of mechanics
 employed in the construction of new apparatus: but, notwith
 standing these disqualifications, he was incessantly setting up his
 judgement against that of the Astronomer Royal. If the Astro
  nomer Royal brought forward any new plan of nautical improve
 ment, the President of the Royal Society was sure to oppose                                                        it.
If   the Astronomer Royal recommended          new instrument, the          a
  President's opposition followed    naturally   night succeeds day.
                                                            as                   as

beginning of this review *.
   The sequel of this affair should not be omitted.         In two or
three years afterwards Mr. Groombridge was much extolled by
French and German astronomers on account of the accuracy and
utility of his researches. A new attempt was made (Maskelyne
being dead) to get him elected; and the Royal Society was ac
tually “degraded by the admission of a London tradesman.”
Poor Sir Joseph “O consistent spirit of inconsistency, how har
monious are             all

248A Review of some leading Points in the Official Character
lity manifested by Sir Joseph to Dr. Hutton.               His friends, as
well as   Maskelyne's,   if they  wished to become fellows of the Royal
Society, were regularly excluded; or, sometimes, with the ut
most civility, informed beforehand, that they “ had better not
expose theniselves to the risque and mortification of rejection.”
If any of them presented papers to the Society, they had the
honour of being carefully lodged in the archives of the Society,
where the world in general, or even the members of the Society,
would derive no more benefit from them than if they were de
posited at the centre of the earth.           This was the case with me
moirs presented by Wildloré, Pince, Lar, Mudge, &c.
    About the year 1816, Dr. Hutton having, by reason of his
advanced age, formed a determination to relinquish the habits
of a student and the active pursuits of an author, resolved, in
consequence, to dispose of his library.          He was strongly induced
to form this    resolution,    on being   informed by some of his scien
tific friends, that there were scarcely any mathematical books in
the BRitish MUSEUM, and that it was exceedingly probable the
governors would be glad to enrich it with so valuable and com
plete a library as his, if they were properly applied                 The                 to.

250   A Review of some                   leading Points in the Official Character
of the whole county which included Sir Joseph's estates. How
much better than to employ a surveyor at his own expense ! A
fine project, truly.  But, alas! death has defeated it; and ere
now both the   great man,  and the placable individual whom he
endeavoured to cajole, have learnt the vanity of every pursuit
except those which were consistent with man’s ultimate end, and
conducted upon principles which will be recognised at the final
day   of account.
    Much should I rejoice if I could, consistently with justice,
omit to record any other instance of this lamentable implacabi
lity. The task, however, is so repugnant to        the better feel                       all

  About the year 1792                 or
                          1793 was established the                                             “    Society

sioned a delay of more than a year.         At length, different mem
bers of the Board of Trade, who were apprized of this delay,
called upon Sir Joseph to assign his reasons, which appeared so
frivolous that he was immediately outvoted upon the question,
and the inquiry ordered to proceed, agreeably to the original                                 di
rections.    Sir Joseph's plea for his opposition to so natural a
plan, was, that as he had recently got Lord Stanhope's scheme
overthrown, and a commission appointed to revise British weights
and measures, a commission at the head of which he was placed,
it would be highly unbecoming and indecorous to allow any ex
periments on foreign weights and measures to be carried on at
the Royal Mint independently of him and his colleagues in the
 said commission.      This childish pretext was altogether disap
proved by most of the members of the Board, and subjected Sir

did not very long survive.
    At the commencement of the present year 1820, several
 promoters of astronomy in theory and practice instituted an
 “Astronomical Society.” An interesting address explanatory of
 the objects of the Society, was drawn up and actively circulated, not
 merely among the friends to astronomical science in Britain, but
 among the principal encouragers of astronomy on the continent.
 Stimulated by this address, nearly                    all

he subsequently treated with coolness and incivility; and some
he even affected not to know.      Shortly afterwards, he summoned
the Council of the Royal Society (“his Council,” as they were
still denominated), laid before them this address, and with a coun
tenance half tinged with melancholy, half with anger, asked what
 was to be done 2 They recommended him to let the new So
 ciety alone, unless he wished to establish it on a firm and dura
 ble basis by his opposition: but this was advice too judicious
 and sensible to be followed.       He then expostulated with the
 Astronomer    Royal  upon   his grossly  reprehensible conduct, in
 sanctioning the new Society: but the Astronomer Royal was                              in
 flexible, and so stupidly blind as not to be convinced by Sir
 Joseph’s arguments, that to sanction a British Astronomical So
 ciety was altogether irreconcileable with the duties of Astronomer
 Royal of Britain.    Sir Joseph next expostulated with the Duke
 of Somerset, who had consented to be President of the Astrono
 inical Society, and who, if I am correctly informed, had actually
 attended one of the meetings, on the incompatibility of this pro
 cedure with the duty of a faithful member of the Royal Society:
  His Grace, in consequence, withdrew from the new Society.
     An active member of the Astronomical Society, whose name
 I need   not specify, had received a promise from Sir Joseph Banks,
 that whenever there was a vacancy among the Royal Society
 members of the Board of Longitude, he would recommend him
 as an admirably qualified person.        On the death of Gen. Mudge,
  this gentleman called upon Sir Joseph Banks and reminded him
  of his promise. Sir Joseph replied, that by becoming a member
  of the Astronomical Society he had forfeited all claims upon
  his recommendation for the Board of Longitude 1

 256    A  Review    of the Character, &c. of Sir Joseph Banks.
 have been from the operation of circumstances over which Sir
 Joseph, his habits and propensities, had no controul.
    After the preceding enumeration of particulars, I may safely
 ask, If the knowledge of pure mathematics have declined in Eng
 land during the last 40 years, who can help ascribing it to Sir
 Joseph Banks : If mixed mathematics, if practical mechanics,
 if geology  and mineralogy, if astronomy, nay, if chemistry, have
 made any considerable advances in England; or if any of them
 have been enriched with noble inventions and brilliant discoveries,
 who will venture to impute the least portion of those advances,
 or the least valuable of those discoveries, to the fostering influence
 of that celebrated individual 2 The flatterers of Sir Joseph have
 termed him the Solon, the Nestor, the Mecanas, of British
 science; and he must doubtless have laughed in his sleeve at
 their simplicity or their folly, whenever he knew them so to
 speak. The MECAENAs truly             What tragedies did he compose?
 What memoirs of distinguished men                What classifications of
 precious stones : What was the name of the learned man whose
 estates he redeemed, as Mecacnas did those of Virgil?              What
 poet or philosopher owed deliverance from Royal disgrace to his
 unsought intervention? What real promoter of science did he on
 his death-bed recommend to the especial patronage of his Prince,
 as Mecanas did Horace to Augustus? The MECHENAs!                    Into
 what will   flattery precipitate    men!    Why    not the  NEwroN,    at
 once? and why not propose for his epitaph—
                         Sibi gratuleitur mortales,
                         Tale tantumque extitisse
                         Humani generis decus   !
    One remark more, and I have done.             Much has been said of
Sir Joseph’s hospitality; and there has been inferred from it the
 necessity that his successor in the chair of the Royal Society
should be a man of opulence.           This is very fallacious, and easily
exposed.     Had Sir Joseph, instead of aspiring to honour among
philosophers, contented himself with moving in the sphere of a
country gentleman, he would doubtless have given as many din
mer parties to the neighbouring gentry, and placed before them
as splendid repasts, as he did to his philosophical associates. And
as to his tea-parties, I know of nothing peculiar about them,
except it be that in order to show a philosophic indifference to
the Christian sabbath, they were for many years held on Sunday
evenings.     Several persons who have attended thern frequently,
and who were, on the whole, pleased with the society they there
met with, have always found it difficult to suppress a smile when
they have heard of the opulence necessary to continue the prac
tice, and affirm that they would engage to defray the whole ex
pense for much less than 1501, per annum.                           Aftei

   After all,      it
                 does not appear quite axiomatic, that genuine
science and philosophy are essentially, if at all, promoted by
this kind of parties.   They tend wonderfully to the formation
of distinct coteries. When from 50 to 100 persons, especially
men of talent, meet frequently, talk much about their own con

the district between Ulverston and Broughton; which is well                              si
tuated for shipping, either by the river Duddon, or by the canal
at Ulverston.    Most of these rocks exhibit a slaty structure, and
it has been stated that some of them had two distinct cleavages,
meeting and crossing each other under a certain angle; but a
person accustomed to the manufacture of roofing slates would
smile on being told that he might cleave them in any other than
one direction.   Although little difference has hitherto been made
by writers, between the roofing slate of these three divisions, yet
a workman of moderate experience will readily distinguish them.
A preference is given to the slate from some quarries, as requiring
less weight for the covering of a roof of given dimensions; this
does not depend so much on the specific gravity of the different
slates, (which varies from about 2750 to 2800,) as upon the fine
ness of grain, which enables it to bear splitting thinner. All
these rocks effervesce more or less with acids; they contain some
calcareous spar, and pyrites, but little metallic ore of any kind;
lead ore has been found near Stavely, but in very small quantity.
In those districts where the rocks are of a slaty structure, the
roads are generally smooth, the fragments naturally adapting
themselves to a flat surface, not rolling about like rounded stones,
nor presenting angles like rough broken ones: but in low situa
tions, or, where roads are much used, they are too soon con
verted into a clayey matter.

arrangement of astronomical Tables, it was resolved to remodel
these entirely, and to present them in the form which, it is pro
bable, the author himself would have chosen, had their construc
tion been deferred to the present time.
   Daussy's Tables of Vesta were adopted as the model, which
has been deviated from only in two instances.      The first regards
the mode of compensating for the intercalary day in Leap Year:
the one here employed, the writer believes to be new, and flatters
himself it may be considered an improvement, since the precept
usually subjoined to the table of daily motions, is liable to escape
notice.   In the other instance, he has chosen to retain in its
original form the Table of Heliocentric Latitude, instead of
giving the Polar distances as is now commonly done.
   The chief variations from the original Tables are as follow:

offer to the public the original production of his pencil, without
having recourse to engravers.        The repeated failures I met with
when I first began the work entitled “Twenty-four Views of
 Italy,” determined me to have a press and materials of my own;
and after several failures and renewed attempts, during the space
of fourteen months, I am at last enabled to offer some drawings,
which show, I hope, a decided progress in the art. I must beg
leave to observe, that the twelve last of the twenty-four views of
Italy, and the five drawings marked 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, are printed
entirely under my direction, and that the preparation of the
stones, the chalk, the ink, &c. is entirely done by myself.
With regard to the drawings marked 6, 7, 8, 9, the whole pro
cess, from the first preparation of the stones, as well as the
printing, is done also by myself.
    It is much to be regretted, that no good stones have hitherto
been found in England.        The only sort which answers tolerably
well the purposes of lithography, is the white lias of Bath; but
it is of too soft and porous a nature, and gives but few impressions
compared with what one can obtain from German stones.             The
Bath stones, however, answer very well for transfers, and other
inferior productions.      The decided superiority of German stones
over any other, added to the difficulties I met with in obtaining
a pure Bath stone of sufficient dimensions, has hindered me
from producing a drawing done upon an English stone.               All
 those I have the honour of offering, are printed from German
stones, from the quarries of Solnhofen in Bavaria.
    The art of lithography admits of many different styles; such
as ink drawings, either by lines or dots, etchings or engravings,
 chalk, and imitations of wood-cuts, and of aqua-tinta. The
only style, however, which has a decided superiority is that of
 chalk, as I think no style of copper-plate engravings can give
 so perfect an imitation of original pencil drawings; whereas,
 from the natural tendency the stone has to imbibe the lithogra
phic ink, it is impossible to obtain very fine lines, or any drawings
 which might not be executed with more ease           etching iry cop    on

upon stone is so very easy and simple, that I have thought it
useless to offer any specimen of                              it.
                                         These considerations have
led me     turn  to  my thoughts towards chalk-drawings; and

 intended for the drawing must be scraped out, and when finished,
 of course appears white instead of black; the thicker lines, as in
 copper, must be cut deeper; and when the whole is finished
 the stone is rubbed with linseed oil, which not being able to pe
 netrate the coating of gum, only touches the stone where it is
 scraped away.      The gum is then washed off, and the print ob
 tained as in the other styles of printing.

     The stone on which the accompanying specimen is executed,
 was taken from a quarry the property of William James, Esq. of
Warwick, a member of the Society for promoting the Arts,          Ma
 nufactures, and Commerce.         It is situated at Wilmcots, near
 Stratford-upon-Avon, and the stone may be there procured in any
 quantity, and of a very large size. I can say from experience
 (having been some years in practice as a lithographic printer,
in which time I have tried various English stones,) that it is
 equal to the German stones in texture and hardness, and is ca
 pable of receiving any kind of drawings intended for lithographic
 purposes.

S1 R,               correspondent  Philo-VERItAtis,     in his remarks
(Phil. Mag. No.269) on my observations relative to the Theory
 of Sir Richard Phillips, insinuates my having intended to hoar
 your readers at the expense of truth. I therefore solicit your     in
 dulgence to insert a few remarks.
     In art. I. page 102, vol. 56. The velocity of the planets in
 their orbits, was by mistake inserted with the density of the
 gaseous medium, and the density of the planets, as will appear
 by referring to art. 6, page 103, i. e. The motions of the planets
in superior orbits are quicker than those which are situated
 nearer the sun.                                           -
      But had I erred in the three first deductions, as erroneously
 stated by Peritatis, there would still have been left objections

286                         Observations on
to confute, sufficient to have exercised the superior talents of this
gentleman, even with his understanding open.
    I shall now proceed to substantiate these deductions.
    FIRST. As to the density of the gaseous medium.          We are
told   by  Sir Richard in his  Treatise, page 21,  “that the den
sities are supposed such, that, multiplied by the distances, the
products are equal *: consequently, as the distances increase, the
densities must of course decrease.”
   Again:       page 25, “The density of each stratum          is inversely
as the cubes      of the radii.”
   SEconDLY.  As to the density of the planets.
   Page 19. “We know from the diurnal phaenomena that the
earth and atmosphere have such a common rotatory motion,
without which the common orbicular force must confer on the
masses unequal momenta.       It is however a necessary mechanical
effect of such common rotatory motion, to equalize the momenta
of masses of various density, and to force them to range them
selves, or to seek to range themselves, in concentric circles or
radii of rotation, inversely as their respective densities. By their
mutual collisions the lighter bodies must, by the mechanism of
equal momenta and equilibria, ascend from the centre towards
the circumference, and the heavy ones le forced towards the
centre.”                                       -
    Whence the same effects must evidently obtain in the planet
 ary system; for the rotatory motion of the gaseous medium and
 the rotatory motion of the earth's atmosphere, on this principle
 of mechanics, must undoubtedly produce similar results.
    We are also told at page 36, “that if the density of the pro
jectile were equal to the density of the medium, then the pro
jectile would float in the medium, and be carried round the earth
in the circular vortex of the earth like the medium itself.”
   On the same theory, the planets would fall to the sun, unless
supported by a medium of equal density with the respective
planets—as it is evident they must swim in a medium of the
same density and velocity—otherwise    resistance would be ge
nerated till this effect was obtained.
   Whence the density of the medium and the density of the
planets in the same circle of rotation must of necessity be equal,
and, on the principles of Sir Richard's Theory, their densities
undeniably decrease from the sun to the confines of the solar
system, as I before asserted; or, from the centre of any revolving
medium or system of bodies, to the extent of their circumference.
   Peritatis admits as granted, that a cubic foot of silver cannot
   * This law involves the absurdity, that the sun and planets, and  allrota
tory bodies, are infinitely denseattheir centres

the author of the English formula is wrong in stating that it wil
give the value of the correction with perfect accuracy; and the
Commissioners of Longitude ought not to have sanctioned such
an assertion.   In the present state of astronomy, and when a
new  impulse  seems to be given to the science, every one must
hail with satisfaction any attempt to expedite and facilitate the
laborious calculations which too frequently arise in practice: and
no one is more sensible than I am of the ability and disposition
of the members of the Board to encourage such attempts.        Let
us not however retrograde in the science, but endeavour to im
prove on what has gone before: so that we may eventually hope
to regain that proud pre-eminence from which we have been
driven by our more industrious neighbours.

             these experiments the piece under trial was supported
            upon  iron supports; the scale for the weights was sus
pended from the middle between these supports; and a silken
line, attached to the middle, moved a lever index; which mul
tiplied the depression so as to render a very small quantity                               vi
sible.
   The scale and               its

   The first trial, that with the 30-inch distance, will give the
most accurate measure of the elastic force; but it is not a fair mea
sure of the cohesive force, because it was evidently broke by the
momentum, the weight acquired by the addition of the last 10 lbs.
The 14-inch length bore the weight some time before it broke.

soda throws down at first the arseniate of iron, and then any
simple peroxide that may remain, if more muriate of iron was
added than was necessary to afford sufficient peroxide of iron to
saturate the arsenic acid.     The arseniate of iron is yellowish
white, the simple peroxide brown-red, showing that no arsenic
acid remains in the solution, if the ferrugineous precipitate, after
being yellowish white, appears red in the last portions; and                                                   in
deed if this does not happen at first, more of the muriate of iron
should be added, till the brown-red precipitate shows itself. All

of the climate.     As the existence of so great a temperature as
this so near the surface, and still more the seemingly progressive
and most rapid increase of it in descending, are at first sight
circumstances very startling to our pre-conceived notions, and
still more so when traced to the conclusions to which they neces
sarily lead; the author of the memoir, previously to coming to
any opinion as to the site or source of this high temperature, dis
cussed the many hypothetical objections that can be advanced
against the existence of an internal source of heat in the body of
the earth.   We have not space to notice        these, nor   notice         all                         to

writer proceeded to demonstrate how very nearly the inhabitants
of Cornwall, and especially the proprietors of land, are interested
in the prosecution of the study of geology; and, on these grounds,
he demanded of them, as their own peculiar affair, to continue
to this Society, and every other having similar objects, that pa
tronage and protection which they have so liberally extended
hitherto; and he appealed to those Cornishmen who were distin
guished for their learning and science (and there are many such)
to consecrate some portion of their immortal labours to the wel
fare and renown of their native county. The discourse thus con
cluded: “Stimulated by motives so powerful as the fair fame of
our country, the diffusion of useful knowledge, and the increas
ing prosperity of the community at large, much may be expect
ed, and we should not forget that much is expected—from the
matured labours of this Institution. Let it not then be forgotten
that success is the prize of exertion—not of the few, but by a ge
neral concurrence in the spirit of our comprehensive Cornish
motto “One and All.” Then will the memorial of these our
days go down to posterity adorned with the imperishable trophies
of Science.   But if we supinely neglect the auspicious opportu
mity, instead of living in the grateful recollection of future times,
posterity will mourn over our apathy, over the unimproved ta
lents thus buried,

trary directions.    These   attractions,  and   repulsions,   are totally
and absolutely different from those which take place between
electrized bodies      the ordinary way.
                                 in
   First. Because they take place only when the Voltaic circuit
‘est fermé,” that                is,
                         when the two ends touch.
   Secondly.           when the extremities,
                           It   is                 the same nature, are   of
the nearest      each other, that there
                      to                      attraction, and there is                                        is
repulsion when they are further removed; while,             the contrary,                on
electricity     the same nature repels, and
                 of                                 opposite natures at   of
tracts.
   Thirdly. These attractions, and repulsions, take place                                                     in

strong      make the two conductors approach each other
            to                                                                                      so

currents which are produced by an action of the particles of
steel upon each other, analogous to those of the elements of a
Voltaic pile, and that they move in planes perpendicular to the
line which joins the poles of the magnet.

                                GEOLOGY.
    Mr. Brongniart has discovered in the recent geological tour in
Italy, that great part of the limestone of the Alps is of a much
                               ---
more modern formation than has been hitherto supposed.
    M. Cuvier is preparing a new edition of his Fossil Animals, with
many additions,
                           AGRICULTURE,     &c.
    M. Cadet     de Vaux has lately recommended, as an important
and useful innovation, the reaping of corn before it is perfectly
ripe. This practice originated with M. Salles of the Agricultu
ral Society of Beziers: grain thus reaped (say eight days before
it  is ripe) is fuller, larger, finer, and is never attacked by the
weevil.      This was proved by reaping one half of a piece of corn
field, as recommended, and leaving the other till the usual time.
The early reaped portion gave a hectolitre of corn more, for half
a hectar of land, than the later reaped.           An equal quantity of
flour from each was made into bread: that made from the corn
reaped green gave seven pounds of bread more than the other,
in six decalitres. The weevil attacked the ripe corn, but not the
green. The proper time for reaping is when the grain, pressed
between the fingers, has a doughy appearance, like crumb of
bread just hot from the oven, when pressed in the same way.
     Major General Beatson has proved, on a farm of 300 acres, at
 Knowle, Tunbridge Wells, since the year 1813, that by light or
shallow ploughing, on a stiff soil, with one horse, without lime
or dung, and without fallow, he can raise crops of wheat and
other grain at the expense of 5l. an acre, equal or superior to
the crops of his neighbours at an expense of 16l. an acre in lime,
and labour of cattle.
    It has long been believed that leaves of the elder-tree put into the
subterraneous paths of moles, drive them away; but it is not so
generally known, that if fruit-trees, flowering shrubs, corn or
vegetables, be wiped with the green leaves of elder branches,
 insects will not attach to them.       An infusion of elder leaves in
water is     good  for sprinkling  over rose-buds,    and flowers subject
 to   blights and the devastations of   caterpillars.
     If pieces of woollen rags be placed in currant-bushes or other
shrubs, &c. it is found that the caterpillars uniformly take shelter
                                                                    under

these traps, with their tenants, at an early hour, and replacing
the rags for the destruction of others.
   Horse-dung, clay, sand, and pitch-tar form a composition,
which, when applied to the trunks and stems of fruit-trees, after
they are properly cleaned, prevents that spontaneous exudation
called gumming, which is very injurious to the growth of trees.
   Mr. Knight is of opinion, &unded on actual experiment, that
oak timber would be much improved, if the tree, after being barked
in the spring, was permitted to stand till the following winter.
                  TO RESTORE               THE WHITE IN PAINTINGS.
   M. Thenard has applied his oxygenated water with great ef
fect for this purpose.     The whites are often rendered brown, or
even  black, where   paintings are acted on by sulphurous vapours,
especially by sulphurized hydrogen, which is very abundant in
some situations.    Recollecting that the oxygenated water con
verted black sulphuret of lead into a white sulphate, he furnished
an artist, who wished to restore a design of Raphael's, with some
of   it. By applying     with pencil the spots were instantly re

successful.     On  Sunday  morning, the 6th of August, going un
der easy  sail,  about 60 miles to the S. of Lancaster-sound,   he
saw a considerable inlet, and a ship higher up in it : turning up
the inlet, he was struck with sounds from the shore, which prov
ed to be inhabitants making strange gestures and screams.      He
and  part  of the crew  landed,  and  by courteous signs overcame
their timidity, and were conducted   by a male who had lost both
feet, probably by the frost, and a female about 13 years of age, to
their huts made of the skins of seal and deer. It was found that
most of the population were absent on the hills hunting; only a
few males, and some women, but a great number of children,
being left.   They seemed docile and hospitable, exchanging
their skin jackets for those of the sailors, and stripping naked
without the least hesitation, to put on the new dress.      They
seemed to pay some adoration to the Sun.
   “The ship's company here caught some fish, and found rea
son to believe that the inlet communicated with Lancaster-scund.
Captain Warham found the variation of the compass to be W.
of the true N. about 100 degrees, and thinks the magnetic pole
is somewhere there, as the dip is prodigious.   The ships then
stretched N.E. for Sir Thomas Smith's sound, in lat. 78%, long.
64., leaving Alderman Jones's sound on the larboard side : he
made Hackluyt's Island 77%, long. 60., and completed his fishing
near Cape Dudley Digges. Coming down Davis's-straits, and
even to Cape Farewell, he fell in with ice, and many icebergs,
having in snow-showers to thread his way through them ; and
finally passed the latter cape on the 3d Sept.
   “Captain Warham is cautious of speaking of any thing but
what he saw, is a good mathematician and astronomer, and
 quite fitted for active and intelligent observation.”

314          Tweed Chain Bridge.—Regent's Canal.
  The method adopted in the erection of this bridge holds out
great promise of economy in future bridge-building. No exca
vation required; no coffer dams; but merely the iron columns
driven as far into the earth as they could be by a pile engine :
they were then made the fulcrum of a lever loaded with three
times the calculated weight of the bridge. The bridge is also so
constructed as to require no spandrils—thus leaving the same alti
tude for the passage of vessels under every part of the span.
   The principal strength and stability of this bridge is obtained
by elliptical arcs and chords, kept so flat that the purposes of
the truss girder are fully obtained, but with superior elegance
and greater strength, and may be extended to an indefinite length.
—Two of those cross the river, their extreme ends resting on the
iron pillars driven in the river banks, and not projecting higher
than the hand rail of the balustrades—with an extended chord
from the two points of the basement, holding them together, and
preventing their extending by pressure; to which elliptical arc
piece are attached or hung chords of suspension for supporting
the bridge-flooring—these chords of suspension being flat, form
stiles between pannels of tasteful Gothic work; the whole form
ing balustrades on each side the bridge.       It being on the prin
ciples of tenacity, the chief part of the iron acts longitudinally by
tension. There are grooves in the top of those iron columns, on
which the whole bridge has room to contract or expand, so ne
cessary in this climate from the various changes of the atmo
sphere from heat and cold, as the other previous iron bridges
have suffered materially from the want of this precaution, and
evidence has been given before the Parliament, that the South
wark bridge rises from 2 to 2; inches in the middle of the day,
and settles again in the evening.     By those iron columns in the
river, instead of piers or buttresses, if they resist the floating ice,
of which from their strength and stability there can be no doubt,
Mr. Dodd, the engineer, has certainly introduced an economical
plan in bridge-building, as in this there is no occasion for bat
tred'eaux, coffer-dams, &c.; a saving most desirable in the ex
pensive work of bridge-building—particularly so, as they are exe
cuted with such facility, and without the expense of centering,
and upon this principle can be built to any order, instead of the
fillagree patterns hitherto adopted.

   Capt. S. Brown, R.N., has completed the chain bridge over
the Tweed. The breadth of the river is 437 feet; and the bridge
crosses the whole in one stretch, without any middle support.

arise from this navigation are not merely local :—The Messrs.
Pickfords lately sent boats from Manchester, and instead of their
passing from the Grand Junction to Brentford, and there being
unloaded, and the goods re-embarked in other vessels for Dept
ford, they went direct by the canal to Limehouse, and crossed
over without any delay; whereby not only time but a heavy ex
pense, with probable loss and damage, were saved to the pro
prietors.   The dock too at Limehouse, being calculated to re
ceive ships of considerable burthen, admits colliers, which dis
charge their cargoes upon the wharfs, or into canal barges; and
thus the plunder and waste of coal, which so notoriously take
place in the Pool, are avoided, and many of those criminal acts,
the list of which heretofore has been frightful, are prevented.

     DEAR    SIR,--I send you          the observations made at this place with
a barometer on the principle of Sir H. Englefield's (No. 391),
with the hope of inducing others of your correspondents to do
the same, for the purpose of making out a table of the altitudes of
different parts of the country.   They are as follow :

     The height of the mercury in the basin of my barometer I con
sider (until corrected) to be 31 14 feet above the level of the sea ;
those persons who have made simultaneous observations will be
able to calculate the height of their stations: and by a few repeti
tions of similar observations on the 10th of November and on
the llth of December next, an additioual number of altitudes
may be found.            I
                     beg leave to say, that when I sent you the
general invitation to persons in possession of a good barometer,
to make a course of hourly observations from 8 A.M. to 12, on
the 10th day of each month, for the remainder of this year, (vide
last No. p. 234,) I was not aware, until the paper was sent off,
that the 10th of December would fall on a Sunday.         I have
therefore proposed Monday the llth in      place; and         its
                                                           should                     if it

XLIX. A         Letter from Dr. Hutton ; with Communications
                  from the Marquis DE LAPLACE.
                             To  Mr. Tilloch.
SiR,   - Is
were so obliging
                the Philosophical Magazine of February last, you
                      as to insert a note from me on the subject of
my Calculations on the Density of the Earth; for I then ap
prehended that the credit of that operation had been transferred
to others: and I scarcely need observe, that as honour is the
chief reward of scientific labours, it was natural that I should
feel some uneasiness on being unjustly deprived of what I con
ceived my right.
     You also had the goodness at the same time to insert the copy
of a letter on the same subject, which I had addressed to the
Marquis De Laplace, under an idea that his Lordship had for
gotten to acknowledge the receipt of that little communication.
 In this apprehension, however, I am happy to find that I was
mistaken, as the delay arose, not from any neglect on his part,
but rather from his attention to the subject, in preparing a pro
 found and interesting paper on the earth's density, a copy of
 which he has transmitted to me, with the following very kind
 and obliging letter.
                           “To    Dr. HUTTON.
                                               “Paris,  Sept. 11, 1820.
     “SIR,--I     hope you will have the goodness to accept my ex
 cuse for not replying sooner to the letter with which you ho
 noured me.        I expected every day that the Tracts I am printing
  in the volumes of the Connoissance des Tems would give me an
 opportunity of inserting what you seemed to wish. But as this
 opportunity has not yet occurred, I have resolved to publish, for
  the express purpose, a Memoir on the Density of the Earth, in
  the volume of the Connoissance des Tems for 1823, which will
 soon appear.       I have the honour to send you a copy of this pa
  per.    It is my  wish that it may satisfy you; being very desirous
  to  prove  to you   how much I esteem your talents, and honour
  your person.      I thank you for the present you have been so
  good as to send me of the collection of your Tracts.            I have
  been long acquainted with your profound researches, which
  secure to you a distinguished rank among geometricians, and
  which have long inspired me with a high esteem for you, the
   expression of which I beg you will accept.

 Although it appears by the foregoing letter from the Marquis
De Laplace, that his Memoir on the earth's density will shortly
appear in the Connoissance des Tems, yet the learned world
must be gratified with an earlier publication of       especially                         it,

read with the deepest interest. No man more highly appreciates

Thus, the super-stratum of the earth being about twice as dense
as the water, and the sub-strata becoming, in proportion to their
depth, three, four, and even five times more dense, it is probable
that the whole mass of the earth is five or six times more dense
than if it were formed of water.”
    The theories of the figure of the planets, and of the oscilla
tions of the fluids that cover them, which have been considerably
improved since the time of Newton, have confirmed the suppo
sition. By this theory it appears that,        the stability  the                       for                          of

ocean, divided by the semi-axis of the earth, the increase of this
length thus corrected, from the equator to the poles, will be
equal to the product of the square of the sine of the latitude by
five-fourths of the ratio of the centrifugal force, to the gravity at
the equator, or by forty-three ten-thousandths.          The multi
plied experiments of the pendulum, made in both hemispheres,
and reduced to the level of the sea, agree in giving to the square
of the sine of the latitude,  a coefficient of more than forty-three
ten-thousandths,     and  very  nearly equal to fifty-four ten-thou
sandths.    It is therefore fully proved by these experiments, that
the earth is not   homogeneous,    and that the densities of its strata
increase from the surface to the centre.

equalities, owing to the flattening of the earth, and the phaeno
mena of precession and nutation, lead to the same result, which
can therefore admit of no doubt.

  aside.    Some weeks afterwards, I found the dark colour of the
  sulphate had entirely disappeared, a dense black substance had
  subsided, and the supernatant fluid remained colourless and
 transparent.       On opening the phial, an odour similar to that
  of ether was perceived, the fluid had a strong acid taste, and
  afforded a copious precipitate with nitrate of barytes.         After the
  black substance had been well washed and dried, a few prelimi

  pound which had not been noticed.           To confirm these results,
  and  procure   more of the     substance,   I repeated the experiment
  with the sulphate and alcohol.         In about two days the fluid as
  sumed a darker tint, the black substance began to precipitate in
  a finely divided state, and in about a week it had              subsided,                     all

                                                                   fluid,

fluid reddened litmus, and had an acid taste. The gas rendered
lime-water turbid, and was in part absorbed by water and by
ammonia; and the unabsorbed portion exhibited properties si
milar to those of nitrogen.      These results seemed to prove, that
the   powder     contained acid and inflammable matter; but they
were not    sufficiently uniform to enable me to place much reli
ance on them.        I then used very small glass retorts, varying in
capacity from nºr to ºr of a cubic inch, and decomposed the
powder over pure water and over mercury; but the results were
most satisfactory when I operated over mercury. From two ex
periments of this kind, which I beg briefly to detail, as they very
nearly agree, I think I may venture to state the composition of
 the powder under examination.
    Experiment 1. Ten grains of the powder were decomposed
 in a little retort, over dry mercury, by the heat of a spirit lamp.
 On the first impression of the heat, gas was disengaged, and
 shortly after, the interior of the retort assumed a reddish yellow
  colour (like that exhibited by the vapour of fuming nitrous
  acid), and small drops of a colourless fluid condensed in the neck
  of the retort. After the utmost heat of the lamp had been given
  to the retort, it was suffered to cool, and the results were im
 mediately examined.
                            (a) Examination     of the Gas.
    The gas remaining in the retort made an ignited piece of wood
 glow brighter; that which came over (deducting the common
 air) was  ºr   of a cubic inch, which diminished to      on being º,
 transferred to water and agitated.    Fºr of the unabsorbed gas,
 on being mixed with an equal volume of pure hydrogen, and fired
 by an electric spark, diminished to            <U+017F>º.
                                            Hence, the unabsorbed
 portion of gas contained more oxygen than could have been fur
 nished from the common air of the retort.
    From other experiments, the gas absorbed by water was found
 to be carbonic acid; it rendered lime-water turbid, was absorbed
 by ammonia, and again disengaged by muriatic acid.
                        (b) Examination       of the Fluid.
    The fluid which rose in the neck of the retort reddened litmus
 paper, and resembled the nitrous acid in odour, colour, and taste.
 It acted upon the mercury in contact with the retort, and when
 washed out by pure water, the solution did not affect the nitrate
 of barytes, or silver.
     (c)  The platinum was perfectly reduced, and          particles its
 formed loosely coherent mass, which could not

rock crystal, in the positions requisite to produce, by their com
bination, the double effect to which I allude.
   There are three principal directions in which a crystal may be
cut specifically different from each other, which require to be
distinctly understood.
   In the first place, let us suppose a prismatic crystal to be
placed with                    its
                               vertical position, and     portion                                                                     be

cut off from the base           plane surface    a  right angles    the                            at
axis, and sufficient      form    wedge       20 degrees,

     Next,      the crystal        bisected verticallybe            plane passing                        by      a

dinary course by the wedge which refracts doubly, this difference
is not corrected by the horizontal wedge, so that an object seen
through either of the combinations L H or V H, appears deubled
to the amount of 17.
    The third combination, consisting of the vertical and lateral
wedges combined, as in the former cases, with their acute edges
in opposite directions, produces an effect perfectly distinct from
either of the former combinations; for, by reason of the trans
verse position of their axes of crystallization, the separation of
the two images becomes exactly doubled.           The consequence of
that position              is,
                    that the pencil ordinarily refracted       the first                                by
 wedge,    refracted
             is       extraordinarily     the second,   and that whichby
 has been refracted extraordinarily         the first, suffers         by

 such a  construction, great  nicety is requisite, not only in cutting
 the wedges so that the refraction in each shall take place at right
 angles to the axis, but also in cementing them together, so that
 the axes of the two wedges shall be at right angles to each other.
 And it may further be remarked, that even then, unless the per

the expression been correct, I think there would have been little
embarrassment in deriving it thus:
   When a magnetic needle is governed only by the attraction of
a sphere, it has been demonstrated, in what precedes, that it is
acted on  by two forces; one of which tends to the centre of the
sphere, and the other urges it from the centre, in a line drawn in
the magnetic meridian, at right angles to the direction of the first
force. Hence, joining the centres of the needle and sphere, and
from the latter          drawing            above; and further making
                                              a   line        as
these lines bear        to each other the ratio of 2 cos ?: sin t, which
has been shown          (page 450) to be the ratio of the forces in those
directions, they         will represent those forces; and hence the                                                            di
rection of the needle will be that of the hypothenuse of the                                                                   tri
angle of which these lines are the sides.
   But it is manifest that the angle included between the hypo
thenuse and the second of the above lines is equal to the dip of
the needle, or to                its
                       deviation from      tangent      the sphere;       a                           to
therefore putting this angle equal      the first line will         3',                                           be

lines themselves there arises the required proportion

reasoning will also hold for the attraction of a point in the interior
of the second sphere ; and, consequently, the force which acts in
the direction of the dip, upon a point within both spheres, will
be equal to n.    But this force is equal to the intensity of the
terrestrial magnetism at the place; wherefore the constant co
efficient n must be equal to the same intensity.
   From what has been demonstrated above, it appears that no
thing more is necessary to convert the formulae, before given, for
the laws of magnetic attraction to a sphere of iron, into equa
tions, than to multiply them by

occurrences, with which it will be our duty to acquaint your
Lordship.
   The Reports transmitted to this Board likewise warrant the
conclusion, that wherever small-pox inoculation is abandoned,
and vaccination exclusively favoured or commanded, the most
striking illustrations of the value of the Jennerian discovery are
uniformly afforded; for, in addition to those places mentioned
in former Reports, in which small-pox is now unknown, the
Board have received information that no case of that disease has
occurred since the year 1804 at Shottesham in Norfolk, nor
since the year 1817 in the city of Gloucester.          The boroughs of
Clonmell and Newton         Limavady     in  Ireland,   and Mothvey in
Carmarthenshire, with the whole country for twenty miles around
of it,
    are reported     have completely succeeded
                               to                         the extirpation                  in

                                    To   Mr. Tilloch.
SIR,     - Your     ingenious Correspondent's remarks on my papers,
page 14, are very curious, I must allow; but whether they apply
to the substantial parts of my argument I leave for others to
determine.      My argument is the list of corresponding eclipses
which I have been at the pains to collect, and trust you will
allow me the credit of having advanced my hypothesis on some
foundation.      It is true, I have filled up the list with many com
puted dates, and especially from the learned and laborious com
pilation entitled L’Art de vérifier                  les
                                              Dates; but since these                             fill
up the steps        in
                   the ladder      their true places, and give

                                                                                   do be

requisite equations; and whether or not the attempt is success
ful, certain it is that an admirable harmony is discoverable even
in the rude and unfinished method there followed.           The like
Riethod is pursued in a subsequent communication, page 439,
where the same is given at large, bringing the corresponding
dates up to the very day, and in many instances within a few
hours, leaving the difference of meridians, and other particulars,
to the skill of those who are disposed to investigate them more
minutely.       In this paper the number of lunar cycles is stated at
48, which is the quotient of 912 divided by 19, the years of one
 cycle, and the revolutions of the moon's ascending Node at 49;
 and thus, if you divide 912 years by 49, there will be given the
 period of one revolution, viz. 18 years about 224 days.      M. La
  Caille's Elements, translated by Robertson, page 285, makes
 this period 18 years, 224 days, 5 hours, reckoned from the first
 point of Aries.
     I presume, sir, there is no occasion here to introduce anoma
 listic calculations of the sun and moon; the mass of evidence                        al
 ready produced in the corresponding eclipses at 912 years di
stance, and the eclipses recorded to have happened, show most
evidently that the true motions of the sun and moon's apogee
and node must agree at and after such an interval, or such phae
nomena could not take place. I do not think these substantial
parts of the argument at       all
                             affected            by
                                         Mr. Utting, who appears

astronomers become exhausted, and all their perfections lost                           in

  The period of the moon's ascending node, which is the lunar
equinoctial point, if I may be allowed so to express myself, seems
very fairly to confirm my hypothesis in fixing on 912 years for
the completion of the moon's motion. Mr. Whiston's Collection
of Tables annexed to his Lectures gives the mean motion of the
moon, apogee, and node, as follows:
 Comp.             Mean Motion of               Mean Motion of                Mean Motion of the

  The mean motion of the node for 19 complete years is 7 deg.
27 min. 22 sec. by Whiston's Tables; but if we say 7 deg. 30
min. in every cycle, the whole ecliptic motion is performed in
912 years; the mean motion for four cycles or 76 years is equal
to one sign, and in 12 x 76 years the node revolves through the
whole of the signs.
   There is no difference between the Chaldean period and the
Metonic lunar cycle, but the method of calculation. The Chal
dean period is one lunar year shorter than the Metonic, and
consists of 223 lunations according to Dr. Halley's account, and
the Metonic consists of 235 lunations: and hence it             that the                   is,

curious criticism on the Connoissance des Tems.            The Observa
tory of Paris never had a more unsparing critic than this learned
foreigner.    “The whole calendar,” he says, of the Connois                      “

London, Nov. 13, 1820.                                                             PETER      Nicholson.
                          To   extract the Cube Root                       of any Number.
   Divide the number into          many periods     as three figures each          of
from  right     left     possible.
                          to          Find the nearest cube
                                     as                             the re                             to
maining figure         figures  or  the left, and subtract that cube
                                                    byon
from the 'number formed            these remaining figures; then the
root            of
         the cube     the first figure
                                    is       the root                of
                                                              extracted.                to   be
   Call the  triple  root now found the first      coefficient,  the triple
square           of
           this root the second      coefficient, and the difference be
tween the cube and the number                                         to   be extracted           the absolute
number; then write these numbers separately            one line.                        in
                                                        of by
       Divide the remainder
           1.                     the second coefficient without the
last figure only    one place   to figures    the quotient.                  in
       2.
       Under the first  coefficient,   construct    column        three             a                   of
numbers,      that the right hand figure may advance one place
                      so
to the right hand                    of
                       the units place        the coefficient.   Under     of
                                                                                                                the

                       the Cube Root in Numbers.
                                                             ".      361
the second coefficient construct a column of two numbers, so that
each number may advance two places of figures before the units
place of the coefficient under which they are placed, and under
the remainder construct a column of one number so as to ad
vance three places of figures before the remainder.
     3. Annex the quotient figure to the first coefficient, and the
 sum will be the first number underneath; each of the two re
maining numbers will be found by increasing the number above
it by the quotient figure.
     4. Multiply each of the first two numbers in the first column
 in succession by the quotient figure, and the opposite number in
 the second column will be found by adding the product to the
  number above it.
     5. Multiply the first number under the second coefficient by
  the quotient figure and subtract the product from the remainder,
  and this last remainder is the number which forms the third         co
  lumn: then    if the product be less than the preceding remain
  der, the quotient figure is the second figure of the root; but
  if not, the quotient figure must be diminished till it is found to
   be so.
      Now, considering      the last two numbers in the first and se
  cond columns as the first and second coefficientº, and the last re
  mainder as a new absolute number, the step of the work for the
  next figure will be found exactly in the same inanner as that for
  the last figure.
      Example.—Extract the cube root of the number 13.
      Here the nearest cube to 13 is S, the root of which is 2; there
  fore the coefficients of the first step are 6 and 12, and the re
  mainder or absolute number is 5: now 5 will be found to con
  tain l, which is the second coefficient wanting the last figure 5
   times: now 5 being tried will be found not to succeed, therefore
   try 3 in the operation : thus
      6      12      5 . . .(3     Proceed with these opposite columns

      66     1587
      69                               of the rules.
      Since 3 succeeds, divide 833 by 158, which is the coefficient
  of the second term without the last figure, and the quotient 5 is
  the next figure of the root, which must now succeed; therefore
   proceed with the next step

         LIX.     Description   of Mr. MALAM's Gas-Meter *.
As     soon as coal-gas came to be extensively applied to the pur
poses of street illumination and to domestic use as a substitute
for lamps and candles, it became an object of great importance
to the proprietors and managers of the different gas-works to
ascertain with accuracy the quantity of gas expended in propor
tion to  the number of jets or burners made use of.
    The essential conditions of any apparatus for this purpose are,
that the pressure on the gas while passing through the measurer
shall at all times be uniform; and that it shall register truly
when that pressure is very small, and when the current of gas is
 very feeble.
    The first gas-meter was constructed by Mr. Clegg, and is se
cured to the inventor by a patent.           It consists essentially of a
 cylinder, divided into cells, inclosed and revolving in an outer
 cylinder, which is less than half filled with water.         The gas en
ters  laterally through    the perforated   axle,  into that cell of the
 inner cylinder which happens to be nearest the surface of the
water.     It displaces the fluid from this cell, consequently de
stroys the equilibrium of the cylinder, and communicates to it a
rotatory motion.       When the cell, so filled with gas, has made
nearly half a revolution, it comes again in contact with the wa
ter, which forces the gas out of the cell into the exterior cylinder,
from which it passes into the conducting pipes.                A train of
clock-work is placed so as to register each revolution of the           in
terior cylinder; and the cubic contents of this being known, of
course the whole quantity of gas passing through the machine in
a given time is ascertained.
    Mr. Malam's gas-meter is constructed on the same general
principles, but with such improvements as induced the Society to
confer on him a high honorary reward; but whether the machine,
in their opinion so improved, is completely open to public use
before the expiry of Mr. Clegg's patent, the Society does not
presume to determine.                                        Secretary.

   SIR,-HERE with I have forwarded to you a gas-meter of my
invention, capable of supplying four Argand burners, each oon
suming about four cubic feet of gas per hour.          ln doing so, I am

my invention into practice, during which time the action of the

known, and the number of teeth in the wheels adjusted accord
ingly, the dial indicates, on inspection, the number of cubic feet
of gas that have passed through the meter since the counter was
last set.
   Now, supposing the exit pipe R is connected with the great
gasometer, or with the street main, and that the gas is flowing
in above the partition h of the detecting valve, and that there is
a proper quantity of water in the machine, the cup i will be
elevated above the opening in the partition by the float k, which,
allowing the gas to pass through the inverted pipe D, fills the
central chamber E, fig. l ; and, as the opening a is above the
surface of the water, the gas passes into the compartment G.
The water being displaced by the entrance of the gas, and the
equipoise being disturbed,        the interior cylinder will move on                                       its

        After Columbus discovered America, under the auspices of
    Ferdinand and Isabella, the sovereigns of Europe, and especially
    Henry the Seventh, turned their thoughts towards, and gave
    great encouragement to discoveries.           Mr. Robert Thorne, who
    resided   many  years as a merchant in       Spain,   and who was after
    wards Mayor of Bristol, wrote a letter to Henry the Eighth, in
    which he strongly recommended a voyage to the North Pole.
    He gave his reasons more at large in a long Memorial to our
    Ambassador in Spain, which show him to have been a very judi
    cious man, and for those times a very able cosmographer; and
    accompanied this Memorial with a Map of the World, to prove
    the practicability of his proposal.        Though this project of his

to new countries; and, finally, that the experiment might be
made with very little hazard, at a small expense, and would re
dound highly to our national honour, if attended with success.
It may be then demanded, why it has not hitherto been at
tempted, and what objections have retarded a scheme so visibly
advantageous     These objections, as far as they can be collect
ed, are the fear of perishing by excessive cold, the danger of
being blocked up in ice, and the apprehension that there could
be no certainty of preserving the use of the compass under or
near the Pole.
                             we have already mentioned, that the
      In respect to the first,
ancients had taken     up  an opinion, that the seas in the frigid
zone were impassable, and the lands, if there were any, uninha
bitable.   The philosophers of later ages fell into the same opi
nion, and maintained that the Poles were the sources and prin
 ciples of cold, which of course increased and grew excessive in
approaching them.       But when the lights of experience were ad
mitted to   guide in such researches, the truth of this notion came
to be questioned, because from facts it became probable, that
there might be a diversity of climates in the frigid as well as the
torrid zone. Charlton Island, in which Captain James wintered,
lies in the bottom, that                     is,
                               the most southern part

Bay, and      the same latitude with Cambridge, and the cold
                  in
there was intolerable.    The servants    the Hudson's Bay Com      of
pany trade annually      places ten degrees nearer the Pole, with
                                    in
out feeling any such inconvenience.     The city     Mosow                      of                    is   in
the same latitude with that      Edinburgh,  and yetof  winter the                    in

                   soil, herbage,      animals; and yet or    Spitzbergen,       in
in   six degrees higher latitude, there are            three; and,        all
                                                                          the                     on
 top   ofthe mountains,        the most northern part, men strip them
                                        in
 selves     their shirts that they may cool their bodies. The ce
            of
 lebrated Mr. Boyle, from these and many other instances, re
jected the long received notion, that the Pole was the principle
of  cold.    Captain Jonas Poole, who           1610 sailed         in
                                                                   vessel              in    a             of

towards the Pole, which no doubt gradually increases. The very
learned and sagacious Dr. Hooke asserted in one of his lectures,
and brought very strong reasons to show, that there is nothing
but sea at the Poles. These points then, being maturely con
sidered, will be found to militate in favour of a free passage this
way, and at the same time give much light into other things that
have been advanced in the course of this inquiry, by showing the
true causes of those facts that, at first sight, have appeared to
many very strange and unaccountable.           For example, if there be
no land near the Pole, then there can be no bays in which ice
can be formed to interrupt the navigation. Again, the rays of
the sun, falling on so flat a surface, and being continually reflected
from the water, must afford a great degree of heat to the air.
At the same time this will account for the sun’s being seen by the
Dutch in Nova Zembla a fortnight earlier than he should have
appeared according to astronomical calculations.              Many other
circumstances    might be  mentioned,    but these will doubtless occur
to the intelligent, and therefore it is unnecessary to dwell longer
 upon them.

    $1Nce the publication of my Tract, entitled “A new Method
of solving Equations,” &c. Mr. Nicholson has added a Postscript
to his Essay on Involution and Evolution, for the purpose of re
probating me, as if I had injured him, instead of his having                                                       in
jured me.
     In my original manuscript I had written the letter a for the
 unknown root, and the letter g for the first assumed root.         Mr.
 Nicholson would insist I should not be understood, unless I wrote
 a for the unknown root; the g also displeased him by              hav                                    its
 ing  so  long    tail.
                    a      had also the initials
                                I                     two alphabets              of                                of
 capital letters.     Mr. Nicholson recommended          use but one,                    to
                                                    by
 and   to  make the distinction        small  figureaunderneath.
    After Mr. Nicholson had discovered another demonstration,
 he   requested me       annex to   my Tract, it   way
                                                   to     Supplement;       by            of

 had done before;          which    by              he
                                     should lose the honour       being                                  of

                                    the old notation.
      Mr. Nicholson did recommend arithmetical equivalents; but
I   saw     no   reason why              he   should         be   complimented                 as   the    inven
tor, since     took he  from Mr. Henry Briggs, the calculator
                                it                                                                                  of

                         Itis
 to   do
       with the theory.
  I  was master       the figurate method
                               of                  theory      the year     in                      in
1780, but poverty kept me from publishing                practising                      or                        it:

  After the manuscript was re-written, upon looking over some
examples      the old manuscript,
                 in                was surprised    Mr. Nichol
                                                         I                                at

 the ancient authors.                                                                                              A  ,

   At page 60 Mr. Nicholson has given an example, in which,
after the subtrahend is formed, the figures necessary to produce
the coefficients for the next step are none of them exhibited.
Mr. Nicholson calls it his own; but in my opinion he ought to
call it his way of working my rule.   In the next page he falsely
asserts that higher multipliers than 9 are necessary in my me
thod.
   The method I have given at the end of my Supplement, Mr.
Nicholson calls Mr. Horner's method; and says I have been an
ticipated by himself in point of publication: but it resembles
Mr. Horner's in no respect, but there being no regard had to the
figurate numbers; so that I have been anticipated by no one in
this method; but Mr. Nicholson has taken good care that I
 should not be long before him, he having made use of              without                             it,

(in one place) contains my method, and a little further on, says
it is superior; but that he does not think it superior, is obvious
from his having instantly adopted mine.        He has not altered the
principle, but has disguised       and made         it,

   Mr. Nicholson has called my demonstration  my Supplement,                          in
a clumsy demonstration;                         he

monstration of his own. There    no doubt but Nr. Nicholson     is
will understand his own neat demonstration; but                                               I          do   not   ex

     In Mr. Horner's nonfigurate method, multiplying and adding
in one line is indispensably necessary, which has been the means
of Mr. Nicholson’s learning it; I have seen him work division,
and he always did it by the long Italian method, in which the
products are written down.

May 1819; my object was          dispense with the figurate numbers

               to
metical equivalents was not         my thoughts,         evident from
                                                        in                                       as   is

  Nov. 16.       A
               Most interesting paper by Sir Humphry Davy,
was read On the Magnetising Influence of Galvanism, in which
various new and curious experiments on this subject were de
tailed, which clearly establish the fact, that the Galvanic fluid,
directed in a proper manner, is capable of communicating mag
netic properties to bars of steel.  If steel bars or rods be ex
posed to the Galvanic current, placed in the direction of the
magnetic axis, no effect follows; but if they be placed parallel
with the magnetic equator they become magnetic—the end
placed to the west becoming the north pole of the new magnet,
and that towards the east becoming the south pole.          And so
great is the Galvanic influence in producing this effect, that it
        if its
exerts    power      at
                      distance

equator, it becomes magnetic.    If we rightly heard the paper,
it is necessary to the success of these experiments that the
Galvanic current be sent not along the bar, but at right angles
to   it,
      across          its
                middle: that    while the direction       is,

that the Moon was now, and would for the next three or four
years continue to be, in such a position with respect to her nodes,
as to pass over the Pleiades every lunation, thus affording a fa
vourable opportunity of observing the occultation of those stars.
A map of the Pleiades was exhibited, on which the apparent
place of the moon, across that remarkable cluster, was laid down,
for those particular days when it will be most interesting to the
observer.—Some valuable tables were presented by Mr. Groom
bridge, on the method of reducing observations of the fixed stars;
accompanied with instructions for the use of the same.—A com
munication was made by M. Gauss, of Göttingen, respecting a
new repeating circle which had been fixed up in the observatory
of that place. This circle was made by Reichenbach, of Munich.
The telescope is attached to an axis, each end of which rests on
a stone pier, similar to a transit instrument: and it is capable of
being reversed in the same manner as that instrument.        To the
axis is annexed a fired circle, three feet in diameter; and also
a moveable circle bearing the level and verniers, by means of
which the repeating principle is obtained.   The telescope is five
feet focal length; and so powerful that M. Gauss states that he
has observed the pole-star, by reflection in water, when nearly
on the meridian at mid-day.    Several observations of stars, with
this instrument,  accompanied  the communication.

                  RETURN OF THE DISCOVERY SHIPS.
Thr    general anxiety that was felt for the safety of His Majesty's
ship Hecla and the Griper gun-brig, employed on a voyage of dis
covery in the Arctic Seas, has been at length happily relieved by
the return of these vessels after an absence of eighteen months.
The particulars of their voyage will no doubt be given to the
public with   allpossible expedition.             In

 We were now    as far as 90 deg. nothing to stop us but ice, which
 delayed us some time; but, after repeated trials, we at length
 succeeded in getting through a passage into the long-looked-for
Polar Sea; our course was as much to the west as the ice would
admit of. By the first week of September we had reached as
far west as 113 deg. W. when we were completely stopped by
ice. Winter set in about the middle of September.        A harbour
was then most anxiously looked for, which we were fortunate
enough to put the ships into by the 26th of September.        It was
a close shave as to time. The sea, or the lanes of water amongst
the ice, which we had hitherto navigated, were now entirely
frozen over.    The ships were housed over, and        things pre                           all
pared for the winter, which, thank God, we passed pretty com
fortably, though cold. We lived                             on

Captain Parry met with no inhabitants,                    but he frequently saw
deserted huts on the shore.                    Only two of the crew had a slight
touch of scurvy.                            -

longitude, as the needle indicated a peculiarity of condition when
they were in that meridian.    The dip, however, did not exceed
86 deg. so that they were not above the Magnetic Pole.”

reached in the parallel of 74 or 75.-114. or l 15. W.-about
550 miles further than Captain Ross asserted the Polar Sea to be
navigable.   In 90. the ships fell in with islands which continued
successively till they reached the extreme westerly point of one
in 115. where winter overtook them.—They wintered in a snug
bay in Lancaster Sound; and did not get clear of the ice till
the 5th of August this year.       From October till February, or
for about 100    days, they  were in darkness; but with abundance
of wholesome   provisions,  and other requisite comforts, they passed
 the time very  agreeably.    The crew were amused with games of
every   kind; and occasionally they acted plays for mutual enter
tainment.     On the breaking up of the ice this season, attempts
were made to proceed westerly; but immense barriers of ice from
the Polar Sea to the northward, shut out             hope             all

Copy of a Letter from Lieutenant William Edward Parry, commanding His
  Mºjesty's ship Hecla, (lately employed with the Griper gun-brig on a
  Voyage of Discovery in the Arctic Seas,) to John Wilson Croker, Esq.
  dated His Majesty's ship Hecla, West coast of Davis's Straits, lat. 70 deg.
  4! inin. N., long. 69 deg. 17 min. W. September 5, 1820.
   “SIR,--I avail myself of an unexpected opportunity by the
Lee, of Hull, whaler, to acquaint you, for the information of my
Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, that His Majesty's ships
under my orders succeeded in discovering a passage through
Lancaster's Sound into the Polar Sea, and penetrated, during
the summer of 1819, as far as the longitude of 1124 deg. west
of Greenwich, between the parallels of 74 deg. and 75 deg. north
latitude.
     “In this space twelve islands have been discovered, and named
the Islands of New Georgia, in honour of His Majesty.          The
expedition wintered in a harbour on the south side of the largest
of these islands (called Melville Island), in latitude 74 deg. 47
min. N. and longitude i 10 deg. 47 min. W., and proceeded to
the westward immediately on the breaking up of the ice at the
 commencement of the present season, the ships being in perfect
condition, the officers and men in excellent health, and with
every prospect of the final accomplishment of our enterprise.
    “At the south-west end of Melville Island, however, the
quantity and magnitude of the ice was found to increase so
much, that for 16 days (being above one-third of the whole na
vigable season in that part of the Polar Sea) it was found im
possible to penetrate to the westward beyond the meridian of
 l i3 deg. 47 min. W. In order, therefore, that no time might be
lost, I determined to try what could be done in a more southern
latitude, and, for that purpose, ran back along the edge of the
ice, which had hitherto formed a continuous barrier to the south
of us, in order to look out for any opening which might favour
the plan I had in view. In this endeavour I was also disappointed;
and the season being so far advanced as to make it a matter of
question whether, with the remaining resources, the object of
the enterprise could now be persevered in with any hope of
success, I consulted the principal officers of the expedition, who
were unanimously of opinion that nothing more could be done,
and that it was, on that account, advisable to return to England.
   “In this opinion it was impossible       me, under existing cir
                                              for
cumstances, not      concur; and trust that the detailed account
                    to                I
of our proceedings, which     shall shortly have the honour
                              I                                  lay   to

though our exertions have not been crowned with complete suc
cess, they will not be found discreditable to the naval honour of
our country.
      “I  beg you will be pleased to acquaint their Lordships, that
having proposed to survey the west coast of Davis's Straits, pre
vious to my return, and being desirous of losing as little as pos
sible of the remaining part of the present season which is fa
vourable for the navigation of these seas, I have not considered
it right to detain the expedition for the purpose of transmitting,
by the Lee, a more full account of this voyage. I shall only
therefore add, that having accomplished the object now in view,
 I hope to reach England by the first week in November.
                          “I   have the honour to be, &c.
                                    “W.   E. PARRY, Lieut. and Com.”
                        Admiralty Office, Nov. 4, 1820.
      “ Lieutenant    Parry, accompanied      by Captain Sabine of the
 Royal Artillery, attached to the expedition, arrived at this office
 this morning.
      “Lieutenant Parry states, that the officers and men of both
 vessels passed the winter without any considerable inconvenience,
 notwithstanding the intense cold (the thermometer having been
 so low as 55 deg. below zero); and that only one man was lost,         -
who died of a chronic disease of the heart.”
      After sailing over the Croker Mountains of Capt. Ross, Lieut.
 Parry gave to the continuation of Lancaster's Sound the name of
 Barrow’s Sound.
      On the north side of Barrow's Sound the voyagers discovered
 a broad channel, up which they could not descry any land, though
the weather was clear and favourable. To the land botanded on
the west by this unexplored channel, and on the south by the               .
 Sound, the maine of New Devon was given.                 Nearly opposite
the channel, i.e. on the south side of the Sound, they met with
another broad inlet (nearly as broad it seemed as the Sound itself),
on which the name of Regent's Inlet was bestowed.                 The ex
pedition sailed up this inlet a considerable way. The land oppo
site to New Devon was denominated                New Somerset.      Many
whales and seals were seen about this part.            Other places disco
vered, received names in honour of Major Rennell, Capt. Sabine,
 and others.
      Among the curious discoveries made, was an American musk
ox, on Melville Island, the principal of the group of islands in
a cove of which this enterprising navigator wintered in 1819.
 This animal       has a large head and shaggy mane resembling the
 lion.     It was
              -    the only one of the species seen during the stay of
    -                                 3 C 2                            the

the expedition at that island.         A white hare was the only small
animal which was met with.            It was found upon another island.
Partridges were seen in great numbers, and the newly discovered
islands also abounded with florescent plants of different unknown
species.       The huts, of which some vestiges remain, are pre
sumed to' have belonged to some Esquimaux, whom chance or
enterprise may have carried into these inhospitable              regions.
Numerous dresses, canoes, &c. &c. have also been brought over
from Baffin's Bay, which are constructed with astonishing natural
genius, industry, and neatness.
      We mentioned the only serious casualty which befell during
 the wintering of the crews in these high latitudes.        Nevertheless
 the cold was so intense, that the utmost care was necessary to
 prevent fatal consequences.         An idea of this may be formed from
 the    fact,  that a servant of     Captain Sabine's, on some alarm of
 fire, ran into the air without covering his hand—it was imme
 diately frost-bitten, and the poor fellow lost three of his fingers.
 No natives were seen, nor any traces of human beings.
      Notwithstanding atten pts made to decry the value of the
 discoveries that are accomplished or contemplated, much com
  mercial benefit has already resulted from the navigation of those
  trackless seas.     The confidence acquired by the experience of
 Capt, Parry, has this year induced the whalers, who had been
  intimidated at the horrors of the higher regions, to venture, as was
  suggested, to the mouth of Lancaster Sound ; and the conse
  quence has been, that they have returned with fuller cargoes than
  were ever known.         In fact, the expenses incurred by the voyages
                                   --
  of   Capt.   Ross and Lieut. (now made master and commander)
  Parry have already been more than repaid to the nation by the
  full cargoes of the whalers, and the certainty obtained, that they
  may navigate Lancaster Sound with safety, and always bring
  home full cargoes.
       Perhaps the most surprising and curious information derived
   from these voyages, is the force of vegetation during the short
  vegetative season in the northern latitudes; of which the botanic
  specimens brought home in the Hecla, and the experiments made
   on the New Georgia Islands, with several of our common gar
   den seeds, afford most striking proofs.—Besides their winter
   amusements of hunting, &c., the officers of the Hecla invented
   also some of an intellectual nature.        We believe we before no
   ticed they performed plays, to which we might add that they
   were their own dramatists.            The New Georgia Gazette, or
   Winter     Chronicle,  of one of the officers, contains some very fair
  jeux-d'esprits, for which the mistakes of some preceding naviga
    tors afforded abundant scope. We have been informed, but we

Colchicum autumnale, or meadow-saffron.                It has been named
Weratrine.
     The seeds of the Cevadilla were those principally operated on.
Ether separates from them a yellow, greasy, unctuous acid sub
stance, being a mixture of elaine, stearine, and a peculiar acid.
[See next Notice.] The seeds were then boiled in alcohol, which
on cooling deposited a little wax. The solution was evaporated
to an extract, re-dissolved in water, and again evaporated, during
which some colouring matter was precipitated. On pouring ace
tate of lead into the solution, an abundant yellow precipitate fell,
leaving the liquid nearly colourless. The excess of lead was pre
cipitated    by sulphuretted hydrogen, and the filtered liquor con
centrated by evaporation was treated with magnesia and again
filtered. The precipitate boiled in alcohol yielded a solution,
which being evaporated left a pulverulent matter extremely bit
ter, and with decidedly alkaline characters.             This matter was
yellow; but being dissolved in alcohol and precipitated by water,
a fine white powder was produced.
     The precipitate by the acetate of lead was found to contain
 gallic acid; and hence it was concluded that the new alkali ex
 isted in the seed as a gallate.
      Weratrine is white, pulverulent, without smell, but excites vi
 olent sneezing : it is very acrid, but not bitter; produces violent
 vomitings in so small doses, that, according to some experiments,
 a few grains may cause death: it is but little soluble in cold
 water: boiling water dissolves about a thousandth part, and ac
 quires an acrid taste: it is very soluble in alcohol, and less so in
 ether : it melts at 50° of the centigrade therm. = 122 Fahr., and
 then appears like wax: when cooled it becomes an amber-coloured
 translucid mass : heated more highly it swells, is decomposed,
 and burns: decomposed by oxide of copper it gives no indication of
nitrogen: it acts on test papers as an alkali, and forms uncrystal
 lizable salts by evaporation; these salts appear like a gum.
     The super-sulphate alone appears to form crystals.               Strong
 solutions of these salts are   decomposed     partially   by  water: vera
 trine is thrown down, and the solution becomes acid. The sul
 phate appears to be composed of
                 Weratrine        93.723   .... 100.0000
                  Sulphuric acid 6.227     ....     6.6441
  In both there was an excess of acid.    Supposing      it an acid salt, and
  in analogy  with the salts of brucine,  the neutral salt will cousist of
                        Veratrine        100.000

  Iodine with Veratrine produces a hydriodate                               and an        iodate;
Chlorine, a muriate and a chlorate.
   Cevadilla was found ultimately to contain elaine, stearine, ce
vadic acid, wax, acid gallate of veratrine, a yellow colouring mat
ter, gum, lignin, and ashes. White hellebore analysed in the
same manner, gave nearly the same results; but was found, to
contain also starch, and the ashes varied a little in the salts they
contained.    Both contained carbonates of lime and of potash,
also silex: the Cevadilla contains also muriate of potash; and the
white hellebore sulphate of lime.
   The Colchicum, examined in precisely the same manner, gave
the same results, but with the addition of inuline. The ashes
were in so small a proportion as not to call for attention.
                         CEVADiC ACID.
   This acid is obtained by distilling the greasy, unctuous acid.
substance (mentioned in the preceding notice), saturating what
passes over with barytes, and evaporating to dryness, which pro
duces a white salt.   An addition of phosphoric acid caused the
appearance of crystals; and distilling at a low heat made the
acid pass over. This acid is crystallizable, soluble in water, fusi
ble, and volatile at a low temperature; soluble in ether and in
alcohol, and capable of forming salts with bases.

    known to be a fungus, whose roots being in the straw of the corn,
    cannot, therefore, be very deep ; if I sprinkle the corn with a so
    lution of salt, why should not the fungi languish and die as well as
    weeds when properly dosed at their roots with salt       The expe
    riment was tried, and the result such as was anticipated, and
    without any injury to the wheat, salt having no injurious effect on
    fibrous matter, whether vegetable or animal. The expense in this
    case ceases to be any object; for six or eight bushels will serve
    an acre, which, at the price of salt applied to agriculture, will be
    under twenty shillings, and this will be more than repaid by the
    improvement of the manure arising from the salted straw.      Two
    men, one to spread, and the other to supply him with the salt
    water, will get over four acres in a day.     The operation of the
    remedy is very quick: in less than eight-and-forty hours even the
    vestiges of the disease are hardly discernible.      efficacy has                        Its

The above heights are corrected for the size of the tube.
    Not observing any corresponding observations in your last
Number, I am almost afraid your readers, who possess barome
ters, are not fully aware of the great importance to the scientific
world it is to know the altitude of the different towns and villages
in the United Kingdom. Or perhaps they may suppose the
course of observations a matter of difficulty.          A single trial will
convince them of the facility of the task.
    I am this day favoured with the observations made by Colonel
Beaufoy at his observatory, Bushy Heath, viz.
                    8 h.       29.527        44'5       4l

 By a comparison of my portable barometer with two excellent
 instruments of Colonel Beaufoy, I have discovered a slower sub
 sidence of the mercury in the closed cisterns than I had been
 given to expect.       I shall therefore avail myself of an early op
 portunity of attempting to find the length of time necessary to
 wait after fining up the instrument before the reading ought to
 be made.     It is right to observe, that this precaution is not ne
 cessary with barometers that have an open basin, and on that ac
 count are more to be depended upon for simgle and expeditious
 observations; although for portability the mountain barometer,
 as improved by Sir H. Englefield, is by far the most convenient.

LXIV.      Observations on M.ARAGo's “Reclamation” respecting
     his Ocular Micrometer, published in the Annales de Chimie
     et de Physique.   By the Rev. W. PEARson, LL.D. & F.R.S.
     Treasurer of the Astronomical Society.
                            To Mr. Tilloch.
Sir,    —A FRIEND       of mine has lately put into my hands one of
the numbers of the Annales de Chimie et de Physique (August
1820) published by Messrs. Gay-Lussac and Arago at Paris, in
which number is contained a paper subscribed by the initial A,
which makes an unwarranted attack on me, on the score of pla
giarism.
    At the first meeting of the Astronomical Society of London, on
March 10, 1820, a Memoir of mine was read “On the doubly
refracting Property of Rock-crystal, considered as a Principle of
micrometrical Measurements when applied to a Telescope;” and
at the subsequent meeting on the 10th of April, a second Me
moir by me was read “On the Construction and Use of a new
micrometrical Eye-piece of a Telescope,” which Memoirs have
not yet been published; but the reports given of these in your
 Philosophical Magazine, and in the Edinburgh Philosophical
 Journal, have produced a belief in the mind of the writer A, who
 can be no other person than Mr. Arago of the Royal Observa
 tory of Paris, that an attempt has been made by me, or by your
 Reporter and Dr. Brewster's (who are unknown to me in that ca
 pacity), to deprive Mr. Arago of the honour of an original inven
  tion exclusively his own.
     Mr. Arago states as reasons for the publication of his Re
 clamation, that he waited two months to see if the reports given
 in the Philosophical Magazine of June [or rather of March and
 April] should be contradicted by me, and that he had forgotten
 my address, or he would have written to me on the subject of
 my having claimed his invention of the rock-crystal micrometer;
  he then proceeds to inform his scientific readers, that he became
  acquainted with me in London four years ago; that in the sum.
 mer of 1819-1 visited the Observatory of Paris, with a view of
  learning the use of astronomical instruments (quelque travail as
 tronomique); to justify the choice that the Royal Society of Lon
  don, had previously made of me as a member; that he pointed
  out the observation of double stars as a proper object of my re
  searches, which subject he says I had previously considered, but
  could not pursue it on account of the defects in my micrometers;
  that he then showed me a particular instrument of his contri
  vance, which he then applied to a telescope by Lerebours, and
   with it determined the diameter of a ball which terminates the
      Wol, 56. No. 272. Dec. 1820.            3 E             steeple

402               Olservations on the Ocular Microméter.
 steeple of Ville-Juif. The writer then states, that I manifested.
 a desire to procure one of those new instruments, which would
 promote my views exactly, and that he recommended to me Mons.
 Soleil of Feydau Passage, who at that time he says was making a
 similar instrument for Dr. Gilbert of Leipzig, as a proper man to
 make me the instrument in question; that this artist undertook
 the commission at his request, and finished it by his direction,
 before I left Paris. The author then takes some pains to prove
 that his instrument had been made and used some years, and
 says that in accumulating proofs he apprehends he may be                                                  in
juring me, and therefore he suggests the propriety of my reply
 ing, as I presume, through the medium of your Magazine. In
 a postscript Mr. Arago tells his readers, that a young Polish as
 tronomer, Dr. Slawinski, had arrived in Paris from Loudon, and
 had brought with him an instrument, made by an English artist,
eractly like those which Fortin had constructed for the Obser
vatory of Paris, except that the prisms were ten times thicker
than are made in Paris, and that consequently they would be use
less with a high power; and lastly, he asserts that the exterior
faces of the prism ought not to stand at right angles to the op
tical axis of the telescope, and that he shall himself shortly pub
lish a description of the Ocular Micrometer, together with all
necessary details respecting                    its
                                  construction, and the various uses

prism  to go: from this circumstance I immediately concluded
that two images might also probably be formed by a prism, after
the rays had proceeded through the lenses constituting the eye
piece, but did not perceive, at the time, what the measure of an
angle would be that might probably be so obtained.        I desired
Mons. Lenoir to adapt me a double prism of clear crystal to a
cell, that I might apply it to the eye-end of a telescope, for the
purpose of making experiments on this mode of application; on
which he laughed at the idea, and assured me that as the angle
of every prism is constant, there is no other way but that adopted
by Rochon, by which a variety of measures could be taken;
when I endeavoured to explain to him how Dr. Brewster had
varied the measure, in his patent telescope, by a variation in the
power, a term which it appeared he did not understand, till I
hit upon the word amplification. At length Mons. Lenoir un
dertook to comply with my wish of his fitting a prism into a cell;
but he had no idea that a small prism, somewhat larger than
the pupil of the eye, would have been sufficient for my purpose,
and therefore he mounted one large enough to be used on Ro
chon's principle.
   “While this prism was preparing, I visited Mr. Arago at the
Royal Observatory; and on informing him what I had in hand,
 he appeared surprised, and fetched from a private cup-board or
drawer, a celestial eye-piece, with a small prism actually applied

lenses only modify the measure            the angle

me, except that              he
                          tabulated, from experiment, the angular
measures which resulted from different arrangements               his lenses,

that produced different amplifications; and that the angles                                    so
measured are very small; but the objects appeared,                      said,        he

the King's private observatory in Kew Gardens, brought then
back through Richmond Park, and then gave them such a
dinner as the season would afford, and invited eight eminent
artists and chemists from London on purpose to meet them.
 It strikes me, however, that these savans might have recollected
the party to which they were introduced, and the site of the
 Observatory near the gate of Richmond Park, where they dined,
if  they could not recollect the hospitality they experienced, and
the instruments they professed to admire.
    “But the English artists,” says Mr. A. in his postscript, “have
shown their ignorance in making the prisms of double refraction,
or they would not have made them to a thickness of ten millimé
tres, instead of one, thereby rendering them useless.” This remark,
coming from talents of the first eminence, would have struck at
the root of English ingenuity, if it could have been brought fairly to
bear on      its
               marked object; but unfortunately for the writer, those
very prisms         Dr. Slawinski's eye-piece, which are made the

the motion in question was effected by the means I laid down in

optical axis of the eye-piece, in which position it yet remains;

                    from the Fruit of the common Arbutus.                                      407
first about a thousand hogsheads were obtained, and the                                      follow
ing year this quantity was more than doubled.
    The spirit was of a good quality; it was sold at Trieste at
the average price of 100 livres the hogshead. The expense of ma
nufacture amounted only to 30 livres.      It has a taste singularly
agreeable, and not in the least empyreumatic, so that it may be
very well employed in the preparation of fine liqueurs. It was
in great request at Trieste.
    The fruit of the arbutus is attended with this precious advan
tage, that it succeeds perfectly in those years when the olive and
the raisin fail, which it is well known are the principal produc
tions of the Dalmatian islands.
    To manufacture the arbutus spirit, the fruit is collected at the
moment that it begins to soften, and is easily plucked from the
tree; it is bruised, and put into vessels to ferment. When there
is not enough of juice to cover the skins of the fruit, sea-water
is added, and the mass is stirred twice every day.       If the fruit
were left in immediate contact with the air, it would become
soured; besides, the sugar being badly dissolved and the mass too
little diluted, it could not conveniently ferment.
    From the moment that the fermentation has actively com
menced, a quantity of liquid is withdrawn every day by a cock
at the bottom of the vessel, and poured again on the surface of
the matter in fermentation.      This gives a uniform progress to
the fermenting process throughout the whole mass.
   As soon as the fermentation is finished, the liquid is withdrawn,
and submitted to distillation. It furnishes about the fourth of

    But to proceed. The Chaldean period is the most perfect and
shortest of any, in which the solar and lunar motions, and the
motions of their perigee and nodes, are nearly coincident.       The
other periods, which I before stated, show the analogy which
subsists between the solar years and the lunar periods.        But if
the G) and ) were in conjunction at the beginning of those pe
riods, the like circumstance would not take place in a series of
consecutive returns, owing to the D’s perigee and nodes not
being in conjunction also. The conjunction would likewise be
 affected by the D's acceleration.     In reference to the period of
395 12 solar years (and not 365.12 as stated at page 356), con
taining 488695 lunations, wanting only five seconds of the line
of conjunction of the G) and D ; this calculation is founded on
the mean motion of the luminaries (see note, p. 14), and is given
in order to show the absurdity of instituting such long periods, as
the D’s accel. amounts to nearly 760 degrees          It is a matter
of surprise to me, that Mr. Yeates could view it in any other
light, it being actually so expressed. In regard to the period
alluded to in Ferguson's Astronomy, as revised by me, viz. of
 13700 years, it may be necessary to observe, that the lunar
motions are arrived at a degree of perfection of which Mr. Y.
appears to be totally ignorant. They did not attain their present
elevation from data and proceedings similar to those of your
 correspondent,    but from an accumulated mass of astronomical
observations; viz. of transits, and zenith distances, &c. made
 during a period of many years, and the subsequent results com
 pared with ancient observations and eclipses: so that, if the falling
 back of the line of the nodes can be ascertained during the space
 of about a century only, it is surely no great presumption to
calculate their period, as is done in respect to the revolution of
the earth's perigee, and the equinoctial points: some have even
gone so far as to calculate when the time will arrive when the
ecliptic will coincide with the equalor, and a universal spring pre
vail all over the earth. But this idea is erroneous, as the revolu
tions of the former appear to be consecutive, while that of the
latter is only vibratory.     Mr. Yeates admits that it was by the
aid of a period of 600 years, that Hipparchus extended his science
in calculating ephemerides of the sun and moon, as he is related
to have done, and that with sufficient exactness for the regu
lating of their calendar.—Wide p. 358. As I before remarked,
in the time of Sir Isaac Newton, the lunar tables gave the
  ) 's long. to within five minutes of a degree from the truth;
whereas they now give it to within ten seconds, and generally
much nearer. So that, embracing the lunar motions at the pre

410                  Remarks on the Lunar Theory.
vantage in my favour is as 30 to 23, even admitting that no im
provement was made in the lunar theory from the time of Hip
parchus to that of Newton /      I therefore contend that an entire
period is completed within the limits of 760 Chaldean periods.
As I before asserted, the difference produced by the D’s accel.,
even if it was completely neglected as far as the period affects
the earth, would only atmount to about one hour; and as the D's
accel. is proportional to the square of the time, it would in a
complete period amount to but little more than four days only.
   I do not contend that the knowledge of these long periods is
a matter of any great importance; but they evidently convey an
idea of the sublimity and grandeur of the celestial motions. Mr.
Yeates (at p. SS) has given us a statement of the mean synodic
revolutions of the D as stated by different astronomers: the
 mean of the last ten of them, or from the time of Hipparchus,
amounts to 29 days 12 hours 44 minutes 2 seconds 35 thirds,
which differs from the respective results of Messrs. Vince, Gre
gory, Woodhouse, Squire, Young, Lalande, Laplace, Delambre,
Biot, Burg, and Burckhardt, by less than one-fourth of a second
only    Mr. Yeates on the opposite page has given four results
adduced from his own calculations, the mean of which is 29 days
12 hours 44 minutes 28 seconds 9 thirds; the extremes of the
above are those of Ptolemy and Whiston, 45 thirds in excess,
and 2 minutes 35 thirds in deficiency respectively.     Mr. Y.'s
 mean exceeds the mean of the ten results above referred to, by
 25 seconds 34 thirds: his difference is therefore 34 times greater
 than that of Ptolemy in excess; and Whiston's difference from
 the mean result is only about one-tenth part in deficiency of
 what Mr. Yeates's is in excess | There must surely be some
 subtilly, or something superlatively grand and exquisite, in the
 calculations of Mr. Yeates, as he differs 34 times in excess, from
                                                      all

most evidently that the true motions of the sun and moon's
apogee and node must agree at and after such an interval, or
such phaenomena could not take place.
   It appears, sir, to this gentleman, of little consequence, whether
the D is distant from her node ten degrees on the one side, or
ten degrees on the other; or whether the D is within 90 degrees
of her perigee, it appears to be a circumstance which he has not
given himself the trouble to ascertain.        Where eclipses are ob
served in various parts of the globe, it is necessary to reduce the
time to one meridian; and also to apply the equation of time
before the interval between the eclipses can be truly ascertained.
The difference of longitude of the G) and ) must also he taken
into the account; the D must likewise be                                         divested of the equa
tions which regulate the inequalities in her                                     motion, and the cor
rection for the acceleration applied before                                       her mean motion in
longitude, or her mean synodic revolution,                                        can be correctly as
certained.
     The acceleration of the   D is a periodical equation (as indeed
are   all
        the equations which   regulate   her motion);      period    very                  its                    is

   In Dr. T.’s Table, the specific Gravity of atmospheric Air is
assumed to be 1.0000, and that of Hydrogen is found to be
0-0694; this last, and 21 others of the numbers expressing the
specific Gravities, being repeating decimals; as an expert Arith
metician would at once perceive, from observing the prime Nuin
ber 3, to be a multiple, in so many of the Denominators of the
Fractions, in the third column of my Table, in the last page;
wherein I have omitted these repeating Decimals, and in column 2,
set down the Numbers, expressing, how many times the weight
of Hydrogen, answers to the weight of each Gas, under equal
Bulks and Pressures.       The vulgar Fractions in column 3, ex
press the relations which the several specific Gravities, indicated
in col. 1, bear to 1 (or +) which is here set against atmospheric
or coll) in Oll all".
   The square-roots of the Fractions in col. 3, have furnished
the Ralios, from whence the corresponding musical Intervals in
col. 4, have been calculated, and expressed in the correct Nota

through your pages, in the year 1807 *.

Gas whose sound is a half-note more grave, than the sound of
this standard Air.
   It so happens, through the peculiar progressions in which the
numbers of the three ranges expressing X, f and m, increase
each way, from 0 against the Standard Air, that for every pur
pose of comparison, and for almost the nicest purposes of calcu
lation, the two latter ranges may be disregarded, and the num
bers (and their decimals) in the X range, may be considered as
artificial Commas, exactly 612 of which make up an Octave.

adhesion, as to form small clods, which, however, break with a
slight touch; thes", according to fertility, produce from 500 to
700 bushels per acre, and sometimes even more.              But here it is
particularly necessary to observe, that the cultivation is not con
fined to such rich sand; for the root is sown on very poor ones,
such as will not produce above 200 bushels per acre: nor is the
culture confined to any sort of sand, but is found on         dry loams,                         all

the quantity may be smaller than upon loam: in my own practice
I sowed 5 lbs., but had reason to think six, seven, or eight might
have been better; the expense of hoeing will however somewhat
increase with the quantity sown.        The choice of seed is a point
of  great   consequence;    it should  always  be new, as old seed is
always a week later of coming up, which increases the difficulty
in hoeing: good seed, when rubbed in the hand, yields a pleasant
aromatic scent.      The most careful cultivators steep it for forty
cight hours in water; and Mr. Burrows mixes it well with earth
for a week, with the same view. It is absolutely necessary to
break the clinging fibres of the seed, by which it is so apt to adhere
together, and render even sowing difficult: some force it repeatedly
through wire sieves; others thrash it with flails; but at        events                             of
the  object  must  be,   some       by

regular defence.     They have also with success been formed into
pies, in the method used for potatoes, but much more slightly
covered, against frost.       But, whatever method is pursued, the
farmer should not for a moment forget, that he should be more
careful to guard against heating and rotting than against frost:
if they are put together dry, and rain be entirely kept out, so
that   allsteam may pass easily through the thatch, they will keep

of carrots, and 28 cwt. of hay: with Mr. Burrows's crops, this
is about one acre of the former.  In another trial by the same
person, accurately conducted, by weighing alive, but no hay
given, the increased weight of the bullocks paid, beef at 9d. per
pound from 7; d. to 8d. per bushel of 54 lbs., and each two and
a half bushels per diem for the first 28 days, but no hay was
given.
   From the preceding minutes, it is sufficiently obvious, that
carrots may be safely relied on as a highly beneficial article for
fattening oxen; and there is every reason to believe, that this
application is profitable.
                                            § 3.-Cows.
    The experiments which have been published on the result of
feeding cows with carrots, are few, and not detailed in the most
satisfactory manner; but they are sufficient to prove, that the
food is excellent in relation to the condition of the stock, the .
quantity of milk, and the flavour of the butter.       Mr. Billing was
highly satisfied with the effect. The result with Mr. Cope was.
still more satisfactory, giving his cows two bushels per diem.
Mr. Onley's, by one bushel per diem, with oat straw, produce
5 lbs. per week of the finest butter in January; if we reckon the
butter at 20d. per lb., it is 8s. 4d. for seven bushels of carrots,
or    1s.   2;per bushel.

been found          Woodbridge.

sixty porkers, the meat being excellent and delicate. Mr. Burke
in   1770 (afterwards the celebrated and right honourable states
man) informed me, when            was with him
                                             I        Beaconsfield, that   at

     In

   Mr. Harvey, in Worcestershire, gained as good barley after
carrots without manure, as after turnips manured.
   In the various experiments of Mr. Burrows, the barley which
he gained after carrots yielded amply, rarely less than five quar
ters per acre.
   These facts are sufficient to prove that carrots, so far from
having any exhausting quality, do actually improve land to a very
high degree.

   Comparing carrots with every other fallow crop, their supe
riority is perhaps in no other point so decisive as in this: if the
seed be good, the crop may be considered as certain; they are

LXIX.    Note upon the Combination of Sulphur with Chrome,
    and upon a new Process for obtaining the Oxide of that Me
    tal. By J. L. LAssaign E *.
Is making lately some experiments  upon, the oxide of chrome,
I endeavoured without success to decompose it by sulphur, in
order to obtain a combination of metal with this combustible
body, both by melting the mixture of the two bodies in a cruci
ble, and by making the vapour of the sulphur pass over the oxide
of chrome heated white red in a porcelain tube.          I despaired of
succeeding; when, reflecting upon the property which the greater
part of the metallic chlorurets possess of being decomposed by
sulphur and converted into chlorurets, the idea occurred to me
of submitting the muriate of chrome in a dried state (which I
consider as a chloruret) to the action of sulphur.
   After having prepared some chloruret from pure chrome, by
boiling together chromic acid and hydrochloric acid in excess,
I evaporated it to dryness in a porcelain vessel: in this state it
was of a hortensia-rose colour in the form of a mass very slightly
puffed up : being reduced to powder and mixed with five times
itsweight     flourof  sulphur,

two bodies were combined, I transformed them into sulphuric
and chromic acids by means of nitrate of potash, and I deduced
the quantity of sulphur from that of the sulphate of barytes, ob
tained by precipitating the solution of the residue of that cal
cination by the nitrate acid of barytes.
   According to the mean result of the two experiments, I con
cluded that the sulphuret of chrome, which I had prepared, was           -
formed as follows:
                    Chrome    . . . . . . . . 100.00                    -

   These experiments led me to a more prompt and oeconomica
method of preparing oxide of chrome of a beautiful green co
lour, and which may always be obtained of the same degree of
                          -                                          -
intensity.
    This method consists in calcining to redness, in a hard
earthen crucible, a mixture of the chromate of potash and sul
phur, in equal parts, and steeping in water the greenish inass
which remains, in order to dissolve the sulphate and the sulphuret
of potash which are formed by that operation.               The oxide of
chrome is precipitated, and may be obtained pure after several
washings.
   It is not necessary to have the chromate of potash crystallised,
in order to extract from it by this process the oxide of chrome.
I have also obtained a beautiful colour by calcining with the          sul
phur the produce of the evaporation of a solution of chromate
of iron treated with nitre, which I had previously saturated by
dilute sulphuric acid, in order to precipitate the alumine and silex
which very often accompany that mineral.

within the limits mentioned by him. This induced me to make
a calculation of the time of beginning for Leighton; and I was
surprised   to find the time differ more than four minutes from
the time given by so good an observation.    I take it for granted,
thar Mr. B. has been misled by the equation of time in the
Nautical Almanac being marked Add, instead of Sul.
    I hope, if this has been the case, Mr. B. will have the good
ness to give the times thus corrected in the same explicit man
 ner in which he sent you his former observations.
    In a calculation of this eclipse by Mr. MacGregor, noticed in
 your last Magazine, and upon which you have bestowed such
 merited encomiums, I have observed that he has made the equa
 tion of time rather too great; but his 14th and 31st equations
 of longitude, being respectively 0".78, and 0.9 too small, will
 very nearly balance the error in the equation of time.
     Your inserting the above will oblige,

 Tur    beautiful discovery of Professor Leslie on the artificial
 congelation of water has successively engaged the attention of
 many learned philosophers and chemists.     They have sought to
 give to this discovery a more extended application, in order to
 convert it to some great object of utility; and already their la
 bours have led to the discovery of some particular results which
 might otherwise have remained long concealed.       In the mean
 time it must be useful to make known all the facts connected
 with this discovery; and I am therefore induced to publish the
 result of an experiment by which I effected the congelation of
 water promptly and with the greatest facility.
    Into a metal vase half filled with water, I poured very gently
 an equal quantity of ether, so that no mixture might take place
 of the two liquids. The vase was placed under the receiver of
 an air-pump, which was so fixed upon          support its           as
                                                                remain    to
 quite steady when the          air
                              was pumped out.                  At

The    following is a brief sketch of the speech of Sir Humphry
Davy on being elected President of the Royal Society.
   After expressing to the members his deep sense of the honour
they had done him in placing him in their chair, Sir Humphry
entered into some general views of the present state of the Royal
Society,             its
             relations     other scientific bodies, and
                                      to                     the pro                 on

                                                   In      the history           of
of the Society, experiments were made with the apparatus belong

   The President took an extensive view of the different depart
tnents of science which seemed to offer promising subjects of new
investigation.    In the Mathematical sciences he pointed at the
application of the doctrines of quantity, weight, and number; to
the elementary philosophy of chemistry; and to many other
parts of general physics.
   In Astronomy, he referred to the system of the fixed stars, the
motions of the comets, and of the bodies which in passing through
our atmosphere throw down showers of stones; for it cannot
be doubted (he said) that these extraordinary phaenomena do
not depend upon fortuitous or accidental formations in the at
mosphere; but are owing to heavy bodies which in a system
where      all
          appears harmonious must      governed     fixed laws      be                        by
and intended for definite purposes.
  InOptics,         he
                mentioned the discoveries Wollaston and Young,           of
which, followed    those  by Malus, Arago, Biot, and Brewster,
                                             of
have opened       curious connexion between the crystalline forms
                    a
of  bodies and their relations        the particlesto    light.                    of
     In Electricity, the learned President alluded             the wonder                to
ful instrument       Volta, which
                         of                              he
                                           said had done more for the
recondite chemico-physical sciences than the telescope for astro
nomy,        the microscope for natural history.
               or                                            He referred                                         to
the new field opened                    by

   In alluding to Vegetable and Animal Physiology, he described
the imperfect state of these sciences, and said that the Society
had a right to expect elucidation of them from those disciples
of the schools of Grew and of Hunter, who had already done so
much       for
          the Anatomy      Plants and for Comparative Anatomy.

may have been formed as to the real justice of the case, no one,

has terminated as it has done; it would have been hard, that,
when clearly proved no fraud was intended, the omission of giv

so heavy a loss as 70,000l.   This determination, however, does
not alter the view of the scientific part of the question,-the dis

     Such   quantity of water as a river or pool must contain a very
               a
considerable portion of oxygen gas, thus absorbed from the air ;
and when we consider with what force the atmosphere presses
upon the water, it will not be absurd to presume that the oxygen
absorbed by the seeds is speedily replaced from the incumbent
atmosphere.
    I will here take the opportunity of remarking, that Saussure
 has attempted to prove that no oxygen gas is absorbed by the
 seed, and that the whole of it is thrown out in combination with
 the carbon, forming (of course) carbonic acid.      If the carbon                             all
is   thus extricated, whence comes         that the plant increases?

 with him, among other objects of curiosity, the skeletons and
 skins of an enormous Hippopotamus, a Rhinoceros, and three
 Whales, one of which is 75 feet in length. It was not till after a
 month passed in the midst of imminent dangers, that M. Lalande
 met with that dreadful monster the Hippopotamus: when he
  received his death wound, he rushed rapidly into the river, which
  he discoloured with his blood. It required ten pair of oxen to
  draw him out of the river, and M. Lalande was compelled to erect
  a rampart of bamboo cane round the dead animal, to protect the
  carcase from being devoured by wild beasts. The whole collection
  brought home by M. Lalande for the Museum at Paris, comprises
   15,000 articles. This enterprising naturalist speaks with rapture
   of the kind and hospitable conduct of the British settlers. . A
   Paris Journal says, “Great praise is due to the English for their
   hospitable and generous conduct towards M. Lalande.       The Hon.

   penalties; but this interdiction was dispensed with in favour of
   the French naturalist; they aided him in every thing calculated
  to ensure success, without however concealing from him that they
   thought success impossible.    When, contrary to        expectation,           all
  he  had succeeded, the  English  cordially rejoiced, and loaded the
 fortunate hunter with sincere congratulations.”

   A few days ago an eel, of the common species, but of extraor
dinary dimensions, got entangled in the herring cruives on the
Firth of Forth, near Higgins' Neuk. On being approached by
the fishermen, it flapped            its

                       Aprlt COT TREES.
  A gentleman of Chichester has now in his pleasure grounds
a few standard  apricot trees of an uncommon size. The history
of them   may prove   of great advantage to horticulture. The
present possessor recollects his ancestors having twelve or four
teen of them; but upon coming into his own hands, he cut most of
them down as unproductive,     never having known them to bear
fruit. About four were left as ornamental trees to the ground,
which have begun to produce within the last six years an annual
abundant crop : one of these the last summer yielded five bushels
of large ripe fruit.   It appears by the above statement, that
standard apricot  trees will not bear fruit until 40 or 50 years
old.
              The DEAF AND DUMB RESTORED.
   The Narrateur de la Meuse contains the following article on
the cure of two deaf and dumb persons, who recovered their
hearing and speech.     This novel and successful operation was
performed by M. Deleau, a young practitioner, a doctor of me
dicine, of the Faculty of Paris, ex-surgeon to the 4th regiment of
cuirassiers,  and now established at Mibiel (Meuse). The two
deaf and dumb who underwent the operations (whereby he per
forated with dexterity and success the meatus auditorius) are
Mademoiselle Bivier de St. Mibiel, aged 16 years, and the Sieur
Toussaint, son of the assistant magistrate of Hans-sur-Meuse,
aged 28 years.
   The young girl is doing extremely well. It is more than a
month since she underwent the operation.     Her left ear is per
fectly healed, and the opening   made to the tympanum always
continues; which is absolutely necessary. She takes notice of
the least sounds, and begins to articulate words in a very satis
factory manner.    Her vivacity pleases, and her figure changes
for the better. She is incessantly humming various airs which
her sisters teach her.
   The young man of Hans-sur-Meuse, who was operated upon
a short time since, hears as well as his comrades, and even more
lively. His right ear is finer than his left—he makes constant
efforts to pronounce    all sorts of  words.   The surgeon, from
whom we have the   particulars,  hopes                 or
                                          It in
                                       that   three    four months

must be instructed like children, who begin to make the first
efforts to articulate.
   M. Deleau informs us, that he is constructing an instrument,
which will afford the happy facility of finishing the operation in
three minutes, by which        success will        its

at ten feet above the level of the neighbouring river.
