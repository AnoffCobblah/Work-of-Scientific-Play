2             Dr. Karl Heumann's Contributions to
    I have generally in my remarks adopted a chronological
arrangement of the various researches, because it is only thus
that #. course of thought which            I  have followed can be
logically represented.    A systematic arrangement would, it
is true, place the simpler before the more complex conditions;
but in the present case the latter, which occur chiefly in the
case of luminous carbon-containing flames, are the more im
portant and have been more studied,
    The experience gained from the study of flames burning
under complex conditions is tested and applied in the case of
simpler flames, and so becomes a guide to the explanation of
the conditions affecting luminous flames in general.
  Diminution and Restoration of Luminosity in Hydrocarbon
                               flames.
   In the greater number of researches which have hitherto
been conducted upon the luminosity of flames, those flames
have been principally examined the luminosity of which is to
be ascribed to the presence of carbon, and methods of            re
search in which the luminosity has been either increased or
diminished have, for the most part, been adopted.
    Such methods are open to many objections, the principal
of which (viz. the introduction of various agencies acting
now in this way, now in the opposite, during the same ex
periment) has been too much overlooked.                 By reason of
this oversight, researches, leading to diametrically opposed
conclusions, have been published; and since Davy's theory
is no longer of universal application, we have been left with
out any means of bringing the facts concerning luminous
flames into harmony with one another.
   Frankland has broached the hypothesis that the luminosity
of flame is not due to particles of suspended carbon, but is
caused by the vapours of heavy hydrocarbons which radiate
white light.    Strong positive evidence in support of a view
so much at vañance with the generally accepted theory, could
hardly be expected ; and Frankland has relied principally
upon the fact that we are acquainted with many luminous
flames in which we cannot suppose that solid matter is
present.
    To the instances already known Frankland has added the
interesting observation that hydrogen and carbon monoxide
 when burned in oxygen under a pressure of 10 to 20 at
mospheres, yield a luminous flame affording a continuous
 spectrum, and also that the <U+017F>aintly luminous flame of alcohol
becomes as bright as that of a candle when the pressure is        in
 creased to 18 or 20 atmospheres".           These experiments   are

not so convincing as might at first sight appear, inasmuch as
we know that the temperature of the flame is increased at
high pressures", and also that at the temperature of the electric
spark many gases yield a continuous in place of a line spectrum.
The power of gases as regards emission of light also varies
considerably under these circumstances; and it does not ap
pear that we are absolutely necessitated, as Frankland has
 |.
supposed, to ascribe the increase in luminosity to the increased
density of the gas, although doubtless this circumstance is
not without considerable influence.
    The inquiry as to the nature of hydrocarbon-flames is quite
independent of the meaning which we may attach to these
                ; and if Frankland puts forward the above-cited
phenomena of combustion as analogies to guide him in views
concerning carbon-flames, no very forcible argument can be
really deduced from the examples, because, as W. Stein f has
pointed out, it cannot be shown that the reaction in luminous
carbonaceous flames must be an analogous one to that described
above.
 .
    Frankland's declaration that the soot must be regarded as
an accumulation of heavy hydrocarbons whose vapours are
condensed on the cold body brought into the flame, may be
 regarded as almost confuted by Stein's objection that in this
 case the soot must become gaseous at higher temperatures
                                                     lº
 (which is not the case).
    New doubts arise concerning the prevailing theory when
 we consider that the admixture not                         of air, but also of
 nitrogen, carbon dioxide, or other completely indifferent gases,
 with coal-gas causes a great decrease in the luminosity of the
 flame of that gas.         Hence we cannot trace the decrease in
               solely to the more energetic oxidation of carbon
 contained in the flame.
    The experiments                      f
                           of Stein and R. Blochmann $ allow us
 to suppose     that, the particles of carbon being more widely
  separated
            '.     the admixed gases, the oxygen of the air is able
 to oxidize them to carbon monoxide more quickly than under
  the ordinary circumstances of combustion.
     To the theory of these authors, viz. that diminution of
  luminosity is a consequence of dilution. Wibel || opposes the
  view that the absorption of heat brought about by the admix
  ture of an indifferent gas is the sole cause of decrease in

4               Dr. Karl Heumann's Contributions               to
 luminosity. Wibel was led to this view by considering the
 fact that a mixture of coal-gas and air, nitrogen, or carbon
 dioxide, which burned with a blue flame, became luminous
 and burned with a smoky flame when the tube from which
 the mixture issued was strongly heated.          In this case the
 dilution must have been increased by the increase of tempera
 ture ; nevertheless the flame became luminous.
     In order to convince one's self of the justness of the conclu
 sions which are drawn from this observation, it is necessary to
 examine somewhat closely the method adopted by Wibel in
 his investigation.     He says, “A tube of platinum, 8 to 10
 centims. in   length, is attached to an ordinary Bunsen's burner
 which is closed at the bottom; the gas to be burned is brought
 into the burner by means of a tube soldered to the lower part;
 when the flame of the burning gas has been adjusted to the
proper point, the indifferent gas is admitted until the flame is
 rendered non-luminous ; the platinum tube is then heated by
means of two non-luminous Bunsen flames held horizontally
on either side of the tube, so as to ensure that it be equally
heated . . . . The same appearance is noticed in the case of
the ordinary Bunsen flame, rendered non-luminous by ad
mixed air, when the platinum tube is placed in the opening
of the lamp and is heated.”
    The last mentioned experiment, as described by Wibel, must
be controlled before one can justly identify the diminution of
luminosity in the Bunsen burner with Knapp's experiments
upon diminution.       Some time ago Barentin * showed that the
amount of luminous gas which enters a given space is very
different according as the gas is or is not ignited.       Barentin
believed that the explanation of the smaller amount of gas
entering a burning lamp was to be found in the counter
pressure exercised by the burning, and therefore expanding
   as, upon the entering gas.       Blochmann      f
                                                  showed that the
   iminished consumption of gas was to be traced solely to the
increase of volume caused by the gas passing over the heated
 upper part of the burner.
        e fact that a mixture of gases issuing from a Bunsen
lamp through a strongly heated tube burns with a luminous
flame, may therefore be due to canses other than that put
 forward by Wibel, viz, rise in temperature of the flame ; for
 it is evidently an improbable supposition that the consumption
 of gas, and therefore also the quantity of            byair

main the same when the mixture is passed over a hot as when
it is passed over a cold tube.
    I  was therefore compelled to alter the conditions of experi
ment in order to render void that particular effect of the hot
tube which has just been described.
    If  rise of temperature of the flame is the cause of increased
luminosity, the effect must be the same if one heats, not the
gaseous mixture, but only the indifferent gas. This experi
ment may be readily carried out with a Bunsen's burner,
through the two air-tubes of which are passed small platinum
tubes about 7 centims. in length ; the outer openings of these
tubes are narrowed so that a quantity of air just sufficient to
bring about complete non-luminosity is allowed to enter.
    A thin-walled glass tube, the upper rim of which is covered
with platinum, may, with advantage, take the place of the
ordinary metal tube of the Bunsen's lamp ; the latter tends
to cool the heated air to too great an extent.          On lighting
the    gas  issuing   from the   glass, tube it burns with a non
luminous flame; but on strongly heating the two platinum
tubes by means of Bunsen's burners (care being taken that
the products of combustion do not enter the platinum tubes)
the flame becomes luminous.
    It might be supposed that this fact is to be explained on
 the supposition that the volume of air passing over the plati
 num tubes is unaltered by heating these tubes, but that the
 true quantity of air calculated for equal temperatures is much
 smaller when the tubes are hot, and that there is therefore a
deficiency in the amount of oxygen required to completely
 burn the carbon, and so to maintain the flame in a non
luminous state.
                  .
    In order to show that this supposition is untenable, and
 that the increase in luminosity is to be ascribed solely to the
                §.
 rise in temperature of the flame, the experiment must be
 modified.

                        proportions that, when conducted through
 a  platinum    tube about 10 centims. in length and 8 millims. in
 width, the mixture burns with a clear blue flame.           If the
 platinum tube be heated to redness, the flame becomes nearly
 is luminous as that of ordinary coal-gas. On allowing the
 platinum tube to cool, the flame again becomes non-luminous.
     From this experiment the conclusion is evidently to be
  drawn that it is the added heat alone which has caused the
  ºne to become luminous, inasmuch as a diminished supply
  of air cannot in this case, as in the former, have influenced

mixture, burning with a luminous flame in consequence of
the application of heat, has or has not been altered so that its
luminosity shall continue when it has been allowed to cool to
the ordinary temperature.          In other words, if the increase in
luminosity is directly due to increase in temperature of the
flame, and is not brought about by a chemical change in the
gaseous mixture, then the flame which appeared luminous at
the point of the strongly heated tube should again become non
luminous when the gaseous mixture is cooled, after having
passed through the heated tube, and is then ignited.
    This experiment may be carried out by connecting two glass
 tubes by means of gypsum to the platinum tube, the outer
 glass tube being V-shaped and being surrounded by cold
 water.     Ifthe mixture of gases be passed through this ar
 rangement, the platinum tube being strongly heated, and be

 ignited at the orifice of the glass V-tube, a non-luminous flame
 is noticed ; whereas if the              be removed and the gases be
 ignited at the orifice of the platinum tube, the flame becomes
 luminous. More simply, the experiment may be carried out
 by burning the gaseous mixture as it issues from a platinum
 tube about 12 or 15 centims. in length : in heating this tube
 near to its orifice the flame becomes luminous; but on heatin
 the tube at a point further back the luminosity of the origin

 flamey is not increased, because the heated gases are again
  cooled by passing over the outer part of the                   tube.
     In employing     a mixture of air and coal-gas under certain
  conditions, it is found, as Wibel has noticed, that “the gas
 aspirated from the opening of the burner reveals—by the
 amount of water and carbon dioxide which it contains, as also
  by  its burning with          luminous flame under the ordinary

   “1. Decrease in luminosity cannot be due to dilution of
the gases, whether understood in Frankland or Blochmann's
meaning of the term, inasmuch as in the above mentioned re
searches such dilution was at any rate increased by heating,
yet the flame became luminous.”
   “2. Decrease in luminosity, in Knapp's experiments, as
also in the case of the ordinary Bunsen's flame, is much more
to be traced to the cooling effect, on the interior of the flame, of

the entering gas.    By heating the latter the flame becomes
luminous.”
   Wibel finds “a most noteworthy argument” in favour of
these two points in the peculiar              of the flame of
                             -
coal-gas and oxygen.
   On the one hand, this flame becomes non-luminous only
when the current of oxygen is rapid, and when the flame is
cooled by metallic gauze ; on the other hand, by proper treat
ment the flame may be made a source of intense light. These
circumstances show, according to Wibel, that neither dilution
nor oxidation is a cause of decrease of luminosity.          By similar
reasoning it might be shown that Wibel's theory is itself
erroneous.     Everyday experience tells us that the blue flame
of Bunsen's burner, as well as that of the blowpipe, possesses
a much higher temperature than the ordinary luminous flame;
but if Wibel be correct in saying that decrease of luminosity
is a consequence of cooling only, then, logically, the tempe
              .
rature of the luminous flame ought to be higher than that of
the non-luminous flame.

        W. Stein", however,    has pointed out that in these cases
a cause other than       lowering     of temperature is at work. He
shows that a flame rendered non-luminous by means of nitro
       yet possesses so high a temperature that it is able to
#.ecompose, with deposition of carbon, coal-gas conducted in a
glass tube through it; he also observes that an inflammable
gas, carbon monoxide, whose pyrometric effect is nearly as
great as that of coal-gas, causes the flame of the latter gas to
become non-luminous.            In order to bring about the complete
non-luminosity of 1 volume of coal-gas, there is required
1-6 volume in Bunsen’s burner, and 0-9 volume in Brönner's
burner, of carbon monoxide.
     In this case decrease in luminosity is not accompanied by
a real decrease in the temperature of the flame; and we are
obliged to allow that dilution of the burning gas plays an

     Wibel's experiment does not prove, as that author supposes
 it to do, that cooling of the interior of the flame is the sole

cooling a flame is of itself capable of bringing about decrease
of luminosity, and that luminosity may be then restored by
simply applying heat; the result cannot be called in question
by supposing dilution or oxidation to have taken place.
     A luminous gas-flame, 3 to 4 centims. in length, proceedin
from the point of a blowpipe or other narrow tube, is allowe
to play horizontally upon a platinum basin suspended in a
vertical position, so that the flame may broaden out and be
come blue.          In this well-known experiment decrease of
luminosity must not be traced solely to withdrawal of heat
by means of the metal, inasmuch as the broadening out of the
flame enables oxidation and dilution, as well as cooling, to
 influence the result.                                       -
   If     the platinum basin be now heated, on the side opposite
 to that on which the flame impinges, by means of a Bunsen's
 lamp held horizontally, the gas-flame becomes more and more
 luminous as the temperature of the basin increases, until it
 finally is restored to                     its
                                  original degree          luminosity.      Of of

10           Dr. Karl Heumann's Contributions to
 admitting indifferent gases is due to dilution, and also to lower
ing of the temperature of the flame by these gases.
   The fact that a flame which has been rendered non-luminous
by means of indifferent gases may be again rendered luminous
                                                         '.
by heating the tube of the burner,       I  hope to explain by es
 tablishing the following points.
   A flame formed of coal-gas and an indifferent gas or air,
and burning blue, requires, in order to cause it to become
luminous, a higher temperature than that which is possessed
by the luminous undiluted flame.        The flame of a
burner in which non-luminosity has been brought about by
means of air is very hot, but becomes luminous when the
temperature is much increased by heating the tube.
       ese points in the behaviour of the Éame of coal-gas and
oxygen, which Wibel adduced in support of his theory, are
explained by me as follows.        Blochmann and Wibel both
noticed that the luminous flame of a Bunsen's lamp, fed with
 oxygen by one opening while the other is closed, can be rendered
non-luminous only by employing a rapid current of oxygen
and a cooling surface of metallic gauze, simply because the
temperature of the flame, when pure oxygen is employed, is
very high. The absorption of heat caused by the entrance of
cold oxygen, as also the absolute rise in temperature required
by the gaseous mixture in order that it shall become luminous,
are entirely, or almost entirely, equalized by the intense heat
produced by the combustion in pure oxygen. Therefore the
production of non-luminosity is so difficult; that non-lumino
sity should be brought about only by employing a rapid stream
of oxygen and a cooling metallic surface is self-evident.
   It is known that a gas-flame may be caused to burn with
great luminosity by the admission in proper quantity, and b
a proper method, of pure oxygen. This fact certainly depends
upon the production of a very high flame-temperature unac
companied by such dilution as is noticed in the Bunsen's or
blowpipe flame when air is employed, and when the diluting
gas is nitrogen.      In this experiment it is found that the
greatest luminosity occurs when a rapid stream of oxygen is
introduced, but that too great a quantity of oxygen, as too
small a quantity, tends to decrease luminosity.       Inasmuch as
a much higher temperature might be reached by increasing
the quantity of oxygen beyond that at which the maximum of
light is evolved, it seemed probable that the actual action of
this excess of oxygen in decreasing luminosity was not to be
traced solely to  its cooling and diluting the burning gas,    as   is
the case with altogether indifferent gases, but that       a  third
cause, perhaps more energetic than either     of  those just men
tioned, was  at  work.                                    -        -

  This supposition led to a more exact examination of the
changes brought about in the flame of coal-gas by an excess
of oxygen. When                   a flame, burning at the orifice of a wide tube,
is placed in an atmosphere of pure oxygen, a notable increase
in luminosity      takes place within the flame-mantle, which is
itself, nevertheless, considerably decreased in size, while the
outer non-luminous border of the flame is broadened out.                      In
order to study this action more narrowly,                               I

vantageous to make the flame very small by allowing the gas
to issue from a narrow tube.                          If,

greater brilliancy than when the combustion proceeds in
ordinary air. The product of combustion is in this case also
a solid, viz. stannic oxide.
   In order to prove that a similar appearance is noticeable in
the case of luminous vapours, in so far as these are not oxi
dized to non-luminous gases by excess of oxygen, hydrogen
was conducted through a      ...Y    containing common salt and
zinc filings moistened with dilute hydrochloric acid (as in
º
Bunsen's well-known experiment).          The gas issued from a
blowpipe-nozzle and burned with an intensely yellow flame,
the luminosity of which was not decreased, but rather the
reverse, when the flame was plunged into a vessel containing
      asmuch, therefore, as the decrease in luminosity which a
small coal-gas flame suffers when burned in oxygen is due to
the presence of an excess of the latter gas, the fact that this
decrease does not take place to so marked a degree when the
flame is burned in ordinary air is to be traced to the presence
of inert nitrogen, which, by diluting the oxygen, diminishes
the energy of the oxidation.                                   -
   In order to  prove  the justness  of this conclusion, the nitro
gen in a given volume of air was replaced by carbon dioxide;
i.e. a cylinder was filled over water with 1 volume of oxygen
and 4 volumes of carbon dioxide; and, after carefully mixin
the gases, a coal-gas flame, burning at the orifice of a      .#
brass tube, was brought into the mixture.        The flame conti
nued to burn with a degree of luminosity equal to that which
it exhibited in ordinary air; it follows, therefore, that the fact
of dilution alone influences the result, the nature of the diluting
gas being unimportant.
   Every indifferent gas, including the products of combustion
themselves, must exert a similar influence.     When an ordinary
flame, issuing from a fine orifice, is burned in oxygen, the
luminosity decreases for the reason formerly assigned; but as
soon as the products of combustion (water and carbon dioxide)
accumulate sufficiently to dilute the oxygen considerably, the
luminosity begins to increase.      The flame which had been re
duced to a luminous point becomes enlarged until it presents
an appearance similar to that exhibited by it when burning in
ordinary air; this happens at the moment when the oxygen
in the vessel is diluted by the products of combustion to the
same proportionate extent as it is diluted by nitrogen in the
      i.
atmosphere.
   If     combustion be continued beyond this point, the lumi
 nosity again decreases—not as was noticed in the former case,
 by a great decrease in the size of the flame-mantle, but by

general weakening of the light until complete non-luminosity
is attained. The flame then increases in size, and finally goes
out.
     This kind of non-luminosity exhibits a great resemblance
to that noticed when the burning material is diluted by
mixing with it indifferent gases, such as carbon dioxide and
nitrogen; the causes of non-luminosity are indeed in both
cases identical.        Inasmuch as every ordinary flame (with the
exception of the flames of explosive substances) requires for
 its  existence two combustibles, the chemical union                        which              of

of the flame.
  These two causes gradually increase, until the flame, which
continually increases in size, becomes blue, then invisible,
and finally, being cooled below the point of ignition, goes-
out.
   Besides cooling and dilution of the carbon-containing flame,
a third cause has been shown to influence the decrease of
luminosity—viz.      the energetic destruction of the luminous
material, i. e. the oxidation of carbon to feebly luminous gases
(carbon monoxide and dioxide).
   Generalizing the results of the experiments upon the means
by which flames which have become non-luminous may be
again restored to luminosity, we find:—
   1. That hydrocarbon flames which have lost their luminosity
by withdrawal of heat again become luminous by the addition
y;
of heat.
      That flames rendered non-luminous by dilution with air
or indifferent gases become luminous by raising their tempe
ratures.
  3. That flames rendered non-luminous by excess of oxygen,
which brings about energetic oxidation of the carbon, are
again rendered luminous by diluting the owygen with indifferent
                                                         -
9CL&68.
     It
      would be very interesting to observe whether flames
rendered non-luminous by admixture of indifferent gases may
be again rendered luminous by heating the tube of the burner,
the combustion being carried out under such pressures as
would cause the molecules of the burning gases to maintain
their original proximity to one another, notwithstanding the ad
mixture of nitrogen or carbon dioxide.         Ihave not myself the
necessary apparatus at hand; but I would direct the attention of
any chemist who is interested in these experiments upon lumi
nous flames to the subject.       It would also be well to note
whether the decrease in luminosity suffered by a small gas-flame
when burned in oxygen is maintained when the oxygen is
diluted to one fifth or further.

non-luminosity brought about by nitrogen and carbon dioxide,
especially dilution and heat-absorption; in the widening out
of the flame caused by a cold surface, absorption of heat and
more rapid oxidation of carbon; and in non-luminosity caused
by air, each of the three causes is at work.
    In the latter case the presence of the oxygen of the ad
mitted air tends to cause a rise in the temperature and a
diminution in the size of the flame, circumstances which are
opposed to the absorption of heat and dilution of the flame.
   The flame of the Bunsen's burner appears to be the final
product of a whole series of causes acting some in one direc
tion, some in another; and it is not to be wondered at that
observers of luminous flames have arrived at such diverse and
contradictory conclusions, inasmuch as they have made the

pressure; and he concluded that the cause of this increase was
to be traced to the presence of the diluting gas. He supposed
that there is a “momentary combustion taking place in the
lowest part of every flame;” this can only be when the issuing
gas is mixed with a due proportion of air; therefore Blochmann
supposed that the explanation of the increased distance between
flame and burner, which is observed to take place when coal-gas
is diluted with an inert gas, was to be found in the following
 statement:—“The greatly diluted gas issuing from the burner
at once becomes mixed with air. In order to maintain the
 constancy of the flame this mixture must contain a fixed quan
 tity of combustible gas. But that this quantity may be main
 tained, in the case of a diluted gas, at the same point as if the
 diluting gas were absent, a much larger volume of the issuing
 gas must become mixed with the air; that                               is,

                           the   Theory of Luminous Flames.                                                   17
observed vacant space, it follows that heating the object placed
in the flame should cause a decrease in the extent of this space.
The following experiments prove that this actually takes place.
   A cold iron wire held in a non-luminous flame which has
been diluted with an excess of indifferent gas, causes extinction
of the flame throughout a considerable space around itself; but
as the wire becomes hotter, this space gradually decreases in
extent, until when the wire is raised to a red heat (either by
the heat of the flame or by an extraneous source of heat), the
flame is observed to rest upon the wire without any interve
ning space. Again, a mixture of coal-gas and carbon dioxide
may be burned at the orifice of a platinum tube, so that a non
luminous flame, separated from the upper rim of the tube by
a vacant space, is produced.        If the platinum tube be now
                       j
heated   by means of a Bunsen's lamp near           orifice, the non             its
luminous flame spreads down throughout the formerly appa
rently empty space until       touches the platinum tube.

    These experiments not only confirm           explanation already   i.
given, but they also completely exclude the possibility            any                                 of

toa   subordinate extent,     the production in   the space observed         of
between the flame and the burner. For the experiments prove
that a  flame, even when largely diluted with indifferent gases,

this fact might be sought for in the presence of unburned and

                       cold gas, which afterwards becomes heated
                         of the lowest flame-mantle. . It has been
already shown that the distance between the flame and any
object in contact with it is increased so soon as the temperature
 of the flame is decreased by the admission of indifferent gas.
 The cold unburned gas in the ordinary flame plays the same
   art, in reference to the lowest part of the flame, as the                                             indif
 ferent gas in the above-cited example did towards the burning
 gas in general. That the action of this cold gas in increasing
 the space between flame and burner is not, however, very great,
 is evident from the fact that, in an ordinary burner the vacant
                        º
 space alluded to is no greater, or not much greater, than that
 noticed between the flame and a metallic rod held in the upper
 part of the burning gas.

 of flames which burn under moderate pressures, as the flames

tion of F. Benevides", the flame of strongly compressed coal
gas allowed to issue into the air, is separated by a space of
several centimetres from the orifice of the tube whence it
 issues.     Ifthe pressure amount to two atmospheres, and the
 tube be 45 centims. in length and 4 to 9 centims. in width,
 the distance between the orifice of the tube and the flame
 amounts to about 4 centims.              Benevides found the tempera
 ture of the dark      space   to be  very   low, which is only what one
 would    expect.
    The same author noticed that a flame brought near to the
 dark space was carried along by the stream of gas. This he
 regarded as proof of the dilution of the gas with air, caused
 by the surrounding atmosphere being carried along with the
 gas-stream which issued from the exit-tube with considerable
 velocity.        If
                   a wire be placed in the flame and be moved
 backwards     through    the dark space, the flame also moves back
 wards towards the burner, but returns to                                its
                                                            original position

   But besides this cooling action exercised by the gas itself,
the temperature of the flame suffers diminution by means of
the action of the cold air surrounding the stream of gas.    The
air which the  issuing gas  carries along with it not only tends
to withdraw heat from the outer portions of the flame, but
penetrates also into the flame-mantle, the temperature of which
it therefore diminishes.
   Such withdrawal of heat by means of the cold gas, and by
means of admixed air, takes place in every flame, even when
burned under small pressure; but the action of these two
causes, especially of the latter, increases as the velocity of the
gas-stream increases; and if this be great and the gas be also
under high pressure, the flame may be so cooled in the neigh
bourhood of the burner as to be extinguished, and a mixture
of air and unburned gas may be formed and carried forward
on the surface of the issuing gas-stream.             In this case the
existence of a flame will become possible only at a consider
able distance from the burner, where the velocity of the gas
has diminished, and where therefore the ignited gas is not so
greatly cooled.
   By increasing greatly the velocity of the gas and by dimi
nishing the orifice through which the gas issues, it may be
possible to prevent the stream of gas from becoming ignited
at all—as, for instance, it is possible to extinguish the flame of
a gas issuing from a burner with a small velocity, the stopcock
being partially closed, by fully opening the stopcock and so
increasing the rush of gas.
   The explanation of this extinction of the flame is to be found
in the fact that the space between burner and flame is increased
by cooling the gas, and that in this space an excess of air
finds      its
           way into the gas-stream, which,                 increases        as   it         its
distance from the burner, becomes more and more diluted with
air, until       at
              last the mixture cannot            caused      ignite.
                                                                  be              to        If

 because under such conditions the diameter              the stream         of              of

24             Dr. Karl Heumann's Contributions to
be eliminated and which may be looked on as immaterial.
But even without this, parallel experiments might lead to the
discovery of interesting relations existing between the veloci
ties of ignition and the combustion-temperatures of different -
combustible bodies.
    For solid   bodies   (magnesium for instance) the velocity of
propagation of ignition is equal to the velocity with which a
wire of the substance must be moved forwards in order that
the position of the flame may remain constant.         The time re
quired for the flame to travel to the end of a wire of known
 length might also be determined.
    Easily combustible liquids might be placed in a hollow, and
the time which expired between the ignition of one end of the
liquid and the arrival of the flame at the other end noted.
Liquids which burn only when absorbed by wick, might be so
absorbed by wicks of known length, and the time required for
the flame to travel throughout the length of the wick placed
horizontally might be determined.
    By the aid of such ea periments a comparative quantitative
expression for the liability to ignition of various combustibles
might be gained.                                            -         -
    For gases, the velocity with which the gas must issue in
order to maintain a constant distance between burner and
flame might be determined; or the distance might be measured,
the velocity of issue being maintained constant.         In order to
do away with the changing velocity of different gases for the
same distance from the burner (depending on the nature of
the gas itself), it would be better to measure that velocity
which is just sufficient to remove the flame from the burner.
    I  am here reminded of Bunsen's method for determining
the velocity of ignition in the mixed gases evolved in the
electrolysis of water". The explosive mixture was burned at
a small orifice of known area, the velocity with which the
gas issued being gradually diminished by reducing the pres
sure until the flame passed backwards through the opening
and ignited the mass of the gaseous mixture.
    This point must be reached when the velocity of the issuing
   as is an infinitely little less than that with which the ignition
is propagated forwards.
      unsen calculated the velocity of propagation of ignition, C,
from the formula       c=}, where         W denotes  the volume    of
  as  issuing in t seconds, and d the diameter of the opening.
In the case of the mixed gases from the electrolysis of water
C was found to be equal to 34 millims. per second, while for

    an explosive mixture of carbonic oxide and oxygen C was
    equal to less than 1 millim. per second.
       These numbers cannot be made use of in the determination
    of the rate of propagation of ignition of a gas burning in air,
    inasmuch as in this case the admixed nitrogen and the ab
    normal conditions under which the combustible gas is mixed
    with air greatly diminish the rate of propagation.
       In order to render clear the relations existing between the
    rates of issue and of propagation of ignition in the case of rapid
    gas-streams, the following considerations will be serviceable.
       A burning gas obeys the law that the position of the base
    of the flame remains fixed when the rate of propagation
    of ignition is equal and opposite to the rate of issue of the
     gaseous stream.    The latter is greatest close to the orifice of
     the burner, and decreases as this point is receded from, because
    of          the opposition offered by the surrounding                                  air.          At      all
    points where the velocity     the gas    greater than the velo
                                                      of             is

the velocity of the gaseous mixture is increased or diminished.
The same phenomenon may be well shown by passing carbon
dioxide through ether contained in a vessel
warm water, and igniting the issuing mixture. The distance
                                                                with
between flame and burner may, in this experiment, be altered
either by altering the velocity of the stream of carbon dioxide,
or by warming or cooling the vessel containing the ether.
    Or the mixed gases may be caused to issue from a small
balloon furnished with an exit-tube and stopcock: by slightly
altering the pressure by means of the hand, the flame may be
caused to move backwards or forwards; or it may be main
tained in a constant position.     If the exit-tube be of platinum,
the flame    may   be caused to rest upon  the orifice of this tube
by heating the tube with a Bunsen's burner. Such flames
then behave in a manner exactly analogous with that observed
in the case of rapid streams of gas; and the explanations
already given of the observed distance between flame and
burner can be predicated of these flames, although diluted
with carbon dioxide &c.; for the decrease in velocity of the
    s is compensated for by the increase in the proportion of
indifferent gases. The temperature of the flame is therefore
low, and the withdrawal of heat by the indifferent gases con
siderable.      The second explanation given of the distance
between      flame and burner, depending upon the different
velocities of the gaseous stream and of the propagation of
                                       j
ignition, holds good in the case of these flames.
                     fº
    One might be disposed to raise the objection that in these
experiments the              mixture was not strongly compressed,
and therefore did not issue with any great velocity.
has been shown that the greater distance between flame and
                                                              But it
 burner is a function of the difference of velocities of the
   aseous stream and the propagation of ignition; and in the
   oregoing cases the latter must be very small, because the
temperature of the flame is very low, and the molecules of
 carbon dioxide interspersed between the molecules of the com
bustible gas must carry away heat from the latter. In these
 flames, for the reasons, just stated, the rate of propagation of
 ignition is small and is easily exceeded by the velocity of a
                                                º
 comparatively slowly moving gas-stream, whence results the
    eat distance between flame and burner.         This explanation
 is rendered more probable by considering that experiment in
which the distance spoken of was                    by warming the
ether    through   which carbon dioxide was
     Inasmuch as the volume of diluting gas was here propor
 tionally diminished, the temperature of the flame was            in
 creased; the rate of propagation of ignition was also increased,

and therefore became equal to the velocity of the issuing gas
at a point nearer to the burner than that at which these two
velocities were previously equalized.
   The diminution in the distance between flame and burner
which was observed to take place in every case when the
burner was heated, or when a wire was introduced between
the flame and burner, must now be commented upon in the
light of the second explanation already detailed. It is easy
to understand why the distance in question should be dimi
nished by heating the burner.
   This distance depends upon the difference between the
velocities of the gas and of the propagation of ignition ; and
the latter is itself a function of the difference between the
ignition and combustion temperatures.
   The combustion-temperature is high because of the gas
being heated previously to ignition; the gas has been already
heated nearly to             its
                       ignition-temperature.       These two circum
stances necessarily   cause      considerable increase

28.          Dr. Karl Heumann's Contributions to
and the upper flame may be still further increased by cooling
the combustible vapours.       The following experiment is      in
structive:–
   A glass tube, 8 to 10 millims. wide and about 10 centims.        .
long, is fastened vertically in the middle of the slit in the
metallic cap surrounding the wick of a lighted petroleum-lamp.
By raising the wick a thick white vapour may be made to
issue from the upper orifice of the glass tube.     If this vapour
be ignited, a small flame is produced, which plays above the
smoke at a distance of perhaps 10 centims. from the tube.
The products of combustion present above this flame are         in
visible, because the combustion is complete and the water
which is produced is dissipated by the heat evolved.
    If the column of visible vapour between the tube and the
small flame be carefully observed, it is seen to be rendered
transparent by the action of the heat radiated from the lower
flame, and finally to become ignited.      In this way the fact
may be explained that the small flame does not rest directly
upon the visible column of vapour, but is separated from it
by a transparent space 1 or 2 millims. in extent.            If the
glass tube in this experiment be replaced by one made of
platinum, and if this be heated, the small flame may be caused
to
    ºpºd
tube.
              and finally to rest upon the orifice of the platinum
    The column of smoke which is seen to issue from a petro
 leum-lamp burning without the glass cylinder, is caused by
the cooling action of the metallic cap which surrounds the
wick. The flame-mantle impinges upon this metallic cap, is
thereby held back, and so is rendered unfit for propagating
the ignition upwards. The lower flame, being            ."  by air
entering from below, continues to burn, and produces new
gases and vapours from the oil-saturated wick, performing,
therefore, a part similar to that of the retort-fires in the
 manufacture of coal-gas.
    As the metallic cap gets heated, the cooling action which it
exercises upon the stream of ascending vapours diminishes,
and the distance separating the upper flame from the lower is
decreased.    If the metallic cap be heated by a Bunsen's lamp,
                                       .
this distance becomes very small, and entirely disappears when
the cap begins to glow.      If  a cap already heated to redness
be placed upon a lighted and properly adjusted lamp, the
flame does not become separated at
    Everyday experience tells us that placing a glass cylinder
upon the lamp causes the two flames to unite. The diminished
supply of air brings about an elongation and curtailment in
the dimensions of the flame, whereby it no longer touches the

sides of the metallic cap; at the same time the flame-tempe
rature is increased, and the motion of the heated particles
of    gas is accelerated.           These circumstances act in opposition
to   ã. cooling          effect of the metallic cap.
     These experiments may be interpreted as pointing to the
withdrawal of heat from the sides of the stream of gas and
air as the cause of the space noticed between flame and burner;
but it  has been shown that this action is but small, and that
the superior velocity of the stream of gas over that of the
propagation of ignition is the principal cause of the observed
effect.   Whether this be the sole cause cannot be determined
until further experiments                   have been carried out.
  The most important points established in the foregoing
part of this paper may be summarized thus:—
     1. The fact that a gas-flame does not rest upon the burner
nor a candle-flame upon the wick, as also the fact that a flame
never directly touches a cold body held within                                       it,

explained       by
                 the cooling action exercised upon the gas
surroundings.
   The combustible gases are cooled throughout                 definite              a
space below their ignition-temperature;           the flame      there                    is
fore    extinguished.     This conclusion         opposed       that
                                                                 is                   to               of

 zine,
       GENTLEMEN,
                             I
                        have not as yet many experimental results
         sufficiently complete for communication to your Maga
           I
          still think that the construction of an induction-coil
 capable of giving a spark 42 inches in length is an instrumental
 feat deserving of record in the annals of science.          therefore      I
 venture to submit the       particulars  of this coil,  recently.com
 pleted for me by Mr. Apps, of 433 Strand, to whose skill and
 perseverance the success of the undertaking is due.
    The general appearance of the instrument is represented in
 the following figure, by which it is seen that the coil is sup
 ported by two massive pillars of wood sheathed with gutta
 percha, and filled in towards their upper extremities with
 paraffine wax.       Besides these two main supports, a third,
 capable of being raised or lowered by means of a screw, is
 placed in the centre, in order to prevent any bending of the
   reat superincumbent mass, The whole stands on a mahogany
  rame resting on castors,
    The coil is furnished with two primaries, either of which
may be used at pleasure. Either may be replaced by the
other by two men in the course of a few minutes. The one
to be used for long sparks, and indeed for most experiments,
has a core consisting of a bundle of iron wires each 032 inch
thick, and forming together a solid cylinder 44 inches in length
and 3:5625 inches in diameter.               weightIts      lbs. The
                                                                is     67

  unsen's method.      The maximum velocity for marsh-gas and air was
0.524 millim., the minimum 0.04.1 millim. per second. The numbers
for coal-gas and air were—maximum 1:01 millim. and minimum 0.097
millim. per second. The velocities are    these instances very slow; and
                                                  in
the experiments show that they are still further reduced         excessby   an       of

   The apparatus shown in the figure serves as a simple and
effective means of exhibiting the absorption of hydrogen by
palladium. a is a tall glass cylinder filled with water; b is a
divided tube of at least 100 cubic centims. capacity; c is a very
narrow         elivery tube, one end of which passes under the
open end of the divided tube; d is a tube for the palladium,
bent so that it can be placed in a vessel of boiling water; e is
a chloride-of-calcium tube for drying the hydrogen;
stopcock leading to a gas-holder.

    After a few grams of palladium sponge have been placed in
the tube d, whilst the one end of the tube remains open a cur
rent of hydrogen gas is passed for some time over the metal
placed in the boiling water.     In the mean time the tube b is
filled with water, and the cylinder as well as the tube c. After
the lapse of about half an hour the tube d is taken out of the
hot water and allowed to cool, the current of gas still passing
through. Then the stopcock            f
                                  is closed, the drawn-out end of
the tube d connected with the gas-delivery tube c and the
screw-tap loosed.
  The palladium is now heated; and the occluded gas is quickly
set free and passes into the graduated tube b.      the metal
cools, the gas is again absorbed; and at last   the hydrogenall
disappears and the tube     becomes,

       GENTLEMEN,
Th;         publication, in your December Number, of a memoir
         by Mr. Chrystal on Bi- and Unilateral Galvanometer
Deflection recalled to my mind some observations of a like
character made some years ago by myself.              I have lately suc
ceeded in      finding   the   manuscript     of a communication with
the above title read (literally) before the British Association
at Norwich in 1868, which contains a short account of these
observations.       As the subject has acquired an additional inter
est in    consequence     of the investigations of Dr. Schuster and
Mr.    Chrystal,   I  shall be glad if you can find room for my

paper, which has not been printed in full hitherto.
                             I am, Gentlemen,
                                          Your obedient Servant,

      December    11, 1876.
    The following paper contains a short account of some ex
    riments which led to rather unexpected results, of which
    can find no notice in the methodical treatises on Electricity,
 although they might seem to be in the way of any experi
 menter on induced currents. The arrangement of the first
                 was nearly the same as that described by Faraday
 in his   original  memoir on induction.         Two thick copper wires
 were coiled     together—the      circuit of one being completed by
 the battery and make-and-break apparatus, and that of the
 other by an ordinary astatic galvanometer of moderate sensi
                                                                    j.
 tiveness.     The make-and-break arrangement was a very rude
 one of    my   own construction, acting either by the dipping of
 needles into mercury, or by the intermittent contact of a spring
 with a toothed wheel. When the handle of the instrument is
  turned, there are generated in the second circuit, as is well
  known, a series of instantaneous currents which are alternatel

the needle produced by a single impulse was only a few degrees,
yet under the influence of the series of equal and opposite cur
rents it remained steady at 60 or 70, and that on either side
of the zero-point, which had in fact become a position of un
stable equilibrium.       Since it took place indifferently in either
direction, the deflection cannot be ascribed to an inequality in
the alternate currents, giving on the whole a balance in one
direction such as, according to the experiments of Henry
d'Abria, might arise from imperfect contacts in the second
circuit.

   The first explanation which suggested itself to me was that,
while no doubt the currents of the two series were strictly
equal (numerically), the resulting impulses, or rather impul
sive couples, acting on the needle might be slightly different
owing to the change of the latter's position in reference to the
coil in the small vibration which the series of currents must
produce, however quickly they may follow one another, which
would give one set an                    over the other.     Those cur
rents would prevail which tend to increase the deviation of the
needle; for they would have, as it were, the greatest purchase

usually been assumed that their sole function is to reduce to the
metallic state the particles of silver bromide which have been
acted upon by light.
   The alkaline developer consists of pyrogallic acid or other
oxygen-absorber, an          such as ammonium hydrate, and a
restrainer such as potassium bromide. These are generally
mixed together and applied to the film on which has been im
pressed an invisible image in the camera. . Those parts acted
upon bylight darken under the influence of the solution; whilst,
if the surface be in a proper condition and the proportion of
the restrainer to the alkali be well balanced, the portions un
acted upon by light remain unchanged.           The image thus
formed is soluble in nitric acid; and further tests show it to be
metallic silver.   In order to discover the part which the alka
line developer played to cause this reduction, a large series of
experiments have been conducted in the laboratory of which                                I
have charge; and the results appear sufficiently interesting to
be published.

reduce 4 equivalents of silver bromide to the metallic state if
sufficient alkali be present to combine with the bromine libe
rated. The solution, after evaporation to dryness, was found
insoluble in benzole or ether &c., and only partially soluble
in alcohol. A part of that dissolved was further found to be
 the bromide of the alkali; and the excess of alkali not in
combination with carbonic acid was also found in the solution.
 The amount of carbonic acid was found to be considerable,
 equal to 1 equivalent of pyrogallic acid. (It seems unneces
sary to give the analysis of the organic residue.              Apparently
the  compound     formed is   totally different from that obtained by
 Stenhouse" when      investigating    the action of bromine on alka
line pyrogallate.)       From the above experiment, it will be
noted that the reduction of the silver is independent of the
absorption of external oxygen, and that only a definite amount
of silver can be reduced by a given amount of pyrogallic acid.
   When, in addition to the alkali, a large excess of soluble bro
mide was added to the bulb B, the same results were obtained,
though the reduction of the silver bromide seemed to take rather
longer time to effect. The following is an example of the
quantities employed in these experiments:—
       In bulb A    was placed     .   .    300 grains of AgBr and
.
                                              10 grains of C. He Os;
       In the bulb   B was placed       .   300 grains of KHO
dissolved in the least possible quantity of water.
                                               ...
    The amount of Ag found to be reduced was 33:86 grains;
and the amount of KBr found in solution was 36-97 grains.
    Layers of thoroughly exposed and                       silver bromide
were next treated with a rather weaker solution of the alkaline
developer; and when the restraining soluble bromide was
           the reduction to the metallic state took place in each
layer almost equably.
                                                                º:
                             When the soluble bromide was present
in equivalent quantities with the alkali, the reduction              place
                                                      .#
first in the layer that had been exposed to light, and spread
   adually into the other layer. From this we may gather that
   e exposed silver bromide is more readil                       than that
unexposed, and that the solution of soluble bromide and the
alkali acts less vigorously than the alkali alone.
   Another point to investigate was as to the means by which
the density in an alkaline-developed image was produced ; for
it could not be supposed that merely those atoms of silver bro
mide which had been reduced to the state of subbromide would
be attacked, since the subbromide of silver is essentially a
coloured compound and can be distinguished even in small

quantities.  A plate prepared with silver iodide was flowed
over with tannin and dilute albumen, and dried. It was then
exposed in the camera, and after exposure half of it coated with
an emulsion formed in collodion by silver bromide. Now a pho
tographic image impressed on silver iodide is not amenable to
alkaline development unless the solutions be excessively strong.
An alkaline developer made as below was therefore employed:—

One part of Nos. 1 and 3 were added to every three parts of
No. 2. As might have been expected, but a trace of an image
was seen on applying the developing solutions to the uncoated
iodized plate (and this trace was subsequently proved to be
due to the sensitive albumen salt); but where the emulsion
had been used, an image gradually appeared, not very strong,
but still perfectly visible and of printing density.
  Silver bromiodide plates were treated in the same way: in
this case there was a feeble image on the part uncoated with
bromide emulsion; but on that part coated with emulsion the
image appeared on the bottom surface of the emulsion film,

further action, however, which must be taken into account.
It has already been shown that silver subbromide is more
easily reduced to the metallic state than is the bromide. In
these last experiments            I
                           have found that there is great dif
ficulty in starting the development in the unexposed bromide
film if the layer of albumen be too thick, but that when once
started it proceeds more rapidly.    This can be accounted for
on the supposition that the attracting particles of silver were
too far distant from the emulsion film to exercise their attrac
tive power.
   But it seems, from other experiments which are still in pro
gress, that the atom of reduced silver immediately combines
with the nearest molecule of silver bromide and forms subbro
mide, which is reduced to the metallic state, and     two atoms                  its
of                                              silver bromide,

 SINCE  enormous strides have been made in electrical science, and not
 least in those regions of it comprehended by M. Mascart under the
 title Electricité Statique.      The theory of the potential has been
 widely extended and applied; and the various new forms of elec
 trometer have given us the means of performing electrical measure
 ments with a precision unattainable twenty-five years ago.                 Im
   ortant researches involving new methods have been carried out
 and published both in this country and on the continent, while
 the mathematical theories connecting the observed phenomena
 have been developed in an admirable manner by Professor Clerk
 Maxwell and others.
    The work before us is undoubtedly the most complete and im
 portant treatise on statical electricity, considered from the experi
 mental point of view, that has been published since Riess's work
 appeared.       It supplies a want widely felt. It brings before us
 concisely, but in a well connected and interesting manner, the re
 sults obtained by the labours of the less-recent workers, Coulomb,
 Poisson, Snow Harris, Faraday, &c., and, though not professing
 to furnish a complete history of the science, or to cite                    the       all

itself, an effect which always requires a certain time, and the
rotation of the plate is too rapid for the induction exercised upon
the glass to play an appreciable part.    Besides, the production of
electrical layers of the same size upon the two faces of the move
able plate is explained in a perfectly simple way by the action of
the points of the conductors and the armatures. The part played
 by the apertures confirms also this explanation.
    A curious phenomenon connected with the Holtz machine—in
 volving grave inconvenience when the machine is used for the
 purpose of charging a large Leyden battery—must have been ob
 served by every one who has had much need to use the machine.
As soon as one of the armatures has been initially excited, the
Leyden jars connected with the two electrodes begin to be charged;
and after the rotation has been continued for a short time, sud
 denly the electricity is extinguished and resumed again in the
opposite direction, so that the positive electrode becomes negative
and vice versá. This change is detected at once by the change of
form of the glow at the points of the combs and the paper arma
tures; each of the jars is then discharged slowly by the corre
sponding comb, and becomes charged with the opposite electricity
to the same potential, after which the same inversion is repeated.
One of the best methods for getting rid of this inconvenience is
that of Holtz himself.       In this arrangement the paper armatures
are formed of two bands which traverse each nearly the whole
extent of a quadrant of the fixed plate. On the axis of the machine,
and just in front of the movable plate, is fixed a diametral con
ductor terminated at each extremity by metallic combs similar to
the ordinary combs. This conductor, which may be placed along
any diameter, is usually inclined at an angle of about 60° to the
direction of the two ordinary combs of the machine. According
to Prof. Mascart, the use of such a conductor, though it may
slightly weaken the power of the machine, entirely prevents both
inversion and extinction, so long as the movable plate is in motion,
even though the electrodes are widely separated.
   The last three chapters of the work are concerned with “Sources
of Electricity.”      First are discussed the experiments of Volta,
Thomson, &c. on the electrical separation produced by the contact
of dissimilar metals. The author, differing in this respect from
the French writers of a few years ago, entirely adopts the views
insisted on by the German electricians, and in this country by Sir
William Thomson and others. That              is,
                                               Volta's original explana
tion of  his fundamental    experiment   isadopted,  though    atthe same
time Volta's     error,     supposing
                           in           that there could     be   aflowof
electricityin a   circuit composed entirely     ofmetals all   atthe same
temperature,     is  pointed out.    Some     of Faraday's experimental
objections  to  Volta's theory are mentioned and speedily disposed
of, the author apparently deeming        itunnecessary  to  discuss them
at any great length.
   Next come the experiments        of   Kohlrausch, Buff, Hankel, &c.
on  the difference    ofpotential produced     by

bodies, and those of            Branly on the absolute measure of electro
motive force.             The phenomena of thermo-electric circuits, though
occupying much space, are not treated in so satisfactory a manner
as their importance demanded, the researches of some recent
writers on the subject (e.g. Prof. Tait) not being even alluded to.
   Clausius's hypothesis respecting the electromotive force in a
thermoelectric    circuit almost disposes of itself. Clausius en
deavoured to   apply  Carnot's theorem (relative to heat-engines) to
the quantities  of heat absorbed or disengaged at the two junctions
in a closed circuit of two metals, and showed as a result that the
electromotive force must be proportional to the difference of tem
perature.    It is found, however, experimentally that this propor
tionality does not hold except within very narrow limits of tem
perature. Prof. Mascart says:– “Carnot's theorem is only true for
those heat-engines which are reversible; and thermoelectric currents
do not present any character of      -
                                        reversibility which justifies
Clausius's calculation.”

  other plane Angle. By BERNARD TINDAL BosanquET.             London:
  Effingham Wilson, Royal Exchange. 1876. (Pp. 20.)
   It is well known that the problem of the trisection of an angle
is not simply to divide an angle or circular arc into three equal
parts, but to effect the trisection by means of the straight line and
circle only. Mr. Bosanquet would probably not have published his

   As the value of 2 changes with the temperatures, the coefficients
given above are average coefficients for the ranges of tempera
ture specified. It will be observed that the value of a increases
 with the pressure until a very high pressure is attained, when it
 changes its direction and diminishes.        This apparent anomaly de
 pends upon the carbonic acid at the high pressure having passed
from the gaseous state proper to the intermediate conditions, which
the author has formerly described as establishing a continuity be

     If we put p-ep, and  calculate the values of p for each of the
above  experiments, it will be found that these values diminish
regularly as the pressure increases at each temperature, with the
exception of the last observation at 64°, where the value of p is
greater than at the preceding observation. This change of direc
tion in the value of p is explained by the circumstance already
mentioned, that the carbonic acid at the higher pressure has been
reduced to the liquid volume (although no liquefaction has taken
place) in passing through the conditions of matter intermediate be
tween the gaseous and liquid states.
   The relations between the volumetric curves in the ordinary
gaseous state for different temperatures are determined by means
of what the author calls the homologues or homologous points of
those curves—that              is,
                       the points    any two isothermals where the

enelosed in a glass tube which was attached to the exhaust-tube of
a Sprengel pump.       The bar of selenium was 45 millims. long and
3-5 millims. in diameter.       Platinum wires were attached to the
ends of it and    passed  through    the sides of the glass tube. The
tube was    exhausted,  and allowed to remain attached to the pump
for four days.      It was now found that the selenium had ac
quired a conductivity greatly exceeding that of the pure element in
its  most highly conducting condition.        The experiment was re
peated with the intention       observing the time required
                                       of                       produce                 to

galvanometer was slightly deflected when the selenium was placed
in  the circuit    ten Leclanché cells. The conductivity
                    of                                         the sele                 of
nium increased rapidly for four days, when the experiment was
unavoidably interrupted.      On admitting air      the tube     change

appearance, even when examined microscopically.            On breaking
the bar   it was found that the conducting-film was entirely super

removed. The conductivity of the bar again increased from day
to day, and is still steadily but slowly increasing (eleven days after
the second sealing of the tube). Although the bar of selenium now
possesses a comparatively low resistance,          cannot detect the          I
slightest alteration in the size of the minute globule of mercury
which has supplied the material for the conducting-film, extending
over a surface one thousand times greater than that of the globule.
   The granular modification produced by subjecting vitreous sele
nium to a temperature of 100° C. for three hours also acquires a
     t increase of conductivity when exposed to the vapour of mer
cury in the Sprengel vacuum.
   As it is possible at any moment to arrest the formation of these
conducting-films, bars of selenium of any given high resistance
 may be obtained in this way with great certainty and accuracy.

colour from a deep brownish red, through different shades of brown,
to a more or less pure yellow, according to the thickness and nature
of the film; for, as is shown in the paper “On the Polarization of
Light by Crystals of Iodine " (Proc. Roy. Soc. vol. xxv. p. 51), the
colour of the transmitted light apparently does not depend solely
on the thickness of the layer of iodine through which it passes.
These films correspond in colour with alcoholic solutions of iodine of
different strength; and the absorption-spectra are very similar—the
whole of the blue end of the spectrum being cut off, and the absorp
tion extending further and further towards the less-refrangible end
of the spectrum, as the thickness of the film increases, till at length
only light having a wave-length of about 650 (in “tenth-metres”),
or slightly more refrangible than the C line, passes through; and
a very slight increase in the thickness of the film is sufficient to
stop this also.
   Fig. 4 shows the appearance with a film of medium thickness,
the strong absorption ending at a point about one third of the
distance between E and D, together with a certain amount of dark
ening extending to about D, and represents the mean results from
measurements of the absorption-spectra of seven different films of
iodine.

   With a little careful management it is usually possible to melt
one of these thin layers of iodine by heating it over the flame of
a spirit-lamp, without causing it either to be dissipated in vapour
or to run together. The liquid iodine appears to be more trans
parent than the solid; for a layer which appears a deep red
colour by transmitted light when hot, sometimes becomes perfectly
opaque dn cooling. When hot it is also of a deeper red than when
cold; and the spectroscope shows that while the less-refrangible
rays of the spectrum are freely transmitted, there is more absorp
tion of those of mean refrangibility than is the case with solid
iodine.                                                         -

   Fig. 3 shows the absorption-spectrum as deduced flon five obser

     As   I have before mentioned, the liquids                            in which iodine is soluble                                . .   .   .
 may be divided into two classes:–first, those with which it forms
 brownish-red solutions, as alcohol, ether, ethyl bromide, Dutch liquid,
 benzole, glycerine, potassium iodide in an aqueous solution, hydro

 tions: this latter class is less numerous, and as far as have hither                        I
to been able to ascertain by actual experiment, only consists of
the following substances—the bisulphide, tetrachloride, and mono
chloride of carbon, chloroform, phosphorous terchloride, tin tetra
chloride, and under certain circumstances, as will be hereafter men
tioned, hydrogen sulphate. In Watts's “Dictionary of Chemistry,’
vol. i. p. 881, it is stated that the solution of iodine in chloral has a
purple colour.                                   -
     In order to obtain solutions of iodine of a known strength, some
 of the liquids in which it is soluble being very volatile, a small
glass weighing-tube closed with a cork was nearly filled with iodine
which had been crushed small with the edge of a platinum spatula.
A stoppered flask holding 25 c. c. was filled with the liquid in
which the iodine was to be dissolved; and the tube having been
weighed, a small quantity of iodine was shaken out of                   and the                      it,
tube again weighed, and               on, till the desired amount had been

   “On the Intrusive Character of the Whin Sill of Northumber
land.”   By W. Topley, F.G.S., Assoc. Inst.C.E., Geological Survey of
England and Wales, and G. A. Lebour, F.G.S., Lecturer on Geological
Surveying at the University of Durham College of Science, New
castle-on-Tyne.
   The Carboniferous Limestone series of the north of England con
tains a bed (or beds) of basalt, known as the “Whin Sill,” regard
ing the nature of which opinion has long been divided. Some
writers regard it as truly interbedded and contemporaneous; others
look upon it as intrusive, and as having been forced laterally between
the planes of bedding. The latter opinion is that held by the
authors, who stated that through South and Mid Northumberland
there can be no doubt as to the intrusive character of the Whin Sill.
This conclusion can be established by the line of outcrop of the
trap, and also by the evidence of individual sections.
   A review of the literature on the subject was given by the
authors, showing that the opinions of geologists are very much
divided as to the nature of the Whin Sill.      But amongst the prac
tical miners of the north of   England    there are very few who will
admit  any  doubt that the Whin lies evenly, and at one constant
horizon, amongst the strata. Clear cases to the contrary are looked
upon as merely local variations, possibly due to successive eruptions
of submarine lava. The Whin Sill serves them as a definite line;
and the limestone next above it is always called the “Tyne Bottom
Limestone.”    The question is thus of considerable economic im
portance. It is also of interest in reference to the volcanic history of
Britain and to classification.
     Prof. Phillips took the Whin Sill    as the base of the Yoredale
Series; the Great Limestone he regarded as            its
                                                     top. But the work
of  the Geological Survey has shown that the Whin Sill lies         atdif
ferent horizons   indifferent places; sometimes       even lies above the
                                                      it
                                 other words, the Whin Sill, which
                              of In
Great Limestone itself.                                                   is
supposed   to mark the base     the Yoredale Series, sometimes lies above
 the limestone which forms the top    of
                                       that series.
    With the disappearance      the supposed base-line
                               of
                                                            at of
                                                           the Yoredales
goes also any good reason for drawing       aline here      all. The so
called “Tyne Bottom Limestone” cannot           traced definitely through
                                                be
Northumberland; and the beds above and below this horizon have
the same general character.
   The authors traced the Whin Sill through Northumberland,          asfar

                      Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                      75
north as Dunstanborough Castle, showing the varying positions at
which it occurs in the Limestone series, and noting points of
interest in some of the sections.        The Whin shifts its position
amongst the strata to the extent of 1000 feet or more.            It fre
quently comes up in bosses through the bedded rocks, and bakes the
beds above it quite as much as those below, especially when those
beds consist of shale.
   As to the age of the Whin Sill, nothing definite can be said. It
is frequently thrown by faults and lodes. There is no certain case
of its being unaffected by faults which throw the neighbouring
rocks, although there are a few doubtful cases which seem to point in
this direction. As the Whin Sill does not approach the Permian
area of Durham, the fact that some of the faults there are believed
to be pre-Permian cannot be applied as a test of age in this case.
   In other districts in Britain in which intrusive basaltic sheets
occur amongst the Carboniferous rocks, there is good reason to
believe that in most cases they are pre-Permian, or at least pre
Triassic. Whether or not this be the case with the Whin Sill
cannot be determined. No light is thrown on this question by the
composition of the rock. Mr. Allport has shown that it resembles,
in all essential characters, the basalts of other Carboniferous districts,
some of which are possibly contemporaneous,          some certainly                 in
trusive.

  EXPERIMENTS                    ONTHE SYMPATHETIC RESONANCE OF TUNING
                                  FORKS.  BY ROBERT SPICE.
     It is   well known that a pair of forks having a vibration-number
of 256 (Koenig's Ut" forks), show the phenomenon of sympathetic
resonance at distances apart varying from three to six feet.
Beyond six feet, special and delicate means have to be employed
to exhibit their resonance. .
   It is also well known that a pair of forks having a vibration
number of 512 (Ut' forks), exhibit the phenomenon with similar
intensity at far greater distances. The accepted solution of this
difference of deportment                          is,                 in
                                that

    I  proceed to explain this hypothesis.              Suppose that we wish to
set a pendulum in motion, but are required to fulfil the two
following conditions:—first, we are obliged to hold the cord of
the pendulum (point of suspension) in our hand, and this hand is
also to be the motive power, to start and keep the pendulum in
motion; second, we are only to be allowed a lateral movement of
the hand of one inch each way, making in all two inches.
    Now the amount of motion or amplitude of a pendulum is
estimated by the angle the cord or rod makes with the vertical;
and clearly, if the point of suspension moves laterally, it thereby
creates an angle.
                                  If,
                               further, the point            suspension has     of   re                            a

of accepting motion moré readily than steel. To test this point           I
made a pair of Ut” steel forks, shorter than Koenig's, and of course
thinner, in order to retain the vibration-number.         These forks
behaved just like the bell-metal forks.                    I

Ut' forks as long as Koenig's Ut” forks, and of course thicker.
These behaved like Koenig's Ut” forks.      Finally, taking a Koenig
Ut” fork on its case, and one of the short Ut” forks also on its
case; on placing them twenty feet apart, it was found that, on
exciting Koenig's fork, my short fork responded well, whereas on
exciting the short fork Koenig's did not respond at all.—Silliman's

NOTE ON THE CORRECTION OF THE WARIATIONS OF RATE OF
  ASTRONOMIC PENDULUMS PROCEEDING FROM DIFFERENCES OF
  ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE. BY A. REDIER.
   Experiments, carefully made, at Brussels, Berlin, and London
have proved that a seconds-pendulum varies 0:6 of a second per
day between the two extreme barometric pressures. A pendulum
perfectly regulated to 730 millims. pressure, would lose 0-6 second
at 790 millims.
   Mr. Airy has had constructed by Mr. Dent the first pendulum
known which corrects these errors. In this construction a horse
shoe magnet, brought more or less near to an armature attached
to the bob accelerates or retards the motion of the pendulum. The
shifting of the magnet is effected by means of a float placed upon
the siphon of a mercury-barometer.          The result is perfect; but,
in presence of the difficulties attendant upon the execution of this
method, it appeared to me useful to seek out a more simple one.
   I have tried, with some success, the effect of the friction of the
air on the surface of the bob. An enclosed bob does not move at
the same rate as one in free air; and            I
                                             can with ease automatically
augment or diminish the free space, according to the atmospheric
circumstances; but this procedure, as well as Mr. Airy's, is again
too complicated.      There is a simpler and surer means of arriving    -
at the result sought.
   Suppose attached horizontally to the top of the bob the barome
tric case of an aneroid.      The bottom of the case thus fixed faces
                     P.

                                                                centre,   is

prove to be a contribution to the precise knowledge of this
subject.
    According to the “kinetic theory,” each molecule of a gas
is constantly in rectilinear motion, possessing thus, in virtue
of its mass, a certain momentum.              Hence, if we have two
layers of a gas moving over each other, we shall have a mutual
interchange of momentum, arising from the transference of
molecules from one layer to another, the result being a ten
dency towards an equalization of the velocities of the two
layers. Thus is produced the effect of friction between the
two layers. The amount of this in any particular case deter
mines the viscosity or internal friction of the gas, and is ex
pressed by the coefficient of viscosity m, which is representedt
by the formula

82          Mr. S. W. Holman on the Relation                                between
where  M is the mass of a molecule, u the “velocity of mean
square" of the molecules, and s the distance between the
centres of two molecules at impact. This formula, if true,
shows that the viscosity of any gas is independent of the pres–
sure upon it at a constant temperature, and increases propor
tionally to the value of u, i. e. to the power of the absolute
temperature.      Maxwell, however, has shown” that the as
sumption with regard to the nature of the impact determines
the value of the exponent in this expression.     From the expe
rimental investigators of the subject, this exponent, w, has re
ceived the various values w=1, #, 3, #; but no results which
I have yet seen furnish any accurate determination of the law.
   The following method, with which                          I

experiments on air only, is designed for the study of the va
riation of the viscosity with the temperature of gases, and,
although capable of being used to furnish measurements in
absolute units of the coefficient, has been arranged for differen
tial effects only, for which it possesses special advantages.

vacuum produced at G, the air will enter at A under the atmo

                  call the attention    those experimenters who of
            present   occupied      investigating

graving     the  Philosophical
                 in             Magazine   for May    1843.   From
this   will
        it             be
                 seen that      the preceding year
                                            in            had made                       I
photographs, not    only     the Fraunhoferof   lines,  but also                                                 of
many others             at
                  both ends      the spectrum, and
                                                of        exploring                          in
the less-refrangible region had found three great lines far                                                            -

                Ultra-red Invisible Region   of the   Spectrum.       87
beyond the line A, and had designated them as 2, 8, y. Of
the existence of a fourth, still lower down,
imperfect evidence.
                                             had obtained   I
       hree     years subsequently these lines were rediscovered
by MM. Foucault and Fizeau, who used the photographic
method previously          discovered by me. . In 1871 they were
again detected by          M.   Lamansky by the aid of a thermo
multiplier.
   I    formerly supposed that the experiments of Sir John
Herschel, made with paper blackened on one side and washed
with alcohol on the other, indicated the existence of these
lines; but a more attentive consideration of the apparatus he
employed has led me to change that opinion.                 He did not
use a slit, but the direct image of the sun, which with the
optical train he had was more than a quarter of an inch in
diameter.         Under such circumstances it was impossible that
either these or any other lines could be seen. The result he
obtained was a succession of circular patches or spots—solar
images—commencing above the yellow, and continuing into
the ultra-red.
    More recently Captain Abney has experimented in the
: “Ime direction, using collodion containing various colouring
or other material supposed to promote the photographic action
of the less-refrangible rays; and in a very recent Number of
Poggendorff’s Annalen (No. 10, 1876), MM. H. C. Vogel
and O. Lohse have published similar experiments.              It is this
last  paper    that leads me to make the   present  remarks;   for those
physicists seem not to be aware that what they are attempting
now was accomplished in America thirty-five years ago.
   I    think, from some expressions that Captain Abney has
used in one of his papers, that he entertains a very low
 estimate of the photographs so produced; he depreciates the
H.          by which they were obtained very much. Sir John
    erschel, than whom no one was a more competent judge
 of a fine photograph, says of one of these that I sent him
 (Philosophical Magazine, February 1843),              “Ishould hardly
be doing justice to the beauty of the specimen itself as a joint
work of nature and art were I to forbear acknowledging                its
 arrival, and offering     a  few remarks      onit..... The spectrum
 itself   is  extremely remarkable and beautiful..... Want of
 habitude      inthe manipulation    ofthe daguerreotype process, and
 by
       so no
          means want      ofsun, prevented my obtaining any thing
 like      fine      impression.”
                    an               If  Captain Abney will for once
 excuse        aninventor for   praising   his own invention,     I who
 have seen very many photographs, and know the difference
  between      a good and       an
                                 imperfect one, will assure him that

these spectrum-impressions were superb.     he will only try                        If
the process, he will never give himself any concern about
collodion spectra again.

                           Luminous Flames.
                       the phenomenon of a small distance existing
         between flame and burner, or flame and a cold substance
placed therein, is most apparent in the case of non-luminous
flames, or of those flames which have been diluted by indifferent
 gases, nevertheless this appearance is also noticeable in the
 case of luminous flames.        In the latter flames the eye is some
 what overpowered by the light, and hence has difficulty in ob
 serving the vacant space; the recognition of this space is made
 easier by placing a screen in such a position as to cover the
 luminous part of the flame as completely as possible.
    Mention has already been made of the fact that a flame loses
luminosity by being pressed down or widened out by the                 in
troduction of a cold substance; and by properly regulating
the experiment, it has been shown that the withdrawal of heat
is of itself sufficient to account for the observed diminution in
luminosity.      By combining the results so obtained with those
which we have gained concerning the distance between flame
and burner, or flame and cold object placed therein, we are led
to deductions of great practical interest.
    If a cold metallic wire be placed in a luminous gas-or candle
flame, the flame is totally extinguished in the immediate neigh
bourhood of the wire, and the luminosity of the flame is dimi
nished throughout a very considerable area.
    In this experiment the low conductivity for heat of gases
comes into play, aided by the great freedom of motion and dif
fusibility of the particles, whereby highly heated particles are
continually brought into fresh contact with the cold wire.
The cooling action of the wire is therefore the greater, and
extends throughout a larger space, the lower the temperature
of the wire itself. The wire is therefore also more potent in

   2. The particles of carbon separated in the lower uncooled
parts of the flame rose upwards, and were deposited upon the
porcelain rod.
   The decrease in luminosity, unaccompanied by deposition
of carbon, which was noticed when the -rod was much de
pressed in the flame, is to be traced to the fact that the tem
perature necessary for separation of carbon could not be
attained in this part of the flame, which previous to the expe
riment was already cooler than the upper part.
   These considerations teach us that, in order to obtain a large
deposit of carbon (as in the manufacture of lampblack &c.),
the cooling of the flame should not be carried too far, while
at the same time the maintenance of a very high temperature
or the presence of much air should be avoided.        Further, we
learn that, in order to obtain  deposition of carbon,  it is not ne
cessary to cool the flame, inasmuch as the maintenance of a
high temperature is a necessary condition of the separation of
carbon. The object brought into the flame may be compared
to a redoubt which intercepts the balls shot forth. The cool
ing action exercised is productive of carbon-deposition only
so far as it prevents the oxidation both of the particles of
carbon suspended in the flame and of those caught by the ex
tended surface.
   Hence it follows that the surface of a glowing body immersed
in  the luminous flame must become covered with soot.
   The carbon which is separated in a smokeless luminous
flame is burned partly in the outer, partly in the inner por
tions of the flame: it is evident, however, that this burn
ing will take place to a less extent where the flame is en
closed by the solid body placed within it than where it is
surrounded by air. Even in the former part of the flame,
however, the supply of air is not altogether shut off; hence
                        º
a part of the soot which has been deposited, and which is at
a high temperature,      will be burned.       Deposition of soot
is therefore generally somewhat less upon a hot than upon a
cooler surface; nevertheless, it may happen that a very cold
substance is scarcely, if at all, covered with soot.
   In performing the               experiment, which exhibits the
fact that a hot surface    may   have carbon deposited upon     it,
care must     be

the surface of the burner is large, and when the burner itself
is made of thick metal: this is especially marked with bur
ners in which the gas issues from a number of small holes
pierced in a thick plate of iron.            If  the supply of gas to
such burners be small, the light effect is almost nil.                The
heating effect of such (roasting) burners is also,         I  think, small
compared with the consumption of gas.              If the supply of gas
be increased in such      burners,    the   tops  of the flames become
luminous, but the lower parts always remain blue.
   If  a burner causes decreased luminosity by acting as a
withdrawer of heat from the flame, one would expect that
burners made of material which is a good heat-conductor
would exercise a greater action in this respect than those made
of material having a lower conductivity for heat. Neverthe
less I am assured that in practice the only fault found with
metallic burners is the readiness with which they undergo
oxidation ; and a Commission by the English Board of Trade"
has reported unfavourably as, regards the use of porcelain or
steatite burners, so far as increased luminosity is concerned.
   The differences in luminosity obtained by the use of differ
ent burners may be so small as only to be distinguished by
very careful experiments.          I  found that the ordinary bur

tubes; and the light obtained from each under exactly the
same conditions was tested by means of the photometer.

   Besides the errors inherent in the photometrical methods, it
was found that other errors rendered the results in the case
of the iron burner of little value. Within the first few minutes
after lighting the gas, the intensity of the light, as also the
consumption of gas, showed most remarkable variations.
These were evidently to be traced to the heating of the burner,
whereby the opening was decreased in size, and hence the
velocity of the issuing gas was also decreased.                In order to

      It was not considered advisable, on account of the arrange
 ment of the testing-apparatus, to further increase the supply
 of gas.                                     -
      From the second and third series of numbers it is at once
 apparent that the steatite is preferable to the iron burner, inas
 much as an equal intensity of light is obtained with a less con
 sumption of gas.             The first series of numbers does not, how
 ever, appear to bear out this result, inasmuch as the intensity
 of light obtained from the gas burning from the steatite
 burner is rather less than that obtained in the experiment
  with the iron burner for an equal gas-consumption.
      If, however, the results obtained from the iron burner be
  compared among themselves, it will be seen that this                              in
  crease of light does not always bear the same relation to
  increase of gas consumed. The reason for this is to be found
  in the fact that the cooling action of the burner is greater
  in the case of small than of large flames.
       If  the results be plotted in curves, the difference between
   the two burners is very apparent.
       I  therefore feel justified in contradicting the statement of
   the Board-of-Trade Commission, to the effect that the advan
    tages of burners made of material of low conducting-power

a small difference in the cavity of two burners, or in the
          of the stopcock &c., often vitiating the experiment.
   therefore had burners of different material specially pre
pared : these were exactly similar in construction, of the same
size, and pierced with the same instrument with a cross-shaped
opening ; they only differed in the material of which
were constructed. These burners were attached to similar

   Besides the errors inherent in the photometrical methods, it
was found that other errors rendered the results in the case
of the iron burner of little value. Within the first few minutes
after lighting the gas, the intensity of the light, as also the
consumption of gas, showed most remarkable variations.
These were evidently to be traced to the heating of the burner,
whereby the opening was decreased in size, and hence the
velocity of the issuing gas was also decreased.               In order to

part  of the flame must participate in the cooling effected
by the entering cold gas; those portions whose temperature
was already but very little above that at which separation of
carbon occurs would be cooled below this point, and would
therefore be rendered completely non-luminous, whereas the
hotter portions of the flame would have their luminosity de
creased, but not entirely removed.   Hence it follows that the
luminosity of the whole flame will be decreased the more the
colder was the entering gas. The total luminosity, on the
other hand, would be increased, if the cooling action of the
entering gas were neutralized by raising this gas, before it was
allowed to enter, to the temperature of the flame.

utmost importance to determine the consumption of gas with
great care.               I
               do not think that the consumption would be
the same in unit of time when the V-tube was kept cold as
when it was heated ; and I do not doubt that had variations
in the consumption been taken into account, the numbers ob
tained by Vogel would have been somewhat altered. These cor
rections, however, would not in any way invalidate the general
conclusions which Vogel has drawn concerning the influence of
temperature upon luminosity; they would probably have only
served to make more marked the difference                                       between the                num

explanation of the great difference between Vogel's results

    I  have already remarked that the cooling effect of the
burner may be neutralized by heating the burner, and that
the entering gas is hereby itself unavoidably raised in tempe
rature.    Inasmuch, then, as it is impossible to pass a heated
stream of gas through a cold burner without raising the tempe
rature of the latter, or to pass gas through a hot burner with
out increasing the temperature of the former, it is evident that
in an experiment in which the gas is passed through a hot
burner the effect obtained will be equal to the sum of these
two causes.      If the results of experiments are to be depended
upon, every precaution must be taken, and especial care must
be given to a determination of the quantity of gas con
sumed, so that, if a difference in luminosity be really ob
served when the tube of the burner is heated, it may be
certainly known whether or not any change in the consump
tion of gas has occurred.
    Blochmann has shown that the diminution noticed in the
consumption of gas after the issuing stream is ignited is due
to the action of the heated burner ; hence one would infer
that if the gas be passed through a strongly heated tube, a
considerable diminution in the quantity consumed will be
observable.     It was therefore most important that determina
tions of the quantity of gas consumed should be carried out
simultaneously with determinations of the intensity of the
light obtained by burning the gas. Such determinations have
been carefully carried out by me, the gas being passed from a
meter through a platinum tube which could be heated by
means of a Bunsen's lamp.
   Observations taken before heating the tube and after it had
become cold gave the same result. Two platinum tubes were
used, each 10 centims. in length, one being 4 millims., the
other 8 millims, in width.       These were heated so that they
became red-hot to the very point whence the gas issued.           The
light radiated from the hot tubes was proved to be so small in
amount as not to influence the results of the experiments.
Inasmuch as the relation existing between intensity of light
and consumption of gas is not as yet accurately known (the
results of different observers differ very much),        I  have as
sumed that the calculated diminution in intensity of light is
  roportional to the observed diminution in consumption of gas.
    us, as 16-litre gas gave light equal to 0-4 candle,        I have
 supposed that 15.5-litre gas would give light equal to 0-38
 candle.    The numbers thus obtained are given in column 7.

panying increased velocity of the issuing gas becomes much
more marked; hence after a certain point the effect of increased
gas-consumption with a hot tube in increasing luminosity must
again surpass that with a cold. This is seen by throwing the
results of the Table into graphic form and comparing the
curves representing the increase in luminosity for equal but
increasing gas-consumption according as hot or cold tubes are
employed. At first the curve of the hot tube keeps far ahead
of that of the cold; as the consumption of gas increases, the
curves become equal (when 40 or 45 litres of gas are con
sumed); but after this point the hot-tube curve again passes
ahead    of that of the cold tube.                       -

   From these results it is again apparent that heating the
tube causes a marked increase in the luminosity of the flame,
and that this increase is the greater the less gas is passed
through the tube. The very considerable      decrease in the
quantity of gas consumed occasioned by heating the tube is
most remarkable, and shows that when the gas makes        exit                                                    its

104               Dr. Karl Heumann's Contributions to
thus communicated to the gas was neutralized by the deposi
tion of carbon within the platinum tube.       No carbon, how
ever, could be detected within the heated tube, even when the
experiment had proceeded for a very considerable time.
Special experiments also showed that when a stream of gas
was very slowly passed for a considerable time through a
tube of hard glass heated to redness, scarcely a trace of carbon
was deposited.    The deposition of large quantities of carbon
within gas-retorts is to be attributed much more to the de
composition of condensed hydrocarbons than of marsh-gas and
ethylene.
   The gas used in the foregoing experiments, however, was
 almost perfectly free from condensed hydrocarbons and tarry
 matter; hence the non-deposition of carbon is only what might
have been expected.
   A    small quantity of water containing tarry matter of a
yellowish brown colour, collected in the cold tube through
which the gas was passed after leaving the strongly heated
platinum tube; inasmuch as this liquid was not formed unless
the gas had been passed through the hot tube previously to
being cooled,              its
                       formation must             traced     the decompo

theless the difference between the two is apparent to the eye,
which is able to look at the latter without shrinking, while it
is unable to bear the intense light emitted by the former.
The delicacy of the eye is therefore very different from that
of the photometer.      By covering the flame with a shade,
           so as to permit the rays of light proceeding from a
determined part of the flame only to pass outwards, it be
comes possible to measure the luminosity of different parts of
the flame by means of the photometer.

    The fact that soot is deposited on a cold object held in a
luminous flame is no proof of decreased temperature within
the flame, inasmuch as it has been shown that decreased tem
perature causes a diminution in the quantity, or even total
suppression, of the separated carbon.
    Soot is also deposited on heated surfaces, but is quickly
burned on admission of air.                 Inasmuch as admission of air
cannot be altogether prevented, less soot is accumulated on
hot than on cold objects.           The surface which collects the soot
may be compared to a redoubt which stops the progress of
the shots fired against
    Burners constructed            iron  of it.              or

nearly two thirds of the island. Early in January 1875 earth
quakes occurred in                          all

extinct volcano near Myvatu, 100 miles further north, opened

ice-calorimeter we have made use of.
    The larger fragments of the metals (some of which weighed as
much as 6 grims.) were most free from impurities, since the
smaller globules, by falling through the mass of the fused chlo
rides, were apt to adhere to the sides of the porous cell, and to
become contaminated with perceptible quantities of          material.          its

   The atomic weights of the cerite metals hitherto adopted have
in no case been directly determined, but have been estimated
from the capacity of saturation of their salts. The estimation
has been based upon the hypothesis, hitherto grounded on no
well-established facts, that the amount of oxygen contained in
them is one third of that present in the             acid needed
to form the neutral salts.          however,    If,

    The metallic lanthanum employed in these experiments was
likewise not quite pure. It was obtained from chloride of lan
thanum after the larger globules of lanthanum had been sepa
rated, and in which the traces of didymium originally present
had become concentrated, since lanthanum is more easily sepa
rated by the current than didymium.              0-8911 grim. of the
same    specimen   which had been    employed    in the foregoing ex
periments, when oxidized with nitric acid, gave 10516 grm.
of oxide of lanthanum, which, on solution in hydrochloric acid,
evaporation, and re-solution, left 0.054 grim. of silica.
    All the oxides were precipitated from the liquid by means
of ammonia and filtered off; the filtrate, after evaporation and
ignition, gave in addition a few milligrams of oxide of lan
thanum. By digesting the hydrates with oxalic acid an inso
 luble white residue of the oxalates of lanthanum and didymium
was obtained, which, after ignition, together with the above
 mentioned small residue, gave 10276 grim. of oxide of lan
thanum containing didymium, and, on the other hand, a
 ...i
 solution which, after evaporation and ignition, left a residue
              of 0.0156 grim. of ferric oxide, 0.0026 grim. of alu
 mina, and 0-0004 grim. of oxide of lanthanum.
     The amount of oxide of didymium associated with the lan
 thanum oxide was determined by means of the photometric
 spectral method originally applied by Professor Bunsen.
     For this purpose a solution was prepared which, in V1 cubic
 centimetres, contained gi grm. of pure sulphate of didymium
  free from lanthanum.      The 10276 grim. of oxide of lanthanum
 which was to be tested for the amount of didymium which it
  contained, was then dissolved in sulphuric acid, and gradually
  mixed with so much water that both solutions, tested before
  the spectroscope in equally thick layers, showed the didymium
  bands of equal intensity.    When this point was attained the
  volume V of the   liquid  was read off.    From these data we ob
  tain the amount of didymium g by means of the equation

   The 1-018 grim. of oxide of lanthanum contained accordingly
0-0476 of oxide of didymium.
  The oxide obtained by the solution of the metal in nitric

   Since it follows, from the oxidation experiment above de
tailed, that 100 parts of oxide correspond to 84.737 parts of im
pure metallic lanthanum, which, after subtraction of the metallic
impurities calculated from the analysis, contain 79°431 of
pure lanthanum, corresponding to 93.229 pure oxide of lan
thanum, we have for the percentage composition of the pure
oxide as directly found:—

number gives the atomic heat as 6:23; if we adopt the for

the law of Dulong and Petit.
   The oxide of lanthanum must therefore likewise be regarded
as a sesquioxide.

    In order to determine the composition of the metal under
investigation, 0.7946 grim. of it was dissolved in nitric acid
and the resulting nitrate ignited; the residual oxide of cerium
weighed 0.97.68 grim.         By treatment with concentrated sul
   huric acid and repeated evaporation with sulphurous acid
 1-6303 anhydrous cerous sulphate was obtained, which, on
solution, left a residue, consisting of 0.0031 grim. of silica
and 0:0127 ferric oxide, which was found to be free from oxide
 of cerium and alumina.
    The amount of didymium was determined by spectral ana
lysis as above described; it was estimated at 0:0332 grim.
   he cerous sulphate, when converted into cerous chloride and
tested in the electric spark before the spectroscope, exhibited
 only a few very weak lines of the lanthanum spectrum. The
 ceric oxide obtained by the oxidation of the metal -

    Since 097.68 grim. of this impure ceric oxide was obtained
 from 0-7946 grim. of the impure cerium metal, 100 grims. of
the above oxide must contain 81.347 grims. of the impure metal.
 By subtracting the amount of the metals contained in the
impurities, we have, out of 94-98 grims. of pure ceric oxide,
 77-362 grims. of pure cerium metal.
    The composition of the ignited oxide obtained after treat
 ment of the pure metal with nitric acid as directly found is

    According to very careful experiments upon chemically pure
 cerous sulphate, which were performed in Professor Bunsen's
laboratory some time ago by C. Wolf, this salt contains

quantity of oxygen is one third of that contained in the sul
phuric acid needed for combination, it follows that the compo
sition of the highest oxide of cerium is

the specific heat of pure cerium,
                            0.04479.

be CeO, then the atomic weight of the metal becomes 92, and

tient of the quantity m by the square of the diameter preserves,
for one and the same value of the current-intensity, a constant
value. The difficulty of ascertaining this resides in the in
equality of the hardening communicated to needles of different
diameters placed in the same external conditions—for instance,
on immersing them in water- when they exhibit the same
bright red”.
   On the other hand, if we compare the phenomena of the
steeping of steel with those of the steeping of iron, we are led
to attribute to the steeped steel a certain degree of heteroge
neity from the surface to the centre; and if it really existed,
one could no longer talk of a magnetizing function of steeped
steel.   Therefore, upon the advice of M. Jamin, I tried dissol
ving in an acid f the superficial layer of steeped needles, so as
to reduce them to less diameters, and afterwards magnetizing
the needles thus obtained.      In this way I proved, not without
some surprise, the existence of a perfectly determinate mag

   Hence arises the necessity of placing the helix at a great
distance from the galvanometer-needle, and consequently the
obligation to be contented with moderate or small deflections
in order to estimate the moments.         have recently obviated     I
this inconvenience    by  rendering    the galvanometer-needle
nearly astatic with the aid of a compensating bar placed above
the needle in an invariable situation.
   There are strong reasons for admitting, & priori, that the
distance   of the temporary poles of the needles from their ex
tremities is independent of the intensity of the current. In
fact, during temporary magnetization the needles are sub
mitted to a magnetic force which has the same value in                                                                     all

 Boscovich and        Herschel,   pointing out the distinction between ex
 perience derived from observation and from experiment. This                                                         is

                    as                                 by
                                             Dr. Fleming. The editor, how
 ever, has inserted two paragraphs, which are distinguished                  being                           by

 enclosed in brackets.      The first defines the meaning of the word
 experience, viz. “Personal knowledge. It is identical with the facts
 of our consciousness.” The second is an extract from Kant in
 illustration of the opinion that men have knowledge a priori.
     A dictionary, as it consists of a number of separate articles, can
 not be adequately criticised without going into details to an extent
 that our limits forbid.     It will be enough to say that the articles for
 the most part are, as far as we can venture to judge, accurately and
 instructively written. In some cases attention is drawn to important
 distinctions which might easily be overlooked. Thus attention is
 drawn to the two meanings of the word realism, by giving a sepa
 rate heading and article to each –to realism as opposed to idealism,
 i. e. the doctrine that in perception there is an immediate cognition
 of the external object; and to realism as opposed to nominalism,
 i. e. the doctrine that Genus and Species are real things, existing
 independently of our conceptions and expressions.          Again, under
 the word substance attention is drawn to its twofold derivation: viz.
 from subsistens (ens per se subsistems), that which subsists of or by
 itself; or from substans (id quod substat), that -which lies under
 qualities.
     In drawing up such a book as the present, one of the chief diffi
 culties, we should suppose, is to determine what words are proper
 to be admitted and what to be excluded. We are inclined to think
 that this difficulty has not been very successfully dealt with in the
 present case.      Thus, “ of providence, foreknowledge, will, and
 fate,” articles are allotted to providence, will, and fate, or at least
 fatalism, but none to foreknowledge.        Again, there is an article on
 Gymnosophist, but hardly on Sophist; so there is one on Mani
 chean, but not on Gnostic; and on Sabism but not on Buddhism.
 Still more strange is the insertion of so unusual a word as Hylo
 zoism, and the omission of Evolution.        This can only be due to an
 oversight; for the author does not refuse to insert words of recent
invention: e. g. he thinks it necessary to give a definition of such
a phrase as “Endogamous Marriage,” though it can have been used
but rarely by any one but the author who invented it; and, besides,
it is quite on the borderland, if it be within the region, of the
“Vocabulary of Mental, Moral, and Metaphysical Philosophy.”
    Dr. Calderwood's purpose in the present edition has been to keep
the book “as nearly as possible in the form in which it came from
the hands of Professor Fleming.”          He has, however, occasionally
withdrawn      quotations,  introduced new matter from the author's
notes, added a few new words, and, besides, “has ventured to intro
duce definitions of the leading vocables.” The additions are placed
between brackets; but it is to be presumed that the editor is solely
responsible for them only in the cases in which they are marked
“ld.” The additions are of very unequal value: not unfrequently
they distinctly improve the article in which they are inserted ; but
sometimes they are unnecessary, and sometimes open to exception.
Thus credulity is said to be “a disposition to believe [without evi
dence] what others tell us.” The words within the brackets are

plainly unnecessary.        A credulous man does not believe without
evidence, i. e. without testimony; but his disposition inclines him
to accept evidence, be it good or bad, without sifting                   Credulity,                        it.

    In a paper published in Poggendorff’s “Annalen, Jubeiband,
p. 32, A. Wüllner has described a series of observations made, by
 means of a revolving mirror, upon the discharge of a large         in
duction-coil through tubes containing ordinary atmospheric air at
 various degrees of pressure.      When, as is generally the case with
 an induction-spark, the discharge occupies an appreciable interval
 of time, the image in the mirror appears spread out to a breadth
 proportional to the duration and to the velocity of rotation.     The
 successive phases of the phenomena then appear, as usual, arranged
 in successive positions, and may be studied separately, even when
 too rapid to be disentangled by the unassisted eye.
    Wüllner's observations appear to have been directed rather to
 the nature of the coil-discharge than to that of the stratifications;
 and some of his principal conclusions are accordingly of the fol
 lowing kind, viz. that at low pressures, i. e. down to 1 millim.,
 when the discharge was stratified, the striae showed an inter
mittence of intensity, indicating either a pulsation within the
 duration of the main discharge or a breaking-up of the main
 into a series of partial discharges.       At greater pressures, e. g.
 at 26 millims., when almost all trace of stratification was lost, this
breaking-up into partial discharges (especially at the commence
ment) was distinctly perceptible. At yet greater pressures, i. e.
from 40 millims. to 75 millims., a cloudy kind of stratification
 showed itself; but, excepting a bright flash at the outset, no
appearance of partial discharge was visible.        The observations,
which were at first directed to capillary tubes, were extended to
tubes of various diameters, and also included the effect of a mag
net on the discharge.
    For some time prior to the publication of the volume in question
 I had been engaged upon a series of experiments very similar
in their general disposition, but with a somewhat different object

      My general instrumental arrangements appear to have been
 similar to those of Wüllner; in fact they could hardly have been
 very different.         The tubes were attached to the coil in the usual
 way, and a contact-breaker of the ordinary form with                          own elec       its
 tromagnet was             the first instance used. By suitably adjusting

of the flake-like, which latter  I have on that account called ele
mentary striae.
   Elementary striae are in general produced at regular intervals
along the tube. The series extends from the positive terminal in
the direction of the negative to a distance depending upon the
actual circumstances of the tube and current.      The length of the
column, and consequently the number of the striae, depends mainly
upon the resistance of the tube, the duration of the entire current,
and, to a certain extent, upon the amount of the battery-surface
exposed; and in that sense upon the strength of the current.
The velocity of the proper motion, other circumstances being the
same, depends upon the number of cells employed; in other words,
upon the electromotive force.
   The appearances of the striae, however, their essential features,
and the conclusions which may be drawn from them will be
better apprehended by means of sketches, even though imper
fect, than by meredescription; and       I therefore subjoin a few
examples.

 discharge is at the right hand, and the negative terminal at the
 top. The drawing fairly represents the appearance of the upper
 part or head of the column of striae during one complete coil-dis
 charge.       When the battery-surface exposed is small, the whole

 striae are for the most part unbroker&but are occasionally inter

creased these diagonal lines appear more and more crowded to
gether, until at last they blend into unbroken flocculent striae.
   This compound nature and mode of formation may be taken
as a general characteristic of the flocculent striae. In some tubes     .
it is more easily brought out, in others only with greater diffi
culty. In some it can hardly be verified experimentally without
a loss of light so great as to mask the phenomenon. The apparent
proper motion of the flocculent strie depends, as is easily seen,
upon the position at which the elementary striae are replaced. If
they are replaced in the positions which their predecessors held,
the flocculent striae will appear straight in the mirror; if they
are replaced successively nearer the positive terminal, the apparent
proper motion will be in the normal direction; if nearer the nega
tive, it will be reversed.
    An ether-tube examined in the same way showed nearly the
same features as the last. The elementary striae, however, were
not so easily separable; and the flocculent striae were formed, as
usual, at an earlier stage near the head of the column than near
the foot of it.
   In another carbonic-acid tube the proper motion of the flocculent
striae was coincident in direction with that of the elementary;
and the latter were consequently more difficult to disentangle,
One point in this tube was particularly noticeable, viz. that as the
column of flocculent striae retreated, so did the negative glow
advance. The two remained throughout the entire discharge the
same distance apart.

the capillary end being at the bottom. The positive terminal is
at the top. The principal interest of this tube consists in showing
the influence of diameter upon the velocity of proper motion.
The wider the tube the freer, it seems, the striae are to move.
The same fact may be observed by comparing tubes differing in
diameter, but in other respects the same ; but the conical tube

momenon.      To the unassisted       eye the discharge was extremely
brilliant; it passed in a column not quite straight, but in a
writhing snake-like curve, with flaky striae at intervals through
its length.    When viewed in the mirror the striae were seen to
spread themselves out with slight, but irregular, proper motion.
With an increased battery-surface, or with a greater number of
cells, but more notably with the latter, not only were the striae
lengthened, but from several of the long elementary striae shorter
ones were thrown out nearly at right angles to the former.         These
were of short duration, and had great proper motion. The general
appearance of these compound striae was that of branches of                      fir
trees, the twigs      which represented the permanent striae, and the

Ampère's law—in other words, to constrict the discharge.                          In
narrower tubes than the one here described, the constriction goes
so far as to imitate the appearance of a capillary tube; and this
effect is borne out by the revolving mirror. The intensification

   IV. Flocculent striae, such as are usually seen in carbonic-acid
tubes, are a compound phenomenon.          They are due to a succes
sion of short-lived  elementary   striae, which are regularly renewed.
The   positions  at which they  are renewed determine the apparent
proper motion of the elementary striae.        If they are constantly
renewed at the same positions in the tube, the flocculent strie will
appear to have no proper motion and to remain steady.             they                                  If
are renewed at positions nearer and nearer to the positive ter
minal, the proper motion will be the same as that of the ele
mentary striae; if they are renewed at positions further and fur
ther from the positive terminal, the proper motion will be reversed.
    V. The velocity of proper motion varies, other circumstances
 being the same, with the diameter of the tube. This was notably
 exemplified in the conical tube. In tubes constructed for spectrum
analysis the capillary part shows very slight, while the more open
 parts often show considerable proper motion.
    VI. Speaking generally, the discharge lasts longer in narrow
 than in wide tubes. In spectrum-tubes the capillary part gives
 in the mirror an image extending far beyond that due to the wider
 parts.

the new striae from one another and from the old ones are the same
as those of the old ones from one another.
   IX. The principal influence of a change in the electromotive
force appears to consist in altering the velocity of proper motion.
A change in the amount of battery-surface exposed produces
a corresponding change in the duration of the entire discharge,
as well as, apparently, in the development of some of the minor
details of the striae.
   X. When the proper motion of the elementary striae exceeds a
certain amount, the striae appear to the eye to be blended into one
solid column of light, and        trace         all

the flaggy slates above the Pale Slates he had found Graptolites and
Orthoceratites of the same species as those found in the Denbigh

of the May-Hill or Llandovery group, and should be taken as the
base of the Silurian, thus including in the Pale Slates or Tarannon
Shale a thick series which intervened between the Corwen Beds and
the flaggy slates of Penyglog.
   4.  “On Mineral     Weins.”   By W. Morgan, Esq.
   The author maintained that no one theory can be accepted in
explanation of the formation of mineral veins, and that, whilst in
some cases their formation may be due to the presence of preexistent
fissures induced by shifting of the containing rock, in others any
such explanation is insufficient, as he thought the means by which
the sides of such fissures were kept apart could not be easily in
dicated.    The point upon which he especially insisted in connexion
with this question was the presence of “horses” in many mineral
veins. He advocated the view that the walls of veins were in close
proximity in their earliest stage, and that the enlargement and
infilling of the veins took place simultaneously by the segregation
of materials derived from the adjacent rock, supplemented, perhaps,
by a tension or tendency to separation caused by slow contraction
of the latter. Instead of a fissure, he assumed the presence of an
irregular surface of least resistance or of electrical action, at which
the vein-matter might collect at first as a mere film.       In this way,
he   thought,  the vein   might  increase and its walls     might   recede
simply by the aggregation of the vein-matter itself, and in general
in proportion to the degree of mineral saturation of the adjacent rocks.

   The following communications were read:—
   1.  “On gigantic Land-Tortoises      and a small Freshwater Species

Fauna, and a note on Chelonian remains from the Rock-cavities of

   2. “On the Corallian Rocks of England.”            By the Rev. J. F.
Blake, M.A., F.G.S., and W. H. Hudleston, Esq., M.A., F.G.S.
   The object of the paper was to describe the rock masses existing
betwixt the Oxford and Kimmeridge Clays. Topographically the
Corallian region is divided into five districts of very unequal size,
wholly separated from each other. The special features of each
district were detailed, both as regards the development, composition,
and fauna of the several subformations therein contained, and
these latter compared with their equivalents or representatives in
the other districts. The old names were, as far as possible, retained;
but where obviously inapplicable, local names replaced them.
    In the Weymouth district (I.) one section discloses 230 feet of beds
between the Oxford and Kimmeridge Clays, made up in ascending
order of grits, clays, marls, and oolites, gritty limestones very fossili

 ferous towards the top, clays and grits. Another section, on the oppo
 site side of the anticlinal, shows the same development of the central
 limestones; but the lower series is considerably attenuated, and the
 upper series (Supra-Coralline) shrunk from about 90 feet to a thin
 ferruginous band of only a few inches. There are hardly any
 corals, and no Coral Rag whatever; argillaceous and arenaceous
 matter (always, however, more or less mixed with lime) prepon
 derates; but there is a rich and varied fauna, which has strong
 affinities with some of the Coralline beds of other districts. This
 culminates in the Trigonia-beds, which lie towards the top of the main
 limestone series; above this the fauna inclines to Kimmeridgian,
 below to Oxfordian types. The remarkable irregularity of the
 Supra-Coralline beds was noted, especial reference being made to the
 mineral character, fossil contents, and geological position of the
 Abbotsbury iron-ore.      In the North-Dorset district (II.) the thick
 ness of the mass is much reduced,          and its constitution greatly
altered. Corals are still very rare; but calcareous sediment greatly
 preponderates, and is made up largely of comminuted shells,
loosely aggregated pisolites, and rubble frequently false-bedded.
The arenaceous base of the Corallian series, described generally under
the term Lower Calcareous Grit, is almost at its minimum in the
 neighbourhood of Storminster.         The central limestones contain a
moderate assemblage of the usual Coralline forms, but Cidaris
florigemma appears confined to a rubbly bed about 8 feet thick.
The West-Midland range (III.), extending from Westbury to Oxford,
exhibits the greatest variety, and, being classic ground, contains a
larger proportion of the type forms of the rocks. The development
is very unequal; and the entire group is reduced to less than 25 feet
in some places; but where the sandy base is expanded, as in those
districts where the escarpment faces the north, the thickness ex
ceeds 100 feet, occasionally falling to about 30 feet in the direction
of the dip, with the probability of the entire mass ultimately
thinning to a feather edge. In many places true Coral Rag is
largely developed, usually terminating the Corallian series in an
upward direction, or at most succeeded by a very few feet of ferru
ginous sand.      Throughout the great escarpment facing the upper
valley of the Thames the lower arenaceous member predominates,
though much mixed with thin-bedded sandy clays, the whole con
stituting a loose formation, which is capped by hard gritty lime
stone containing an abundant fauna, representative of the middle
series, differing somewhat, on the one hand, from the Rag with
its   partially Kimmeridgian character, and,                  on
                                                         the other, from

invariably indicates a distinct horizon, we also find the casts of
shells, rarely or never met with in the West of England, but which
appear common in some parts of the Continent—e.g.            species of
Isoarca, a certain form of Opis, which latter occurs also in a portion
of the Yorkshire Basin (V.). This bears 130 miles N. by W. from
the reef at Upware. The Corallian beds are grouped as a belt of rocks
enclosing an oval tract of Kimmeridge Clay. There is more sym
metry here than in the south; and the triple division of grit, lime
stone, and grit, though not absolutely true in all places, is fairly
accurate; most of the beds are better-developed, and the contrast
between the Coral Rag and underlying Oolites is strongly marked.
In the Tabular Hills these Oolites constitute a double series, divided
by a “Middle Calc Grit,” a fact first indicated on stratigraphical
grounds by Mr. Fox Strangways, and amply borne out by fossil
contents. The shell beds of the Lower Limestones are, especially
in their lower parts, charged with Brachiopoda and other forms of
the Lower Cale Grit ; whilst the Upper Oolite, on which the Coral
Rag reposes, contains a far more varied fauna, though singularly
destitute of Brachiopoda. The fauna of the Rag here, as elsewhere,
inclines to Kimmeridgian types.
   As the object of the paper was to arrange facts rather than to
propound theories, the conclusion was chiefly occupied in summing
up and correlating.      It was shown that, since the leading feature
of the rock masses between the Oxford and Kimmeridge Clays is
variety, a strict and rigid correlation is altogether impossible. Yet,
in spite of great local differences, producing in many places a
strangely contrasted facies, there are certain features which may be
deemed fairly characteristic of the several divisions.   The bank-like
character of most of these beds was insisted upon. A table of com
parative sections, 14 in number, affording a generalized idea of the
development, was exhibited, and the stratigraphical verifications of
many of these given, as sections drawn to scale, in the body of the
paper.

observations on A PROPERTY OF THE RETINA, FIRST NOTICED
     BY TAIT. By ogdEN N. RooD, PROFESSOR OF PHYSICs IN
     COLUMBIA COLLEGE.
     In the    Edinburgh “Proceedings,’       1869–70, vol. vii. pp. 605–607,
Tait described an interesting observation which has perhaps some
bearing on Thomas Young's theory of colour.          While suffering
from indisposition, he noticed each time, on awakening from a
feverish sleep, that the flame of a lamp seen through a ground-glass
shade assumed a deep-red colour, the effect lasting about a second.
He  suggests that the nerve-fibrils in the retina also partook of
 sleep, and, on awakening, the green and violet nerves resumed their
 function somewhat later than the red.            I
                                               have in Iny own case noticed
 some instances which seem to        point out that after a nervous shock,
 sudden or prolonged, the green nerves (adopting the theory of
 Young) recover their activity later than the red, and probably later
 than the violet nerves. The first observation was made twenty
 years ago, while recovering from the effects of chloroform which had
 been administered by a dentist well known at that time in Munich.
 Upon regaining consciousness and raising my eyes to the face of
 the operator,     I
                   was a little surprised at not having previously re
 marked his unusually ruddy complexion, but the next instant saw
 that this was due to an optical illusion; for his hair appeared of a
 bright purplish-red hue. The singular appearance lasted perhaps
 a couple of seconds, when his hair resumed                     its
                                                       natural colour, which
 was white.      This observation corresponds with that made            Tait.   by

ON SOME EFFECTS OF HEAT UPON VOLTAIC                                           CIRCUITS COMPLETED

   I. It is known, and M. du Moncel has demonstrated in several
ways *, that if one of the plates of an electrolyte be heated, a ther
moelectric action is produced, which has the effect of producing a
current, the heated plate constituting the positive pole. This
action, which often shows itself in aerial telegraphic circuitst, may
become very energetic if the electrolytic system be disposed so as
to maintain the liquid around the two plates at considerably differ
 ent temperatures; and to obtain this result, we need only isolate
from one another the portions of the liquid into which the elec
trodes dip—or to take advantage of the property possessed by                                                       all

          The energetic effect determined by both these arrangements evi
**    dently depends on the circumstance that the heated portions of the
      liquid tend to maintain themselves at its surface, leaving the lower
      parts at a less-elevated temperature; and if Faraday's experiment
      in a U-tube did not give any decisive result, it was because, in con
      sequence of the disposition of the apparatus, the liquid about the
      electrodes did not present a sufficiently great difference of tempe
      perature.                             -
          By making use of magnetic helices, of which the wire would
      be constituted by copper tubes in which currents of cold water
      and of superheated steam circulate, it might perhaps be possible
      to obtain, in consequence of the preceding reactions, magnetic
      effects which would explain the magnetic state of the terrestrial
      globe by attributing it to the inequality of temperature of the seas.
         II. If the electrolyte be constituted by the smoky flame of a
      paraffine taper, and if the current from a pile of 40 Leclanché
     elements, or of 30 elements with bichromate of potash, be passed
      through the flame, a copious arborescent deposit of carbon is
     observed to form at first at the extremity of the negative wire,
     constituting an agglomeration of branches tending to rise in the
      direction of the flame, and to reach the positive wire.               A few
     moments after, carbonaceous threads, slightly curved, are depo
      sited upon this, and likewise tend to rise with the flame; and
     if these two deposits be brought near to one another by bend
     ing their ramifications a little, a series of bright sparks are seen
     to be exchanged between the extremities of the ramifications, re
     sembling points of electric light.

  XXIV.     On the Laws          of   the Passage   of Electricity   through
                     Gases.      By G. WIEDEMANN".
Soº         time since the author, in conjunction with Dr.
       Rühlmann, made a series of experiments on the dis
charge of electricity between spheres of metal in rarefied air.
The image of the discharge was reflected from a revolvin
mirror fixed on the axis of a Holtz machine which supplie
the electricity.

the object-glass of which was divided vertically, like a helio
meter, into two parts, one of which was                   until the
image of one               seen in one half was     brought  into a
                                           º
line with that of the next discharge seen in the other half.
The amount of displacement was measured.
   In all the experiments the pressure of the gas was so far
reduced that the discharge took place through the gas alone,
unmixed with any material particles from the electrodes.
   These experiments led to the following conclusions:—
                                 .."
   I. That the potential on the               electrodes, necessary
for effecting a discharge, is greater for the positive than for the
negatire electrode.

   This result was obtained by measuring the time-interval be
tween two consecutive                         when one electrode
was charged with positive or negative electricity and the other
            with the earth, (2) when both electrodes were con
nected with the machine, but one was larger than the other.

    charge increases with the pressure, at first rapidly, then more
    slowly and nearly in proportion to the increase of pressure.
     These quantities of electricity are, under circumstances otherwise
    similar, greater and greater for the following gases in order,
     hydrogen, owygen, carbonic acid, air, and nitrogen.

     sary for effecting a discharge, an explanation of the various
    features of the discharge was
        On account of their greater potential, the gas-molecules at
    the positive electrode are repelled with a greater velocity than
    those at the negative; and consequently #. positive discharge
    extends to a greater distance from the positive electrode than
                                         º
    the negative from the negative.        Further, since the difference
    of tension at different    points  of an electrode is greater with
    large than with small charges, the discharge from the positive
   takes place only from the point directed towards the negative,
   while that from the negative takes place more largely from
   the general surface.     When the                takes place between
   a   plate and a small  sphere,   we find at the meeting of the two
   discharges phenomena similar to those produced at the meet
   ing of two currents of water.        If the plate is negative, it ex
  hibits the glow or halo, while the positive discharge from the
  sphere sinks in a cup-shape; if the plate be positive, the red

     "simily     we may find an explanation of the action of the
  electric egg, and of the connexion between the direction and

  (between a point and a ring) and the direction of the discharge.
       In the later experiments one      of the spherical electrodes of  .
 the vacuum-tube was connected             with one conductor of the
 Holtz machine, the other conductor of which was connected
 with the earth, while the second electrode was connected with a
                           lº.
 galvanometer and thence with the earth.            Whether the first
 electrode was charged with positive or with negative electri
 city, the alternating                   and consequently the quan
 tity of electricity passing through the tube, remained un
 changed. But still the number of discharges in a unit of
time was greater when the electricity drawn from the machine
was negative.          -
      The above-mentioned difference of quantity of positive and
negative electricity necessary for effecting a discharge is not
determined by the passage of unequal quantities through the
apparatus used for the discharge. The same result will be ob
tained if a spectrum-tube, i. e. a capillary tube with spherical

164                Prof. G. Wiedemann on the Laws of the
   While the foregoing researches lead us to some conclusions
respecting the quantity of electricity necessary for the begin
ning of a discharge, it is requisite through a measurement of
the heat developed, to learn something definite about the pro
gress of the discharge during the passage of the electricity. By
application of a thermopile to the different sections of the ca
}.illary tube, the rise of temperature due to the quantity of
       developed in a unit of time may be determined.         ese
  uantities of heat in various sections of a capillary tube are
the same whether the tube be long or short, even when the
length is varied in the proportion 1 : 1-78; only in longer
tubes the heating, and with it the brilliancy of the discharge,
diminishes towards the electrode connected with earth, especi
                                             -
ally when it is negative.
   &: Tubes of various internal, but equal eaternal diameter
receive, under circumstances otherwise similar, nearly equal
quantities of heat in equal times from the discharge, even when
the cross section of the space through which the discharge
passes is increased in the proportion 1: 4.    This condition of
things is maintained when capillary tubes of different diame
ters, or when tubes of diameters varying at different parts, are
used.
      Ifthe capillary tube is slightly heated at any part, the
 number of discharges scarcely alters.            If
                                                  it be considerably
 heated, a bright sodium light appears at the heating-point,
 and the number of discharges increases.            But the sodium
light does not extend beyond the heated part. If the space
about the electrodes be heated, a sodium light is similarly de
veloped without spreading further ; the intervals of the dis
charges increase.       But as soon as the pressure due to the
heating reverts to what it was before, the intervals resume
their former value, even though the glass be heated almost to
fusion.
    The charge on a capillary tube, examined electroscopically
throughout         its
                  entire length,     similar
                                        is   tothat         of

 be  put    to

at both ends with platinum electrodes having their axes per
pendicular to that of the tube. When the tube was insulated,
and both terminals directly connected with the conductors of
a Holtz machine, both electrodes were covered with a bright
halo.     From the positive there proceeded a somewhat con
tracting discharge, A, which at some distance from the electrode
showed a dark spot, B, and then slightly decreasing (C) through
the entire tube, passed to the neighbourhood of the negative
electrode, from which it was separated by the dark space D.
    On putting the positive electrode to earth, the dark spot B
becomes smaller, while the discharge A spreads somewhat
further. On putting the negative to earth the dark space D
becomes larger, and the part C of the discharge contracts in
a spindle-shape towards         it.

    With regard to           the passage of electricity through gases, two
 opinions have been put forward.                    On the one hand it was
 supposed (and the opinion was suggested as the more probable
 in the former memoir on the                            that the particles of gas
 situated at the electrodes carry with them the electricity at
 the commencement of the discharge, and transmit the dis
 charge from one electrode to the other by means of a directly
                                             lº
 progressive movement of the particles. Against this view
 various physicists, and among                        A. de la Rive, maintain
 “that in      gases    of a certain
 disruptive, and therefore that gas,
                                           density

                                                          every insulating body,
 whether solid or fluid, plays the essentially passive part of a
 hindrance to the re-connexion of the two electrodes, which, so
 to speak, is mechanically overcome by the discharge. On the
 other hand, gas of a certain density or rarefaction will allow
 the electricity to flow out without mechanical resistance, and
 will only offer an electrical resistance, while the transmission
  of electricity takes place by so rapid a sequence of molecular

movements that it appears almost continuous. We then have
a real galvanic current, upon which the magnet acts as upon a
rigid conductor, and which is capable of effecting electrolytic
                                                                                     .
decomposition   of the gas, if it is compound, as in a liquid
electrolyte. In this case the resistance will be in proportion
to the length of the column of gas.    It is therefore no longer
a  discharge, but a real electric current.”     In proof of
view it is  especially urged that when induction-currents are
employed, besides the disruptive discharge, the “aureole”
appears, as well as the “trait de feu,” which disappears in
highly rarefied gases, and, according to Perrot's experiments,
these can be separated from one another.
   But if an extremily rarefied gas acted in the same way as a
metallic conductor or an electrolyte, the smallest difference of
tension at the electrodes would cause a proportionate current
to pass through the gas, and the electricity could not, as ex
perience shows, accumulate before the commencement of the
discharge in a greater but finite density.
   To make it possible to combine the latter phenomenon with
the supposition of an electrolytic conduction of the gas, we
must form the hypothesis of a certain resistance at the elec
trode itself, which, like a non-conductor, would prevent the
passage of electricity from the electrodes to the conducting
gas, and to break through which a finite tension would be
requisite.

which now conduct metallically that the combined bodies of
heat in the tubes would be equal to each other—a supposition
equally complicated and improbable.
     Even the phenomenon of the aureole and the “trait de

the former is equally produced by single discharges in lumi
nous gases, and the latter by metallic discharges which at
high pressure are added to the former.
         ther do the above-mentioned experiments allow us to
conclude almost with certainty that the conveyance in gases is
 not carried on by any such double process, but actually
continues essentially in the same manner from the beginning
to the end of the discharge.
     The process of the discharge in my opinion may be supposed
to be somewhat as follows. First of all, we cannot suppose that
 the conveyance of electricity in gases can take place through
 the ether alone ; for then a discharge would pass in                 vacua,    all
 however perfect, which            isnot the case. The particles         the          of
 gas themselves must therefore take part                the conveyance
                                                             in                            of
electricity.    If,   then, the charge            of
                                              the electrodes      one placeat

170               Prof. G. Wiedemann on the Laws of the
closed   in tubes, this original impulse, and the quantity of
electricity necessary for a discharge, are on this very account
independent of the length and width of the tube—in so far at
least as the mutual action of the electricities accumulated
upon the electrodes, and that of the free electricity distributed
along the tube upon the electrodes themselves, can be neg
lected.
   In like manner the tension required for a discharge is                                            in
dependent of the heating of the gas in the capillary tube, so
long as the glass is not decomposed by the heat and trans
formed into a metallic conductor, because such a transforma
tion would be equivalent to interposing a new electrode between
the original electrodes of the tube.
   The tension required for the commencement of a discharge
in different gases may depend, under conditions otherwise
similar, upon the nature of the gas itself, upon the capacity
for a charge of                 its
                       several molecules, &c.

     the electrodes in a glass tube be so far apart that their
mutual influence may be neglected, the phenomena become
more complicated, because the sides of the tube may become
charged from the electrodes.     Although with the apparatus
above    described the so-called “positive discharge'' always
passes  through the entire length of the capillary tube, it is
only when the negative electrode is put to earth that the
whole tube receives a positive charge, diminishing of course
in strength with the distance from the positive electrode.
   With insulated electrodes it is only in part positively
charged ; but when the positive electrode is put to earth it is
negatively charged from the negative electrode in               entire                its

meet others causes the movement to spread, in a direction

also be communicated from one molecule to another. The

in the fact that in general the direction of movement of the
particles of bodies with their coverings in two successive
sections of the conductor is very different. In the passage,
therefore, of electric particles from one molecule to another
the direction of their movements must alter ; and the work

given by other                   of these phenomena and of others
nearly connected with them,                       I
                                        will venture to touch upon
them again briefly here.
   In his very interesting experiments on Lichtenberg's figures,
Herr von Bezold" advances the hypothesis, that when they are
exhibited in the positive terminal a movement takes place
towards the                    when at the negative a movement
towards the periphery. The same circumstance does not seem
to occur in gas-discharges. If with increased pressure tuft
shaped metal-discharges accompany the gas-discharge at the
positive electrode, the glowing portions of the metal must se
parate themselves from the electrode and move away from                                           it.
     In  the same way,           Geissler tubes,

we   supposed   that the current                 of
                                       air which always accompanies
the   spark     ofthe electrode and passes                         by

                               friction with the dry air makes the
latter negatively electric.

   In another place P. Riess" attempts to derive the action
of the electric egg from the fact that the air which surrounds
the electrode is charged with the electricity of the electrode

discharge, and this air must be         through subsequently
by the explosive discharge ; therefore a discharge in a direc

                 Passage   of Electricity   through Gases.           177
      With reference to this question we must recur to the
   experiments in which one electrode is put to earth while
   the electricity of the machine is transmitted to the other
   through an air-spark.      In this case the air-charge must begin
    .
   at once,  on the   passage    of the air-spark, with a certain ac
   cumulation of   electricity,  and without any previous distribution
   of static electricity upon the sides of the glass; in conformity
         this we find here no distinct charge of the sides of the
   tube.
      When the discharge proceeding from the charged electrode
   passes through the tube, the two electricities of the electrode
    which is put to earth are also divided, and from the latter
   also the discharge begins, though only a short time after the
   other. Both discharges (which, though the movement pro
   ceeds from a communication between the molecules, still pro
   duce the impression of currents of air) meet towards the elec
   trode which is put to earth.        Being thus attracted to one an
   other, they contract; and since the discharge proceeding
   from the positive electrode begins with greater velocity than
   the negative, it penetrates more or less into the latter and
   presents to it a convex surface; and since at the meeting-point
              .
   the opposing electric molecules are much accelerated, the dis
   charge there appears brighter.
      As the dark space appears near the negative electrode, even
  when the electricity is conveyed to it through an air-spark
                                                           "...;
  and when the positive electrode is put to earth, it cannot be
  the meeting-point of the positive and negative                      Or
  the  place         the free   electricity  of the two are neutralized,
  since this would rather be warmer and brighter, as mentioned
 above.      As, however, the dark space, according to De la
  Rive's direct experiments, appears colder than the other part
 of the discharge, and a true current of electricity cannot cer
 tainly be proved to exist in it by means of derived currents
 (by which new electrodes are brought into the current), it
 therefore follows that the passage of electricity through the
 dark space must take place in a manner different from that of
 the rest of the discharge. Its appearance must depend upon
the magnitude of the charge on the electrodes necessary for
the commencement of a discharge, because under circum
stances otherwise similar it appears, to a certain extent, only
when the positive electrode is put to earth and the air-spark is
introduced between the machine and the negative electrode,
and not in a reversed arrangement.
     According to the experiments mentioned at the beginning
of this paper, the extent of the dark space increases with the
length of air-spark, it diminishes when between it and the

them, does a close aggregation ensue; the heat and brightness
then become greater, and are transmitted, as stated above,
from particle to particle.      Possibly, after the first collision, a
large number of consecutive equally charged molecules
travel some distance without a fresh collision between eac
other, in the same way as the molecules which first left the ne
gative electrode; and they may only then transmit their charge
to the unelectric molecules beyond them.          In this way lighter
and darker patches may appear alternately, forming the well
known striae.
    At the positive electrode the discharge begins at a much
higher charge than at the negative. With the same supply of
electricity it will pass in a much shorter time.             The gas
 molecules thrown off from it will be fewer; but they will be
 more highly charged, and will move from it with great velo
 city. The dark space, therefore, disappears.          Only in par
 ticular cases does it exist to a smaller      extent, viz. when the
 electrodes are directly connected with the machine, and when
 an air-spark is introduced at the negative electrode, by which
 means a reverse discharge of the tube, which has been charged
 by the positive electrode, may commence through the latter
 before the spark can break through the interval at the nega
 tive electrode.
   I   do not deny that many experiments will be needed to
 prove these theories.     But they essentially comprise the phe
                        general  aspect, which involves no suppo

 nature of    electricity.  The great difficulty and complication
 of the phenomena may make this preliminary statement not
 wholly needless; and }            to be able to supply some further
 contributions hereafter.
   We ought now to examine whether and how far the above
 mentioned researches, and the differences deduced from them
 as to the behaviour of the discharges at the positive and
 negative electrodes (which for brevity we may generally
 term positive and negative discharges), will explain the very
 interesting and remarkable details of their outward appearance,
 noticed more particularly by Hittorf", with electrodes of
 different forms. We must necessarily limit ourselves on this
 point to some of the more simple phenomena.

 ends; in this case also the repulsion of the electricity accu
 mulated round the electrodes on the glass, which spreads with
 decreasing density, at the ends of the electrodes is relatively
 least.   The discharge, therefore, soon passes under rather
 high pressure out # these front ends.          the air is more        If
 rarefied, the tension necessary for the commencement of the
   discharge, as well as the charge of the surrounding glass, and
   also the difference of the tension necessary for the discharge
   at different parts of the electrodes, are smaller, particularly at
   the negative electrode, which always requires a smaller charge.
   The electricity conveyed from the electric machine, or from
   the inductorium, is sufficient then to produce the discharge
   onto the negative electrode, and even at a certain dis
   tance from         its

different lengths are blown on to a glass globe containing the
negative electrode, and if at the ends of the tubes two similar
wires are placed as positive electrodes, and if the current of
induction is passed first through the long tube and then
through    the shorter, the intensity of the current appears
greater in the latter case, because, in consequence of the
                                                                        !.

   2. Influence of the surrounding spaces.—If the spaces sur
rounding the negative electrodes are not alike, different ten
sions are necessary in order to produce discharge. With
cylindrical electrodes of different thickness, but the same
length, enclosed in tubes of equal diameter, the thicker elec
trodes require a greater charge, because the repelling reaction
of the homonymous charge of the glass envelope on the elec
tricity of the surface of the electrode is greater; and also the
electrode itself, in consequence of                             its
                                         larger surface, requires                                                 a

mutual gravitation of their parts.    This application involves a
large assumption, viz. that the precession of a nebulous mass
is nearly the same as though it were rigid.     In defence thereof
I  can only quote Sir W. Thomson, who says, “Now, although
the full problem of precession and nutation, and what is now
necessarily included in it—tides, in a continuous revolving
liquid spheroid, whether homogeneous or heterogeneous, has
not yet been coherently            out,   think    see far enough      I                   I
towards a complete solution to say that precession and nuta
tions will be practically the same in it as in a solid globe, and
that the tides will be practically the same as those of the
equilibrium theory” ".
     I
     therefore once for                     all
                             make this assumption.

In  the first place, we observe that the magnetization, whether
temporary         permanent, begins
                     or                      sensible    very low to         be                     at

present less analogy with simple broken lines, such as would
be given by the old theory of the coercive force. This cha
racter also presents itself most distinctly in the curves given by
Rowland for various sorts of iron, contrary to the results fur
nished by Bessemer steel.
   Let us also notice that the ratio r, which we have found de
creasing towards a certain limit when the intensity of the
magnetizing force increased indefinitely, presents in the case
of soft-tempered steel a very definite minimum, beyond which r
augments very sensibly. Although this minimum presents

placed perpendicular to the magnetic meridian. The coil is
mounted on four rollers, and can be removed at pleasure; it
carries an index, which slides along the rail upon a divided
rule, the zero of which coincides with the axis of rotation. By
an appropriate arrangement the bars are kept exactly in the
axis of the coil.
   It has been verified that the deflection produced by a bar of
50 centims, length is exactly proportional to the cube of the
distance of its centre from the needle as soon as that distance
exceeds 2 metres: in general a much greater distance was
taken.                       -

  The results furnished by steel not hardened, to which the
preceding Tables relate, are particularly interesting.
   In the first place, the coefficient B is independent of the                                     in
tensity of the magnetizing current.      A determined value

magnetization corresponds a much smaller value,

and these polar distances are characteristic of the steel used—
the one for the temporary, the other for the permanent mag
netization.
   Secondly, the coefficient A1, which is referred to the tem
porary saturation, is greater than the coefficient, A2, corre
sponding to the permanent saturation. In general A1 and Ag
are functions of the intensity of the magnetizing force not dif
ferent from those which we have studied in sections          II.,                            I.,

these functions.
   Tempered bars furnish analogous results, provided that only
bars of the same temper be considered.   For them the values

results are of the same sort as those obtained for the values of
d= 2a in     section    I.
   B,
     Let us now pass to the inductions to be derived from the
direct results obtained from the study of the moments, relative
to the distribution.   If it be admitted that the quantity of free
magnetism contained in a slice of the thickness du, situated at
a distance u from the centre of any bar of the series studied,
may be represented by the formula

the magnetic moment y will be represented by formula (1).
The same letters in the two formulae refer to the same quan
tities.
    Inversely we admit with Biot" that, if the magnetic mo
ments verify formula (1), the distributions are conformable to
                                       ..
formula (2). The foregoing experiments supply the values of
the constants A and B characteristic of the distribution.
    To explain to ourselves          the physical character of
these constants, let us consider the case of a bar of infinite
length. In this case the distribution will be represented,
starting from the end of the bar as origin, by the formula

                 Mr. O. Heaviside on the Speed of Signalling
   Later on the same instruments were introduced between
London and Amsterdam, on a circuit consisting of a land-line
of 130 miles on the English side, then a cable of 120 miles,
                                   of 20 miles (Culley, Journ.
               vol. i.). In this case the maximum speed ob
tained was 50 per cent. higher from Amsterdam to London
than vice versá. Again, on the London-Dublin circuit, con
sisting of cable 66 miles and land-lines 266 and 10 miles, the
longer line being on the English side, the speed from Dublin
to London was double that obtained in the reverse direction,
viz. 80 and 40 words per minute respectively. Similarly- be
tween London and Belfast.
   In all these cases it is to be observed that the station nearest
the cable receives the most slowly, and that the greater the
inequality of resistance of the land-lines, the greater is the dif
ference in the working-speeds.             This seems to point directly
to the conclusion that the uncentrical position of the cable in
the circuit actually causes the retardation to be greater in one
direction than in the other.          The fact that the cable receives a
much larger charge of electricity when the battery is connected
to the end of the shorter than to the end of the longer land
line might, on a cursory examination, seem to corroborate this
conclusion.       But when the light of theory is thrown upon this
view of the matter it is at once found to be untenable.
   It is easily shown that if condensers be distributed in an
arbitrary manner along a line which is to earth at each end,
dividing it into sections having any resistances, and the con
densers be         initially discharged, the introduction
                      all                                              elec   of    an

battery is less than the receiver resistance, and least in the
 contrary case. Now if the battery is always in circuit, as in
making signals with a reversing key, the effect of any arbitrary
signals may be calculated by the same formula, and the maxi
mum working-speed (always provided it be within the reach
of the apparatus) will be least when the station nearest the
cable receives, if the battery is less than the receiver resistance,
and greatest in the contrary case.         Generally, the more cen
trally the capacity is situated the greater the retardation.
   The influence of leakage or faults may be readily determined
in a similar manner, since the retardation is proportional to
the resistance through which the charge in the cable discharges
to earth.     In        all

the latter case, and, by reason of the before-mentioned pecu
liarities, the station A nearest the cable receives more slowly
than B. The explanation of the reduction of speed by leakage
is similar. The leakage lessens the retardation and conse
quently quickens the signals. If every signal were quickened
in the same proportion, as would happen were the circuit
always complete, it is evident that the speed of working must
be increased ; but it is easily seen that the decrease in the re
tardation caused by the loss is proportionally much less when
the circuit is complete than when the line is insulated at
the sending-end, thus increasing the irregularity in the re
ceived signals due to the unequal intervals between the
sent signals, and consequently lowering the working-speed.
Again, the addition of resistance at the
at A in   fig.  2, when B sends to   A,  may     ... ."       , as
                                              increase the work
ing-speed.       Now, since the addition of resistance obviously
increases the retardation, nothing could result save a de
crease of speed if the retardation of every signal were         in
creased in the same ratio.      But this is not the case ; for the
retardation is increased in a greater ratio when the line is    in
sulated at the sending-end than when the circuit is complete
—exactly the opposite to what occurs with leakage: then the
working-speed was lowered; now it is increased.         (This rea
soning will not, of course, apply to other systems of transmis
sion.) On the other hand, the speed is lowered by inserting
resistance at the sending-end, B, fig. 2; for the retardation is
unaltered with line insulated, ãºf increased with complete
circuit.
   To ascertain the exact amount of retardation produced b
resistance at either or both ends of a submarine cable, each.
case must be calculated separately, because the form of the
curve of arrival of the current is altered, the law of the squares
only holding good when exactly similar systems are compared.

stant potential ; (6) shows the arrival-curve when a resistance      -
equal to the cable's is inserted at each.end. . . .
    It will be observed from an inspection of the curves, that,
when resistance is added at one end of a cable only, the effect
in increasing the retardation is very great when the added
resistance is small, but as more and more resistance is added
there is not much further effect. The limit is reached in
curve (5). But the insertion of resistance at both ends has a
much greater retarding influence, which increases without
limit. Compare (4) with (6): in (4) we have twice the
cable's resistance at one end and none at the other; in (6) the
same resistance is equally divided at each end, and the retar
dation is very greatly increased.
    With respect to the change in the form of the arrival-curves,
it will be seen that, when resistance is inserted, the first part
of the arrived current is proportionally less retarded than the
later parts.      Thus, comparing (1) with (6), when there is no
 resistance inserted the current reaches 5 per cent. of                maxi    as its
mum       in2:45a,  whereas (6) takes      6a,              or

An Elementary Treatise     on Elliptic Functions.    By ARTHUR CAY
  LEY, Sadlerian Professor of Pure Mathematics in the University of
   Cambridge.     Cambridge:     Deighton, Bell, and Co.     London:
  Bell and Sons. 1876. 8vo. Pp. 384.
IN     most works on the Calculus the subject of Elliptic Integrals is
      either altogether excluded or treated inadequately; and not
merely is this the case with works that are in fact elementary, but
even in the elaborate treatise of the late Professor De Morgan the
subject is dismissed in two paragraphs, which are in substance as
follows:—“Important as Elliptic Integrals are in certain classes
of problems, and numerous as have been the properties of them,
which have been investigated, it cannot yet be said that either these
                                                                                       to on
problems or methods              lie
                              close     the grand route
                                       so                 towhich the
students' elementary course should         marked out       require
                                                               be                 as

                                        to                                                               on a

                                                   fact Legendre worked
at  the subject, systematizing and supplementing the work               his                         of
predecessors and making the actual numerical calculations, for
about forty years. His results,      their final form, were published
                                                     in                                                  in
1825–26. They were scarcely out when the subject was treated from
an entirely new point      view   of                 by
                                     Jacobi, whose Fundamenta Nova
was published       1829, being preceded and followed
                     in                                           memoirs                   by
from 1828      1858, and
               to                      by
                            Abel, whose memoirs appeared from 1826
to 1829.
  It  will be seen from this statement that the student who wishes
to  make out the subject will not gain much help from the ordinary
textbooks; and indeed not much has been written (we believe) on
the subject     English, beyond the works referred
                in                                             the note           to   in                 to

    needed; and students have reason to be thankful that the task of
  writing such    a book has been undertaken by one in every way so
    competent as Professor Cayley.       His Treatise “is founded upon
    Legendre's Traité des Fonctions Elliptiques, and upon Jacobi's
   Fundamenta Nova and memoirs by him in Crelle's Journal;” he has
    made “comparatively very little use of the investigations of Abel
   or of those of later authors.” A good deal has, however, been done
   in treating “various points which require to be more fully discussed”
   than they have been by Jacobi, and particularly the theory of the
   Elliptic functions themselves, and not included in the Fundamenta
   Nova the “theory of the partial differential equation satisfied by the
   functions 9, H, and deduced therefrom the partial differential equa
  tions satisfied by the numerators and denominators in the theories
  of the multiplication and transformation of the elliptic functions.”
      The Treatise is expressly designed for the use of students, and
  great care has been taken to prevent them from being lost in the
  wilderness of symbols to which the author introduces them. Thus
  the first chapter is taken up with a general outline of the subject,
  and the student is directed to peruse the chapter, not dwelling on
 it,  but returning                  it   as
                                finds occasion, the object being that

 THE“On       the Origin of Windings of Rivers in   Alluvial Plains, with
 Remarks on the Flow of Water round Bends           in Pipes.”   By  Pro
 fessor James Thomson, LL.D., F.R.S.E.
     In respect to the origin of the windings of rivers flowing through
 alluvial plains, people have usually taken the rough notion that
 when there is a bend in any way commenced, the water just rushes
 out against the outer bank of the river at the bend, and so washes
 that bank away, and allows deposition to occur on the inner bank,
 and thus makes the sinuositv increase.       But in this the v overlook
                                                                          t
the hydraulic principle, not generally known, that a suream flowing
along a straight channel and thence into a curve must flow with a
diminished velocity along the outer bank, and an increased velocity
along the inner bank, if we regard the flow as that of a perfect
fluid.   In view of this principle, the question arose to me some
years ago:—Why does not the inner bank wear away more than

                  of Windings of Rivers in Alluvial Plains.                                                   229
the outer one 2  We know by general experience and observation
that in fact the outer one does wear away, and that deposits are
often made along the inner one.   How does this arise ?
   The explanation occurred to me in the year 1812, mainly as
                 ".
follows:—For any lines of particles taken across the stream at
different        as A,B, A,B, &c. in fig. 2, and which may be
designated in general as AB, if the line be level, the water-pressure
must be increasing from A to B, on account of the centrifugal
force of the particles composing that line or bar of water; or,
what comes to the same thing, the water-surface of the river
will have a transverse inclination rising from A to B. The water
in any stream-line CD E* at or near the surface, or in any case
not close to the bottom, and flowing nearly along the inner bank,
will not accelerate itself in entering on the bend, except in con
sequence of its having a fall of free level in passing along that stream
linet.
   But the layer of water along the bottom, being by friction much
retarded, has much less centrifugal force in any bar of     particles                           its
extending across the river; and consequently      will flow sidewise             it
along the bottom towards the inner bank, and will, part                                                 of   it    at
least, rise       up
              between the stream-line and the inner bank, and will
protect the bank from the rapid scour       that stream-line and  of                                               of

    On the other hand, along the outer bank there will be a general
tendency to descent of surface-water which will have a high velo
city, not having been much impeded by friction; and this will wear
away the bank and carry the worn substance in a great degree down
to the bottom, where, as explained before, there will be a general
 prevailing tendency towards the inner bank.
    Now, further, it seems that even from the very beginning of the
 curve forward there will thus be a considerable protection to the
 inner bank. Because a surface stream-line CD, or one not close to
 the bottom, flowing along the bank which in the bend becomes the
 inner bank, will tend to depart from the inner bank at D, the com
 mencement of the bend, and to go forward along DE, or by some such
 course, leaving the space G between it and the bank to be supplied
 by slower-moving water which has been moving along the bottom of
 the river perhaps by some such oblique path as the dotted line FG.
     It is further to be observed that ordinarily or very frequently
 there will be detritus travelling down stream along the bottom and
 seeking for resting-places, because the cases here specially under
 consideration are only such as occur in alluvial plains; and in
 regions of that kind there is ordinarily", on the average, more de
 position than erosion. This consideration explains that we need
 not have to seek for the material for deposition on the inner bank
 in the material worn away from the outer bank of the sºme bend
 of the river. . The material worn from the outer bank may have to
 travel a long distance down stream before finding an inner bank
 of a bend on which to deposit itself. And now it seems very clear
 that in the gravel, sand, and mud carried down stream along the
 bottom of the river to the place where the bend commences, there
 is an ample supply of detritus for deposition on the inner bank of
 the river even at the earliest points in the curve which will offer any
 resting-place.     It is especially worthy of notice that the oblique
 flow  along  the bottom towards the inner bank begins even up stream
 from the    bend,   as already explained, and as shown by the dotted
 line FG in     fig.  3. The transverse movement comprised in this

 been producing the alluvial plain have become extinct, and erosion by the river
 has come to predominate over deposition.

oblique flow is instigated by the abatement of pressure, or lower
ing of free level, in the water along the inner bank produced by
centrifugal force in the way already explained.
   It may now be remarked that the considerations which have
in the present paper been adduced in respect to the mode of flow of
water round a bend of a river, by bringing under notice, conjointly,
the lowering of free level of the water at and near the inner bank,
and the raising of free level of the water at and near the outer bank
relatively to the free level of the water at middle of the stream,
and the effect of retardation of velocity in the layer flowing along
the bed of the channel in diminishing the centrifugal force in the
layer retarded, and so causing that retarded water, and also fric

the bend, to flow obliquely towards the inner bank, tend very mate
rially to elucidate the subject of the mode of flow of water round
bends in pipes, and the manner in which bends cause augmentation

    “On Repulsion resulting from Radiation. Influence of the Resi
 dual Gas.”—(Preliminary Notice.) By William Crookes, F.R.S. &c.
    I have recently been engaged in experiments which are likely
 to throw much light on some obscure points in the theory of the
 repulsion resulting from radiation.      In these   I have been mate
rially assisted by Professor Stokes, both in original suggestions
 and in the mathematical formulae necessary for the reduction of
 the results.   Being prevented by other work from completing the
 experiments sufficiently to bring them before the Royal Society
                                      I
 prior to the close of the session, have thought that it might be
of interest were     I to publish a short abstract of the principal
 results  I   have   obtained, reserving the details until they are
ready to be brought forward in a more complete form.
   In the early days of this research, when it was found that no
movement took place until the vacuum was so good as to be
almost beyond the powers of an ordinary air-pump to produce,
and that as the vacuum got more and more nearly absolute, so the
force increased in power, it was justifiable to assume that the action
would still take place when the minute trace of residual gas
which theoretical reasoning proved to be present was removed.
The first and most obvious explanation therefore was that the
repulsive force was directly due to radiation.             Further con
sideration, however, showed that the very best vacuum which            I
 had succeeded in producing might contain enough matter to offer
 considerable resistance to motion.        I  have already pointed out
 that in some experiments, where the rarefaction was pushed to a
very high point, the torsion-beam appeared to be swinging in a

viscous fluid (194); and this at once led me to think that the                                                                   re
pulsion caused by radiation was indirectly due to a difference of
thermometric heat between the black and white surfaces of the
moving body (195), and that it might be due to a secondary action
on the residual gas.
   On April 5, 1876,                          I
                                exhibited at the Soirée of the Royal Society
an instrument which proved the presence of residual gas in a
radiometer which had been exhausted to a very high point of sen
sitiveness. A small piece of pith was suspended to one end of a
cocoon fibre, the other end being attached to a fragment of steel.
An external magnet held the steel to the inner side of the glass
globe, the pith then hanging down like a pendulum, about a mil
limetre from the rotating vanes of the radiometer.                       By placing
a candle at different distances off, any desired velocity, up to several                     fly
hundreds per minute, could be imparted to the                      the radiometer.           of
Scarcely any movement                the pendulum was produced when the

with mirror, being suspended from the stopper, the rotation of
the bulb can only cause a motion of the pith through the inter
vention of the enclosed air.      Were there no viscosity of the air,
the pith would not move; but if there be viscosity, the pith will turn
in the same direction as the bulb, though not to the same extent,
and, after stopping the vessel, will oscillate backwards and                                                                  for

exhaust, the force of radiation commences to be apparent, the
viscosity remaining about the same.          The viscosity next commences
to  diminish,  the force of radiation       increasing.     After long-con
tinued exhaustion the force of radiation         approaches     a maximum ;
but the    viscosity   measured    by   the logarithmic    decrement begins
to fall off, the decrease    being  rather sudden after it has once com
menced.
    Lastly, some time after the logarithmic decrement has com
 menced to fall off, and when it is about one fourth of what it
 was at the commencement, the force of radiation diminishes.               At

   1. “Note on the Question of the Glacial or Wolcanic Origin of
the Talchir Boulder-bed of India and the Karoo Boulder-bed of

South Africa.” By H. F. Blanford, Esq., F.G.S.
   The author, referring to a doubt expressed by the President in a
paper on Australian Tertiary Corals as to the glacial origin of the
Talchir Boulder-bed, indicated that the hypothesis of its formation
by the action of local glaciers under present climatal conditions
would require the elevation of the whole region to the extent of
14,000 or 15,000 feet, and the assumption that the denudation of
this great mountain mass was so moderate that large tracts of the
ancient surface are still preserved at levels now only a few hun
dred feet above the sea.      This the author regarded as very im
probable.     He assumed that the President, rejecting the evidence
adduced by various writers in favour of the glacial origin of the
Talchir and Karoo Boulder-beds, was inclined to fall back upon the
notion of their being of volcanic origin, and quoted a letter from
Mr. King, who had described the Talchir rocks of Kámáram as trap
pean, in which that gentleman stated that the rocks so interpreted
by him prove to be dark green and brownish mudstone. He cited
further evidence of like nature, and concluded that the ascription of
a volcanic origin to these boulder-beds was probably in          cases   all
due     similar misinterpretations.

 render the rock distinctly columnar.      At the eastern end of the
 mountain the stone is so close in texture as often almost to resemble
 chert.    In the next two quarries westward the rock is coarser, and
 its jointing less regular.   In the most westerly quarry the stone is
 generally fresher in appearance, closer in grain, and greener in
 colour. All these stones are probably modifications of the same
 original rock. From the chemical analysis of the rocks the author
concludes that, supposing them all to have had originally the same
composition as the unaltered rock in the most westerly quarry, that
at the extreme east of the mountain has lost about 3 per cent. of
silica, and the others have received respectively an increase of 1:35
and 0.77 per cent. of silica.     The altered rocks contain an abun
dance of quartz granules, due probably to the crystallization of pro
gressively dissociated silica, as the specimens of rock in which these
granules occur do not contain a larger proportion of silica than
those in which its presence can hardly be detected under the
microscope.     The proportion of alkalies in the different specimens
does not    materially vary.
    Overlying the second quarry at the east end of the mountain is an
ash bed of reddish brown colour, containing more than 10 per cent.
 of protoxide of manganese and nearly 20 per cent. of peroxide of
iron, and showing a great diminution in the percentage of silica
when compared with the associated crystalline rock.
    The author further described the characters of the uralite-por
phyry of the Mawddach valley near Dolgelly, which is of a greyish
green colour, spotted with black, and consists of a granular base
enclosing patches and crystals of uralite, the outlines of which are
sometimes sharp and well defined, but generally rounded and merging
into the general base.

   The saline solutions        are pulverized by a jet of compressed air;
the   air, charged    with    powder,    enters a regulator, into which the
gas also comes, and whence a mixture issues of constant composi
tion.      This mixture passes into a vertical tube of 19 millims.
 diameter, capped with iron-wire gauze, above which it burns with
a conical flame 6–8 centims. in height.                The height of the inner
 cone varies from 3 or 4 centims. to zero; and the flame can be
 rendered oxidizing or reducing.
     By means of a lens the image of the flame is thrown upon the
 slit of the spectroscope.         Two spectra are then seen, the one above
 the other.      The lower spectrum is produced by the light of the
 blue surface; and                  all

    Chloride of Platinum.—The flame is of a bluish whiteness; its
illumination is equal to that of a wax taper. The upper spectrum
shows a continuous bright luminosity, with some feeble bands and
lines.     The lower does not resemble the electric spectrum ; it is
formed of a fine series of sufficiently brilliant bands, less bright on
the side towards the red, their other edge being clean; a few fainter
lines are also seen.
    Of the other metals, some have not been submitted to experi

degree reducing.       On charging the flame with gas the interior come

    XXXIII.       On the Theory of an Imperfectly Homogeneous
         Elastic Solid. By Professor C. NIVEN, Queen's College,
         Cork.”.
    1.   THE     present paper attempts to deal with the theory of a
            solid composed of elastic material, homogeneous on a
    large scale but not homogeneous when considered in detail.
    It may be likened, to use Sir W. Thomson's comparison, to a
    wall built of rubble, which appears homogeneous enough when
    looked at from a sufficiently great distance.        Inside such a
    substance the stress across a small plane area will not be a
    simple force, but may, under certain circumstances, consist of
                                                 i.
    a force and a couple.     In fact the investigation was suggested
    by the theories of the bending and twisting of wires and of

              Imperfectly Homogeneous Elastic Solid.                          243
   Mathematical theories of an apparently continuous substance
are sometimes based upon finer molecular theories.      The dis
tribution, however, of the molecules and of their properties
presents so many irregularities and discontinuities, that it is
             to trace the changes which take place in each indi
vidual, and we are thus obliged to confine ourselves to taking
the average of a large number of them; and it is this average
with which we are concerned in explaining the sensible pro
perties of matter.    In this way the dynamical theory of gases
has been    constructed;   and the earlier theories of elasticity
rested on a similar foundation.     Green's theory of elasticity,
on the other hand, is based on the general consideration that,
whatever be the nature of the forces acting in the interior of a
solid, the energy required to produce the change of form of
an element-volume depends only on the deformations which it
experiences.     These may be expressed in the following man
ner.     Ifu, v, w be the displacements of a point (w, y, z),
u-H Au, v-H Av, w-H Aw those of an adjacent point (a +h, y + k,

    We might now find, by       the method of last article, the values
of the    stress-components    and the equations of motion of the
solid.     If this were done, it would be found that the substance
transmits in every direction two circular waves oppositely po
larized, and would therefore give rise to rotatory polarization.
We need not stay to discuss these calculations, as the results
are included under the general theory of an aeolotropic solid,
to which     I now proceed.

    8. To the terms which occur in the ordinary theory of a
homogeneous substance we have now to add the terms of
classes (I., III.), (I., IV.), (I., W.).      This part of the energy
apparently contains 6 x 27 = 162 coefficients.         But it must be
noted that there are nine relations connecting the members of
group W. with the differential coefficients of ori, or, ars, and
that these differential coefficients are also connected by the
 relation

 The number of independent constants is thus reduced to 102.
 I shall now endeavour to ascertain whether these terms afford
any illustration of              polarization in            as they do
in   isotropic  substances.   It must be admitted     that, in the pre
sent state of science, theories of double refraction based on the
study of the vibrations of elastic bodies are rather of the nature
 of dynamical illustrations than real explanations. Still, even
 if they serve no more useful end, they may help us to picture
to ourselves the geometrical laws of the phenomena. , Green
has given two theories of double refraction, one of which was
 ...i    upon the hypothesis that the elastic substance was pri
mitively free from strain, and transmitted in every direction
two plane waves whose vibrations were strictly in the front of
the wave. In his second theory he introduces an initial state
 of stress, and by properly determining these stresses obtains
the same geometrical construction for the wave-velocities as
before, but with the direction of vibration now at right angles
to that in the former theory.         I  shall make use of the first
theory, and apply the same hypothesis of two strictly trans
versal waves to the new terms now introduced.               It is clear,
however, that the results will not be affected by adopting the
second form of Green's theory.
    The following method of introducing the condition that the
substance shall always transmit two strictly transversal waves
is substantially the same as that given by Lamé in his repro

250                          Prof. C. Niven on the Theory of an
duction of Green's theory, and is somewhat more easily applied
than his process or Green's.   Let the small motions of a solid

for two of these terms; and we may observe that it follows
from this that the interior parts of these terms may be sup
posed to have been already combined with those belonging
directly to classes (I., III.), (I., IV.). The existence, there
fore, of the terms of the class at present under consideration
in no way affects the internal movements of the solid, though
it does affect the specification of the stress to which the solid
is everywhere subject. For in addition to the forces and
couples which have been already considered in art. 6, we must
also imagine stress whose proximate effect is a variation in the
state of strain of the parts of the solid adjacent to the plane at
which it acts.    I proceed now to prove the proposition men

            XXXIV.    Note on the Polarization of                 Heat.
                  By G. CAREY FosTER, F.R.S."
           following           of the amounts of heat trans
THEmitted by twodeterminations
                  Nicol's prisms, whose principal sections
make different angles with each other, were recently made in
the Physical Laboratory of University College, London, by
Mr. M.     J.
            Jackson.    Although the results amount to nothing
more than an additional verification of a relation that is already
thoroughly established,          I
                             venture to put them on record, not
only because such verifications are satisfactory in themselves,
but also because the apparatus required for conveniently re
peating experiments of this kind is not always at hand.
   The source of heat was a rather powerful paraffin-oil lamp
(supplied by White, of Glasgow, for use with a Thomson's
quadrant electrometer).      The rays from the lamp were con
centrated  by  a lens of 7.5 centims. diameter and about 22 cen
tims. focal length, placed so as to produce a real image of the
lamp-flame within the silvered reflecting cone of the thermo
pile. Immediately behind the lens (on the side next the lamp)
a double screen of polished sheet brass was placed, whereby
the radiation could be cut off or allowed to pass at will. On the
other side of the lens came two Nicol's prisms, each about 20
centims. long, and giving a clear circular field about 6-7
centims. in diameter.     The prisms are protected at the ends
º
by disks of thin glass, which were left on during the experi
ments.     It is to #. possession of these fine prisms, made for
me by Mr. C. D. Ahrens, that the possibility of making the
experiments with so much ease was due.            The thermopile,
which was about 95 centims. distant from the lens, was
             from stray radiation by a double hood of tin-plate.
   e galvanometer was a reflecting instrument of low resist
ance, on Sir William Thomson's principle, made by my assist
ant, Mr. Grant.      By means of a commutator inserted between
the  thermopile   and the galvanometer, two opposite deflections
were obtained for each position of the prisms.       In the follow
ing Table, the column headed 81 gives the means of the deflec
tions to right and left when the angle, 6, between the prin
cipal sections of the prisms was measured in one direction;
                                     82,
and the column headed         the corresponding deflections when
this  angle  was measured      the opposite direction.

an excess of 366. Thus it appears that the force of gravity
is enough, and a little more than enough, when acting on a
nebulous mass, to cause a rotation with sufficient velocity to
make the centrifugal equal to the centripetal force, and there
fore to separate nebulous rings from the equatorial zone.—
Q. E. D.
    But what became of the excess (.366) of the velocity due to
the force of gravity? Plainly that proportion of the force was
expended by the friction of the rotating exterior layer on the
unrotating interior.                                 I
                         As have already shown, the rotation
of some of the ancient nebulae began on the exterior; and there
fore the exterior layer must necessarily have been retarded by
friction on the interior layers. By calculation have found that                      I

regions, being near the axis of rotation, must always have
sympathized more with the unrotating interior, because they
had less distance to fall to the axis to acquire velocity by their
falls. The present excess of equatorial velocity must be
regarded as a relic of the past, just as fossil remains in the
earth's crust tell of the state of things in times long ago.

pose, for instance, our solar nebula to have been expanded
originally to less than half the distance to the nearest fixed
star, say to 3500 times the distance of Neptune.      Then much
less than the 40,000,000,000th of the entire mass would have

exterior to that          oft

1. The Velocity           of Sound, and Ratio of Specific Heats, in Air.
   On examining the received values of the velocity of sound,
it becomes apparent that the discordance between the results
of different experimenters is considerable.        propose to                        I
put the results together and compare the different experi
mental data which can be brought to bear on the subject.
Without attempting to give a final result, I think some con
siderations of interest can be suggested as to the values that
most nearly satisfy the different determinations and require
ments.                            -
  The following Table represents the velocities of sound found
by different observers, reaching from the middle of the last
century up to the present time:–

   In the next place, his proceedings bring to light the diffi
culty in correctly allowing for wind &c. #, always employed
reciprocal discharges in the open-air experiments; but it was
clear that accidental influences were not entirely eliminated.
This consideration alone furnishes an objection fatal to the
authority of           all

   As between Regnault's results and those of any one else,                                          I
have no doubt that in Regnault's we know far more about the
different elements of the question in a trustworthy manner
than in any other case.     But it does not follow that his num
ber is to be taken as true to the first place of decimals.
     If
      we examine the isolated determinations, we find that the
deviations are not inconsiderable: in some cases they amount
to fully the difference between Regnault's own number and
332 metres, or thereabouts, which is more usually accepted.
   Under these circumstances we can form no definite con
clusion from the numbers before us; but I think that if we
take Regnault's number (330.7 metres) and the ordinary
number (332 metres), the mean between them, 331-35 metres,
or thereabouts, will afford a number which will be safe to work
with, and may be used with a certain reserve as representing
this number
knows.      It may

                           but have never come across    any allu
sion to it.
   The connexion between the ratio of the specific heats and
the observed velocities of sound is as follows (I insert the
velocities in feet here, as we are generally here accustomed to
reckon this particular datum in this way):-

   These numbers are reckoned with data which give 918.5
feet for the Newtonian velocity.
   Regnault, selecting the velocity which he applies to the
specific heats, and applying small corrections, gets 13945 for
the ratio he adopts.

     Isuppose, however, that the principal objection would have
been that the experimental data were not consistent with the
hypothesis. In answer it seems to be enough to look at the
Table at the beginning of this note; we can say without hesi
tation that, giving due weight to Regnault's experiments, it is
impossible to conclude with any certainty whether the true
value of the ratio of specific heats lies above or below 1:40.
    At the same time, since there must be internal work done
in the atoms in some way that we do not comprehend, though
it is probably very small, we may regard such a value as Reg
nault's (13945) as compatible with a possible explanation,
since with such a value the total         vica   slightly greatervis        is

   In view of this comment, the above values cannot be
regarded as beyond admissible limits.       We may conclude,
then, that the values 1-40 for ratio of specific heats, and 331-2
metres or 1087 feet for the velocity of sound, are a fair repre
sentation of experimental results—and that they give rise to
no discordances in their connexion with other data and theories,
which are of an amount to call for rectification on the evidence

ding communications contained in the Numbers of the           ‘Phi
losophical Magazine’ for May and November 1876, and at
the same time departs in no respect from the principles of the
   eneral hydrodynamical theory of the physical forces which       I
    ve now for a long time upheld.
    Considering, first, the case of the radiometer with the vanes
                           I
blackened on one side, assume that the radiant light or heat
which is incident on the vanes, being thereby converted into
heat of temperature, causes the atoms in a thin superficial
stratum to be displaced from their neutral positions, and in
 greater degree on the blackened side than on the other, on
account of the greater accession of temperature on that side.
 It is true that the intrinsic molecular forces of the vanes will
tend continually to make the atoms return to their neutral
 positions; but since at the same time the disturbing force is
 continually in action, the result of the antagonistic forces, so
 long as the disturbance is operative, will be a persistent ab
 normal condition of the superficial stratum. This is a real
 change of condition of the vanes, by whatever name it be
called. It seems to me that it would be best described by
           j
 the term thermo-electric.      But it is of chief importance to
 remark, that every such superficial disturbance, however
 caused, gives rise to a steady circulating atherial current, in
 which the pressure varies so as to be always less the greater
 the velocity, and that consequently atoms immersed in such a
 current       be dynamically acted upon by reason of the vari
                                   .
 ation of  pressure.   In the present instance the course of the
 current is from the blackened to the opposite surface, because,
 on account of the greater expansion of the vane on the warmer
 side, the channel for the current diminishes and the velocity
 increases towards the bright side, and accordingly the dyna
 mical action is the same as if the vane were pushed on the
 blackened side.      [I have so fully discussed the above-cited
  hydrodynamical proposition in previous communications, that

                     case of the cup-shaped radiometer(No. 1035),
  we may   assume that when the               effect of the incident
  radiant light or heat, converted into heat of temperature, is just
  counterbalanced by the tendency of the superficial atoms to take
  the positions in which they are ordinarily held by the molecular
  forces, they will, as in the former case, be permanently dis
  placed from their neutral positions. But because both the
  radiating surfaces are bright, the action will be the same on
  both, so far as regards the amount of expansion caused by the
  accession of temperature. There will, however, be the differ

ence, that a given displacement in the normal direction will
cause the atoms in a given superficial area to be spread over a
larger portion of convex surface than of concave surface,
the motion in both cases being from within to without, and
the lines of motion being divergent for the convex surface and
convergent for the concave surface.     On this account there
will be, capteris paribus, greater atomic density at the con
cave surface than at the convex surface, and the latter will
be in the condition of the blackened surface of the ordi
nary radiometer.        Hence the cup-shaped             radiometer will
move as if it were    pushed    on the convex side, as is found ex
perimentally to be the case.
   The experiments referred to showed that the motion of the
radiometer was in the same direction and nearly the same
in amount, whether the light fell only on the convex side,
or only on the concave side, and that in either case the rate of
revolution was about half what it is when the light falls on
both sides. These results may be considered to be consistent
with the theory, inasmuch as we may draw the inference from
the supposed thermo-electrical character of the disturbance, that
the state of displacement of the atoms induced by a disturb
ance on one surface is spread equally over both by superficial
conduction, and consequently that the action is of the same
 kind whether one surface or both be illumined.
   When this radiometer was heated by a hot shade or plunged
in hot water, rotation was caused in the opposite direction to
that caused by the light.           Under either of these circum
stances the superficial atomic density of a vane must be the
same throughout in order that                its
                                         molecular forces may coun

In  this paper Mendelejeff drew attention      the “periodic law” to
announced        him by  1869, according
                                in            which “the proper  to

prises certain of those elements which form oxides having the
general formula R, O3, viz. boron, having the atomic weight
of 11, aluminium = 27, yttrium = 88, indium = 113, didy
mium = 138 (?), erbium = 178 (?), and thallium =204.                 But
when this group is compared with others with which it ought
(theoretically) to present certain analogies, it becomes evident
that there are several gaps in the series.        These gaps M. Men
delejeff has filled with hypothetical elements.             Two vacant
places occur between aluminium and indium ; to the second of
these the hypothetical metal ekaaluminium is assigned.               The
analogies between this metal and aluminium, on the one hand,
                                                            ..
and indium, on the other, should be, according to theory,
somewhat the same as those existing between zinc and magne
sium and cadmium, or arsenic and phosphorus and antimony.
    In the paper already referred               to,
                                         the theoretical properties              of
ekaaluminium and of some of its salts are                       M. Men
delejeff then puts forward the suggestion that the new metal
gallium, discovered August              3,

        No. 2.-On Franklandite, a       new Mineral Borate.
MAN.           analyses have been made from time to time of
          sodio-calcic borates, brought chiefly from the Peruvian
province of Tarapaca.         Most of the analyses seem to show
that the    specimens  of borates examined were mixtures of some
predominant mineral, such as the well-defined Ulexite, with
varying quantities of one or more borates containing a larger
proportion of sodium than Ulexite.        I have lately had the op
portunity of examining a specimen of a borate from Tarapaca
which has the same components as Ulexite, namely sodium,
calcium, boron, oxygen, and water, but which is much richer
in alkali than that mineral, and which seems to be a nearly
                                               I
pure specimen of the mineral with which supposed Ulexite to
be often associated.       The specimen   I analyzed was brought
from Peru by Mr. Graves, and was kindly placed in my hands
for examination by the Rev. Dr. Haughton.
    The specimen consists of a felted mass of long, thin, inter
laced fibres, which are white in colour and possess a silky
lustre. Under the microscope, the fibrous crystals taken from
the cleanest portions of the mass were seen to be free from any

    The mineral is easily fused, first losing much water.
    The taste of the mineral is first slightly saline, owing to the
presence of a little admixed common salt, and is afterwards
somewhat alkaline.        It is slightly soluble in water, but is
easily and almost completely dissolved by dilute hydrochloric
and nitric acids, the minute residue consisting of particles of
clay.                       -
    When portions of the mineral mass were digested with
nearly ice-cold water, a sensible quantity of chloride was
dissolved     out.   The solution, evaporated on a glass micro
 scopic slide, afforded the well-known crystals of sodic chlo
ride. A little calcium was also dissolved by the water. In
 some of my earlier experiments upon this body               I was led,
 through the carelessness of a junior assistant, to suppose that
 the percentage of chloride present was much greater than it is

shown to be in the analysis given further on. The specimen
taken for this analysis was carefully picked by myself from the
best parts of the mass and the selected portions then mixed.
   The analytical process was conducted in the following way:-
   A weighed quantity of the borate was dissolved in pure
dilute nitric acid; to the solution excess of silver nitrate was
added, and the precipitated chloride of silver filtered off and de
termined. The excess of silver was then separated from the
filtrate by just sufficient hydrochloric acid ; a calculated excess
of pure oxalic acid was next added, and the solution then ren
dered alkaline by ammonia.

a small quantity of sulphuric acid separated and estimated with
the aid of baric nitrate, the excess of the latter being in turn
removed by treatment with sulphuric acid. The solution was
now transferred to a platinum dish and evaporated to a small

chemist whose researches on the organo-boron compounds
have contributed so materially to extend our knowledge of
those interesting bodies.
   Although the formulae given above for the two minerals are
not in any true sense “constitutional,” they make one point
clear, namely that the substitution of one molecule of sodic
oxide (Na, O) for three molecules of water is capable of con
verting Ulexite into Franklandite, so far at least as composi
tion is concerned.    As a change of this kind can evidently be
effected by  various indirect means, it is to be expected that
mixtures of the two borates in different proportions would be
 found; and the observed differences in the analytical results
afforded by some specimens of native sodio-calcic borates seem
to indicate that such mixtures are not uncommonly met with.

XL.        On Liquid Vorter-Rings.    By John TRowbridge, S.D.,
           Assistant Professor of Physics, Harvard College".
IT    has often been observed by chemists that a drop of
      coloured liquid falling from a burette or a capillary tube
                                                         W.
into a liquid of different specific gravity, in which it can dif
fuse, assumes the form of a ring.

researches of                             and              is now
                                                   I
attracting so much attention that have thought that a study
of the general equations of motion of matter in connexion
with a study of the rings would contribute to our knowledge
of vortex movement. Professor W. B. Rogers published in
the American Journal of Arts and Sciences for 1858 an ex
tended paper on smoke rings and liquid rings, and described
various methods of forming them. This paper seems to have
been overlooked by recent investigators.         It is a singular
coincidence that Helmholtz should have       published   his great
memoir on vortex movements in the same        year that the article
of Professor Rogers, which details purely the experimental
 side of the subject, appeared on the other side of the Atlantic.
 Professor Tait's method of forming smoke rings, which is also
referred to by Sir William Thomson in his paper on vortex
atoms, is now well known. The apparatus consists merely of
a box closed at one end by a tightly stretched cloth, and having
a circular hole of 6 or 8 inches diameter at the other.     Clouds
of sal-ammoniac     vapour  are  generated  inside the  box;   and
                     Wi.
rings are expelled by striking the stretched cloth with the
hand.     Sir           Thomson suggests that two such boxes,
placed so that the rings might impinge on each other at any
 angle, would form a useful apparatus in studying the behaviour
of such rings towards each other. At the conclusion of this
paper several methods of studying liquid rings will be described.

liquid of less density, in which it cannot diffuse, the conditions
of     its
       motion the instant after        strikes the surface

and nearer to this conclusion                 when     the variations      of h are
smaller and smaller.       Obviously we should therefore obtain
the most   perfect  liquid  rings when the drop and the liquid in
which the motion takes place are composed of the same liquid.
A drop of water falling into water must form a more perfect
ring than that formed by a drop of

  reater density than water; and every drop of water falling
into water from a height not too great must necessarily form
a vortex-ring.
   The formation of liquid rings is as fascinating and as simple
an occupation as blowing soap-bubbles.       All liquid drops fall
ing from such a height fini the surface of the liquid in which
they are about to diffuse is not too much disturbed to enable
the drop to be acted upon symmetrically by the forces at the
free surface, will form rings if too great differences of density
do not exist.    That a drop of pure water will descend through

surface.    This fact can be shown also by the employment of
any of the aniline colours which are solvent in water, the drop
consisting of a coloured solution whose density does not differ
sensibly from that of water.      The method which       have em      I
ployed to produce the rings consists merely of a small glass
tube, slightly smaller at one end than the other.       A piece of
cotton is wedged in the tube; and flexible rubber tubing is
attached to the larger end.      With the aid of the mouth one
can fill this tube with liquid and eject it in drops at pleasure.
A   modification         of the same apparatus enables one to form the
rings beneath the surface of the liquid. With a bent tube one
can send the rings through a liquid in any desired direction.
By means of a three-way glass joint and a small india-rubber
       one can send by the same impulse two rings whose paths

by this simple means that a half vortex-ring moving near
another in a parallel path with a less velocity tends to follow
in the path of the first ; and that two equal half vortex-rings
moving in opposite directions along the same path separate
into two vortices which move at right angles to the path of
the original vortices.
   Whenever a stratum of dense vapour is formed in the higher
regions of the atmosphere, it is evident from the preceding
discussion that it will tend to descend in the form of a vortex
ring if disturbing forces are not present.    The results of this
paper are as follows:—
    1. An analogy between the strain-potential and the velocity
potential is indicated.
    2. It is shown that the formation of liquid rings is a neces
sary consequence of the fundamental equations of strain and
of hydrodynamics, and that a difference of density is not ne
 cessary to produce them.
    3. Vortices can and do arise in certain processes of diffusion.

THE“The       Action of Light on Selenium.” By Prof. W. G. Adams,
F.R.S., and Mr. R. E. Day.
   The paper contains an account of a series of experiments which
have been carried on during the past year, and which have had for
their object the investigation of the electrical behaviour of selenium,
especially as regards      its
                            sensitiveness     light.

was increased.   Also it was found that the electrical resistance of
the rod of selenium was different for currents going through it in
opposite directions.  Thus if two platinum wires be melted into
the selenium at two points, A and B, and the resistance of the
selenium be balanced by the Wheatstone's-bridge arrangement, the
positive pole of the battery being connected to the electrode A,
then, on reversing the current so that the negative pole of the
battery was now connected to the electrode A, the numerical value
of the balancing resistance was always found to be different from
that previously obtained.
   If   the electrical conductivity of selenium followed the ordinary
law of metallic conduction, this would not be the case ; and hence
it seemed probable that a careful investigation of these points
would lead to some important results.
    In the experiments recorded in this paper, the objects we have
had especially in view have been —
    (i)  To examine the character          the electrical conductivity
                                                         of                                                   of
 selenium when kept                  in
                             the dark.

    Several pieces       selenium were prepared

 this ring. The rings                     of
                                two such wires were then heated           the                            in

  cylinder of a  selenium, thus forming platinum electrodes. The
 whole was then annealed. After annealing, copper wires were
                    the platinum electrodes, and the selenium was then
              in on

ends of the wire electrodes of the selenium were made to dip into
two little mercury-cups fixed on a plate of ebonite, and then were
connected to the binding-screws of the Wheatstone-bridge arrange
ment. Thus by reversing the position of the electrodes the                                         di
rection of the current through the selenium was reversed. The
positive direction of the current was always determined at the
commencement of each series of experiments by means of a
delicately suspended magnetic needle.
   A few preliminary experiments were made to determine whether
the change of resistance with change of direction of the current
had any connexion with the position of the selenium or the di
rection of the current with respect to the magnetic meridian.
No such connexion was found to exist.
   From the results obtained from a great many experiments
made to determine the diminution of resistance with increased
battery-power, and the change of resistance with a change of the
direction of the current, the following conclusions were drawn:—
   (1) That on the whole there is a general diminution of resist
ance in the selenium as the battery-power is increased.
   (2) The first current through the selenium, if a strong one,
causes a permanent                     set

                                                                          which               of

   (3) The passage           the current         any direction produces

of   the molecules which facilitates the subsequent passage                                        of   a

one case we found that the effect of light was not only to bring the
deflection of the galvanometer-needle down to zero, but also to send
it up considerably on the other side.
    Here there seemed to be a case of light actually producing an
electromotive force within the selenium, which in this case was op
posed to and could overbalance the electromotive force due to
polarization.
    The question at once presented itself as to whether it would
be possible to start a current in the selenium merely by the action
of light. Accordingly the same piece of selenium was connected
directly with the galvanometer.      While unexposed there was no
action whatever. On exposing the tube to the light of a candle,
there was at once a strong deflection of the galvanometer-needle.
On screening off the light the deflection came back at once to
Zero.
    This experiment was repeated in various ways and with light
from different sources, the results clearly proving that by the
action of light alone we could start and maintain an electrical cur
rent in the selenium.
    All the pieces of selenium hitherto used had repeatedly had elec
trical currents passing through them; and it therefore seemed
desirable to examine the effect of exposure to light on pieces of
selenium which had never before had an electrical current sent
through them.
    Accordingly three pieces were prepared, as nearly alike as
possible, and were annealed.      Two of them were found on trial
to be sensitive to light; that is to say, light impinging on them
produced an electrical current; the third piece, however, showed
no signs of sensitiveness.       Hence it appears that three pieces
which were made up from the same stick, which are of the same
length, and were annealed at the same time, may, owing to some
slight difference in their molecular condition, be very different as to
their relative sensitiveness to the action of light.
    In the experiments by which the above results were obtained,
the piece of selenium under examination had always been exposed
as a whole to the influence of the light; so that it was not possible
to tell whether any one part of a piece was more sensitive than
any other.
    In order to examine into this point more fully, we used the lime
light, and then by means of a lens the light was brought to a
focus on the particular portion of the selenium plate which
was to be tested.        A glass cell containing water, and having
parallel sides, was interposed in the path of the beam, so as to
assist in absorbing any obscure heat-rays.
    The results of these experiments proved conclusively the
following points:—
    (1) That pieces of annealed selenium are in general sensitive to
 light, i.e. that under the action of light a difference of potential
is developed between the molecules, which under certain conditions
can produce an electric current through the substance.

     (2) That the sensitiveness is different at different parts of the
same piece.
     (3) That in general the direction of the current is from the
 less towards the more illuminated portion of the selenium, but that,
 owing to accidental differences in molecular arrangement, this di
rection is sometimes reversed.
    The currents produced in the selenium by the action of light
 do not resemble the thermoelectric currents due to heating of
the junctions between the platinum electrode and the selenium;
for in many cases the current produced was most intense when
 the light was focused on points of the selenium not coinciding
with the junctions; also the current was produced suddenly on
exposure, and on shutting off the light the needle at once fell to
zero ; the gradual action due to gradual cooling was entirely
wanting.
    When the light fell upon a junction, the current passed from
the selenium to the platinum through the junction, which is not
in accordance with the place assigned to selenium in the thermo
 electric series of metals.
    Experiments were next undertaken in order to examine what
effect would be produced on the strength of a current which
was passing through a piece of selenium in the dark when a beam
of light was allowed to fall upon                          it.
    The results obtained from these experiments were                     follows:—            as

 cool the most rapidly, and we shall have, in passing from the out
 side to the centre, a series of strata in a more and more perfect
 crystalline condition.
    Light, as we know in the case of some bodies, tends to promote
 crystallization, and, when it falls on the surface of such a stick of
 selenium, probably tends to promote crystallization in the exterior
 layers, and therefore to produce a flow of energy from within out
 wards, which under certain circumstances appears, in the case of
 selenium, to produce an electric current.
    The crystallization produced in selenium by light may also ac
 count for the diminution in the resistance of the selenium when a
 current from a battery is passing through it; for in changing to
 the crystalline state selenium becomes a better conductor of elec
 tricity.

    “On the Application of the Principle of Reciprocity to Accous
 tics.”
    In
          By        Rayleigh, F.R.S.
        a memoir published some years ago by Helmholtz (Crelle,
 Bd. lvii.) it was proved that if a uniform frictionless gaseous
 medium be thrown into vibration by a simple source of sound of
 given period and intensity, the variation of pressure is the same
 at any point B when the source of sound is at A as it would have
 been at A had the source of sound been situated at B, and that
this law is not interfered with by the presence of any number of
fixed solid obstacles on which the sound may impinge.
    A simple source of sound is a point at which the condition of
continuity of the fluid is broken by an alternate introduction and
abstraction of fluid, given in amount, and periodic according to
the harmonic law.
    The reciprocal property is capable of generalization so as to
apply to all acoustical systems whatever capable of vibrating about
a configuration of equilibrium, as       I  proved in the Proceedings
of the Mathematical       Society  for June 1873, and is not lost even
when the     systems  are subject  to damping, provided that the fric
tional forces   vary as the first power  of the velocity, as must always
be the case when the motion is small enough.           Thus Helmholtz's
theorem may be extended to the case when the medium is not
uniform, and when the obstacles are of such a character that they
share the vibration.
    But although the principle of reciprocity appears to be firmly
grounded on the theoretical side, instances are not uncommon in
which a sound generated in the open air at a point A is heard
at a distant point B, when an equal or even more powerful sound
at B fails to make itself heard at A ; and some phenomena of
this kind are strongly insisted upon by Prof. Henry in opposition
to Prof. Tyndall's views as to the importance of “acoustic clouds.”
in relation to the audibility of fog-signals. These observations
were not, indeed, made with the simple sonorous sources of theory;
but there is no reason to suppose that the result would have been
different if simple sources could have been used.

        In experiments having for their object the comparison of sounds
    heard under different circumstances there is one necessary pre
    caution to which it may not be superfluous to allude, depending on
    the fact that the audibility of a particular sound depends not only
    upon the strength of that sound, but also upon the strength of
    other sounds which may be heard along with                         For example,       it.                          a

been    drawn by Prof. Reynolds, does not interfere with the ap
plication of the law.
    An experiment has, however, been brought forward by Prof.
Tyndall, in which there is an apparent failure of reciprocity not
referable to any motion of the medium *. The source of sound
is a very high-pitched reed mounted in a short tube and blown
from a small bellows with which it is connected by rubber tubing.
The variation of pressure at the second point is made apparent
by means of the sensitive flame, which has been used by Prof.
Tyndall with so much success on other occasions.                    Although the
flame    itself, when  unexcited,   is 18 to 24 inches      high,  it was proved
by a subsidiary experiment that the root of the flame, where it
issues from the burner, is the seat of sensitiveness. With this ar
rangement the effect of a cardboard or glass screen interposed
between the reed and the flame was found to be different, ac
cording as the screen was close to the flame or close to the reed.
In the former case the flame indicated the action of sound, but in
the latter remained uninfluenced. Since the motion of the screen is
plainly equivalent to an interchange of the reed and flame, there is
to   all appearance      failure
                            a         the law   in  reciprocity.    of
    At first sight this experiment            difficult   isreconcile with the to
oretical conclusions.       It true that the conditions under which
                                           is
reciprocity       is

reflect the vibrations in the direction of the flame, the effect is
again produced with the same apparent force as at first.
    These results prove conclusively that the reed does not behave
as the simple source of theory, even approximately.            When the
screen is close (about 2 inches distant) the more powerful vibrations
issuing along the axis of the instrument impinge directly upon
the screen, are reflected back, and take no further part in the ex-.
periment. The only vibrations which have a chance of reaching
the flame, after diffraction round the screen, are the compara
 tively feeble ones which issue nearly at right angles with the
 axis. On the other hand, when the screen is close to the flame,
 the efficient vibrations are those which issue at a small angle with
the axis, and are therefore much more powerful.              Under these
 circumstances it is not surprising that the flame is affected in the
 latter case and not in the former.
    The concentration of sound in the direction of the axis isgreater
 than would have been anticipated, and is to be explained by the
 very short wave-length corresponding to the pitch of the                If,                    ...
 as is not     improbable,  the overtones of the note       given   by  the
 reed are the most efficient part of the sound, the wave-length
 will be still shorter and the concentration more easy to under
  stand *.
     The reciprocal theorem in its generalized form is not restricted
  to simple sources, from which (in the absence of obstacles) sound
  would issue alike in all directions; and the statement for double
  sources will throw light on the subject of this note.          A double
  source may be thus defined:—Conceive           two equal and opposite
  simple sources, situated a short distance apart, to be acting
  simultaneously.     By calling the two sources opposite, it is meant
  that they are to be at any moment in opposite phases.               At a
  moderate distance the effects of the two sources are antagonistic
  and may be made to neutralize one another to any extent by
  diminishing the distance between the sources.               however,                If,                  at
  the same time that we diminish the          interval, we   augment     the
  intensity      the single sources, the effect may

velocity of the medium at B resolved in the direction B Q due to
the source at A is the same as the velocity at A resolved in the
direction  AP  due to the source at B.              If
                                           the waves observed at
A and B are sensibly plane, and if the axes AP, B Q are equally
inclined to the waves received, we may, in the above statement,
replace “velocities” by “pressures,” but not otherwise.
   Suppose, now, that equal double sources face each other, so
that the common axis is A B, and let us examine the effect of                      in
terposing a screen near to A. By the reciprocal theorem, whether
there be a screen or not, the velocity at A in direction A B due to
B is equal to the velocity at B in direction A B due to A. The
waves received at B are approximately plane and perpendicular to
A B, so that the relation between the velocity and pressure at B is
that proper to a plane wave; but it is otherwise in the case of the
sound received at A. Accordingly the reciprocal theorem does not
lead us to expect an equality between the pressures at A and B, on
which quantities the behaviour of the sensitive flames depends.
On the contrary, it would appear that the pressure at A corre
sponding to the given velocity along A B should be much greater
than in the case of a plane wave, and then the relative advantage
of the position A would be explained.
   It will be seen that, if the preceding arguments are correct,
Prof. Tyndall's experiment does not bear out the conclusions that
he has based upon it with respect to the observations of the French
Commission at Villejuif and Montlhéry.      No acoustic clouds could
explain the failure of reciprocity then observed; and the more
probable hypothesis that the effect was due to wind is not incon
sistent with the observation that the air (at the surface) was
moving in the direction against which the sound was best heard.
   Further experiments on this subject are very desirable.
    “On   Supersaturated    Saline Solutions.”           By   J.   G.- Grenfell, B.A.,
F.G.S.
    In making experiments on the sensitiveness of supersaturated
solutions to air and greasy surfaces,           I
                                             was much annoyed by the
solutions so frequently crystallizing on the removal of the cotton
wool, as this necessitated boiling the flask again and waiting till
it was cool.       I
                   noticed that frequently part of the cotton-wool
adhered to the mouth of the flask; and it struck me that, in
removing this, some fibres must get detached and fall             carrying   in,
with them    in   all
                   probability  crystals    of
                                             the salt.    soon convinced
                                                               I

touched, and are apparently the 7-atom salt; the octahedra
not change, and are evidently the anhydrous salt. This fact

     Sodium sulphate crystallizes generally on a clean plate exposed
in my laboratory as 10-atom salt, whilst if protected by an inverted
beaker it dries up by evaporation, forming the modified salt.     So,

   The mere fact, however, that the salts are, as a rule, perfectly                                                    in
sensible to every kind of surface, wood, paint, paper, glass, and
dust of all kinds, seems to me fatal to this theory.
   A solution of one part of normal sodium sulphate in about six of
sulphuric acid possesses some curious properties.      This solution,
which sets quite firm, can be kept for a week in an open beaker,
so that the air apparently has no crystals to introduce ; and yet
when dropped on to a dirty surface in my laboratory it more often
crystallizes than not. It is thus much more sensitive than an
aqueous solution of sodium carbonate or acetate.     The crystals are
apparently a hydrate of the hyperacid salt NaH, (SO.), ; and it is
almost inconceivable that the dust should contain crystals of this
salt. It is extremely deliquescent, and the excess of acid should
certainly be taken up by the dust, and very often by the surface
itself.
   The solution sometimes crystallizes suddenly in the test-tube as
though something had fallen in. The crystallized drops will not
stand exposure to air for more than 30 minutes or so.                         Hence,
although there is plenty of sulphuric acid in my laboratory, where
I  have often heated this solution,                                  I
                                                   find it very hard to believe
that the salt exists in this form in any part of the room. The
normal salt and the anhydrous salt are without action on the solu

 same time. The clear crystals are inactive in the 6 to 1 solution,
  while the opaque is active: and this is a clear proof of their identity.
 Solutions of intermediate strength between 2 to 1 and 6 to 1 often
 deposit in flasks the whole excess in clear crystals, which are
 sometimes inactive in the 6 to 1 in a test-tube. It is almost im–
  possible to obtain these solutions supersaturated in flasks, though
  it may be done with the utmost facility in test-tubes. Out of
 many trials with one flask         I
                                 only succeeded once by leaving it to
 cool on the sand-bath.      In a test-tube they give the same forms
 as the 6 to 1. The variety of the forms in which these solutions
 crystallize is truly astonishing, according to the proportion of
 acid and salt, amount of water, and the temperature. A flask once
 gave the most exquisite little, flat, open flakes closely resembling
 snow-flakes ; but I have not been able to reproduce them. In
 short the relations of these two substances to each other want
 working out thoroughly.       A certain amount of acid added to the
 salt which is in excess gives a thin liquid, which will not crystal
 lize, and a little fine white powder, the anhydrous salt. Two
 drops of acid in a test-tube half-full of solution cause drops to eva
 porate on a plate in octahedra; and when the anhydrous is thrown
 down on heating the test-tube locally after crystallizing, it is redis
 solved, leaving, however, well-marked octahedra just before    -   it all
 disappears.
    The most curious property, however, of the 6 to 1 solution is
 this —On a clean glass plate it can be spread out into a thin
 covering of the plate with the handle of a tooth-brush; then with
 the end of a glass rod scratch a letter hard on the plate, and the
 letter will come out at once in slowly growing crystals. The effect
 is certain with the right proportions, and is most striking, as
 a plate of any size can be used. Scratching has the same effect
when the solution is placed on gold or copper, but not on plati
 num foil, lead foil, bone, gutta percha, or any soft substance. The
effect is of course analogous to that of scratching on the ammonio
magnesic phosphate and on soda water in a clean tumbler.             Mr.
Tomlinson explains these by supposing that a partial vacuum is
formed into which the salt and gas separate.           I
                                                       confess it seems
to me more probable that the result is due to vibration. With
the same solution of sodium sulphate in acid, but of different
strength, scratching is inactive, and         I
                                             have tried it in vain on
many aqueous solutions.
     Icannot see why the vacuum should not act equally on all; but
it is easy to understand how the molecular vibrations of one un
stable system should be affected by a particular set of vibrations,
whilst those of another system should not. The results obtained
thus far, then, are:—
    1. Exposure to air and dust has no effect on some supersa
turated solutions.
                                                    º
    2. The sulphates are the most sensitive.       Exposure of a clean
glass plate for half an hour to the air of my laboratory caused
nearly   all the drops   ofsodium sulphate put              itcrystallize

at   once, whilst the same plate recently cleaned       quite inactive.

   3. Even the sulphates are unaffected by the dust of the open
air and generally of ordinary rooms.
   4. Anhydrous salts or modified salts, sometimes new, are pro
duced by the spontaneous evaporation of the solutions in drops.
   5. Drops can be rapidly touched on their surface with crystals
of the same salt without crystallizing.
   6. Greasy surfaces, whether films or lenses, have no effect.
   7. The shape of the vessel has sometimes a material influence
on the possibility of obtaining a supersaturated solution.
   8. Air and dirty surfaces are active on salts which apparently
cannot exist in air.
   9. Scratching a hard surface will cause a particular solution to
crystallize.
   The crystal theory, modified as it now must be, seems on the
whole the best explanation of the phenomena. The case of the
hyperacid sodium sulphate, however, remains to be explained.                 If
the crystal theory is true, the order of sensitiveness of the solu
tions should be the order of comparative rarity of the salts; and
this remains to be proved.
   As to the cause of supersaturation, a good many facts seem to
show that it is the anhydrous salt which enters into solution.
The lower hydrates seem to be first formed, as in the case of
sodium sulphate and the alums.                 In the case of the hyperacid
sodium     sulphate     with two     parts   acid to one of salt, repeatedly
boiled, it seems to be the anhydrous salt which is first deposited.
When the aqueous solutions of sodium sulphate and the alums
are made to crystallize, the modified salts become opaque white,
while the hyperacid salt remains unchanged, and can be obtained
unchanged by heating the opaque variety from the top so as to
dissolve this, but not the anhydrous.
   Against the theory that it is the anhydrous sodium sulphate in
solution at low temperatures must be set the following fact.
   Löwel, in his Tables of the solubility of the three forms of
sodium sulphate, which are found in                           all

taking place at that temperature; and that would involve the
supposition that it was the 10-atom salt in solution before. The
difference in our results springs from the different modes of
working.    Löwel always maintained a large excess of anhydrous
present, whilst I  added the salt in small portions, carefully avoid
ing throwing down any anhydrous. This is pretty easily done by
keeping up a very rapid motion so as to prevent the liquid from
getting heated too much at any point.        It seems to me that in
any case, as the six ounces fairly dissolved, the solubility of the
10-atom    salt should be given in those proportions.          Further
experiments would,      I
                        have no doubt, give still higher figures.
   In conclusion,   I would remark that if the crystal theory of
these solutions be accepted we have a test of great delicacy in
these drops for the presence of the salts.    Interesting experiments
might be made as to the power of air to disseminate crystals of
a salt thrown into it in fine powder.
   De Coppet has already remarked that the mass of a solution
exerts some influence on its crystallization, and      I
                                                      have shown that
the form of the vessel also has a decided effect. The effect again
of different vibrations on different solutions is worth trying, as
there seems to be no reason why the hyperacid sodium salt
 should be an exceptional case.
   A good deal of work has yet to be done before we arrive at a
satisfactory explanation of these obscure phenomena.

ditions indicated in a question (suggesting the possibility of a dis
placement of the axis of figure from the axis of rotation amounting
to 15° or 20°) put to mathematicians in a passage of the Anniversary

question is kinematical; the forces by which the elevations and de
pressions might be effected do not come under discussion.      In de
termining numerically the amount of the deviation from the formulas
investigated, approximate numbers seem to be sufficiently exact for
every useful purpose.   The conclusions arrived at are as follows:—
   (1) The displacement of the earth's axis of figure from the axis of
rotation that would be effected by the elevations and depressions

by a transfer of matter of less amount than about a sixth part of the
whole equatorial bulge.

place, it need not produce any effect, or only a small effect, on the
position of the axis of figure; e. g. if it took place in a way resem

   Another similar tube, with carbonate

amounted on the first day                      to    21

34 atmospheres, and after seventeen years              44, showed likewise     to
always the same weight (14.6361 grams).
   Thus, according        these experiments,
                                  to               pressure         from 40a                      of                    to
100 atmospheres cannot, during           space       seventeen years, force   of

has become obtuse, and the acid flows in the tube with condensed
carbonic acid like quicksilver in a glass tube filled with air.
   In the atmosphere of hydrogen the angle at the margin of the
dilute sulphuric acid, which at first likewise wetted the sides, has
also increased to about 60°.
   The glass thus appears to have gradually in the course of years,
under the influence of the great pressure, become coated with a
thin layer of carbonic acid or hydrogen respectively, which exerts
a different attraction from that which glass exerts upon the liquid
particles at the margin of the surface. A similar film of gas
must have been deposited on the surface of the zinc and obstructed
the further chemical action of the acid *.
    In spite of the negative result of these experiments,
                                              hydrogen

not conclude that the molecules of                        and carbonic acid
have greater dimensions than the molecules or the pores of glass.
The distance within which the molecular forces of glass act upon
the gas particles is at                       all
                                 events greater than the dimensions

                 ON THE POLARIZED                         LIGHT OF THE RAINBOW.
                                       BY PROF.            J. DECHANT.
   In vol. clix. of Poggendorff's Annalen, M. Schiel communicates
the observation that the light of the rainbow is completely polarized.
This fact had also previously been observed by Tyndall, in 1870, on
the occasion of his journey to Algeria"; and he also states the
direction of the polarization, saying, “The light of the bow could in
                                                by

of the coils weighs 14 pounds; and the wire makes about 400
turns.    The particular coil employed in any case is put into
circuit (generally as a double wire of 200 turns) with a small
Grove's battery of only six cells; and this is the highest power
applied in my experiments. In the circuit is placed also a
commutator, which is at my hand, so that, while                watch the                       I
                   I

control.
   4. Polar surfaces.—These were originally well planed, and
perpendicular to the axes of the cores. For the present pur
pose they had to be smoothed and brightened by polishing, a
process which           I
                      found troublesome and excessively tedious,
from the     refractory    nature of the material.        The polishing
was done with fine dry emery powder, applied by chamois
leather to one of the surfaces, and by a rubber of fine silk stuff
                                                                                                   ..
to the other. Each rubber was backed by a flat and smooth
block of iron, which was worked carefully by hand over the
end of the core.       The last stage of the polishing was similar
to the earlier stages, but without new additions of emery.
When the process was finished, each polar surface (though
not such a speculum as would satisfy an optician) acted as a
pretty good plane metallic mirror,              plane perpendicular     its                                    to
the axis      of
              the core.     Placed         room       ordinary daylight,
                                                      in      a                in
each mirror      gave   good    regular    images           surroundin              of   all
objects that were        any degree illuminated; and
                            of in
                                                                                           in  a
room, the image           neighbouring candle-flame was generally
                               a
very good, brilliant, distinct, and sharply and truly
except towards the rim           the mirror, parts not used
                                           of                     the ob                           in
servations. The surface that had been finished by chamois
leather was rather more brilliant than the other, but not                                                          so
perfectly well planed.
I    should say here that, from              that have seen       allthese                          in

good conditions, at the instant when the circuit is closed, the
light shows itself faintly in proper form, size, and position
across the formerly uniform         , and so continues without
sensible change as  long as the current passes.  Break, and the

appears and continues till the instant of break, when it disap
pears at once.
   The beam reflected by the mirror of magnetized iron is cer
tainly not plane-polarized, as is the incident beam (and the
reflected beam also before magnetization); for when the light
is restored by magnetic force from pure extinction as above,
it cannot be extinguished by any rotation of the second Nicol
in either direction; nor (as far as I can judge of these faint
effects and with the present means) is the light sensibly weak
ened by any such rotation.             The analyzer's position of extinc
tion before       magnetization     is also (exactly or nearly) the posi
tion of minimum           intensity  after magnetization.

    When the mirror becomes a north pole, the light flashes up
at once to a sensibly higher intensity, which is sustained with
out change as long as             current passes. When the circuit is
broken and the mirror          demagnetized,       the light falls at once
from the     higher   intensity   to  the  primitive faint intensity, and
so continues as long as the circuit is open. When the mirror
becomes a south pole, the light falls from the primitive faint
intensity, down either to perfect extinction or extremely near

that was what I may truly call the exquisite                 of the
magnetic mirror as a test for fixing the position of the plane
of polarization of the incident light. One or two simple notes
of actual observations will illustrate this point more distinctly
than any general statement could do.
   Things often happened thus. Working as in the first expe

almost every case.     Say that the north pole restores distinctly,
and the south   pole weakly  or not at all.   Leaving the circuit
open, I turn the first Nicol to the left as little as possible, and
then bring the second Nicol into the position of extinction,
and test by working the commutator and watching the light
in the polariscope.    Several careful operations of this kind are
 sometimes  requisite.
            Summary and Interpretation of the facts.
   12. In these experiments light is reflected from an iron
mirror at an incidence of 60° to 80°, passing through a first
Nicol before reflection and through a second Nicol after.
   Initial conditions.—The iron mirror unmagnetized, the prin
cipal sections of the two Nicols perpendicular and parallel
respectively to the plane of incidence.
   Essential operations.—Starting thus from pure extinction in
the polariscope, we apply any one or two of four operations.
Two of these are merely mechanical, extremely small rotations
of the first Nicol from             its
                            initial position, right-handed rota  a

330     Dr.  J.  Kerr on Rotation of the Plane of Polarization
only to assume that the immediate optical effects of the four
operations (R, N), (L, S) are similar in kind for all, and
similarly directed for those of either pair, but oppositely           di
rected for different pairs.      R and L turn the plane of polari
zation; so therefore, according to this view, do N and S. R
and N turn the plane of polarization in one direction; L and S
turn it in the contrary direction. But even from an optical
point of view there is still an important difference between the
mechanical operations and the physical; for in the one case
(R or L) the full effect of the operation is impressed upon the
light before incidence, while in the other case (N or S) the
effect is impressed somewhere and somehow in the very pro
cess of reflection.
   To get a more definite statement of this interpretation, con
sider the pair of conspiring operations (R, N). In the case
of operation N, and to an eye which looks into the polar mir
ror, the nominal direction of the magnetizing current round
the core is right-handed (9).        In the case of operation R and
to the same eye, the direction of rotation of the plane of po
larization, or the direction of rotation of the trace of that plane
          .
upon the reflecting surface, is evidently left-handed (9). We
infer that a right-handed current gives a left-handed rotation
of the plane of polarization. And this completes the first ex
 perimental proof of the general statement made in art. 2.
    14. To test the truth of this view of the facts,       I thought of
three methods which         appeared      accessible:—first,   to apply
 each of the four operations     (R,  N),   (L,  S), and to characterize
 them separately by definite compensating actions in the polari
 scope;             , to apply the operations N and S in com
bination with small permanent rotations of the second Nicol;
 thirdly, to return to the case of perpendicular incidence,
 which I had already tried roughly without success.               I  shall
 prepare the way for an account of the first of these methods
 by a short mathematical discussion.
               Compensation    of effects  of operation R.
    15. Let the angle of incidence be about 75°; and suppose
 that the initial conditions are as in the first and second expe
 riments (12), and particularly that the direction OX of the
 vibration is perpendicular to the plane of incidence.          The ope
 ration R   being  now   applied,  .."the     incident  vibration   bein

pression are reversed, and therefore interchanged. It is now
compression that extinguishes the light; tension strengthens
it from first to last.
    When the angle of rotation of the first Nicol is too large,
which it may be while still very small, the neutralization by
 tension or compression is incomplete, the light fading to a
very sensible minimum and then increasing; but the extinc
 tion is still perfect when the initial intensities have reached
much greater values than those obtained by magnetization in
the first experiment.

  The four operations (R, N), (L, S) were found in the second                                            i
experiment to be related to one another, two and two, as con
spiring or contrary; they are now seen to be related to one
another more generally, and in the same combinations, as like
or unlike. With reference to effects in the polariscope, the
operations R and S are as clearly unlike as are the operations
R and L, or the operations N and S; and, on the other hand,
and with reference always to effects in the polariscope, R and
N are as clearly like as are any two operations R, or any two
operations        N.     It      was assumed,             in explanation        of the facts
brought out in the second experiment, that the optical effects
of the four operations (R, N), (L, S) are the same in kind
for all, and similarly directed for those of either pair, but op
positely directed for those of different pairs.            All the new
facts agree with this hypothesis and confirm                             it.

experiment. The strengthening actions of N in (1) and of S
in (2) are evidently what was to be expected; for in (1) the
second Nicol leaves the plane of polarization a little to the left,
and N turns that plane a little more to the left. But the whole
subject deserves a more particular discussion.

 338     Dr.  J.  Kerr    on Rotation   of the  Plane of Polarization
     To apply this result to the first half of the second experi

 and then apply successively the three sets of operations
                         (R, N),     (R),    (R, S).
 The corresponding intensities in the polariscope are
                (–2'-2)”,          (–a')”,    (–2/+2')”,
 which are as the numbers 4, 1, 0.                The actual results, as
 already specified, were bright, faint, black (10). "
     24. Returning to the sixth experiment.             In discussing the
 expression
                            e” +p°–2ep' cos p,
 found in art. 22,       I shall suppose the rotation of the second
 Nicol    always    righthanded,      or the angle e always positive.
 The   amplitude    p'  is positive  for S, negative for N.       e angle
 q, varies continuously with the angle of incidence, from zero
 at normal incidence, through          | at principal incidence   (75° or
 76°), up to    ºr at  grazing incidence.       It will be observed that
the          principal incidence      in the present case is the      T of
      3. at                                                         3
equation (2)     of art. 15, diminished by the r of reversal due
to reflection.
    (1) When the value of the angle of incidence is consider
 ably less than 75°, cos (b has some positive value c, and the
 additions made to the primitive intensity e” by the operations
N   and   S are
                      p” +2ep'c and p”–2ép'c.
In   this case, therefore, the effect of N in the polariscope is
always an increase,         and always more pronounced than the
effect of S.
    Let  e  be the value     of  e which is determined by the equation
                                p'—2ec=0.
When e=e', the effect of S in the polariscope is reduced to
zero; when e <e', the effect of S is a small increase; when
exe', the effect of S is a decrease.
       iii.
    (2) When the value of the angle of incidence is consider
ably greater than 75°, cos (b has some negative value —e, and
the              made to the primitive intensity sº by N and S are
                        p”–2ép'e and p” +2ep'e.
Here, therefore, contrary to what holds in the first case, the
effect of S is always an increase, and always more pronounced
than the effect of N. Here also, as e increases from zero, the

           by Reflection   from the Pole of   a Magnet.             339
addition made to e by the weaker magnetic operation passes
from positive, through zero, to negative.
   (3) In the case of principal incidence, cos b-0, and the
additions made by N and S to the primitive intensity e” in the
polariscope are equal and always positive.
   25. Seventh earperiment, a repetition of the sixth, to test
the preceding inferences.
   (1) Angle of incidence about 70°. All the effects recovered
as predicted, and as already obtained roughly in the sixth
experiment.    Recovered also perfectly at various incidences
from 60° to 75°.
   (2) Angle of incidence very large, about 85°. No sensible
                                     |.
effect obtained in any case by application of the operations N
and S, with the arrangements of      sixth experiment, or with
those of the second.   The reason very probably is that, as the
angle of incidence approximates to 90°, the ratio of the ampli
tudes p' and e becomes excessively small, by diminution of
the rotation p towards zero.
   Angle of incidence about 80°. The effects very faint, but
clearly contrary to what was predicted : N strengthens the
light as in the first case; S either weakens it or has no
effect.
   (3) Equal positive effects of N and S in the polariscope
were never observed at 75° or any other incidence. The
hypothesis advanced in 20 is therefore inexact : the rotation
due to magnetic force is not impressed effectively before inci
dence.      either is it impressed effectively after reflection
 (10... 19). The difference of phases of the two reflected
vibrations, p' in OY, and 1 in O X, has therefore some value
Aq intermediate between p and 0; and the intensity in the
sixth experiment is equal to
                     e” + p”    –
                                2ep' cos A$.
   Judging from the earlier experiments, second to fifth,             I
think we are bound to assume that A is very nearly equal to 1:
but certainty upon the subject can be reached only through
exact measurements.        I
                          come now to the third method men
tioned in art. 14.

ments as in the last three experiments, and working under
the most favourable conditions attainable,    have often left                 I
the two Nicols in position at pure extinction, and tried the
effects of the simple operations N and S.       have certainly                    I
got distinct effects many times in such circumstances, and
assured myself that they were due to magnetizations of the
iron mirror by getting them to appear and disappear at the
instants of make and break of the circuit; but the effects
were so excessively faint that                       I
                                  could not once characterize
them as due to rotation of the plane of polarization.    have                                    I
no doubt whatever that, with a stronger magnet and a finer
mirror, and a more intense light, this experiment would be as
satisfactory as any of the preceding.

to the edge, as if to divide the block into two equal wedges.

line drawn across the block C in the diagram of 7. Returning
to the diagram of art. 27, the bored block is removed, and

is turned always in a direction contrary to that of the mag
netizing current.
   The precise character of the mixed optical effect in the
case of oblique incidence can be determined only by exact
measurements.     This much, however, appears to be clearly
proved by the preceding experiments, that the rotation due
to magnetization of the mirror is impressed upon the light
neither effectively before  incidence, nor effectively after re
                     -
flection.
   No effect was obtained in any case without the presence of
a submagnet.          I
                   think it certain that the only use of this
piece is to concentrate or intensify the magnetic force upon
the iron mirror by inductive action.
   The powers applied were barely adequate to produce        the                            all
effects.  Some      the phenomena were quite imperceptible
                      of
when the battery began       work, and afterwards, when
                                        to                  had                             it
worked at intervals for three or four hours. Much better
effects may certainly     expected with higher electromagnetic
                                   be
powers and finer optical appliances.

   The sum of these results = 1, as it should be. In these
calculations it is supposed that the wave is of such length
compared with the thickness of the layer as to prevent inter
ference-effects.

  Calculating the above expressions, we find that, if energy

follows:—

The transmitted and reflected energy are very nearly equal;
and each is very nearly half that of the incident sound.
  We can find the value of v : v<U+017F> for which the division should
be exactly equal between transmission and reflexion.

with a layer of the thickness of a quarter wave-length in the

not the same for high and low sounds is probably to be ac
counted for by the fact that the relations which produce inter
ference are not, the same in the two cases. A. a matter of
fact, high sounds are most affected in general by transmission
through obstacles or layers of any kind. The reason                                             is,   no
doubt, that under ordinary circumstances         the dimensions

observes,   of the very same form as the one subsequently given
by Professor Tait (1870–71) to express the value of this elec
tromotive force. A few words of explanation are therefore
necessary from me.
   The work of Professor Avenarius in 1863, as detailed in his
memoir”, “Die Thermoelektricität, ihrem Ursprunge nach, als
identisch mit der Contactelektricität betrachtet,” consisted,
first of all, in arriving at this expression by means of two hy
potheses, very reasonable and probable at first sight, but really
inconsistent with each other, and one of them false; and
secondly, in bringing the expression so obtained to the test of
experiment, and verifying it in a complete and satisfactory
manner between certain limits of temperature. This second
part of his work is unassailable; and as it was performed several
years before the similar more extensive experiments of Pro
fessor Tait, it constitutes, so far as              I
                                             know, the original dis
covery of the actual numerical laws of the electromotive force
of a thermo-electric pair.
    Regarded, then, as an empirical formula expressing with
experimental accuracy the electromotive force of a thermo
electric circuit, it is correct; but considered as a formula de
duced from and embodying a certain theory in contact-elec
tricity (which theory one would naturally have supposed to
be verified by the verification of the formula), it is erroneous,
and has led Professor Avenarius himself to erroneoust results.
In a subsequent communication to Poggendorff’s Annalent
in 1873, to which he now refers me, he admits this to some
extent; and in this paper he makes full use of the laws dis
covered thermodynamically by Sir William Thomson in 1851,
and shows that his own expression is in agreement with them
if the “specific heat of electricity in a metal” is assumed to be
 proportional to          its
                       absolute temperature.      Professor Tait had
pointed this out            very similar manner

         Mr. O.   J. Lodge on Thermo-electric      Phenomena.      351
     The errors in the original theory are rather subtle, and are
 worth pointing out, not for the purpose of casting any slur on
 the valuable work of Professor Avenarius, but as illustrating
the slight though important difference between the present
 theory which includes Thomson's effects, and the two hypo
theses which ignored them and which were also independent
 of the laws of thermodynamics.
     First hypothesis.     That the electromotive force of a thermal
joint is expansible in terms of the (Centigrade) temperature,
thus
                              e=a+bt+ct”. . . . . . . . (1)
     Second hypothesis. That in a complete circuit there is no
electromotive force anywhere except at the junctions of differ
 ent metals, or that the electromotive force of a thermo-electric
pair, with two joints at different temperatures, is obtained
simply by subtracting the electromotive force of the joint at
the temperature      tº from that    of  the joint at the temperature
ti, or
                          E= e1-ez.        •  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  (2)
    Conclusion following from these, the law of Avenarius—
                          E=b(ti-ta)+c(t?–t;).         .  .  .  .  (3)
     Now the first hypothesis taken by itself is a tolerably safe
assumption, and, as it happens, is actually true as it stands.
But when the second hypothesis is also made, the general
theory of heat-engines requires the constant c to be zero,
§:
which would render most of the subsequent investigation
meaningless, and would make (3) entirely discordant with ex
                This, in fact, is the very discrepancy which led
   ir William Thomson about 1851 or 1852 to see the falsehood
of hypothesis No. 2, and hence to the discovery of an electro
motive force between different portions of one and the same
metal at different temperatures, which, under the form of the
“electric convection of heat,” he subsequently caused to be
verified by a most laborious series of experiments".
    The falsehood of the second hypothesis is fully admitted by
Professor Avenarius in 1873f.
    The conclusion when considered alone is correct, as have    I
said above; but the constants b and c have not the same mean
      as they had in (1).      If we consider them to have the same
.#
value in (1) and (3), we shall be led into error as regards mat
ters of fact, just as Professor Avenarius was.

This being the correct expression in terms of the constants of
(1), one is justified in saying that (3) is erroneous—although,
as (5) and (3) happen to be of precisely the same form, one
is just as good as the other if the constants are arbitrary and
have no special meaning assigned to them.

THEcrystals of metallic lustre and dull      tin-white colour,

The planes y are pitted and rough. Figs. 2 and 3 are repre

   The twins about (011) are a fresh illustration of the ten
dency to twin about the face of a prism whose angle is near
60°. Fig. 4 is a representation of this twin, in which both mem
bers are shown approximately in aquilibrio with the twin-axis
vertical. Fig. 5 represents somewhat closely the appearance of
a moderately large twin of this kind. . The principal crystal,
denoted by Roman letters, is projected in the same way as in
fig. 1; and to it are attached two smaller crystals twinned about
(110), the one represented by Greek letters, the other by
barred Greek letters. The intersection of planes which corre
spond is straight and definite, of planes which do not cor
respond (as s and u) is irregular and indefinite. The elements
obtained by measurements on this crystal differ slightly from
those given above, as is shown by the following Table:–

        Fig. 6 a shows the simple crystal in the same projection.
                  the face of the prism {1 1 0} have been already
observed. These twins generally show the tendency to deve
lop but slightly in the direction of the twin axis; and was       I
fortunate enough to get a specimen showing this to a remark
able degree.    It is about the size of a penny-piece, and about
the thickness of the thick penny of George           III.
                                                     One member
is about half the width of the        other, the remainder being

358            M. E. Bertrand on   the   Law of Twinning
Von Lang (Mineral. Mittheil. Tschermak, 1871).             I have       also
published a note on this mineral in the Annales des Mines,
vol. iii. 1873; but up to the present time two interesting
facts concerning it have not been noticed.       It is known that
leucophane has a very good cleavage parallel to the base,
p=0.01, and that the acute bisectrix of the optic axes is per
pendicular to this cleavage.     With a sufficiently large plate it
is easy to obtain with the polarizing microscope two direc
tions apparently at 90° to one another, in which the hyperbolae
and the lemniscates are perceived.
    In certain cases one finds two crystals separated by a single
 plane of junction which have the planes of their optic axes
 orientated at about 90° to one another.       In other cases one
                              j
 observes a series of very narrow bands corresponding to as
 many crystals of which the axes are situated in planes making
angles of nearly 90° with one another.         By an examination
 of a great number of cleavages of leucophane,         I
                                                    have succeeded
in  establishing  that these twins are  very  frequent,   especially
 in plates  of some    magnitude.        I
                                      shall describe a   very good
 twin  crystal of this  kind, which, moreover,    presents  another
 peculiarity.   It consists of two crystals placed at about 90° to
 one another, the two bases lying in one and the same plane.
 Each of these crystals               two well-developed faces,
 b'='1 12, truncating two edges parallel to the base; the two
 other edges are not truncated in the large crystal; but in the
smaller one faces bºa 111 are found truncating these edges.

                   and Hemihedrism    of Leucophane.             359
The fourth edge is not present, owing to the crystal being
broken at this part.
    The British Museum also contains a crystal which          I have
not examined; but the figure of the crystal published in
Tschermak’s Mineral. Mittheil. (1871) shows that the crystal
is modified differently on the four edges of the base. This
crystal therefore seems to present the same hemihedrism as
that noticed above.       Without pronouncing definitely on the
hemihedrism, I think that there is sufficient probability to justify
me in calling attention to the fact, and to encourage an exa
mination as to whether other crystals present the same hemi
hedrism.
     Instead of considering leucophane to be hemihedral, one
 might suppose that it belonged to the oblique system rather
 than to the prismatic. On this supposition the base would
 become the plane of symmetry g’=010, the bisectrix of the
 optic axis would be the horizontal diagonal of the base, the
 faces bla 1 12 and b4-11 1 would become m-110 and
 e'= 104 respectively.         But this supposition would only be
 admissible if the hemihedrism to which         I have called atten
 tion were a hemihedrism with        parallel faces; for in the case
 of a hemihedrism with inclined faces one would not find the
  four vertical faces necessary for forming the prism.       But the
 twinned specimen of which        I have spoken above shows very
 clearly a hemihedrism with inclined faces. Moreover, if leu
 cophane crystallized in the oblique system one would probably
 observe a crossed dispersion in the polarizing microscope,
 whereas the symmetry of the dispersion of the colours is most
 perfect. This does not constitute a proof, but renders it ex
  tremely probable that the system is prismatic.
      I have likewise proved that the trace of the plane of the
  optic axes on the face p-001, parallel to the cleavage, coin
  cides with the diagonal of this face; for if a twinned plate be
 examined with the ordinary microscope between two Nicols,
  the line of separation of the two crystals is observed to be
  situated very approximately at 45° to the trace of the plane
                 l.
  of the optic axes of each of the two crystals, the plane of the
  optic axes of one crystal being at 90° to that of the other.
      This coincidence, which is necessary in the prismatic system,
  but not in the oblique, gives a fresh argument in favour of the
  system being prismatic.
      We ma                  conclude that the greater part of the
  crystals of leucophane are twinned and most probably hemi
  hedral.    It will be interesting to obtain evidence whether
  other   crystals  besides those mentioned above present the same
   hemihedrism.

capable  of producing the former action; and experiment shows
that  they can also produce the latter".
   Coal-gas issuing from a rather narrow horizontal tube was
ignited ; the flame was separated by a space of 1 or 2 centims.
from the orifice of the tube.     A tube from which chlorine
issued was introduced between the burner and the flame: the
luminosity of the latter was at once increased ; and the flame at
the same time extended itself backwards to the point at which
the chlorine entered.    The volume of the flame-mantle was
thus increased at the expense of the blue zone of the flame.
     Ifbromine be employed in place of chlorine, a sooty flame
is  produced   ; this is to be traced to the formation of a gaseous
compound of bromine and carbon, and consequent partial cut
ting off of the supply of oxygen.
    Before deducing a wide generalization, it seemed to me ne
cessary to inquire whether in every case introduction of chlo
rine brought about the result theoretically foretold.
    The flame of a hydrocarbon may become feebly luminous
(1) when the flame-mantle contains a small number of solid
carbon particles. This condition is fulfilled in the flame of                                         all
substances relatively poor            carbon—for instance,

 368            Dr. Karl Heumann's Contributions to
 combine with the hydrogen present, and so produce a hydro
 carbon rich in carbon, or set free pure carbon itself.
     The substitution-products of marsh-gas, CH, Cland CHCls,
 are gases fulfilling these conditions. While marsh-gas burns
 with a feebly luminous flame, the flame of methyl chloride
 (CH3Cl) is smoky and strongly luminous. Chloroform
 (CH Cl3) also burns at the surface of a wick with a luminous
 flame.    Hydrogen containing a little chloroform vapour burns
 with a brilliant although non-smoky flame; if a large quan
 tity of chloroform be present, the flame becomes somewhat
 opaque and deposits much soot.         In each of these cases hy
 drochloric acid is produced.
    The flame of a hydrocarbon may become feebly luminous, or
 even non-luminous when (2) the temperature is not sufficiently
 high to cause separation of solid carbon.      Two cases here pre
 sent themselves.     A low  temperature    may  be occasioned by
 withdrawal of heat    by extraneous   causes, as when a luminous
 flame is brought into contact with cold substances, or by the
 action of admixed gases which absorb heat, and so reduce the
 original temperature of the flame. These flames may be so
 hot as to cause to         a piece of platinum wire held within
                      #.
 them, and yet not hot enough to bring about a deposition of
 carbon from the hydrocarbonaceous material of the gas.          On
 the supposition already put forward, chlorine ought       in either
 case to render the non-luminous flame luminous.
    A small luminous flame was rendered non-luminous by
 causing it to play upon a porcelain basin.        (I have already
 shown that withdrawal of heat is here the cause of non-lumi
nosity.)    So soon as chlorine or bromine vapour was brought
into the blue flame, it became luminous and deposited soot
upon the basin.      This experiment proves that the flame be
 came non-luminous because the temperature was not attained
at which carbon is deposited, and that so soon as carbon was
separated, even by other means than increase of temperature,
luminosity returned.
    The blue flame of mixed coal-gas and carbon dioxide, coal
 gas and air, or coal-gas and     ...i.   monoxide, when mixed
with a little chlorine became      very luminous;    this was espe
cially noticeable with the flame of mixed coal-gas and air,
because this flame is possessed of a higher temperature than
the others; and     I have already shown that the temperature
                                               .
at which deposition of carbon takes place in flames admixed
with indifferent gases is higher than that at which the same
phenomenon occurs in the case of flames not so admixed.
    The luminosity of a hydrocarbon flame           be diminished
(3) by the temperature not being sufficiently high to maintain

                          the Theory       of Luminous Flames.                                                369
the separated     carbon in such a condition as that it shall emit
light.   Such flames (the flame of turpentine for instance)
become luminous when their temperature is increased ; this
may be done by admitting air or oxygen. The admission of
chlorine to such flames may be shown experimentally to have
no effect in increasing luminosity.
   Frankland has put forward the suggestion that the soot de
posited from luminous flames does not consist of carbon, but
of a mixture of heavy hydrocarbons whose vapours have been
condensed upon the cold body introduced within the flame.
Stein * has pointed out that in this case increase of tempera
ture should cause the soot to again assume the gaseous form ;
experiment proves that this is not                                 so.
                                                  The absorptive power
of carbon for      gases   seems      me      explain
                                                to     the fact that the

soot deposited from luminous flames does not consist                  pure                           of
carbon. Stein's analyses show 99.1 per cent.                   carbon and                  of
0.9 per cent.        hydrogen.

Further, the fact experimentally proved, that the surface of a
body heated to redness may become covered with soot, is op
posed to Frankland's hypothesis: if the deposition consisted of
condensed hydrocarbons, it could only take place upon surfaces
relatively colder than the flame itself.        If  the space immedi
ately over the flame of burning turpentine be examined, it is
seen to contain flaky particles of sooty matter.           A hydrogen
flame brought into this layer becomes surrounded by a conti
nuous luminous mantle; the flame of a Bunsen lamp becomes
                                jº,
crowded with glowing particles.             No glowing particles can
be    distinguished    by  the eye  or by means of the microscope in
a luminous       gas-flame,   by  reason of the rapidity with which
the current of     gas   is carried upwards.    These small particles
are    stopped  in their   upward   course  by any  solid body brought
into the flame, or by the                      still layers of air; they
thus become more compact and dense, and so bring about the
deposition upon themselves of further numbers of particles
until there is finally formed a visible cloud of soot or smoke.
A solid body, or even a layer of air, while stopping the rush of
solid particles, simultaneously lowers the temperature of the
flame.
     In order to render visible the production of masses of solid
 matter, two blowpipe-nozzles, through each of which a stream
 of gas issued, were arranged horizontally opposite to one
another.       By regulating the distance between the nozzles a
perfectly circular homogeneous flame was obtained ; by bring
ing the nozzles rather nearer to one another and slightly altering
 their inclination, the flame assumed a half-moon shape. The
 lower part of this flame was but slightly luminous, but was
 filled with little glowing points (fig. 1, Plate II.). The flame
 being in a kind of whirling motion, these little points were
 swept upwards and passed away as sparks from each horn of
 the half-moon.          By bringing a porcelain plate over these
 points, the little particles were obtained in the form of coarse

     Another experiment was arranged in which the little par
 ticles of carbon were caused to form a larger and visible mass
 by projection against a solid body. A                       basin hung
 vertically was heated on the concave side by means of a Bun
 sen's lamp ; a coal-gas flame about 5 centims. in length was
 caused to issue from the narrow circular orifice of a tube which
 was held by a clamp, and directed so that the flame struck the
 basin a little below the centre.         By regulating the distance
 between this tube and the           basin, a halfmoon-shaped       flame

was obtained crowded with little glowing particles which as
cended with a spiral motion, escaping from each horn of the
half-moon (fig. 2).          The separation of solid carbon within a
coal-gas flame is thus rendered visible to the eye. The experi
ment further shows that in an ordinary coal-gas flame the
solid particles are very small but numerous, and that, when a
number of these are gathered together in a special part of the
flame, that part becomes continuously luminous.
    Frankland looks upon the fact of the transparency of lumi
nous flames as militating against the view that they contain
solid particles. We know, however, that many substances
containing solid matter (for instance, paper soaked in oil) are
more or less transparent. Stein has also shown that it is very
difficult to distinguish ordinary letters placed behind a gas
flame consisting of several layers, or behind the flame of a pe
troleum lamp.          My own experiments confirm those of Stein,
and prove that the lower non-luminous portion of a gas-flame
             jº.
is much more transparent than the upper luminous portion,
and that it is almost impossible to distinguish an object when
viewed through several layers of such flame, the same object
being seen when viewed through a single layer. The eye
 becomes dazzled by the light of the flame, and so incapable of
 sharply                        objects which emit lesser degrees of
 light.    Tested in the      sunlight,                 all

    It seemed to me necessary to test this new method of examin
ing flames by the shadows which they cast in sunlight, by
              together as many and as various flames as possible.
      aving proved to myself that the flame of pure hydrogen
casts no shadow upon a white screen, but only the image of a
few more or less dense streaks (fig. 5),
traverse an apparatus in which it         ãº I    caused the gas to
                                                 become laden with
solid material (zinc oxide, magnesia, &c.) before ignition.
The flame now in each case cast a most distinct shadow.

was thrown into the flame of hydrogen, the flame became
strongly luminous, and a shadow at once appeared on the
SCreen.
    As an example of a flame undoubtedly            containing solid
matter,   I employed   hydrogen laden with the vapour     of
dichloride (Cr(), Cl).       During the combustion of this flame
chromic oxide is produced ; this oxide is not converted within
the flame into a non-solid substance or substances, as is partly
the case with the carbon liberated in the flames of hydrocarbo
naceous bodies.      Fig. 6 represents the shadow cast by the

    The observation of the shadow thrown on the screen by a
flame serves as a means for determining the action which is
taking place within that flame. Spontaneously-inflammable
silicon hydride throws a very distinct shadow, resembling that
cast by a turpentine-flame. The gas is evidently decomposed
with the                of solid silicon, which is again oxidized in
the outer portions of the flame to silica, itself also a non-vola
tile solid.

   Kersten states that several metallic chlorides, when brought
in the state of solution into the flame of a Bunsen's lamp,
cause that flame to become luminous.      Those chlorides which
thus produce luminosity are, according to Kersten, ferrous,
cuprous, palladium, and gold chlorides; chlorides of zinc, an
timony, platinum, silver, tin, mercury, as also chlorides of
the alkali-metals and alkaline earths, do not, according to the
same authority, cause the Bunsen flame to become luminous”.
   These chlorides may cause luminosity by deposition of metal,
or by decomposition of hydrocarbons by means of chlorine,
and consequent production of carbon within the flame. .

the introduction of iron, platinum, and copper chlorides caused
these flames to become luminous.     The metallic chlorides were
used in the solid state, as I found that the few drops of solu
tion which could be introduced into the flame on a platinum
wire spirted very much, and contained an extremely small
quantity of solid matter.     The following Table presents the
results of the examination of a series of metallic chlorides and
of other salts.

a continuous     spectrum.    If the metal or oxide which is sepa
rated in the flame be partially volatilized, one part of it may
remain in the solid form and so impart luminosity to the flame,
while another portion may become gaseous and so impart
colour to the flame.       The luminous portions of such flames
show a     continuous,  the coloured portions a line-spectrum.
     Those substances which do not cause a non-luminous flame
to become luminous may also be subdivided into those (salts
of lead, of alkalies, alkaline earths, except magnesia, &c.)
which are easily volatilized and therefore colour the flame
while affording line-spectra, those (arsenic and antimony com
pounds) which afford continuous spectra while also imparting
 a colour to the flame, those (mercuric chloride) which vola
 tilize almost immediately without producing any noticeable
 effect upon the flame, and, lastly, those (magnesium              and
 silver chlorides)     which,  although   undergoing    decomposition
 with the production of solid matter, nevertheless do not cause
 luminosity because the solids produced are not carried into the
 flame.     The metal or oxide which is separated in the various
 experiments may be obtained by bringing a porcelain basin
 into the flame.
     If it be true that the luminosity is due in the foregoing ex
 periments to solid matter separated within the flame while the
 colour is caused by heated vapours, we should expect to find
 the luminous flames casting shadows upon a white background
 when viewed in sunlight, while the coloured flames would cast
 no shqaows.
     Eaperiment     has proved the correctness   of this expectation in
                                           -   -
 every case.
     The flames of burning magnesium and of coal-gas contain
 ing oxygen and metallic zinc both cast very distinct shadows;
  these flames contain magnesium and zinc oxides respectively,
  substances which remain solid at high temperatures.
      From these experiments       I think we may draw the follow
  ing inference:–
      Luminous flames which owe their luminosity to the presence
  offinely divided solid matter produce characteristic shadows when
  viewed in sunlight.
      But is the converse of this true? Do luminous flames
  which produce shadows in sunlight owe their luminosity to
  the presence of solid matter?
      To this question, in the absence of experimental evidence,
   º
  I  should answer no; for it is possible that luminous flames
  consisting only of heated gases may, when viewed in sun
          cause an appearance similar to that of a true shadow.

burning hydrogen which has been coloured yellow by the
presence  of sodium chloride, is partly absorbed thereby,
and that the light which passes on shows a dark absorption
band.   So also sunlight is more or less absorbed when passed
through various glowing gases. As sunlight already shows
dark lines corresponding with light spectral lines of sodium,
barium, calcium, copper, &c., it is not to be expected that
flames coloured by these metals in the gaseous state should
cause absorption of any part of the sun's rays.         But it is
otherwise with colourless luminous flames.       Such flames ab
sorb portions of the rays of almost every part of the solar
spectrum. These flames must therefore cause a shadow-like
appearance on the screen, unless the absorption be too trifling
to allow of our eye detecting the relatively dark spaces.
That the eye is unable to detect any dark spaces, I have proved
experimentally.               I

   Some time after writing the foregoing pages                  I
                                                        noticed a
memoir by G. A. Hirn entitled “Sur les propriétés optiques
de la flamme des corps en combustion, et sur la température
du soleil”. In this paper Hirn describes the behaviour of
various flames when viewed in sunlight; his conclusions,
however, are directly opposed to those which I have deduced.
   Hirn starts with the assumption that luminous hydrocarbon
flames contain solid carbon, luminous phosphorus-flame con
tains solid pentoxide of phosphorus &c.—that the transparency
of these flames is due to a change, brought about by the hig
temperature, in the optical properties of the solid particles con
tained in the flames, whereby these particles become transpa
rent and incapable of reflecting light.
  I shall   endeavour to show that       Hirn's conclusions         are   in
valid.    In his preliminary assumption Hirn takes no notice of
Knapp's experiments, which show that the decrease in lumino
sity of hydrocarbon-flames, brought about by admitting air, is
not to be traced to oxidation of the carbon, inasmuch as pure
nitrogen causes the same result f. Frankland's supposition
that the luminosity of hydrocarbon-flames        is not due to the
  resence of solid carbon had been disputed by no one when
   irn's paper appeared.      Frankland had shown, five years
previous to the appearance of Hirn's paper, that phosphorus
pentoxide is volatilized at temperatures lower than that of
the flame of phosphorus burning in oxygen, and that there
fore the luminosity of this flame cannot be due to the presence
of solid phosphorus pentoxide.

    Of Hirn's assumptions—that the luminosity of hydrocarbon
flames is due to the presence of solid carbon, and that the lumi
nosity of phosphorus burning in oxygen is due to the pre
sence of solid phosphorus pentoxide—the first was unproved
 at the time he wrote, and the second is untrue.
    Light reflected from a solid body is known to be polarized.
 Hirn found the light from ordinary                                aS
also the   light from burning   phosphorus,  to be  non-polarized    ;
he also           to detect evidence of   polarization   in the light
 coming from the flame of the blast-furnace.        He found, how
 ever, that the white smoke rising from the phosphorus-flame
 emitted polarized light, as did also the smoke coming from the
 blast-furnace when the furnace-doors were opened.           He con
 cluded that the flame of the furnace owes               its

presence   of those metallic salts which appear in the solid form
when the doors are opened.        This conclusion tacitly assumes
the presence of solid matter in the flame of the blast-furnace.
Hirn    does not appear to have examined the spectrum of this
flame ;   and, so far as our knowledge extends, the contrary
assumption to that made by Hirn appears quite as credible
as his.
   Hirn thus    assumes that the light from a flame which con
tains solid matter must show evidence of polarization, and
that the absence of polarized light is only to be accounted for
by supposing that the solid particles become optically altered
at a very high temperature, and lose their power of reflecting
light.   %   appears to me that the facts observed by Hirn
would be much better explained by regarding the absence of
polarization as proof of the absence of solid particles in the
flame.    This explanation would apply to the phosphorus
flame, and perhaps also to the flame from the blast-furnace.
I  have, however, convinced myself by experiment that the
non-recognition of polarized rays in the light coming from a
flame is not proof of the absence of solid matter in that
flame.
   The amorphous carbon present in the luminous flames of
ordinary combustible hydrocarbons reflects almost no light;
these flames show no traces of polarized light when examined
by means of the polariscope. The light from many other
non-homogeneous bodies is also devoid of noticeable polarized
rays. We cannot, therefore, assume that the light emitted by
a flame containing a small quantity of finely divided solid
matter must show such a number of polarized rays as shall be
 recognizable by the polariscope. Hydrogen-flames, rendered
luminous by the presence of platinum chloride, osmic acid,
ammonium chromate, ferric and cupric chlorides, &c., showed
no traces of polarized light when examined by means of
Arago's and Savart's polariscopes; yet these flames certainly
contained solid matter.
   The flame of hydrogen containing chromyl dichloride also
failed to show polarized light: the smoke of this flame, and
also of the turpentine-flame, when examined in sunlight,
afforded evidence of polarization.      I am inclined to trace the
polarizing action of the smoke in these cases to the presence
of condensed water, tarry matter, hydrochloric acid, &c.,
which substances would be present as gases in the flame itself.
    I  cannot, therefore, regard the non-detection of polarized
light as proof of the absence of solid matter in flame; much
less can  I agree with Hirn's statement, that “the solid par
ticles lose their power of reflecting light at a white heat.”

378             Dr. Karl Heumann's Contributions         to
    In   the second section   of his paper Hirn notices a statement
made      by  Offret",  who,  reasoning from Arago’s observation
that the luminous effect of a flat gas-flame, as measured by
the photometer, is the same whether the broad or narrow end
be turned towards the instrument, concludes that the luminous
gas-flame is completely transparent. Hirn shows from his own
observations that Arago's statement is not quite correct, and
that the broad side of the flame always emits a little more
light (about one fifth more) than the narrow side of the flame.
Offret mentions the well-known fact that the light from an
oil-lamp or candle, when thrown through the electric or lime
light, casts a shadow on the opposite wall : he, and Hirn also,
regards this phenomenon as due to refraction caused by the
heated, and therefore thin, layers of gas.
     I  have, however, shown that luminous flames throw true
shadows when carefully examined, and that these shadows
are independent of the darker and lighter bands caused by
refraction.
     In section 3 of his paper Hirn examines the transparency
 of the flame of petroleum-lamps for light emitted from flames
 of the same kind.        An old-fashioned shadow photometer was
 employed. A system of eight large lamps placed one behind
another, served as the source of light.        Hirn's observations and
 calculations led him to the conclusion that the light from such
 lamps suffers a greater diminution by passing through the hot
 gaseous products of combustion, than by passing through
 the luminous flames themselves.          The method of calculation
 adopted by Hirn appears to me to be altogether erroneous.
 By applying what       I must   regard as a more rational method
 of interpretation to Hirn's results,          I find that there is a
 decided decrease in luminosity brought about by the action
 of the separated carbon upon the light passing through the
 flames of these lamps, over and above that occasioned by
                        i.
 refraction in passing through the heated layers of gast.
     Hirn discusses         transparency of flames for light from
 foreign sources in the fourth section of his paper: #. again
 unfortunately chooses the flame of burning phosphorus.
 From the fact that the flame of burning phosphorus causes
 no shadow, while the smoke, so soon as it becomes visible to the
 eye, does cast a shadow, Hirn concludes that the solid phos
 phorus pentoxide suspended in the flame is transparent; we

 his, and of Heumann's method of calculation: the latter method is cer
 tainly much the more rational. Hirn's photometric process is also shown
 by his own results to be very faulty.—M. M. P. M.]

have long known, however, that the oxide does not exist in
the solid form in the flame.
   I    have noticed a faint shadow cast by the flame of phos
phorus burning in air ; but as this shadow disappears on
substituting oxygen for air,                I
                                          conclude that in the former
combustion the temperature is scarcely high enough to ensure
 the complete conversion of solid into gaseous matter.
     Hirn further says that the flame of a petroleum-lamp throws
 no shadow on a screen when viewed in sunlight,                         that          |.
 when the flame is rendered           smoky    the smoke causes a most
 marked shadow.          From the detailed description of Hirn's
 experiment, it is evident to me that he placed the screen at
 too great a distance from the flame.                He also obtained no
 distinct shadow when the           sunlight   was sent, by means of a
 looking-glass, through a series of eight petroleum-flames.
 On account of the interference between the flames, and also
 on account of their distance from the screen, this result is not
 to be wondered at".
     The petroleum-flame employed by Hirn was surrounded by
 a   glass  cylinder, which seriously interfered with the distinct
  ness of the shadow produced.
     It is not possible, by removing the screen further and
  further from the flame, to obtain a clearly defined shadow
  much exceeding in size the dimensions of the flame itself.                                    If,

380            Dr. Karl Heumann's Contributions to
be employed a shadow is obtained.   This shadow is most dis
tinct towards the outer edges of the flame, where the thick
ness of luminous matter attains a maximum.
   Fig. 9 represents the shadow thrown by the flame of an
ordinary burner.
    Fig. 10 represents the shadow produced by directing the
small  flame against the screen.     Figs. 11 and 12 show the
forms of shadows    produced   by adding   an excess of benzol
                    º
vapour to the gas (coal-gas or hydrogen) issuing from ordi
nary burners.    Similar appearances result with the flame
of  hydrogen   rendered luminous by admission of chromyl
dichloride. These experiments show that the shadows                    in
crease in intensity as the thickness of the luminous layer             in
creases, or, in other words, that the intensity of the shadow
is dependent upon the number of carbon particles which pre
vent the passage of the sun's rays through the flame.
   Hirn blew                 powder into a flame ; before the
powder was completely ignited the flame produced a shadow;
after complete ignition, however, no true shadow was obtained.
I  have carefully repeated this experiment, and find that a
flame containing a considerable quantity of lycopodium pow
der produces a marked shadow. Hirn probably used too little
of the powder, or placed his screen at too great a distance
from the flame. It is of course to be expected that the shadow
produced by a flame in which the lycopodium powder is
undergoing thorough combustion should be less marked than
that formed by a flame which contains unburned lycopodium :
in the former case the shadow is due to the presence of sepa
rated carbon only.
   The sole experiment of Hirn which is capable of interpre
tation in terms of his theory only, is that in which the light
of burning magnesium wire was passed through the flames of
eight petroleum-lamps: the increase in the light-effect of
these eight flames was equal to the total light-effect of the
magnesium when burned by itself.        But Hirn's previous ex
periments showed that the light from two petroleum-lamps
                                                                      º;
loses 39.9 per cent.” when passed through six other similar
flames; it is scarcely possible therefore that the light of burn
ing magnesium could suffer no diminution in luminosity when
passed through eight petroleum-flames.        Hirn's photometric
process  is,   his own results
               as              show,   altogether untrustworthy.

                        produce   true shadows are those which
consist     glowing vapours and gases. Luminous hydrocarbon
             of
flames produce strongly marked shadows             sunlight; these            in
flames therefore contain finely divided solid matter. That this
 solid matter can       nothing but carbon

importance to the determination of the amount of proteine
compounds in different kinds of vegetable food ; and such a
determination becomes of the utmost importance both to the
physiologist and from a practical point of view.
       itherto, however, this desideratum has been very imper
fectly supplied, and the chemist has very inadequately an
 swered the question as to the proteine value of the different
 vegetable foods. Gluten, legumen, vegetable caseine, vegetable
 albumen, as the various proteine substances occurring in vege
 tables have been called, vary much in properties.              Some of
 them are soluble and others are insoluble in water ; and some
 are soluble in alcohol ; and it would be difficult to draw up
 any general method of extracting the proteine compounds from
 vegetables so as to be enabled to weigh the proteine compound
 in a state of purity. Resort has therefore been had to ele
  mentary analysis; and chemists have deduced the amount
 of proteine compounds from the percentage of nitrogen found
 on submitting the food to ultimate analysis.
     To this procedure there are several objections which have,
 apparently, not been sufficiently insisted upon. Taking the
 case of wheaten flour (which is much more favourable than
 many other cases), the percentage of nitrogen is a little short
  of 2:00; yet neither the Will-and-Warrentrapp process nor
 the Dumas process of nitrogen-determination, as it is gene
 rally carried out, is at      adequateall    the valuation

               of                        potash;     fact, we   of

384      Messrs.        Wanklyn and Cooper on         the Determination
have made a special adaptation of the well-known ammonia
process of water-analysis to the case of vegetable proteine.
   The working details of our process are as follows:—
   Into a litre flask a carefully weighed gramme of the ve
getable substance to be analyzed is placed, and 20 cub. centims.
of decinormal solution of caustic potash is added, and then
water is added until the litre-mark is reached by the level of
the liquid.  The contents of the flask are then shaken up so
as to ensure thorough mixture.      In this manner we obtain a
liquid of such a strength that each cubic centim. contains 1
milligramme of the              ãºr
                            or other vegetable substance to be
operated upon.    10 or 20 cub. centims. of this liquid (i.e. 10
or 20 milligrammes of the vegetable substance) are conve
nient quantities to work with.
   The next step is to get the retort in order as for a water
analysis, and to place in it 300 or 500 cub. centims. of good
drinking-water, and to add 50 cub. centims. of a solution con
taining 10 grims, of potash and 0.4 grim, of permanganate of
potash (such as is used in water-analysis), and to distil until
the residue in the retort no longer yields the slightest trace
of ammonia. That having been done, 10 or 20 cub. centims.
of the liquid containing the vegetable substance are to be
                                                                           ºri'
added and the distillation proceeded with. The vegetable
substance will then be attacked, and     proteine Wii     its                                ield

   In looking through this Table the reader will be struck with
the constancy of the quantity of proteine substances in
wheaten flour.             If
                      one of the American samples (No. 15) be
excluded (we believe that there was a little pea-flour in that
sample), it will be seen that the highest percentage of am
monia given by any sample of flour is 1:14; and excluding
the solitary sample of Australian flour, the lowest yield of
ammonia is 1:00. Wheaten flour would therefore seem to
yield between 1:00 and 1:13 per cent. of         weight    ammonia   its            of
when subjected         the above process,

strange gorges. Thus the Colorado itself emerges from the plateau
region in a cañon 4000 feet deep.
   The chief economic product of the area is coal; and though the
amount of glacial drift is inconsiderable, at least a tenth part of the
sedimentary rocks of the region is buried beneath vast fields of lava.
   As before remarked, the disturbance in the Colorado district can
scarcely be considered violent. The faults and folds are numerous,
but simple in character; and the “monoclinal fold,” or one single
bend in the strata, sometimes accompanied by faulting at one
extremity of the long ridge or slope formed by the disturbance, is
not merely “a feature of occasional occurrence,” but is “a charac
teristic type of displacement, and is rivalled in frequency only by
the fault.” These monoclinal folds divide the area into a series of
“blocks,” and sometimes culminate in lines of displacement. A
very clear sketch showing the occurrence of these, as well as of
the cañons which seam the plains between them, from Major
 Powell's report on the Exploration of the Colorado, is given to
illustrate the region.

the streams which carry away the disintegrated material            deposit                 to

   The chief agents        weathering are solution

when the cement is soluble and the texture of the other ingredients
open; “disintegration by frost is most rapid in rocks which
absorb a large percentage of water,” detrition by mechanical wear
in soft rocks; and transportation is easiest when the results of cor
rasion are finely comminuted.
    As a rule, climatal effects depend rather on rainfall or dampness,
than on changes of temperature, as the latter must be extreme to
produce much useful fissuring, though still cracks in a country
where frost has an opportunity of acting would facilitate the
destruction of the mass.             One of the most valuable results of
rainfall is the increase the vegetable products afford to the solvent
power of water; but nevertheless, on the other hand, vegetation
acts as a protective agent to the surface, both in checking the force
of the rain-drops and in retarding the removal of the soil by                                                        its

 the rain runs off the rock-surface, and both solution and weathering
are therefore retarded, though the disintegration                         corrasion                 by

of corrasion will be proportionately rapid, and gorges, such as those

the river-bed, even when cut through rocks of various degrees of

There are no waterfalls in the great cañons, though hard bands of
limestone as well as adjacent beds of soft sandstone are equally
cut through.     Ordinarily this would result in the production of
ledges and waterfalls; but there are none such in these river-beds.

wards found that the former experiment had already been made                                               by
Fechner (see Wiedemann’s “Galvanismus,' page 21), who also tried
lifting copper from sulphur and got the same effect; although the

390        Royal Society:—Mr.     J. Thomson on Contact
plates were lifted as carefully as possible, yet it was not certain
that friction had been entirely got rid of, so the following experi
ments were made to show that there is an electrical displacement
when two non-conductors or a conductor and a non-conductor are
put in contact without friction.
   The arrangement used was as follows:—
   Glass rods, AB, CD, EF, GH, were fixed in a wooden frame
ACGE ; round these rods silk threads, BF, DH, were wound; an
aluminium needle carrying a mirror, M, was hung by a silk thread
from a brass rod, T, fastened in the wooden frame; a wire from
the needle dipped into a glass vessel, N, containing sulphuric acid;
a small magnet was fastened to the back of the mirror, and a glass
case was placed over the whole; outside the glass case were mag
nets, by means of which the position of the needle was regu
lated; a wire also from the outside dipped into the vessel N,
and was used to charge the needle with electricity; positive elec
tricity was got from an ordinary electrophorus, negative from
an electrophorus    in which the resin was replaced by a plate of
glass; which was excited by silk.     If wax and glass were the sub
stances  experimented   on, a cake,  OQRP,   was made, one half of
which, OSQ, was glass, the other half, RPS, being wax; the junction
of the wax and glass was parallel to OQ, the wax sticking fast to
the glass : this cake was then placed on the silk threads under the
                                                                     *
needle, and  it was found possible to bring the needle into such a
position that when it was charged with positive electricity it was

    When two non-conductors, A, B, are placed in contact, the
electricity will not be distributed through the whole of A and B;
and if the displacement is from B to A and parallel to the sides
of the cake, the only parts electrified will be the middle and ends
of the cake; the A end of the cake will be positively and the B end
negatively electrified; and if A has a greater specific inductive
capacity than B the middle will be negatively electrified; if it has
a less specific inductive capacity than B it will be positively elec
trified.

some quantitative measurements. The above experiments were

    1. “On the Strata and their Fossil Contents between the Borrow
dale Series of the North of England and the Coniston Flags.”         By
Prof. Robert      Harkness,   F.R.S., F.G.S.,  Professor of Geology   in
Queen's College, Cork, and H. Alleyne Nicholson, M.D., D.Sc.,
F.R.S.E., F.G.S., Professor of Natural History in the University of
St. Andrews.
    The object of this paper was the investigation of the strata be
tween the great volcanic series of the Lake—district, the Borrowdale
rocks, and the sedimentary rocks called Coniston Flags by Prof.
Sedgwick.      The Borrowdale series, the Green Slates and Porphyries
of   Sedgwick,  are underlain by the Skiddaw Slates, forming the base
of the Silurian series, and equivalent in age to the Arenig rocks of
Wales, according to their fossil contents. The Borrowdale rocks
consist of ashes and breccias, alternating with ancient lavas, and are
partly subaerial, partly submarine. They contain no fossils, except
 in a band of calcareous ashes near the summit of the group, which
is followed by the Coniston Limestone, with or without the inter
 vention of a bed of trap. The fossils are of Bala types. Some
 times this band is recognizable with no traces of fossils except
 cavities filled with peroxide of iron.     The authors regard this as
 proving the prevalence of volcanic activity in the Lake district up
 to the later portion of the Bala period.
     The deposits specially discussed in the paper sent, lie, apparently
 quite conformably, upon the Borrowdale rocks, and are grouped by
 the authors as follows, in ascending order:—
                  1. Dufton Shales.
                  2. Coniston Limestones and Shales.
                  3. Graptolitic Mudstones or Skelgill Beds.
                  4. Knock Beds.

           between the      Borrowdale Rocks and Coniston Flags.                                       393
    The “Dufton Shales” are a well-marked, but locally distributed
group of muddy deposits, especially well developed in the Silurian
area underlying the Cross-Fell range, where they are seen in four
principal exposures; and their thickness probably exceeds 300 feet.
They are richly fossiliferous, the fossils being generally of Bala
types; and they may be regarded as forming, palaeontologically, the
base of the Coniston Limestone.           The fossils sometimes occur in
ash-beds; and the continuance of these conditions leads the authors
to believe that there was no break between these shales and the
underlying Borrowdale rocks.
    The “Coniston Limestone” has long been recognized as the best
defined division of the Lower Silurian rocks of the north of England.
Its range and characters, and those of the associated shales in
different localities, are indicated by the authors; and from the con
tained fossils, they refer           it,

shire, with the Description of a new Fauna.”      By C. Callaway, Esq.,
 M.A., F.G.S.
    The purpose of the author was to prove that certain olive, mica
ceous, thin-bedded shales exposed at Shineton, near Cressage, and
covering an area eight miles in length by two in the greatest
breadth, which had been mapped as Caradoc in the survey, were of
Tremadoc age. They were seen clearly to underlie the Hoar-Edge
Grit, the lowest beds in the district, with Caradoc fossils; and no
rock distinctly underlying the shales could be detected.      The evi
dence for their age was chiefly palaeontological.   With the exception
of Asaphus Homfrayi, a Tremadoc form, the species are new. Genera
such as Olenus, Conocoryphe, Obolella, and Lingulella suggested a
very low horizon; but two Asaphoid forms (though not typical
Asaphi) pointed in an opposite direction.       Corroborative evidence
was found in a correlation of the shales at Shineton with the
Dictyonema-shales    at Pedwardine and Malvern.     It was shown from
lithological characters and from fossils that the shales at the three
localities were of the same age; and as the beds at Pedwardine and
Malvern were, on their own testimony, admitted to be of Lingula
flag or Tremadoc age, the Shineton shales were inferred to be on the
same horizon, the Asaphids leading the author to adopt the younger
of the two formations. He was of opinion that the Black Shales of
Malvern (Dolgelly beds) were not represented in the Shineton area.
He announced the discovery of the Hollybush Sandstone, forming a
continuous band between the Shineton Shales and the Wrekin axis,
recognized by the occurrence of Kutorgina cingulata, and probably
separated from the shales by a fault.        This also afforded corro
borative evidence of the identity of the Dictyonema-shales with the
shales at Shineton.

    1. “On Sandworn Stones from New Zealand.” By John D.
Enys, Esq., F.G.S.
    The author exhibited specimens of sandworn pebbles from near
Wellington in New Zealand, and described their mode of occur
rence.    They are found on an isthmus rising but little above the
sea, and about a mile wide, and having on each side a line of low
sandhills, separated by a flat space of clayey sand, on which the
stones rest.    The isthmus separates two bays, on each side of which
the   ground   is high; and hence the prevailing winds (which are
north-west and south-east) blow across the isthmus with consider
able force, and carry with them a cloud of sand, which, on a windy
day, forms a dense mass reaching about to the knees of a person
walking over the ground. The passage of this moving sand over
the stones or pebbles lying on the surface wears them away so as to
give them sloping sides, and even to bring them to an angle or ridge
running along the upper surface, the direction of the longer axis
of the stone with respect to the prevailing wind governing the par

material occur in the stones, these are left projecting from the
surface, and are sometimes even undercut.

duced independently, and, electrically considered, would act, in the
same direction, the one answering to positive, and the other to
negative, electricity.   Hence, as the amount of compression may be
supposed to be equal to that of dilatation, the light incident on
both surfaces simultaneously would have double the effect of the
light incident on either singly. This inference agrees with experi
mental results.
   I  have said in the April Number (p. 279) that “the intrinsic
molecular forces of the vanes tend continuously to make the atoms
return to their neutral positions; but since at the same time the
disturbing force is constantly in action, the result of the antago
nistic forces will be a permanent abnormal condition of the super
ficial atoms, so long as the disturbance continues.”       I propose now
to qualify this view by saying that the tendency of the atoms to
take the neutral positions is due to the law of heat-earchanges, which
is always in operation, and which may even be said to include the
before supposed action of molecular forces. The thermal influences
of the enclosing glass case, and of other surrounding substances,
which physicists have taken into consideration in proposed ex
 planations of the action of the radiometer, may be assumed to be
embraced by this general law, and on that account may not require
to be specifically determined.

  Among the fringes the discovery of which we owe to Mr. Airy
there is one, called courbe en semelle by M. Billet, remarkable for
the instability of its form and orientation, and therefore very ap
propriate to serve as a characteristic.              purpose to show the           I
advantage that may be derived from the study of this curve in
order to ascertain :-1, the physical constitution of a mirror (that

closely related, and giving volumes multiples of 5:5, the value as

new density-observations of my own, to include at least twelve
compounds not in my earlier list.
   My own determinations, in addition to those have already given               I

lithium bromide, 3-102, 17°; lithium iodide, 3-485, 23°.

 symbol of the substance, the second its density with authority

cular weights, the              between successive members of the
series increase              as   we ascend.              Thus LiCl and NaCl differ                            by     5-5,

400             Intelligence    and Miscellaneous Articles.
NaCl and KCl by      11, KCl and RbCl by 16.5. This regular differ
ence-increase is certainly suggestive of some law yet to be clearly
made out.
    A similar relation to Kopp's hydrogen-volume is also afforded by
the two other compounds. Sodium hydride (Na,FI), discovered by
Troost and Hautefeuille”, with a density of 0.959, has a molecular
volume of 49.1, or very nearly 5.5 x 9. Still more interesting is
iodine monochloride, so carefully studied by Hannayt. At 0° the
solid substance has a specific gravity of 3.263, and a molecular
volume of 49.8, thus varying only 0.3 from a multiple of 5.5. At
 101° the chloride boils, and at 98° its density is 2.958, having a
volume of 54.9.      Probably an absolutely correct determination at
its boiling-point would give a value of 55. So we may say that
iodine monochloride, both as a solid at 0°, and as a liquid at its
boiling-point, has molecular volumes multiples of that of hydrogen.
    As for the haloid salts of silver, they cannot with certainty be
included among the substances connected by this multiple relation.
The fluoride agrees fairly, however, having a density of 5-852, Gore,
and a molecular volume of 21-7 instead of 22. The chloride and
iodide may be forced to agree by selecting out the density-determi
nations of certain investigators, and rejecting other decidedly dis
cordant data. The bromide does not agree at all. A determination
of my own for precipitated AgBr gives a density of 6:215, 17°, and
a corresponding volume of 3025. Other determinations are even
 more discordant than this. Silver salts generally have molecular
 volumes equal or nearly equal to the corresponding sodium com
pound, that of sodium bromide being 33-0. Silver fluoride, it will
be seen, diverges also from the sodium salts.       For thallium our
data are insufficient.    Its monochloride has a molecular volume
approximating to a multiple of 5:5, but not closely enough to be
 satisfactory; the sesquichloride does not even approximate. At
                      I
some future time hope to be able to revise and extend our specific
gravity determinations for this class of thallium salts.
    Now to sum up. Including the silver and thallium salts we know
the densities of twenty-five substances containing only univalent
elements. Of these, twenty have molecular volumes multiples of
that of hydrogen, three are doubtful, two apparently disagree.     We
may therefore safely assert the following general law, subject to
possible exceptions:—Every compound containing only elements of the
hydrogen group has a molecular volume an even multiple of that of
hydrogen.     This is probably but a hint of some more general regu
larity connecting other elements and other groups.
    Postscript.—Since the above pages were written, there has been
  ublished by Johnson a density-determination for potassium tri
iodide, KI, (Chem. News, vol. xxxiv. p. 256). This determination,
3.498, corresponds to a molecular volume of 120-1.     121 is an exact
multiple of 5:5, and gives a theoretical density of 3:472. The mul
tiple relation now holds good in twenty cases out of twenty-five.—

take place in an elementary gas, the molecule being composed
of two atoms. How the atoms are bound together we do not
know ; but, from what we can gather, there seems to be some
attractive force between them which at very close quarters
changes into a repulsive one.   Equilibrium is sustained by the
attraction between the two atoms and their motion about one
another.
                    If,
               then, the two atoms       molecule become sepa         of

    3. In the   present paper  I  first consider the problem, To
find the number of blows      greater   than c, between two sets
of moving particles, per unit of time, in unit of volume.
This is then applied to find the dissociation at any tempera
ture, and a quadratic obtained, the positive root of which
gives the ratio of molecules to free atoms in the gas ; and it
is shown that the resulting state of the gas is a stable one.
This ratio is used to investigate the relation between the tem
perature and pressure ; and it is shown that Charles's law is
not rigorously exact, though within ordinary ranges of tem
perature it is very nearly so ; reasons are also given wh
for the permanent gases c should be large, compared wit
the mean blow at ordinary temperatures.           Next the specific
heats are considered ; and it is proved that for a diatomic
                                                       º
molecule, in which the atoms are smooth and spherical, or
the energy of rotation of the atoms is unaffected          external
causes, the ratio of the specific heats is about 1:4; it is also
shown that the specific heats are almost rigorously constant
at ordinary temperatures.     This concludes the present paper;

compound gas of the type HCl.
    4. When we pass to the consideration of a compound gas,
even of the simplest form, additional difficulties are introduced,
as equations of a high order appear whose algebraical solution
is impossible, and from which therefore it will be extremely
 difficult to deduce general laws. All we seem able to do is
 to take one or two particular cases, and learn what we can
about them.      For instance, in the case of a gas of the type
 HCl, i.e. in which two monatomic gases combine to form a
 gas whose molecule is diatomic, we get three equations of the
second degree between three unknowns.            In general, when
two gases A and B are mixed together, there will always be a
                                      ...
 certain proportion of a new gas C whose molecule is com
posed of atoms of A and B, and the proportions of free atoms
 and molecules of A and B will be              When the excess of
 the number of combinations of free atoms of A with B over
 the number of molecules of C destroyed in any time is
 greater than the number of combinations of free atoms of A
 to form A and of free atoms of B to form B, then the propor
 tion of A and B decreases, whilst that of C increases, and we get
 a chemical change.       This will explain why often the mere
 presence of another gas D will produce a change of A and B
 into C ; for the action of D on A and B may cause more of
 their molecules to be broken up than of C, while at the same

   The condition may be stated in a different form as follows.
When a increases through the root, f(xy) must change from
positive to negative.  From this again we see that the positive
root of by’–2ary—a”=0 gives a stable state.          For when
w-0 the expression is positive, and when was o it is negative,

some other substance ; and all we can deduce is that when the
temperature increases a certain degree, the pressures of all the
permanent gases increase in very nearly the same ratio with
one another; but we have no proof that what we consider
equal increments of temperature corresponds to exactly equal
increments of mean kinetic energy.         This is generally ac

   In the above we have neglected the variation of the poten
tial energy of molecules except in the case where they are
 broken up. The above formula is greatly simplified if we
 consider, as is highly probable, that a molecule has twice the
 number of degrees of freedom of a free atom—in other words,
   2A2=X1; we then get

posed throughout the present paper), any internal energy an
atom may have must be unaffected by change of temperature;
and in this case A1 = 2.

 cide with those of prop. W., giving ; of the whole transmitted,
and the remaining            divided between the reflected streams.
 If cosy-0,     or the component systems differ in phase by 4 of
a  period,   the whole energy is transmitted, or the geometrical
composition takes place unaltered.              This is immediately seen
from the     vanishing    of the term (2AB cos y), by which C*        dif
fers from A*-i-B”.
    In all these discussions it has been assumed that the incident
wave-systems were not subject to constraint, which would pre
vent them from yielding to the reflected impulse ; and in cases
of interference in air constraint is frequently absent. But
where the two wave-systems are supplied, say, by tuning

forks close to the point of meeting, the forks are capable of
maintaining their movement unchanged and acting as a con
straint. Under these circumstances more work is                    by the
sources, and the geometrical composition of the systems is
maintained.

    In the next note propose to apply the principle of the flow
of energy to the divergence of sound in air.

                 on the supposed Diathermancy                             of Rock-Salt.                     425
   A     thermopile is placed at a distance from the source of heat,
the radiation from which causes a deflection of the galvano
meter-needle.         This arrangement completed, the substances to
be examined are introduced between the source and the pile,
their different powers of absorption and transmission being
determined by the different values of the deflections. Taking
a single instance, it is assumed that a plate of ice <U+017F>o of an
                                 a all
inch thick absorbs           the incident radiation from copper heated
to   400° C.; while            rock-salt plate                         of
                                                       the same thickness
transmits 92.3        per cent.              of
                                    the total radiation from the same

source      of heat. That the ice does absorb the heat            proved                     is
the    liquefaction         of
                          the   substance;    but that 92.3     per   cent.
the total radiation passes through the salt not, think, equally           is       I
certain;          fact the experiment points, not
                 in                                          diathermancy,         to
but    to  the unequal absorptive powers                          of
                                                   the different substances
examined.
      In  1869* Professor Magnus endeavoured                account for the        to
diathermancy            of
                         rock-salt                 by
                                         saying:—“The great diather
mancy       of   rock-salt does not depend                small absorbing on   a
power for different kinds                     of
                                      heat, but upon the circumstance
that   it  emits only one kind          heat, and only absorbs this one,
                                                  of

that this conclusion              based upon the doctrine             periods,                 of
although the result                  of is

    thick; a few threads of unspun silk wound round the head of
    the thermometer-tube hold it in position. This will call the    I
    “enclosed ” thermometer, and the other the “naked ” one;
    both thermometers are fixed to one cork and placed in a glass
    tube. The whole apparatus is seen in fig. 2. & is the cork with
    thermometers attached, the bulbs of which are at a distance of
    one inch from each other; T, a glass tube 12 inches long and
    1% inch internal diameter          containing them; V, a glass vessel
    8 inches    long    and 4 inches internal diameter, fitted with a
    cork to admit the tube T ; this vessel is filled with water at
    the boiling-temperature; t, a tube to convey the steam given
    off by the water to condenser K. The mode of performing
    the experiment is as follows:—
        The thermometers being in their places, the tube containing
    them is placed in a freezing-mixture and allowed to remain
    till both thermometers register 0°C. The water in the vessel
    V is heated by the aid of a spirit-lamp which is withdrawn
    when the water boils; when ebullition has ceased the tube is
    taken from the freezing-mixture and quickly passed into the
    vessel V, and the rise of both thermometers noted from minute
    to minute. When the enclosed thermometer has reached its
    maximum temperature, the tube is then withdrawn, placed in
    the freezing-mixture, and the descent from minute to minute

experiments which have been made, that, under the presuppo
sition mentioned, the chemical is equal in amount to the gal

law  guy-Mºlt,    where M is a constant, i denotes the current
intensity, l the resistance of the conduction and the pile toge
ther, and t the time during which the current is in action.
Therefore, if E denotes the electromotive force of the pile, we
can also write gw=MEit, from which, in consequence of the
inference drawn, we obtain kw=MEit, if kw signifies the heat
evolved by the primary chemical processes in the pile.           n                                  If

Hence we conclude that kw=                                  E, and therefore that, for
one equivalent,     kw=                 , from which it follows that the quan
tity of heat which is produced in the pile by the primary che
mical processes while one equivalent is decomposed at the
positive pole is a measure of the electromotive force of the
Pile.
    Ifthe galvanic is in reality precisely as great as the prima
chemical heat, we may consequently say that the whole effi

arising in the pile cannot pass over into galvanic heat, but a
part of it is expended for the mechanical work necessary for
generating the electromotive forces of polarization and the
chemical decomposition in the cell.     We can imagine this
brought about by the store of chemical heat requisite for
this work being carried by the current from the pile into
the decomposition-cell,  where it is employed for the purpose
mentioned.    Consequently no other change of temperature
can arise in the decomposition-cell   than that which is occa
          .
sioned by the passage of the current through the electrolytic
liquid. The heat generated in the decomposition-cell must
therefore be equal to that which is produced when the current
passes through a metallic conductor the resistance of which is
equal to that of the liquid.  Now, as by direct measurement

been         greater than the             the cause of this has
been sought in the secondary chemical processes which may
take place there and are independent of the current.

        have already, some years since ", given another expla–
nation of the thermal phenomena in question.        It was, in
brief, the following:—If the current does no external work,
its total action consists      calling forth heat
                                               in      the conduc              in

          heat would have been obtained out       nothing. The            of

                 Galvanic Pile, and Electromotive Forces.                                            431
rent, the electromotive force consumes a quantity of heat ex
actly equal to the quantity generated by the current in over
coming the resistance of the galvanic conduction. The heat
consumption of the electromotive force is accordingly equal to
gw; yet it does not hence follow that it is not also equal to kw,
or that gw and kw have not the same magnitude.
   If only a single electromotor is inserted in the closed circuit,
keeping the same notation as before, we have
                                     gue   = Mølt=MEit;

therefore in unit time a quantity of heat is consumed which is
  roportional to the product of the electromotive force and the
intensity of the current. Thus,             the solution of one
equivalent of zinc, the total amount of heat gu, consumed by
the electromotor               =    y E.          This holds, even            if l   be changed—
that    is,   even   if   the current-intensity                be   increased        or   diminished.

 other respects the two views              to divergent results: for

 chemical heat is equal to that of the galvanic, wherefore the
 former   also gives a measure of the electromotive force; ac
 cording to the other these two quantities may be different,
and consequently the primary chemical heat cannot serve as
 a measure for the electromotive force, &c.
    In order to determine which of these two views accords
best with experience, we will more closely consider the expe
riments which have been instituted for the purpose of studying
the thermal phenomena of the pile and of the current.                  For
brevity, we will name the first-cited method of consideration
 No 1, and that proposed by me No. 2.
    3. Favre" has endeavoured, by direct experiments, to
answer the question, Is the whole of the galvanic heat which
arises in the circuit derived merely from that which is gene
rated by the chemical processes?          For this he made use of a
mercury calorimeter with two muffles situated close to one
 another, of the same nature as the calorimeter which Favre
                    ...
 and Silbermann had previously employed in their determina
                              ºf
 tions of the heat            ed in chemical processes.          The pile
 he used consisted of a glass tube filled with water containing
 º
 sulphuric acid, in which were placed the two pole-plates,
 amalgamated zinc and                     copper (Smee's pile).          It
 was closed with a fine     platinum    wire,  which was of unequal
         and thickness in different experiments.          The hydrogen
 evolved in the  pile was collected and measured.            The experi
                                                                       .
 ment was first made in this       way:—The        pile was enclosed in
 one muffle, and the platinum wire in the other; at the same
 time it must be remarked that the copper wires connectin
the pole-plates with the ends of the platinum wire,
wift    were outside of the calorimeter, were so thick that
          W.
no perceptible development of heat could take place in
them.             therefore, the experiment was thus arranged,
the calorimeter indicated the total sum of the heat which
was developed in the pile and the entire circuit while
the current was in action ; and since the quantity of the
hydrogen gas developed was at the same time known, it
was easy to calculate what the sum of the heat would have
been if the experiment had been continued until one equiva
lent of zinc in the pile was dissolved. Thereupon the experi
ment was varied by leaving the platinum wire outside of the
calorimeter, in consequence of which the galvanic heat which
arose in the wire had no effect upon the calorimeter.                  The

difference between the indications of the calorimeter in the two
eases was consequently equal to the galvanic heat which was
developed in the platinum wire. The results of the different ex
periments will be seen from the following Table. Column a

it amounts to 23900 thermal units, which agrees closely with
M. Favre's result”.
   If  the difference which is almost always found between the
quantities of the chemical and the galvanic heat is caused by
the secondary chemical processes which may take place in the
pile, we must assume, in accordance with what has been said
above, that these processes bring forth in some piles a produc
tion, in others a consumption of heat.           Favre thought at first
that the     galvanic    heat was    exactly equal   in quantity to the
chemicalf.        Subsequently      he shared the view already ex
pressed    by  others, that the cause of the difference in question
in Smee's pile lay in this, that the hydrogen at the negative
platinum disk was separated in the active state, or in statu
 nascenti.    As afterwards the hydrogen leaves the platinum
disk and      escapes    upward through the liquid, it passes over
into      its
           ordinary    condition,      which process heat
                                                  in            liberated,             is
which probably raises the temperature               the liquid, but does

 not augment the electromotive forcef. But the unexpected
 relation shown             by
                         the cadmium-platinum and zinc-platinum
 piles charged with hydrochloric acid finally convinced him
                                                                           -
 that this also could not         the true explanation

     In order, therefore,        explain the difference         the ordi               in
 nary Smee's pile, we must assume that heat               evolved      the   is                       on

liquid     inthe  pile,  without   affecting  the electromotive force.
In   the two piles last mentioned, with hydrochloric acid              the                            as

                                     on                             other,                     to

   From the foregoing it follows without doubt that it is very
difficult to employ the mode of representation No. 1 for the
explanation of the thermal phenomena which take place in
the galvanic pile and               by

438        Prof. E. Edlund on the Thermal Phenomena of the
sentations, No. 1 or No. 2, deserves to be preferred, we obtain
the best clue from the experiments instituted in order to mea
sure the heat-phenomena in a chemical-decomposition cell or
voltameter. With this view Raoult employed partly water
acidulated with sulphuric acid, and partly a solution of sul
phate of copper as electrolytic liquid, and with the help of a
mercury calorimeter measured the quantity of heat which arose
in the decomposition-cell over and above the quantity occa
sioned there by the passage of the current in consequence of
the resistance".    If W is the total heat developed in the vol
tameter, and gw (as before) the heat which the passage of the
current occasions in consequence of the resistance (or the gal
vanic heat), W–gw was measured.             This heat-difference,
which Raoult calls the local heat, may in the following be de
noted by L. By special experiments Raoult moreover mea
sured the polarization-electromotive force produced in the
voltameter during the passage of the current. This electro
motive force may be denoted by e, and that of an element of the
Daniell pile by d. The series employed consisted, in the dif
ferent experiments, of from two to twelve Daniell elements.
The numbers cited below under L denote the number of heat
units which were developed in the voltameter during the libe
ration of one equivalent of hydrogen or copper.         As, more
over, it cannot be necessary to describe more closely the
arrangements in the experiments, we may here add only that,
with the decomposition of the sulphuric-acid water, the two
poles in the voltameter consisted of platinum wires in the first
two experiments (A and B)—while in the third experiment
(C) only the positive pole consisted of platinum, the negative
being formed of a thick wire of copper.       In     three experi                  all
ments with the copper solution the positive pole consisted
                                                                                                         of

As  may  readily          be
                      understood, the voltameter alone was en
          the calorimeter, and the piles stood outside
       in                                                                                         of

in the voltameter |. the passage of the current; and this
happens notwithstanding it might be supposed, in consequence
of the chemical decomposition of the liquid, that the result
would be a cooling.
    Raoult is of opinion that the cause of the heating in this
 case is to be sought in secondary chemical processes occurring
 in the voltameter, which have nothing to do with the current.
 He supposes that the constituents of the electrolyte, which
cover the electrodes and cause the polarization, are easily de
composable, and on their decomposition              give rise to a heat
production in the same manner as takes place with the hyper
oxide of hydrogen—that the decomposition of these products
first takes place after they have left the electrodes and begin
to ascend through the liquid, in consequence of which this is
heated by them without the current being at                  affected.            all                      In

Indeed the calculated do not differ more from the observed
numbers than can be accounted for from the unavoidable
errors of observation occurring in experiments of this sort.
Hence it follows that, to account for the thermal phenomena
occurring in the voltameter, there is no need to have recourse
to the secondary chemical processes which may take place
there, the nature and amount of which are more or less un
known "; the theoretical view above presented under No. 2
perfectly suffices for their explanation.

In this the quantity of heat k—a was obtained, where a (as

in agreement with experiment,    it becomes a point of interest
to inquire how the propagation of sound (or the propagation
of waves in gases generally) would be explained by #. aid of
the kinetic theory.
    Since, in accordance with this theory, the molecules of
    ses are in motion among each other in straight lines, colli
  ing among themselves, it would appear somewhat difficult to
form a distinct idea as to the mode of propagation of a wave
in a gas and the condition determining the rate of propagation,
unless some law or guiding principle could be conceived of
according to which the molecules moved. Now            think it                                 I

will be found, on considering the subject, that there is a
guiding principle governing the motions of the molecules of
a gas among each other.                                 I
                                   propose to show that the mo–
lecules of a gas in a fixed vessel under the influence of their
mutual collisions tend to arrange their motions in such a
way that an equal number of molecules move at any instant
in any two opposite directions; or a                      adjustment
goes on among the molecules of a gas in such a way that
when an imaginary plane is placed in any position outside
 the vessel, the number of molecules which at any instant
are approaching the plane is equal to the number which at
the same instant are receding from                                 it.

a known fact that, when a sound-wave passes through a mass of
air,the mass of air oscillates, as a whole, backwards and forwards
(within small limits).     It will therefore be necessary to explain
how this takes place in accordance with the kinetic theory.
Taking the illustrative  case of the row of spheres, we have
observed  that when no wave is passing, each sphere is nor
mally oscillating backwards and forwards within definite
limits; or       all
               the alternate spheres,       half the row, move    or
forward, whilst the other half moves backwards. We have
observed that when     wave passes, each sphere, after
                                  a                           has                               it
transferred the increment       velocity foward, returns back

wards with           its
                normal velocity; i.e. the sphere    only affected                is
with the increment    velocity   of
                               when     moves forwards,  and not

when      moves backwards.
           it                  The sphere therefore makes                                              its
forward movement with       greater velocity than

movement; and accordingly the sphere gains more ground                                                 at
its forward movement than loses        the backward movement;

     9. The Physical Condition determining the Velocity of Sound.
 —It must evidently follow, as a necessary consequence from
 the above considerations, that the velocity of sound in a gas
 must be proportional to the velocity of the molecules of the
 gas; so that, therefore, the numbers expressing the velocity
 of sound in different gases and the numbers expressing the
 velocities of the molecules of different gases must be propor
 tional to each other. This is found to be true. Thus, for
 example, the velocity of the molecules of hydrogen is known
 to be four times as great as that of the molecules of oxygen;
 so the measured velocity of sound in hydrogen is four times
 its measured velocity      oxygen.       in

unaltered.         old theory would assume that the velocity of
sound has remained unaltered in this case because increased
density (or increased number of air-molecules) has a power of

diminishing the velocity of the sound-wave, while, on the other
hand, the increased pressure of the air against the sides of the
vessel (considered to represent                  “elasticity”) has a
power of increasing the velocity of the wave, and that the two
actions counteract each other, and therefore the velocity of
the wave has remained unaltered. Contrast this with the
simple and realizable explanation of the kinetic theory, viz.
that the velocity of the wave has remained unaltered simply
because the velocity of the molecules which propagate it has
remained unaltered.
   13. Clausius has demonstrated          that, for a gas to fulfil
Mariotte and Gay-Lussac’s laws:—
   (1) “The space actually filled by the molecules of the gas
must be infinitesimal in comparison with the whole space occu
pied by the gas itself.”
   (2) “That those portions of the path of a molecule through
out which the molecular forces are of influence in sensibly
altering the motion of the molecule either in direction or velo
city must be of vanishing value compared with those portions
of the path throughout which  -      such forces may be considered
as inactive.”
   Since, therefore, the portion of a molecule's path through
which it is acted on by other molecules of the gas is                                   .#
ingly small compared with the range of               path throughoutits

                     acted  on,  there      therefore practically

This is an inevitable certainty by the acceptance of the kinetic
theory; and therefore it is clear that a change of density of
the air, by adding to the number of air-molecules (as when air
has been forced into a vessel), cannot possibly influence the
velocity of propagation of a wave by the air so long as the
molecular velocity remains constant.
   14. Obviously when air has been forced into a vessel and
thereby     density increased, this has simply the effect, by

    16. Case of Heated Rarefied Air.—When air unconfined
 and free to expand is heated, the velocity of sound is found to
be increased. This, according to the old theory, is considered
to be due to the diminished density of the air, or the diminished
number of molecules attendant on the expansion of the air.
 Now, in accordance with the kinetic theory, this increased velo
city of propagation of the wave is simply explained by the                                                                     in

now referred to increased “elasticity” of the air (represented
by the increased pressure of the confined air upon the sides of
the vessel).    This increased pressure upon the sides of the
vessel, however, is only due to the increased velocity of the air
molecules which impinge against the sides of the vessel, and
whose velocity has been augmented by the application of
heat (and whose motion represents the “heat”). The                                                         in
creased pressure of the heated air may serve as a convenient
means for estimating the augmentation of molecular velocity,
upon which the augmented velocity of propagation of the
sound-wave depends.        Thus it may be a convenient rule that
the  velocity  of sound in heated (confined) air (of unchanged
density) is proportional to the square root of the “elasticity”
of the air (as measured by the pressure), the reason of this
being that the velocity of the molecules of air (which deter
mines the velocity of the propagation of the wave) is itself pro
portional to the square root of the pressure.      The augmented
                      ".
pressure of heated confined air is evidently not itself the cause
 of the increased velocity of propagation of the wave; but the
 augmented               (“elasticity”) is the effect attendant on
 the increased velocity of the molecules of air, which increased
 velocity is itself the cause of the augmented velocity of propa
 gation of the wave.
    19. The result of these considerations may therefore be
 summarized as follows:—
    That the velocity of propagation of a wave (such as a ware
 of sound) in a gas is                   ºff,
                               determined by, and proportional to,
the velocity         of   the molecules            of the gas;           that this relocity       of pro
pagation of the ware is not affected by density, pressure, or by
the specific gravity of a gas, or by any thing else earcepting the
                     it its
 velocity    of       molecules.

    Measurement of a large though imperfect crystal in the
British Museum showed it to be a combination of the cube
with the tetrakishexahedron {4 10} and the triakisoctahedron
{811}. As the faces were very dull, and but rough measure
ments could be obtained, I was glad to confirm this observa
tion by the examination of a crystal showing the same com
bination in Mr. Ludlam's beautiful collection, which he was
good enough to lend me. The angles measured on the latter
crystal agree fairly well with the calculated angles.

         Perception of the Direction of a Source of Sound.
IN      a paper with the above title, communicated last year to
       the Musical Association and afterwards published in abs

 tract, in “Nature,      I  brought forward the fact that we are
 unable to distinguish whether a pure tone (obtained from a
               and air-resonator) is immediately in front of or
 immediately behind us—although with other sounds, and no
 tably with the human voice, there is in general no difficulty.
 In order to make the experiment satisfactorily, it is necessary
                                          i.
 to provide two similar forks and resonators and to place the
 observer between them.           At a given signal both forks are
 struck, but one of them only is                over its resonator.       If
this  precaution   be  neglected,     the noise attending the excita
 tion of the fork vitiates the      experiment.    Subsequently to the
reading of my paper, it occurred to me that if the ordinary

view as to the functions of the two ears be correct, there must
be other ambiguous cases besides those already experimented
upon. To the right of the observer, and probably nearly in
the line of the ears, there must be one direction in which the
ratio of the intensity of sound as heard by the right ear to the
intensity as heard by the left ear has a maximum value greater
than unity.     For sounds coming from directions in front of
this the ratio of intensities has a less and less value, approach
ing unity as      limit, when the sound

In  like manner,   for directions intermediate between the direc

                          It might be supposed, for example, that
                                       ear is first affected.
  however, it appeared that the power of discrimination was not

  weakened, although the observer stopped his ears during the
  establishment of the sound.
     When one ear is stopped, mistakes are made between forks
  right and left; but the direction of other sounds, such as those
  produced by clapping hands or by the voice, is often told
  much better than might have been expected.
                 The Head    as an Obstacle to    Sound.
     The perfection of the shadow thrown by the head depends
  on the pitch of the sound.        I have already mentioned that it
  appears to make but little difference in the audibility of a pure
  tone with a frequency of 256, whether the ear used be turned
  towards or from the source.         But the case is very different
  with sounds of higher pitch, such as that of an ordinary
  whistle. The one that      I employed was blown from a loaded
 gas-bag, and gave a very steady note of pitch          f". A    hiss is
 also heard very badly with the averted ear. This observation
 may be made by first listening with both ears to a steady hiss
  on the right or left, and then closing one ear.          It makes but
 little difference when the further ear is closed, but a great dif
 ference when the nearer ear is closed.          A similar observation
 may be made on the sound of running water.
     For the same reason a hiss or whisper, coming from a
 person whose face is averted, is badly heard.              Under these
 circumstances even ordinary speech is difficult to understand,
 though the mere intensity of sound does not seem deficient.
                        º
                         Reflection   of Sound.
    In many cases sound-shadows appear much less perfect than
 theory would lead us to expect. The anomaly is due in great
 measure,    I believe, to an error of judgment, depending on the
 enormous     range  of            with which the ear is capable of
 dealing. The whistle of a locomotive is very loud at a distance
 of ten yards. At a mile off the intensity must be 30,000
 times less; but the sound still appears rather loud, and would
   robably be audible under favourable circumstances even when
 enfeebled in the ratio of a million to one.        For this reason it
is not easy to obtain complete shadows; but another difficulty
arises from the fact that there are generally obstacles capable
 of reflecting a more or less feeble sound into what might other
 wise be a nearly complete shadow.           An attempt to examine
 this point led me to a few simple experiments on the reflection
 of sound, which may be worth recording.

             Lord Rayleigh's Acoustical Observations.                       459
   The principal obstacle throwing the shadow was the corner
of a large house; and among the sources of sound tried were
the human voice, tuning-forks, whistles steadily blown, and a
small electric bell, of which the last (which was employed in
Professor Reynolds's acoustical experiments) proved to be as
convenient as any. The source was placed close to the south
side of the house, at a distance of eight or ten yards from the
south-west corner, while the observer took up a corresponding
position on the west side. With these arrangements the sound
shadow was pretty good, though far from perfect. When,
however, a flat reflector, such as a drawing-board of moderate
dimensions, was held at the proper angle by an assistant placed
at some distance outwards from the corner, the augmentation
of sound was immense, and the hearer realized for the first
time how very good the shadow really was.
   A screen made by stretching a “Times’ over a hoop about
 2} feet in diameter gave apparently as good a reflection as the
drawing-board; but when calico was substituted for the paper
the reflecting-power was very feeble.     By Wetting the calico,
 however, it could be made to reflect very well.          results #.
are in agreement, with the striking experiments described by
 Professor Tyndall.

                     Audibility of Consonants.
  I suppose   it must have been noticed before now that the s
sound is badly   returned by an echo.     Standing at a distance
of about 150    yards  from a large wall,           I
                                             found that there was
scarcely any response to even the most powerful hiss.      Sh was
heard a little better; m, k, p, g pretty well; r very well; h
badly; t badly; b. seemed half converted into p by the echo.
The failure of the hiss seems to be the fault of the air rather
than of the wall, for a powerful hiss heard directly -   at a dis
tance of 200 yards had very little s left in             it.
   Interference     of   Sounds     from two unisonant Tuning-forks.
   In  ordinary experiments       interference the sounds are only
                                         on
approximately       unison, and consequently the silences result

forks were placed at a distance of about ten yards apart, and
were provided with suitably tuned resonators by which their
sounds were reinforced. The pitch of both forks is necessarily
identical, since the vibrations are forced by electromagnetic
forces of absolutely the same period. The arrangement was
successful; and with a battery-power of two Grove cells sounds
of fair intensity were obtained. With one ear closed it was
possible to define the places of silence with considerable accu
racy, a motion of about an inch being sufficient to produce a
marked revival of sound. At a point of silence, from which
the line joining the forks subtended an angle of about 60°, the
apparent striking up of one fork, when the other was stopped,
had a very peculiar effect.
                        Symmetrical Bell.
  I  do not know whether it has ever been noticed that there
ought to be no sound emitted along the axis of a symmetrical
bell. It is easy to see that at any point of the axis any effect,
whether condensation or rarefaction, which may be produced
by one part of the surface of the bell must be neutralized by
other parts, and that therefore on the whole there can be
no variation of pressure during the vibration.       The experi
ment   may  be made with a  large glass bell (such as those used
with air-pumps), set into vibration by friction with the wetted
finger carried round the circumference.          the axis of the    If
vibrating bell be turned exactly towards the observer, the
sound is feeble as compared with that heard when the position
of the bell is altered. The residual sound may be due to want
of symmetry, or more probably to reflexion from the ground,
which last cause of error it is almost impossible to get rid                                of.

stalk, the necessary curvature of the paths would give rise to
an unbalanced centrifugal force tending to set the sounding
board in vibration. The force thus arising is indeed of the
second order, and might probably be neglected, were it not
that the apparatus is especially suited to bring it into pro
Inlinence.
  In order to test the soundness of this view as to the origin
of the octave, the following experiment was contrived. A
256 tuning-fork was screwed on to a resonance-box intended
for a 512 tuning-fork, and therefore approximately in tune
with the octave of the first fork. When a powerful vibration
was excited by means of a bow, the octave sound was predomi
nant, and but little could be heard of the proper tone of the
fork.   In order to place the two sounds on a more equal foot
ing, a resonator, consisting of a bottle tuned by pouring water
into it to a frequency of 256, was brought near the ends of the
vibrating prongs.          adjusting the distance it was easy to
arrange matters so that at the beginning of the vibration
neither sound had a conspicuous advantage.            But, as the am
plitude of vibration diminished, the graver tone continually
gained on          its
                rival, and was left     last     complete possession

actual note of the pipe, when blown in the ordinary way by a
wind of pressure measured by 2% inches of water, corresponded
to an effective length of 28 inches, so that the blown note was
actually higher in pitch than the note of maximum resonance.
So far, therefore, from the depression of pitch in an organ
  ipe below that calculated from the actual length, according to
    rnoulli's theory, being             due to the action of the
wind, it would appear that in the absence of a peculiar action
of the wind the depression would be even greater, than it                                                                 is.

mine their form, and gives rules for describing cycloidal and invo
 lute teeth. He then takes the question of the strength of teeth,
goes on to give rules for the construction and proportion of wheels,
and ends the chapter with some articles on screw-gearing.                   This
 very brief account of the contents of a single chapter will perhaps
 serve to indicate the sort of treatment which the subject receives
 at our author's hands, as well as to show how much is taken up
 directly with the question of strength, viz. about a fourth part in
 the case of the present chapter. A similar remark would apply to
other chapters.
    The work seems to have been executed with great care and with
an ample knowledge of the subject. It will doubtless be very useful
to students of mechanical engineering; and those whose interest
in mechanics is of a less practical kind will find a good many inter
 esting questions worked out clearly and accurately.
    The author of such a work as that before us has one great diffi
 culty to contend with. He is obliged to consider the extent of the
 mathematical knowledge which his readers may be presumed to
have; and in order to render his work useful to as large a class
as possible, he is obliged to take some things for granted which
admit of being proved.         What should be taken for granted and
 what proved is a question that must be settled by a sort of com
promise; and as the author may be presumed to have given it a
great deal of attention, his opinion, as expressed in the selection
that he makes, is primá facie entitled to great weight; we do not,
however, think that in the present case Mr. Unwin has been
always very happy. At                    all

thing is arbitrary unless the reader knows more than              he finds in
the book, whereas, if the author had gone back a single step, and
stated the connexion between Z and the moment of inertia of the
cross section, the reader would have seen that nothing more was
being assumed than certain geometrical results which are to be
found proved in many text-books".              On p. 54, and elsewhere,
Poncelet's formulae for      approximating    to V(a” + bº) are used, but
not a word is said to indicate the degree of approximation obtained
by them. When a student is informed that if a and b are un
known he may write 0.83 (a + b) for V (a’ + bº), he certainly
ought to be told that in doing so he is liable to an error of rather
more than a sixth part of the whole, either in excess or defect. A
somewhat glaring example of a formula given without the needful
explanations occurs on p. 31, where, in an article on Continuous
Beams, the author gives the equation which expresses the “Theorem
of Three Moments:” he states in connexion with the equation that
the bending-moments at the extreme points of support are zero.
Now, if the reader happens to know more about the subject than
the author tells him, he will be able to understand the article, and
will see that as far as it goes it is quite correct.             however,                           If,                      he
attempts           to
               use the    equation   with       more information than the  no
book supplies, we should feel             certainty         the result: e.g.,

of 250 millionths of an atmosphere; at 100 millionths it is 0-105,
at 50 millionths it is 0.093, at 20 millionths it is 0.068, and at 2
millionths it is 0.02. The force of repulsion in oxygen increases
very steadily up to an exhaustion of about 40 millionths of an at
 mosphere; it is at its maximum at about 30 millionths, and thence
declines very rapidly.
    Hydrogen gives a remarkable diagram.             The viscosity at the
normal pressure is measured by a log. dec. of 0.063; at 250
millionths of an atmosphere it is 0.057, at 100 millionths it is
 0.052, at 50 millionths it is 0.046, whence it rapidly sinks. The
force of repulsion increases slowly up to an exhaustion of 250
millionths, then quickly until it attains its maximum at about 50
millionths, and it then rapidly declines. The force of repulsion is
very great in a hydrogen vacuum, being in comparison with the
maximum in an air vacuum as 70 to 41. Neither is it necessary to
get so high an exhaustion with hydrogen as with other gases to
obtain considerable repulsion.        This shows that in the construc
tion of radiometers it is advantageous to fill them with hydrogen
before exhausting.
    Carbonic acid has a viscosity of about .01 at the normal pres
 sure, being between air and hydrogen, but nearer the former.               On
approaching a vacuum, the force of repulsion does not rise very
 high, and soon falls off.
    Before working with this apparatus                  I
                                                   thought that monohy
drated   sulphuric   acid evolved no     vapour,   and            I
                                                           therefore freely
used it for   cleaning  out the pump    and for  drying   the gases.        can      I
even now detect no         vapour-tension;     but a    comparison     of the
curves, with and without sulphuric acid, shows that the presence
of this body modifies the results. One of my curves represents the
action of the residual sulphuric anhydride gas. The experience
thus gained has led me to adopt phosphoric anhydride for drying
the gases.        I
                  can detect no        effects from the presence

learning the advantage of raising the whole apparatus to a high
temperature during exhaustion,                          I
                                            have used roasted mica lamp
blacked on one side for the     vanes;    for this purpose it is almost per
fect, being a good absorber on one face, a good reflector on the
other, a bad conductor for heat, extremely light, and able to stand
high temperatures. Many experiments have been tried with metal
radiometers, some of the results being recorded in previous papers
which   I have read before the Society; but being less sensitive than
pith or mica instruments,                     I
                                   had not hitherto worked much with
them.       I
            now tried similar experiments to the above, using the best
conductors of heat instead of the worst; and for this purpose thick                                                    }
gold-leaf was selected for the surface on which to try the action of
radiation.    An apparatus was constructed resembling a radiometer
with an    opening  at the top, capable of being closed with a plate of
glass. Through this               I
                             could introduce disks of any substance                                             I
liked, mounted in pairs on an aluminium arm rotating on a needle
point. The first disks were of gold-leaf, blacked on alternate sides.
After exhaustion, a candle repelled the black surface of cne of the
disks, but, to my surprise, it strongly attracted the black surface of
the other disk.           I
                      noticed that the disk which moved the negative
way was somewhat crumpled, and had the outer edge curved so as
to present a slightly concave black surface to the candle.                 soon                       I
found that the curvature of the disk was the cause of the anomaly
observed; and experiments were then tried with disks of gold and
aluminium—the latter being chiefly used as being lighter and stiffer,
whilst it acted in other respects as gold.

the opposite rotation to light, repelling the black surface.
    The plates were now folded across the vertical diagonal, the black
surface being still inside and the bright metal outside. The actions
with a candle and hot glass shade were similar to the last, but more
decided.
    The plates were now flattened, and put on the arms at an angle,
still being in the vertical plane. When the bright surface was out
side, scarcely any action was produced by a candle; but when the
lampblacked surface was outside, strong repulsion of the black was
produced, both with a candle and with a hot shade.
    The square aluminium plates were mounted in the experimental
apparatus, one being attached to the arm by the centre of one of
the sides, and the other by an angle. The opposite corner of the
one mounted diamond-wise was turned up at an angle. The outer
convex surface of the diamond plate was blacked, and the side of
the square plate facing the same way was also blacked, so that
either two black or two bright surfaces were always exposed to
the light, instead of a black and a white surface, as is usual in ra
diometers. As might have been expected, both these black surfaces
were repelled; but the turned-up corner of the diamond-mounted
plate proved so powerful an auxiliary to                   black surface, that   its
 strong rotation was kept up, the square plate being dragged round
 against the action      light. of

rate of one revolution in 6-95 seconds, the concave side being
attracted.
   These experiments show that the repulsive action of radiation
on the convex side is about equal to the attractive action of radiation
on the concave side, and that the double speed with which the fly
moves when no screen is interposed is the sum of the attractive and
repulsive actions.
   No. 1037. A two-disk cup-shaped aluminium radiometer, as
above, lampblacked on the concave surfaces.
   In this instrument the action of light is reversed—rotation taking
place, the bright convex side being repelled, and the black concave
attracted.
   That this attraction is not apparent only, is proved by shading
off the sides one after the other. When the light shines only on
the bright convex side no movement is produced; but when it shines
on the black concave side, this is attracted, producing rotation.
   No. 1038. A cup-shaped radiometer similar to the above, but
having the convex surfaces black and the concave bright.
   Light shining on this instrument causes it to rotate rapidly, the
convex black surface being repelled. No movement is produced on
letting the light shine on the bright concave surface; but good rota
tion is produced when only the black convex surface is illuminated.
   No. 1039. A cup-shaped radiometer like the above, but blacked
on both sides.
   With this a candle causes rapid rotation, the convex side being
repelled.     On shading off the light from the concave side the
rotation continues, but much more slowly; on shading off the convex
side the concave is strongly attracted, causing rotation.
   When either of these four radiometers is heated by a hot shade
or plunged into hot water, rotation is always produced in the
opposite direction to that caused by the light.       On removing the
source of heat the motion rapidly stops, and then commences in the
opposite direction (i.e. as it would rotate under the influence of
                                                         fly
light), the rotation continuing as long as the        cooling. Chilling

bounding surface of glass than would a concave surface.              In this
way the behaviour of the cup-shaped radiometer with both surfaces
bright, No. 1035, can be understood, and perhaps also that of Nos.
1038 and 1039. It would not be difficult to test this view experi
mentally, by placing a small mica screen in the focus of a concave
cup, where the molecular force should be concentrated. . But it is
not easy to see how such an hypothesis can explain the behaviour
of No. 1037, where the action of the bright convex surface more
than overcomes the superior absorptive and radiating power of
the concave black surface; and the explanation entirely fails to
account for the powerful attraction which a lighted candle is seen
to exert on the concave surfaces in Nos. 1035, 1037, and 1039.

     RESEARCHES ON THE METALLIC REFLECTION OF POLARIZED
                OBSCURE HEAT-RAYS.        BY M. MOUTON.
 I    HAVE     employed, in these researches, one of the apparatus ordi
       narily used by M. Desains for studying heat-spectra. Polarized
in a determinate azimuth, the light and heat traversed first a plate of
 flint glass suitably inclined to the plane of incidence, and intended to
   nnul the effects produced by the prism *. The pencil, reflected,
 then dispersed and analyzed, was finally resolved into a very pure
 spectrum, the luminous portion of which was directed to the slit of
 the thermoelectric pile. The breadth of this slit was 1 millim.;
 that of the red band of the luminous spectrum 4 millims, and the
 total extent of the luminous spectrum about 4 centims.
     I operated on three wave-lengths (A, A, A,) distributed in the
 obscure portion of the spectrum, and sensibly symmetric in refer
 ence to the extreme red;—A, of the yellow; A, of the blue-green;
 and A, of the indigo. The method of experiment rests on princi
        established by M. Jamin in his “Etudes de la réflexion métal
 É.ique de la lumière”t:—
     1. Every ray initially polarized in any other azimuth than zero
 and 90° becomes, after reflection, elliptic.
     2. After passing through a spar prism, of which only the extra
 ordinary image is utilized, an elliptic ray presents, when the prin
 cipal section of the prism coincides with the major axis of the
  ellipse, a maximum of intensity—with the minor axis, a minimum;
  and if we study these intensities in pairs of azimuths a and a +90°,
  going from the major to the minor axis, the first predominates over
  the second as long as a is comprised between the major axis and
  45°, becoming inferior to it as soon as a passes beyond that bisec
  trix of the axes. Thus the source of heat is only required to be
  constant during each pair of observations, a period which is ren
  dered very brief by a special movement permitting the analyzer to
 be rotated rapidly through 90°.       The azimuth of the bisectrices of
  of the axes of the ellipse can thus be determined within 1 degree.

  3. The azimuth of the incident vibration can thus be brought to
be such that the two principal components of the reflected vibration
will be equal. This azimuth is again determined by pairs of obser
vations whose only inferiority to the preceding is their not having
a constant sum (the source being so), but which, like them, have
the advantage of being swift, grouped in pairs independent of one
another, and terminated by two equal values of the galvanometric
deflections.

of the ellipse (the incident ray vibrating at 45°), by a the azimuth
of the incident vibration which renders the two principal reflected
components equal, by 3 the difference of phase produced by the
reflection, and, lastly, by   and                I            J

      ON THE DIFFUSION OF WAPOURS                                          THROUGH CLAY CELLS.

   The apparatus for the experiments in this investigation con
sisted essentially of a clay cell enclosed in a tin-plate box, and
connected with a cooling-apparatus and a vertical glass tube.                                                     A
moderate current of air passed through the box, while the vapour
flowed into the cell, and, striking past at the walls of   diffused                                  it,
reciprocally with the air         the box. The surplus vapour,

as  the air that had diffused through, passed into the cooling
apparatus, where the former condensed, and the air, saturated with
vapour      at
            the temperature          the room, flowed into the glass tube.

145°-3 and 136°6–144°-9 C., gave the result, that, while the ratio
of the volumes            of

gave for this ratio somewhat higher values than the numbers cal
culated from the theoretical vapour-densities. The deviation which
had been already observed from Graham's law                      not       equal           is           of

appear not improbable that the forces acting between the molecules
of  substances and their vapours, which with some vapours are
even more striking, may modify the square-root ratio, and that                                                    a

LXV.     The Influence      of Light upon the Electrical Resistance
  of Metals.         By Dr. R. BöRNSTEIN, Assistant in the Physical
  Institute, Heidelberg           University".
         object of the experiments described in this paper is to
THEprove      the more general occurrence of a class of phe
nomena which had hitherto been noticed only within narrow
limits, but which, nevertheless, were of such a nature as to
excite considerable interest among physicists in general. The
experiments are connected with the fact, which has been
noticed within the last few years, that the electrical resistance
of the metalloids selenium and tellurium diminishes if either
of these bodies be exposed to the action of luminous rays; and
they have shown that the same phenomenon occurs in the
..
case of metals—that is to say, in the case of platinum, gold,
and silver.   No other substances have as yet been examined;
but the    similarity   in the behaviour of these three metals
renders it extremely probable that sensitiveness to light is
not, as one was hitherto inclined to think, a property peculiar
to selenium and tellurium, but that we are here dealing with
a general property of            all
                               metals.
     oth these metalloids are          adapted for proving the phe

482        Dr. R. Börnstein           on the Influence    of Light
really due to light, and not to a rise of temperature, which
always accompanies any exposure to radiation. The metals
that have been examined differ from selenium and tellurium
in this respect, that their resistance invariably increases with
the temperature; and when they are exposed to light, the ob
served change in their conductivity arises from the differential
action of two causes, namely the direct action of light and
the rise of temperature; and the existence of the first of these
may be considered as proved beyond question, if the observed
change consists in a diminution of the resistance.
    Now, in the case of platinum, gold, and silver, phenomena
                                 º
have been observed which are exactly similar to those already
noticed in the case of selenium and tellurium ; and their detec
tion was effected by giving these metals such a form that the

much as possible        # the mass was exposed to the incident
luminous    rays.    For the             a collimating tube with a
slit was   employed,    a lens like that in use in spectroscopic
experiments, and a flint-glass prism of 45° refracting angle,
  laced in the position of minimum deviation for sodium
 ight. The achromatic collimating lens had a focal length of
260 millims., and a diameter of 26 millims.         In front of the
slit was a Bunsen burner, the flame of which was coloured in
the usual manner by means of a bead of salt on a platinum
wire. When an observation was to be taken without e
                               ..
sure to light, the flame was extinguished, and the slit was
covered with a piece of black paper.        In a few cases sunlight
was used—sometimes the direct rays, and on other occasions
the ray after  its  refraction through      prism being employed.

  In   order to  avoid  any  risk     error, two different methods
                                         of
of  measuring the resistance were employed—the measurement
by the Wheatstone bridge arrangement, and the measurement
ofa  resistance according       Weber's method
                               to                   “damped vibra
                                                          of
tions.” Among the experiments             few were also made with
                                              a
induced currents; and though they are inconclusive               re  as
gards the action     of  light, they are put forward with the rest
because they enable       us    draw some interesting inferences
concerning the action      of  a to
                                 current upon            its
                                                    conductor.            In
employing the first method, two equal metallic bodies were
simultaneously observed while one and then the other was
alternately illuminated; and the ratio               of
                                                  their resistances,
under these circumstances, was determined each time inde
pendently. This method              of
                                   procedure had this advantage,

that the two metallic bodies under comparison were, except
as regards the illumination, continuously under the influence
of identical conditions. The “damping” method did not per
mit of two metallic bodies being simultaneously observed, and
was therefore employed to determine the resistance of one body
at frequent successive intervals, during which it was alter
nately in the dark and under the influence of the luminous
 rays. This method afforded no security against any possible
influence which alterations of temperature, and other changes,
might have upon observations which succeeded one another
after any considerable interval of time. Nevertheless the ma
jority of the experiments have been carried out according to
this method, and far more favourable results have thereby been
obtained than with the Wheatstone bridge. The explanation
 of this lies in the fact that the “damping” method is much
better adapted for working with electrical currents of very
weak intensity; so that changes in the resistance, or other
 influences, can only very slightly affect the currents which
are employed in the measurement.      While in the first of these
 methods a Leclanché cell was employed as the electromotor,
 in the latter method the currents generated in the coils of
 the galvanometer by the oscillations of the magnetic needle
 were found to be sufficient; and it appears that just this par
 ticular difference between the two
influence on the results, and therewith

no doubt that this always took place in the interval between
any two consecutive inductive impulses; for the duration of
these currents was indefinitely small as compared with the
intervals of time which elapsed between them.               During the
whole time of the experiments the temperature of the room
increased from 13°7 to 14°3 C., and therefore could not have
been the cause of this observed increase in the resistance.
Since the same phenomenon was confirmed by a number of
further observations on other days, it appears conclusively
proved that
    The mere passage of electrical currents increases the resist
ance of the thin layer of gold by more than one per cent., the
effect remaining   for  the space  of about   one day.
              Experiments      by the   Damping Method.
    In seeking for a further method which would enable the
 sensitiveness to light of metallic plates, which were being
traversed by an electric current, to be observed in a manner
 free from any disturbing secondary actions, the object to be
 aimed at was to employ a current of minimum intensity,
without, however, diminishing the accuracy of the measure
ments.     It seemed as     if  this would be satisfactorily effected
 by employing the “damping” method due to W. Weber",
which consists in joining up the conductor, whose resistance
 is required, with a galvanometer, and observing the oscil
 lations of the galvanometer-needle.           In this way the metallic
 plate   under examination was only traversed by the feeble
 currents induced in the coils of the galvanometer by the
 swinging magnetic needle; and, except in the first few ex
 periments, the metallic plate itself was included in the circuit
 only at the moment when the deflections of the needle were
 being read. The disturbing influence of the current was thus
 reduced to a minimum: of course it was impossible to get
 rid of it entirely; and, moreover, this is not required for
 qualitative experiments, since, fortunately, it operates in the
 same way as heating would do, and thus can never be mis
 taken for the direct luminous effect.
    In the majority of the experiments carried out by this
method the source of light consisted of the flame of a Bunsen
burner, coloured with salt, the rays being sent as before
through the slit, prism, and lens, onto the metallic plate; on
a few subsequent occasions sunlight was employed.
    The experiments were made with gold, platinum, and silver.
 Gold was employed as before, in the form of strips of gold

leaf upon glass; platinum, as a very thin film, burnt in on
plate-glass, appearing of a grey colour by transmitted light;
and         in layers of varying thickness on plate glass, the
layers being of a bluish colour by transmitted light.          The
platinum held so firmly to the glass, that the thin connecting
wires could be soldered to it directly.     In the case of silver it
was necessary first to cover the points intended for the con
nexions with a galvano-plastic layer of copper; and then the
connecting wires could be soldered on to the layer of copper
thus produced.     The plates were then fixed to suitable stands,
so that the longer side, which was parallel to the line joining
the points of connexion, was vertical.           The illumination
invariably took place on the metallic side.
    The dimensions of the gold plates employed were 24 x 9
millims.; and they had a resistance of 3 mercury units.
Those of the platinum plates were about 50 x 16 millims.,
with a resistance of 175 units; while the dimensions of the
silver plates were about 65 x 17 millims., with a resistance
of 4.853 units.
    The experiments consisted in determining, by the above
method, the resistance of the metallic plate, first when unex
posed, and then when exposed to light.          Exposure to light
was thus found to produce a diminution of resistance, the
maximum of which amounted to 3, 4, and 5 per cent. for the
 respective resistances of the platinum, gold, and silver plates.
These values, moreover, did not by any means remain con
stant in different experiments, although these were carried
 out, as far as possible, under similar conditions. On the con
 trary, whenever, in order to ensure similarity in the external
 conditions, several experiments were made in quick succession
 with the same metallic plate, it always became less sensitive
 to light; in fact, in a few instances the opposite effect was
 eventually produced, just as if the rays were now only able to
 generate a rise of temperature.     The experiments always suc
 ceeded best when the     particular metallic plate had not been
 experimented upon for some days; and when, in such cases,
 the observations were continued for any length of time, it
 was very evident that, owing to the duration of the experi
 ments, the sensitiveness to light diminished, but again         in
 creased after every pause.       The same thing had also been
 noticed, but less distinctly, in the experiments with the
 Wheatstone bridge.        It might appear open to question,
 whether the cause of this phenomenon, which has come out
in the course of the experiments, is to be sought for in the
 electrical currents, or in the illumination, since both exerted
their influence simultaneously; but, on comparing the experi

490              Dr. R. Börnstein on the Influence of Light
mental methods here employed and the results obtained, we
shall see that in the first method, where the more powerful
currents were employed, there was, cateris paribus, a much
smaller sensitiveness to light; and we may therefore conclude
that
    The diminution of conductivity produced by the electrical
current, which was described above as an electrical after-effect,
is accompanied by a diminution in the sensitiveness to light.

therefore seemed desirable to test this point by experiment.
For this purpose the Wheatstone bridge was employed, and
the resistance of a thin metallic plate was compared with a
known copper-wire resistance.          In this case the electric cur
rent, which was generated by a Daniell's cell, was kept on
continuously, and every thing was so arranged that from the
commencement there was a small deflection of the galvano
 meter-needle.      This would necessarily increase whenever the
 resistance of the lamina increased, while a diminution in the
 electromotive force of the cell could only slightly diminish
 the deflection.     All the different specimens of thin metallic
 plates employed in the above experiments agreed with one
 another in the following phenomena.           At first the deflection
 increased, owing to the effect of the current—considerably in
 the case of silver, but less so in the case of gold and platinum;
 then, when a large copper soldering-iron, which had previously
 been heated to a dull red by a glass-blower's lamp, was
 brought near the plate under examination, the intense radia
 tion from it produced a considerable increase in the deflection,
  which, on the removal of the hot iron, diminished again very
  slowly, at       all

ent colours, in order to base thereupon some further infer
ences.  It is clear that experiments in this direction will be
of the highest interest as regards our knowledge of optical
and electrical phenomena.
  The results of this investigation are as follows:—
   The property of experiencing a diminished electrical resist
ance under the influence of luminous rays is not confined to the
metalloids selenium and tellurium, but belongs also to platinum,
gold, and silver, and in all probability to metals in general.
   The electrical current diminishes both the conductivity and
also the sensitiveness to light, of      conductor; and both    its                                  of

forming but one cumulate only; but in others a succession of
cumulates occurs, each cumulate becoming in turn a diapolyte.

resistance in the voltameter can be neglected in presence of
the resistance of the series and rheostat.
   (a) Calorimeter No. 1 including the series and the rheostat,
without a voltameter.—While, in each element, an equivalent
of zinc dissolves, the chemical processes develop a quantity of
heat which we will call k; at the same time the electromotive
force consumes a quantity of heat which is equal to 23000                                     º,
wherein d signifies, as before, the electromotive force of a
Daniell element.   The quantity of heat generated in the series
and the rheostat is          gw=              E.       For       the Daniell     element we

together the action of these three sources of heat, we obtain
                                          º:
the quantity k of the chemical heat, which alone, in this case,
determines the deflection of the calorimeter.
   (b) Calorimeter No. 1 including the series, the rheostat, and
the voltameter.—The quantity of heat expended for the chemi
cal decompositson in the               may be named a. The
total amount of chemical heat is therefore now k—a.       In the
series the quantity          of heat consumed is 23000
                                                                            E;      but in the
voltameter a quantity of heat 23000; is generated,                                    because
                           º
the electromotive force of polarization acts in the opposite
direction to the current. The galvanic heat developed in the
conductors        is   =          x 23.900.            Putting together the action
of   all
       these sources    heat, we get the sum k—a, which

electromotive             force.     Because            it can     be    assumed            that      the
entire resistance is included in No. 1, a quantity                                     of galvanic
heat   =              x 23900 is developed there.                            The sum of the
actions     of these three sources of heat becomes k—23900

If this quantity of heat be compared with that which was ob
tained in the first case (a), the comparison shows that, through
the insertion of the voltameter, the calorimeter No. 1 suffered
a loss     of heat =23000, although it cannot have given up its
heat to that calorimeter.   A source of heat is produced in
No. 2 by the electromotive force of polarization acting in the
opposite direction to the current.  The heat thus produced is
                                          is,   equal                             of                      by

      In   Favre's experiment               it   was shown that the loss                    of  heat      in

 higher production      heat than the calculation required                                                 is,
 that    the calculation the resistance of the voltameter was
           in
 supposed equal     nil, which cannot
                            to             quite correct. There    be
 was therefore really present     the voltameter   in
                                                    small source                   a

              Galvanic Pile, and Electromotive                   Forces.        503
the small difference mentioned.        Consequently calorimeter
No. 2 could not but     indicate, as it actually did, a somewhat
greater development of heat; and hence we are perfectly
justified in asserting that theory and experiment are, within
 the limits of errors of observation, closely accordant with each
 other.
    6. Sir W. Thomson and, subsequently, Bosscha made the
 following experiment * :-Two equal voltameters are filled
 with the same quantity of sulphuric-acid water, and then suc
 cessively inserted in the circuit of a powerful galvanic series.
 The electrodes in one of the voltameters both consisted of
 platinum ; but in the other the positive electrode only was of
 this metal, while the negative consisted of amalgamated zinc.
 Although the same current passed through both voltameters,
 and consequently an equal amount of chemical decomposition
 took place in each, yet the temperature        rose much more
 rapidly in the voltameter which has zinc for the negative
 electrode than in the other.       Bosscha regards the unequal
 elevations of temperature in the two voltameters as occasioned
 by the power of the zinc to transfer hydrogen from the active
 to the ordinary state being different from that which platinum
 possesses in this respect.
   I   have repeated this experiment, and obtained the same re
 sult.   By applying the mode of representation No. 2, it is
 easy to find the cause of the different elevations of tempera
 tion. There is in each of the voltameters an electromotive
force which acts in the opposite direction to the current of the
series.    In the voltameter of which both the electrodes con
sist of platinum this force originates exclusively from the
polarization of hydrogen and oxygen.           In the other volta
meter oxygen is separated at the platinum, and hydrogen at
the zinc ; but, besides the polarization hence arising, this
voltameter acts also as a pile, in the opposite direction to the
current.     That the platinum-zinc vessel develops a greater
counterforce than the other vessel, one can easily convince
one's self by first inserting the one vessel in the circuit of the
current, and then withdrawing it and putting the other in                        its
place.    One then finds that the current        the seriesof  con         is
siderably more enfeebled           by
                                the platinum-zinc vessel than by
the other.     The quantity       heat arising from the current
                                    of
passing  in   the opposite direction          to
                                          the electromotive force
which acts    in the two voltameters, must         that account be

                    the platinum-zinc  vessel than     the other.   in

phenomena      in  the pile,      as

                                               made, an unequi
vocal proof is obtained that heat is developed when the current
passes through an electromotor in the opposite direction to
the acting electromotive force.
   Two equal test-tubes of glass  (A and B) were filled with
the same volume of water   containing  sulphuric acid ; and in
each of these tubes two  platinum   wires and a thermometer
were immersed.   All four wires were cut off from the same
piece; and the two thermometers were also alike.                            The wires
and the thermometers     passed through the corks with which
the tubes were closed, and were thereby kept undisturbed in
position during the experiment.    One of the wires in the tube
A was connected with one pole of a Bunsen series of from
four to six elements ; the other wire in the same tube was put
into connexion with a commutator which

which two brass springs slide.       When one of these springs is
connected to one end, and the other spring to the other end
of a conductor, the current in this circuit is incessantly
changing     its
               direction       as

form currents by the consumption of heat.         In the same

arise through the diminution of the intensity of the inducing

     that contact electromotive force can be absolutely independent
     of the chemical affinity between the substances which are in
     contact with one another.
          Since, in order to explain the thermal phenomena in the
     hydroelectric pile, we are compelled to assume that the elec
     tromotive force found in it consumes heat when a current
     passes through in the same direction as that in which the
      force acts, but generates heat if the current has the contrary
      direction, we must also admit that the same thing must also
      happen at the surface of contact between two metallic con
      ductors at which an electromotive force is present, and, there
      fore, that the explanation which                        I
                                                  have given of Peltier's
      phenomena", may be the only true one. I will therefore not
      dwell further upon the objections which were raised against
      the correctness of that explanation.         In connexion therewith
     I   have sought to prove that the thermoelectric force arises
      from the dependence of the contact electromotive force on
      temperature f.        In consequence, however, of the reasons
      alleged by Prof. Clausius f this view of mine has not met
       with general recognition.       I will therefore take leave here to
       subject Prof. Clausius's arguments to a brief examination.
           9. In reference to the origin of thermoelectric currents,
       Clausius urges, in the memoir cited, that it is in the
       highest degree improbable that the attraction of the mate
       rial molecules for electricity should change with the tem
         erature; and if this were not the case, the distribution of
         eat would have no influence at                       all

      e will imagine two different conductors M and N in con

an electrical molecule in                     its
                                immediate vicinity must depend

We will now assume that the molecule              situated on the            m   is

increased.    Now this may take place by the vibration-period
diminishing while the amplitudes remain unaltered or even
become smaller than before.     When the last-mentioned takes
place, the action of the attraction-force which tends to carry
the electric molecules from N to M becomes feebler at the
higher than at the lower temperature; and hence there results
in the thermoelectric ring a current running in the contrary
direction to that current which is produced by a smaller tem
  erature-difference between the two junctions.      Herein is to
|.  seen the cause of the known alteration of the current
direction shown by several metallic combinations with great
difference of temperature between the junctions".
   If, therefore, it be admitted that the electric fluid consists
of the luminiferous aether, it may be regarded as proved that
contact electromotive force must vary with the temperature—
a relation which, besides, has been, in my opinion, practically
demonstrated by Le Rouxf.

  LXIX.      On a Modification of Mance's Method of measuring
       Battery Resistance.      By OLIVER      J. Lodge, B.Sc."
                                [Plate V.]
            modification here suggested consists simply in using
THE     a  galvanometer    and condenser instead of a galvanome
ter alone, so as to detect variations in difference of potential
instead of variations in current.
    Ily  this change it is converted into a strictly null method.
 Moreover it is now possible entirely to get rid of the effects of
variations in the electromotive force of the battery, which are
very annoying in any of the ordinary methods and prevent ac
 curate measure. This is accomplished by breaking the galva
nometer-circuit the instant after the battery is short-circuited.
 Fig. 1 (Pl. W.) is a diagram of the connexions for measuring
the resistance of the battery d, with the keys shown on a large
scale: m partially short-circuits the battery when depressed;
n closes the galvanometer and condenser circuit unless de
pressed.     The two keys are electrically independent; but the
stand of the upper one is balanced so as to rest partly on the
 spring of the lower one (which must be strong). On depress
ing the upper key, the first effect is to close the circuit marked
 r at the point ºn ; the second, and immediately succeeding,
 effect is to break the circuit marked g at the point n.           The
same    object  would be    accomplished      more  conveniently  by a
single double-contact key made on purpose, as shown in fig. 4. .
The object of the double key is fully explained below. A B C D
represents a box of resistance-coils; a and b are large and
equal resistances; and c will be equal to d, the resistance of
the battery, whenever the galvanometer-needle is unaffected
by pressing down the keys.
                Resistance-measurements      in general.
    Consider the arrangement of six conductors joining four
  oints (commonly known as the Wheatstone's bridge) as form
ing the edges of a tetrahedron or triangular pyramid (fig. 2).
It is obvious, (1) that, as far as position is concerned, every con
ductor has precisely the same properties as any other, and (2)
that any one conductor is adjacent to four of the others and
opposite to the remaining one.        Call the resistances of pairs of
opposite ones a and c, b and d, r and g, and let electromotive
forces be caused to act, in any manner through any of them ;
then it can be shown that when ac=bd, r and g are “ conju
gate conductors,” or that variations in the conductor r have
no effect whatever on the current in g, and vice versá, no

matter whether these variations are simple changes of resist
ance or the introduction of new electromotive force.

batteries at r has any effect on a galvanometer at g, one can
observe whether the relation ac-bd is or is not fulfilled, and
can change one of these resistances until it          For the case                    is.

 possible to measure any resistance whatever without the pas
 sage of a current through the resisting body, although it is
 quite easy to measure an electromotive force without any cur
 rent circulating through the electromotor, so, although a
 current of constant strength is sufficient to give a measure of
 the resistance of a homogeneous conductor, such as a metallic
 wire of uniform material, or a homogeneous liquid, or anything
 else which contains no internal electromotive force, yet a vari
 able strength of current is necessary to determine the resis
 tance of an electromotor.
    And the reason of this is apparent, viz. that the opposition
 experienced by a current in passing through an electromotor is
 of two kinds—one due to the proper ohmic resistance, the other
 due to the electromotive force; and with only one strength of
 current it is no more possible to tell how much of the opposi
tion is resistance and how much is electromotive force, than
it is to obtain the values of two unknown quantities from one
equation.     We may either take two measures of the strength
of current and then eliminate one of the unknown quantities
 algebraically, or we may use a contrivance (like Mance's
method) by which one of them (viz. electromotive force) is
 eliminated electrically ; but two strengths of current are just
as essential in the latter case as in the former, as also it is
just as necessary that the two unknown quantities shall remain
 constant.    It is possible that the resistance, as well as the
electromotive force, of a battery does not accurately fulfil this
 condition, but that it varies to some extent with the current;
in so far as it does this, however, it is not a definite thing, and
is incapable of accurate measurement.
   I  have entered into this matter at some length because the
slip in Maxwell is getting repeated in other books (cf. Cum
ming's admirable ‘Introduction to the Theory of Electricity,'
p. 162); and it is as well to get clear on the subject.
    The difference of potential required to force a current of
strength C through an electromotor of resistance R and internal
electromotive force e is
                            E= RC+.e.
  Various methods may be applied to measure E and C.; but
no observation of a single value of E and C can determine R
unless   e           Another observation with a different value
             is known.
of E and C must be made; and then e can either be eliminated
directly, or one can employ an indirect means of effecting
its elimination, provided     remain constant.

galvanometer; but variations in e (due to the changed u),
which would produce the same effect on the galvanometer, no
matter how much the resistances were balanced, have no time
to take place before the galvanometer circuit is broken; and
then no further change has any effect.   This works very well
in practice; and the resistance of a cell can be really deter
mined when producing a current through a definite resistance,
viz. a+b+c+d.      This cannot be done accurately by any other
method that I know of.

   The method may be applied to determine the resistance of
electrolytes in
                   fººl    A long tube containing the electro
lyte surrounded by a jacket of water at a known temperature
is interposed in the battery circuit d, the battery being one
whose resistance is small and can be depended on; and the re
sistance of the two together, battery and tube, is measured.
   The tube is then removed, and the resistance of the battery
determined alone ; the difference of course gives the resistance
of the electrolyte in the tube. The tube can then be filled
with mercury and the measurement repeated. The amount of
polarization of the electrodes is of no more consequence than
the electromotive force of the battery, provided the gas given
off is not allowed mechanically to obstruct the current; and
the effect of variations in its amount are reduced to a mini
mum by the method just described for the battery.        It is well
to make the tube end in a couple of globular receivers with
two necks, very much like Dewar's electrometer, and to plunge
large electrodes into these globes (see T, fig. 4). Their position
in the globes is not of very much consequence; neither is a
bubble or two of gas on their surface; the principal part of
                                                                             .
the resistance is offered by the liquid in the tube.     If a ther
mometer is   kept in each receiver and the   liquid  be allowed to
flow backwards and forwards through the tube once or twice
before observing,             its
                       temperature may               be

 The Amateur Mechanic's Practical Handbook, describing the different
   Tools required in the Workshop, the Uses of them, and How to Use
   them; also Eramples of different kinds of Work, with full De

THIS        book
       different   kinds of work, particularly metal work, such as an
amateur mechanic is likely to undertake. The principal tools
which he is supposed to have are a lathe, a drilling and planing
machine, as well as vice, bench, and hand tools. He is expected
to be able to use them : e.g. he should be able to turn a crank
shaft, bore out a cylinder, cut a screw, and make a universal chuck.
He should also be able to make drawings and patterns. Although
it is scarcely worth the trouble, yet, at a pinch, our amateur ought
to be able to make his own iron castings. The case is different
with brass castings; by making them he will save both time and
money. He is supposed to be well off for space; for he should
have a separate room for pattern-making,         When thus furnished
he will be prepared to execute works of considerable difficulty,
such as to make a horizontal engine; and accordingly a chapter is
devoted to describing the process.      The boiler, however, is a more
difficult matter; so this may be “selected.” Still, “if you are at a
loss for a job, you will find it some amusement to make a boiler
yourself;” and therefore instructions are given for making a
vertical boiler. For though “horizontal boilers may be used,” yet
when the size is small “they do not answer so well as the upright
ones.”     When all is made, the amateur will have his reward; “he
lights the fire in his boiler, turns the steam on, and excitedly looks
for the first turn of the fly-wheel. If the engine be a success, he
will in that one turn of the fly-wheel pass one of the pleasantest
moments of his life.”
   It  will be seen that our author is enthusiastic about his pursuit;
still he gives his amateur some very good and sensible advice: thus,
he tells him how to profit by a visit to a mechanical engineer's works,
and, again, advises him to learn not only how to mend his tools,
but even for the most part to make them. This advice, if followed,
would in many cases save his readers a good deal of money, by
enabling them to find out whether they have in them the genuine
spirit of the amateur mechanic: “Buy but few tools at first, you
will soon find out your wants as you go on. Make as many as
you can ; and with diligence in using them, and exercising care and
patience, in the course of twelve months you will find yourself
amply repaid for your trouble.” Very true!          If you are not pre
pared to make and mend your own tools, you have not the root of
the matter in you, and had better give it up.

   This short memoir completes the geological descriptions, by the
Geological Survey, of the area directly bordering the estuary of the
Thames, and is supplementary to the author's longer memoir on
the Geology of the London Basin, 1872. It is also the first
memoir issued by the Geological Survey which notices the Crag
Formation, so rich in fossils, and valuable as a source of the phos
phatic nodules and fossils, called “coprolites,” used in making
artificial manures.
   The London Clay and its cement-stones come to be first de
scribed ; then the Red Crag of Beaumont, Walton-Naze, and near
Wrabness and Harwich, is carefully noticed, in brief, both from
the author's recent observation on its dwindling remnants, and
from the results of the long-continued researches of the Messrs.
Wood, Prof. Prestwich, and others. The old gravels, sands, and
brick-earths, and the later alluvium, blown sand, and shingle, also
receive attention.     In noting the physical features of this clay

Huggins, D.C.L., LL.D., F.R.S.
   In
    the year 1863 Dr. Miller and myself obtained the photograph
of  the spectrum           of
                       Sirius.
   “On the 27th January, 1863, and          the 3rd March on   the same                of
year, when the spectrum          this star (Sirius) was caused

the  spectrum,  though tolerably defined at the edges, presented no
indications of lines. Our other investigations have hitherto pre
vented us from continuing these experiments further; but we have
not abandoned our intention of pursuing them”.
     Ihave recently resumed these experiments by the aid of the
18-inch speculum belonging to the Royal Society's telescope in
my possession.     Considerable delay has arisen from the necessity,
for these observations, of a more uniform motion of the driving
clock.     For this purpose, Mr. Howard Grubb has successfully
applied to the clock the control of a seconds' pendulum in electric
connexion with a sidereal clock.       This system works quite satis
factorily.
   The prisms employed are made of Iceland spar, and the lenses
of quartz.     After an extensive trial of different photographic
processes, preference has been given to dry plates.
   The apparatus is so arranged that a solar or electric spectrum
can be taken on the same plate, for the purpose of comparison,
with the spectrum of the star. Spectra have been obtained of
Sirius, Vega, Venus, the Moon, &c.

the arrangements of the special apparatus which has been con

  After exposure to the light of Vega, the dry plate was allowed
to remain in the instrument until the following morning, when
a solar spectrum was taken upon it through the half of the slit

the star.

gerald, M.A.
    At   a meeting of the    Dublin Scientific Club on Monday the 6th
November, Professor Barrett           gave the Club an account of Mr.
Kerr's experiments on the rotation of the plane of polarization of
a ray of light when reflected from the surface of the end of a
magnet, to which additional interest was attached by the reading
of a letter from Mr. Kerr to Professor Barrett giving an account
of the mode of making and of the last results of his experiments.
                        I
At the time proposed trying whether any similar effects would
be produced by reflection from the surface of a crystal of quartz
cut perpendicularly to the axis, as was led to think there might  I
be, owing to the similarity of the rotatory polarization of quartz
and of substances under magnetic action.                 Following out that
         I
clue, obtained the following explanation of Mr. Kerr's experi
ment, and was enabled, through Professor Barrett's kindness in
helping me to verify my recollections of Mr. Kerr's letter, to make
sure that my theory explains the facts.
    Faraday has shown, in the nineteenth series of his experimental
researches, that a ray of plane-polarized light, when transmitted
through any solid (diamagnetic?) transparent medium under the
action of a powerful magnet, has the plane of                     polarization                  its
             in                            positive current must circulate
rotated      that direction     which          to in
                                                                 a
round the ray        order  in produce       magnetic force       a  the same                     in
direction       that which actually exists
                  as                                 the medium. Verdet,   in
however, discovered that           certain ferro-magnetic media (as, for
                                                  in
instance,    astrong solution        perchloride       of

                                    is   in                the current which         to
would produce the magnetic force.

gives this explanation      the  following
                                         in words:– “A        plane-polarized
ray falls         on
                the medium.       This      equivalent         two circularly

polarized rays, one right- and the other left-handed (as regards the
observer). After passing through the medium the ray                still plane                   is
polarized, but the plane         its polarization

                                           is

the medium.                 In
                     other words, the right-handed ray has performed
a  greater number        vibrations, and therefore has

of the right-handed ray is less within the medium than the left
handed, or that the refractive index for right-handed rays is greater
than for left-handed in a medium that rotates light to the right.
Hence, from what Verdet has shown, it appears that, in a ferro
magnetic substance, for a ray of light travelling from the south to
the north pole, the magnetic                  action        is such as to make the refractive
indew    for right-handed circularly polarized rays          less than for left
handed ones; for in this case the plane of polarization is turned
to the left, for it is a right-handed current that would produce the
magnetic force.
    By applying this to the case of light reflected from the south
pole of a magnet, we get what                          I
                                         believe to be the true explanation
of Mr. Kerr's interesting experiment.             In like manner, as in the
case of a transmitted ray,                    I
                                    consider the incident plane-polarized
ray to be the resultant of two circularly polarized ones, one right
and the other left-handed.           Now, for the right-handed one, the
refractive index at the surface of the south pole of the magnet,
being a ferro-magnetic substance, is less than for the left-handed
ray.    Hence if each of the two circularly polarized rays be sup:
posed to be the resultant of two plane-polarized rays, one polarized
in the plane of incidence and the other at right angles to                      the                             it,

the direction of the rotation that would be produced, if iron were
transparent, from Mr. Kerr's experiment.
   It would be quite easy to deduce the difference of the refrac
tive indices of iron for the two circularly polarized rays if we knew
the amount by which the plane of polarization is turned; but it
would be necessary to employ MacCullagh's or Cauchy's formulae
for the intensities of the reflected rays; and these are so compli
cated that it is hardly worth while going through the calcula
tions, as the effect Mr. Kerr has observed seems only barely obser
vable.
   Similar effects must, of course, occur in the cases of diamagnetic
substances,   organic solutions, and quartz; but the amounts in
these cases would be entirely beyond the range of observation of
our present instruments; for in quartz, for instance, the difference
of the refractive indices of the two circularly polarized rays is only
0-00008.

were soldered so as to connect the wires with a Wheatstone

   On dividing the latter values by the former, it was found that
the increase per unit of resistance for a stretching force of 1
gramme on a cubic centimetre of each wire was nearly the same for
wires of the same material, but differed with wires of different
materials. The mean increase per unit of resistance was
                      for the  steel wires 1875.5x107".
                      for the iron    ,    2132.2 x 107”,
                 and for the brass    ,    2244.9 x 10-11,
the greatest departure from the mean value being
                     for the steel less than 27 per cent.,
                     for the iron about 3.0 per cent.,
                and for the brass about 8.5 per cent.
    The temporary increase of length which a cubic centimetre of
each wire would experience on being stretched with a force of
 1 gramme      was then calculated from observations which had
been made in the usual manner with the cathetometer;               this
increase of length was found to vary
    in the case of 3 steel wires from 5082×107" to 5665× 107".
    in the case of the iron wires from    4896×10"     to 5938 x 107",
and in the case of    1 brass wire was 10120x107".
     On dividing the increase per unit of resistance for a stretching
 force of 1 gramme on a centimetre of the material by the increase
 of length produced by the stretching force, so as to obtain the in
 crease per unit of resistance when the wires are stretched 1 centi
 metre, a mean value of 3:525 was obtained for the steel wires,
 3.951 for the iron wires, and 2.203 for the brass wires—thus
 showing that, though the increase per unit of resistance for a
 given stretching force is greater in brass than in iron or steel,
 the increase per unit of resistance for a given lengthening of
 the wire is much greater both in iron and steel than in brass.
     The torsional rigidity of the wires was next ascertained by the
 method of vibrations, several trials being made with different
 lengths of each wire; the results for different lengths of the
 same wire agreed very closely indeed.
    From the values of torsional rigidity and the increase of length,
 the diminution of section was calculated for a cubic centimetre of
 each wire when stretched with a force of 1             mme, assuming
the wire to be isotropic.        Next the increase of resistance which
 would result from mere lengthening of each wire and diminution
 of section was determined, and it was ascertained that, on sub
 tracting this latter value from the total observed increase of
 resistance, there was a considerable residue in the case of the
 steel and iron wire, also a residue not so great in the brass.
 This residual increase of resistance probably arises from increased

space in the line of flow of the current between the particles of the
wire produced by the stretching force.
   The conclusions to be drawn from the experiments are:—
   1. That the temporary increase per cent. of resistance of a wire
when stretched in the same direction as the line of flow of the
current is exactly proportional to the stretching force.
   2. That the increase per cent. of resistance, when a cube of
each material is stretched by the same weight, is greater in iron
than in steel wire, and greater in brass than in iron; also that
the increase is nearly the same for different specimens of the same
material.
   3. That the increase per cent., when a cube of each mate
rial is stretched to the same extent, is mueh greater in iron and
steel than in brass.
   4. That there is a residual increase in each case over and above
that which would follow from mere increase of length and diminu
tion of section; that this residual increase is much greater in
iron and steel than in brass, and greater in iron than in steel.

   The following          paper was     read:—
   “On Stratified Discharges.—III. On a rapid Contact-breaker, and
the Phenomena of the Flow.” By William Spottiswoode, M.A., F.R.S.
   In a paper published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society,
vol. xxiii. p. 455,           I
                       have described a form of contact-breaker de
signed for great rapidity and steadiness of action. It consisted
of a steel rod which vibrated under the action of an electro
magnet.     As regards sharpness of break and steadiness of definition
in the striae, this instrument left little or nothing to be desired.
But, as explained in the paper above quoted, an alteration in the
current not only affected the steadiness directly, but also reacted
on the break itself.      The effects due to an alteration of the
current alone    thereby became masked, and the study of the laws
relating to such changes was rendered more difficult, or altogether
impracticable.      In order to obviate this inconvenience        devised        I
another form of contact-breaker, in which the vibrating rod and
electromagnet were replaced by an arrangement purely mechanical
in   its action, and therefore entirely under control.

found necessary.          In many of the experiments accordingly from
10 to 20 of the smallest Leclanché cells usually made were em
ployed with the small, and from 20 to 50 with the large coil.
     But these were afterwards replaced by a double fluid battery
suggested by my assistant, Mr. P. Ward, and described at the
end of this communication.
     For some time the experiments were conducted with the platinum
 spring resting on the wheel; and the effects were varied by
 altering either the pressure of the spring or the velocity of the

times compressed and at others dilated, the phenomena always
maintained their characteristic features.
   The condition of the striae here described, whether flowing or sta
tionary, may be comprised under the general term “steady;” and
when there is no motion in either direction, they may be speci
fically denominated as “stationary.”
   Two questions here presented themselves:—First, what are the
conditions necessary for the production of steady striae 2 Secondly,
what are the conditions and circumstances of the advance and
retreat, in other words, of the flow of steady striae 2
   With a view of ascertaining the nature of the distinction between
the ordinary and the steady striae, careful observations were made
with the revolving mirror. It having been noticed that when
the wheel break moved slowly ordinary or irregular striae were
produced, and that when it moved rapidly steady striae resulted, it
seemed probable that the latter effect might be due to the short time
of contact, and to the consequent absence of many of the features
described in Part II. of these researches.              This          fact, identical      is,     in
with the    suggestion     there  made,    that the  fluttering    appearance     was

to the entire distance between two contiguous striae, when it will
apparently be reduced to zero; the striae will then again appear
stationary.    Experiments appear to confirm this view of the case.
   Experiments were next instituted with a view of ascertaining the
connexion between the flow and resistance. Starting from a con
dition of current and break for which the striae were stationary, it
was found that an increase of resistance, introduced generally in
the primary circuit, produced a forward flow, i.e. from the posi
tive towards the negative terminal, while under similar circum
stances a decrease of resistance produced a backward flow.         Fur
thermore, if after producing a forward flow the resistance be
continually increased, the flow after increasing in rapidity so as
to become indistinguishable by the unassisted eye, gradually appears
to become slower, and ultimately to reverse itself, in accordance with
the law suggested above.
   Another form of contact-breaker was also occasionally used.
The principle upon which it was based was the sudden disruption
of a thin film of conducting liquid by a discharge between the
electrodes  of a circuit.   The mode of effecting this was to make
one electrode terminate in a platinum plate fixed in a horizontal
position, and supplied with a uniform film of dilute sulphuric acid;
the other in a platinum point, the distance of which from the plate
is capable of delicate adjustment by means of a screw. Electro
motive force required for this break is not less than that of 5 cells
of Grove.
   As soon as the current passes, the fluid between the plate and
point will be decomposed and electrical continuity broken. This
done, the fluid flows back again, and continuity is restored. By
a proper adjustment of the supply of fluid and of the distance of
the electrodes (the latter varying from '05 inch to .001 inch), the
number of disruptions may be made to attain 1000 per second.
   The currents delivered by this form of break are exceedingly uni
form, and the effects produced are quite equal in delicacy to those
produced by the electromagnetic or by the wheel break.
   The elements used in the battery to which allusion was made in
the early part of this paper are zinc and carbon. The zinc is
immersed in dilute sulphuric acid in the proportions of 1 volume
of acid to 7 of water; and the carbon in a saturated solution of
bichromate of potash with 1 volume of sulphuric acid to 7 of the
solution.   The carbon and bichromate solution are held in a
porous cell.
   The absence of nitric acid permits this battery to be used in a
room; while the fact that the zinc is attacked only when the circuit
is complete, renders it unnecessary to lift the plates out of the fluid
when not in use, as in the bichromate battery. The only limit to
the time during which this battery may be left untouched, appears
to be the period when the bichromate salt finds its way into the
outer cell, so as to attack the zinc independently of electrical action.
But this does not take place to an extent materially to affect the
action for some months.

   1. “On the Upper Limit of the essentially Marine Beds of the
Carboniferous System, and the necessity for the establishment of a
‘Middle Carboniferous Group.”        By Prof. E. Hull, F.R.S., F.G.S.
   The author, in this paper, divided the whole of the Carboniferous
rocks into successive stages from A to G inclusive, taking the Car
boniferous beds of Lancashire as a type, and showed that these
stages could be identified over the whole of the British Isles.       It
was only recently that their determination had been made in Ire
land, so that until now the materials had not existed for a complete
correlation of the series in the British Islands.   The following is an
abbreviated statement of the      representative  stages in descending
order:-

    Palaeontological               Results.-On making
                                          a census of the Molluscan
and other fossils from the various stages above that of the Carboni
ferous Limestone (Stage B) as determined by the Palaeontologist
of the Geological Survey, some interesting results were obtained,
showing the prevalence of marine conditions up into stage E, and a
general change in the character of the fauna in the succeeding
stages.  Including only the area of the British Islands, it was
found that no fewer than 37 genera, with 74 species, of decidedly
marine forms, occur in the Gannister-beds (Stage E), of which                                                           all

  2.   “On    Coal-pebbles and their Derivation.”                            By H. K. Jordan,
Esq., F.G.S.
   In this paper the author endeavoured to explain the mode of
production of pebbles of coal in the clays and sandstones of the
South-Wales Coal-field and elsewhere, the occurrence of which had
been long since noticed by Sir William Logan and Sir Henry De la
Beche. His opinion is that the pebbles in question are derived
either from the seam of coal above which they are found, or from a
seam of coal which formerly existed in the same, or approximately
in the same position, and which has been destroyed by erosion, the
effect of strong currents of water, which distributed the grains of
sand and other materials upon the coal-seam.

542                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
    I have made use of a simple plate           of glass having a breadth of
1 decimetre       and a length of 1:5. Semi-silvered glass has great
reflecting-power, and yet remains very transparent; it presents
merely a slight brown shade.
    It is known that M. Foucault advised the investing with this
semi-silvering the objectives of telescopes for viewing the sun, in
order to arrest nearly the whole of the rays of obscure heat”.
    When the glass is silvered, washed, and dried, the silver (which
might be removed by the slightest friction) is fixed by coating the
glass with a transparent varnish.            For this purpose it is heated to
about 40°, and the following varnish is poured upon the silvered
face:—alcohol, 100 cubic centims. ; mastic tears, 10 grams.                     The
thin film of resin which adheres is very transparent and has a
very even surface.         The reflecting-power of the glass is slightly
diminished, but is still sufficient.          The silvered surface could be
covered with another glass plate ; but this would give rise to mul
tiple reflection, which is avoided by using the varnish.
    The glass is then fixed, when the varnish is dry, by one of                                                  its
edges,   in   a nipper fitted          foot, permitting various inclinations

     NOTE ON THE SENSATION OF COLOUR.                                     BY C. S. PEIRCE.
  It  may, perhaps, be worth while to notice a few consequences of
three theories concerning colour which are usually regarded with
some favour.
   First Hypothesis-The appearance of every mixture of lights
depends solely on the appearances of the constituents, without
distinction of their physical constitution. This believe is estab                   I
lished.
   Second Hupothesis.-Every sensation of light is compounded of
not more than three independent sensations, which do not influence
one another. This is Young's theory. It follows that, if we de
note the units of the three elementary sensations by i, j, and k,
every sensation of light may be represented by an expression of
the form
                                                 Xi+Y}+Zk.
   Third hypothesis.-The intensity of a sensation is proportional
to the logarithm of the strength of the excitation, the barely per
ceptible excitation being taken as of unit strength.  Negative loga
rithms are to be taken as zero. This is Fechner's law. It is known
to be approximately (and only approximately) true for the sensation
of light. From this it follows that, if                                  a.,             be
                                                                                y,
                                                         the relative           z
proportions                     three lights giving the elementary
                                                    of
sensations       i,  j, of
                    mixture
                          k, a
                    the sensation produced      the mixture            by                          is
                       I          log   a  .   i+J logy.j+Klog             z.       k,
where      I,   J,   K,
                are three constants.
  From these   principles     follows that,    itlight giving any   if a                                 sen
sation such    that  just
                     as   written have      intensity increasedits                                      in   any
ratio   the resulting sensation will
           r,                                              be
           I     log   ra. +J log ry.j-i-Klog rz.                    k
           =Ilogar.           i-H i

Thus the result     increasing the brilliancy
                             of                    any light must              of                              be

          the sensation      variable amounta      constant sensation,   of    a
I    J j+ Kk; and
     i-H                                all
                           very bright light will tend toward the
same colour, which may therefore        called the colour be brightness.                      of
Moreover,    the three
                 if     primary   colours    mixed      the proportions
                                                                 be                 in

and can only differ     more    less.
                                      by             or
     Now  find

                                          illuminated with the same
homogeneous light, uniformly over each, but unequally       the two,                           in

                    different colours.

If we          have the means               of varying the wave-length of the light
which illuminates the fainter rectangle, we can improve the match
between the two, by bringing the fainter toward the yellow.

which they will never cross—a point a little more refrangible than
D and having a wave-length of 582.10-" mm., according to
Ångström's map. If both rectangles be illuminated with this light,
the fainter appears white or even violet; but if it be varied in wave
length with a view of improving the match, it will be found to
return to the same point with the utmost precision.
    It appears, therefore, that, if our hypotheses are correct, the
colour log r (I i +J.j+K k) is like that of the spectrum at A=5S2,
only that it contains less blue or violet, and is consequently of
greater chromatic intensity.                                 -
    It further follows from Fechner's law that, if any light be gra
dually reduced in brightness, one element of the sensation will
disappear after another—and that when very faint it will exhibit
only one primary colour, which is the one which it contains in
greatest proportion relatively to the proportion in the light which
has the colour of brightness. Now although this does not seem
to be exactly the case, yet we do get some approximation to                                                           it.
It   istrue that any light whatever, when sufficiently faint, appears
white, owing           the self-luminosity
                           to                        the retina. We cannot  of
therefore, unfortunately, get sight              the primary colours  of        re                               by
ducing the light         three parts
                               of          the spectrum. But we may,

match any less-refrangible light.             We may therefore say that                                               a

experiments that the photometric susceptibility of the eye is the
same for all colours. The result, however, is uncertain, because
it may be that R is chiefly due to other sources of error than the
limitation of sensibility; still the experiments show as small a
value of R as is usually obtained.       shall endeavour, by further        I
observations, to obtain a conclusive result.
   A further consequence of our hypotheses will be reached by dif
ferentiating the expression for a light-sensation.  We have

plate, A=0.01.24, K= 100-5.          The ordinate-unit is the half of a
wave-length; the unit of length, the centimetre.
   After these researches the question naturally arose, Are these
phenomena to be attributed, as Neumann thought, to a regular
action exerted upon the glass mass by the outer layers at the time
of       its
       solidification?        regard  In this         to
