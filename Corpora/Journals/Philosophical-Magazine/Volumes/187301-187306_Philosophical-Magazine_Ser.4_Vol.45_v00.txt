 brations are shown to be in the ratio of         1:2   (Pl. I. fig. 3).
 If we take    organ-pipes  of other  intervals, we get with the fifth
 three flames above two, with the fourth four above three, and so on.
    The rapidity of the motion of the flames allows their reflections
 in the mirror to be very sharply defined; but as they are of
 very short duration, it would be difficult in this experiment to
 observe trifling deviations from the purity of the intervals; for
 although in point of fact it is easy to recognize that in one of
 the series there are almost always two flames when there is one
 in the other, yet it would be difficult to discover that about 200
 in the one series coincide with about 101 in the other.           These
 exact observations can be made with the       greatest  facility,  how

 ever, if we make the two capsules of the two corresponding organ
 pipes act on the same flame.
        If
        we sound two organ-pipes, exactly tuned to an octave,
 while the gas streams from their two capsules into the same
 burner, the flame has the appearance of containing within it a
 smaller one without motion. By the slightest discord, how
 ever, the latter becomes flickering, and lengthens and shortens
 periodically within the greater one.       Each of these double
 movements composed of ascending and descending shows a
 fluctuation, either the deviation           of the upper tone by a
 double vibration, or of the lower by a single vibration from the
 pure interval of the octave.
     The fifth (2:3) shows three, the fourth (3:4) four, the third
  (4:5) five points of flame one above another, whose mutual
 position remains unchanged with the perfect purity of the                                                        in
 terval; on the contrary, any deviation from this causes an up
 and-down movement among them of each single point, which
 takes the appearance of a waving motion.

those positions where the long flames are at their longest, the
short flames are at their shortest, and vice versd.
   In fig. 4, Pl. I. the picture of the seventh (8: 15, or 8: 16–1)
shows this process, although in a very short period. The fifth
(2 : 3) shows a period of three, the fourth (3:4) of four, the
third (4:5) of five, and the second (8: 9) of nine in the
range of the increasing and then decreasing flames.
   If  the proportion is not of the form n : n + 1, then there
takes place in the whole period not only a rise and fall of the
flame-summits, but the curve connecting them shows as many
elevations and depressions as the difference between the two
ratios.     For example,   see the      picture of the sixth (3   : 5)   (fig. 4,
Pl. I.).
   The more complicated the interval of the two notes, the more
carefully we must bring it into perfect purity of tune, until no
further movement whatever can be discerned in the flame,
because otherwise the recurring periods of the flame-pictures in
the mirror suffer continual change by the change of phase, and
in that case it becomes difficult to recognize them.    But this
exact tune becomes still more imperative if we wish to combine
more than two notes while making them act on one flame.        It
will be remarked, besides, in these experiments, how difficult it
is to retain absolutely constant notes with organ-pipes, even
when we make use of a well-regulated bellows.
          Coexistence   of two   Tones in the same      Air-column.
   The investigation of the combination of two related tones in
one flame-picture is especially useful, because it teaches us from
the flame-picture of a combination of tones, of which the com
ponents are unknown, to find the single tones of which it is
composed.
  A passage to the trial of such a combination of tones as, e.g.,
each sound offers, is the combination formed by a fundamental
with a known overtone in the same air-column.        Very suitable
for such an experiment is the above described closed organ-pipe
with three flames, since the mode of the fundamental as well as
one node of the first overtone are situated at their ends.
    If we blow the fundamental (1) very gently, the flame
picture in the mirror shows the vibrations of this tone; if now
we blow the overtone (3) strongly, each single vibration will be
replaced by three flames.   With a rather weaker blast both tones
are produced together, and we always see three flame-summits
over every fundamental flame (fig. 5, Plate I.). Therefore several
tones present at the same time in the air-column give exactly
the same flame-picture as the combination of the same tones
when each is produced by          its
                               own particular organ-pipe.

                             Representation      of Sounds.
     The apparatus which is used for the representation of sounds
 consists simply of a manometric capsule, before the membrane
 of which there is a small cavity terminating in a short tube
 (fig. 6).  The sounds to be represented must be conducted into
                                       Fig. 6.

 without undergoing any change in their passage.
    The sound-pictures of the combined tones of the same instru
 ment are never        all
                    alike, but the deepest tones always show much
 larger and more complicated flame-groups for each single vibra
 tion    the fundamental than the higher ones, because the high

pipes, the upper notes which are contained in the sound of a
lower note have so high a place in the scale for a high note
that they produce no effect, either on the ear or on an artificial
membrane.
     The lowest note of the violin, for example, is g (192 vibrations),
and its 8th harmonic  g (1536 vibrations) is within the range
of the instrument.   It is produced on the G-string by a length of
4, and on the E-string by about 13; centimetres.    Nevertheless,
if we take this very g as fundamental tone, the length of

too late for the Exhibition;   but                          I
                                      was able to exhibit them at the
Meeting of the Association of Natural Philosophers at Dresden
in 1868.          I
               delayed their publication until now because I wished
to revise them with precision, but was always prevented by the
delicate state of my throat, which did not permit me such
fatiguing experiments.      But now, since       can no longer hope        I
to  recover, I have used  my  best endeavours to make the pictures
correct, and give them forth, not indeed as absolutely perfect,
but as nearly so as it was possible for me to make them.
    The drawings themselves are much more difficult than might
be supposed, particularly of the large flame-groups of the deeper
notes, not only on account of the evanescence of the pictures,
but also because the flame-summits do not always follow each
 other, but are partly situated beneath one another, so that it
 appears as though different flame-groups were intermingled, or
 rather pushed partly one before another.          But these flames,
 whose background, so to say, is formed by other flames, easily
 escape observation, particularly if the back ones are not so high,
 nor the front ones so low, that the bright summits of the latter
 stand out upon the blue lower parts of the former. We can
 indeed, by a rapid rotation of the mirror, separate      the summits                        all
 from each other; but then the whole group becomes difficult
 observe,      on
               account                      its
                              great length and the great bending

the flames.

   The characteristic tone of U approaches therefore to the third
overtone of D and E, to the second of A and B, and to the fun
damental a and b; and in point of fact in the flame-groups of D
and E we can perceive a forking into three, in those of A and B
into two chief divisions; while the flame-pictures of a and b show
a great preponderance in intensity of the fundamental over the
accessory tones.
   The characteristic tone of O does not approach any of the
overtones of the sounds that are sung (except C) nearer than
about half a tone; therefore it has but little effect on the flame
pictures.    At a, where it approaches the second, and at d, where
it approaches the third overtone, we perceive clearly the forking
into two and three parts respectively; but the more complicated
groups of A, F, and D do not show any particular prominence
of the tones 4, 5, and 6. This was to be expected, as the air in
the mouth cannot strongly vibrate if          pitch,                its

visable to employ a mirror placed in an oblique axis on which it
would be turned, and would then show the flame-picture in a
continuous circle instead of broken bands.
   The voiceless sibilants F, S, and CH give the same unsatisfac

the method first practised by Zoch (Pogg. Ann. vol. cxxviii.)—for
measuring the number of acoustic wave-lengths contained in a
given tubet, the idea occurred to me that could use the method            I
for the determination of the variation in the number of wave
lengths contained in this tube caused by a change in the tempera
ture of the air which it contains, and thus succeed in readily
determining any temperature to which the tube might be exposed.

of pyrometry, and the facility of    application, can      its

     This paper is intended only to give a general account of the new
 method of pyrometry; and therefore            I  have not touched on the
 details of apparatus and experiment.                      I
                                                 These will present in a
 subsequent communication, in which accounts of actual applica
 tions of the method will be given.          I may, however, here remark
 that if the tube in the furnace is 13 metres long and 0.015 metre
 in diameter, it can be coiled into a spiral 0.5 metre in dia
 meter, or into two spirals each of 0.25 metre diameter; or the
 tube can be bent on itself several times and thus form a compact
 fascicle of tubing.       Also the tubing should ascend from the re
 sonator to the furnace-tube and descend from the latter to the
 manometric capsule, so that the rarefied air in the hot tube can
 not enter the tubing outside of the furnace.                If the serrations
                              º
 of the manometric flames are too dim to be            readily  observed, they
 can be rendered      distinctly  visible even in broad      daylight  by pass
  ing the gas through a              tube containing tow saturated with
  benzole.     I have thus been     able to exhibit these phenomena at
  night to an audience in a room brightly illuminated with many
 gas-jets. We can also make the vibrating flames brilliant by
  sifting into them the fine scrapings of lead-pencil.
     In ascertaining the number of displacements produced by any
  elevation of temperature, the furnace-tube is slowly moved into
  the furnace, so that the displacements of the resonator-serrations
  can be counted as the tube gradually attains the highest tempe
  rature, when the serrations become stationary.

                                      It     isthat when sulphurous acid
comes into contact with one              the  high      of

this action; and          not  it uncommon thing
                                     is           an          see this experi      to

relates     sulphuric

excused for bringing forward results which differ      some degree                      in
from those of the  above-mentioned   workers.
  It    generally understood
          is                      the present day that  at    action                               no
can take   place between   dry  sulphurous    acid and nitric acid
gases when brought together         the same vessel; and    in                                           in      all

                       Sulphuric Acid-manufacture.              25
chemical treatises this fact is distinctly stated. Thus Miller,
in his “Elements of Chemistry,” speaking of the theory of the
manufacture of sulphuric acid, says:—“ Direct combination,
however, cannot be produced between the two gases (oxygen and
sulphurous acid); the intervention of a third substance becomes
necessary, and if water be presented to them a very gradual pro
cessof oxidation occurs.”
   Gmelin also, in his ‘Handbook of Chemistry,” observes:—
“A   dry mixture of two measures of sulphurous acid gas and one
measure of oxygen remains unaltered; but if water be present, a
very gradual condensation takes place, and sulphuric acid is
produced.”    The results arrived at by different observers may
be summed up in the deduction from the above paragraphs—
namely, That no action can take place between these two gases
without the intervention of water, either in the liquid or gaseous
state.
    Itwas with the intention of inquiring more closely into this
that the following experiments were made; and the conclusion
I  come to, and which         I
                            hope to clearly demonstrate in this
paper, is the very reverse of that generally admitted—That
action does take place between the dry gases under certain con
ditions.
    As   I
         was anxious to have the gases in as similar a condition
as  possible to those in the lead chamber, the sulphurous acid
was made from burning sulphur, the nitric acid being prepared
from nitrate of soda by the action of sulphuric acid, whilst the
air employed was first carefully dried by passing through sul
phuric acid and caustic potash, every care being taken to prevent
the presence of even the smallest amount of moisture.
   Eap. I. When dry sulphurous acid and nitric acid in the

gaseous form are brought into contact in a perfectly dry glass
vessel, which is then hermetically sealed, there is apparently no
action (for this experiment I used a vessel of the following
shape); but if this mixture, after being allowed
to stand for ten or twelve days, be then opened,
and the remaining gases expelled, it is found
that a decided, though small amount of sulphuric

acid has been formed over the sides of the glass vessel, and may
be seen in the condition of white crystals, soluble in water, and
behaving in      all
                  respects      sulphuric acid. There are many
                                  as
things which will prevent this formation, and which         Iintend
noticing further on, such     temperature &c.
                                  as             This result, how
ever,    greatly hastened          by
                                 the addition      of
                                                    single drop  of

                                     arrive   was that these crys
                                              at
tals were merely the ordinary chamber crystals; but         was led

to doubt this from various circumstances.    In the first place,
they seemed to differ from the chamber crystals in form, these
partaking more of the needle-shaped form of the crystals of
sulphuric acid; and also, when exposed to the air, they remained
a long time (several days in fact) without change.    This shows
they are not the same as the chamber crystals. Again, when
they were brought into contact with water, they dissolved
without the evolution of nitrous fumes, from which we may
fairly conclude that they were crystals of sulphuric anhydride.
     I had long been inclined to take a different view of the
cause of this action from that generally accepted.        It seemed to
me, in       all    its
                  phases,               to
                              resemble the action          small piece               of   a

to  find what effect water present       large quantity had upon

mixed gases was put into     glass vessel and allowed

a certain amount of nitric acid still remaining untouched.    In
both  cases, however,  the result, in appearance, was a complete
combination.    Still, on examination, a large amount of nitric
acid was found in solution in water in No. 1 (Exp. IV).
   Exp. VI. Equal volumes of steam and mixed gases were then
tried, and the result on examination gave—
                                                    Acid produced, cal

   From these experiments, then, I considered myself justified
in adopting the theory of the leavening nature of the action
taking place.
   It is also evident that the volume of steam introduced should
be less than the combined volumes of the two gases.     But let
us take another case. Suppose the temperature of the vessel in
which the experiment is to take place be raised to 100° C., or
kept in boiling water, the results are found to differ in every
case.

Here, then, is quite another phase opened up to us: tempera
ture has a great deal to do with the action taking place; and,
as the result of many experiments,     find that           I

 be embodied     the general rule, that “The higher the tempera.

   The foregoing results thus show the action occurring when
nitric acid gas   brought into contact with sulphurous acid gas,

both with and without the presence       steam. The next question

  and also an inquiry into the best form of chamber to be used in
  the manufacture of Sulphuric Acid.
  In  the preceding page the following observation is made
when speaking of the laboratory method of showing the theory
of sulphuric acid-manufacture:–“ Near to the deposit, and
long after the ruddiness has apparently disappeared, a very
small narrow band of red fumes is noticed wherever the crys
tallization has taken place.” This, then, when taken into con
sideration along with exp. X. in the same section, tended to lead
me to the belief that the greatest amount of condensation takes
place at the bottom of the chamber, near the surface of any sul
phuric acid which has been already formed, and that the upper
portion of the chamber is of use principally as a reservoir for the
gases; so that         if,
                        instead       having of long high chamber, one

                As is naturally expected, the largest amount of sulphurous
            acid is present at the entrance to the chamber; but dispersion
            takes place very rapidly indeed, so that each 10 feet makes a
            decided change   in the percentage of acid present.
               The amount of sulphurous acid present at a distance of 10
            feet from end of chamber is equal to 72 per cent., continuing
            the same till about 20 feet from end.     There is then a rapid fall
            to 46 per cent. at 30 feet, falling rapidly still, till at 40 feet from
            end the amount only equals 31 to 33 per cent.            After this the
            variations are not so remarkable;   the amount of     sulphurous   acid,

                 The ordinary funnel-shaped collector usually placed in the
            chamber, and which communicates with a small leaden jar on
            the outside, by which a manufacturer gets an idea of the strength
            and make of his acid, was brought into use. Instead of being,
            as usual, placed about 8 feet from the bottom of the chamber, it
            was in this case placed about 16 feet high, and the amount of
            sulphuric acid formed was carefully observed.
                In this case, after standing nine days, only tº of an inch of
            acid had formed, whilst at the height of 4 feet the make of acid
            was regular and fairly large.
                In the former case (at 16 feet) sulphurous acid was continu
            ously escaping, whilst the amount in the latter was merely tri
            fling. This, then, was a very fair proof of the truth of my theory.
                                                          Sulphuric Acid.
               Passing from the sulphurous to the sulphuric acid,        find the                                        I
            diagram of percentage in the latter a very strange one. At 10
            feet from the point of entrance, where 0 is the percentage of
            acid, to 140 feet the variation at 15 feet in height is very trifling.
            The highest amount is reached at 50 feet, showing there only
            23 per cent.    But at 3 feet the analyses present a more extra
            ordinary difference than that of Diagram I.
               Beginning again at 10 feet from entrance, I find the amount
            of acid to be equal to 81 per cent. ; then a sudden rise brings it
            to 89 per cent., this being the maximum; then comes a most
            rapid and continuous fall, till at 100 feet the amount is 30 per
            cent., and remains nearly at this to the end of the chamber.
               The following diagrams will show the variations.

striking. It is only required to place the white line in Diagram I.
on the dotted line in Diagram II., and vice versd.        In No. I.
the greatest amount of sulphurous acid is at the top of the cham

very simple.
    Ifwe have two series                   of    waves superposed,                       each      of    which         is

       Hence becomes evident the remarkable fact which, it seems
    to me, has not yet been duly recognized, that with the lower
    values of R the magnetizing-function has an ascending course,
    and with a certain value of R reaches a maximum.                   We
    see further from these Tables that with a very long and thin
    rod, if it is magnetized by a force not too great, the magnetic
    moment increases not as is usually assumed, nearly proportion
    ally, but much more rapidly, and between certain limits of the
    force is nearly proportional to the cube of                                 it.
       This  is    to       be
                        seen even from some        Joule's experimentst,  of
    whose    attention, however,  was  chiefly directed     the permanent              to
    magnetism          of
                     the rod.    Further, Wiedemanni remarked that,
    with rods     ofmoderate thickness, the magnetic moment increases
      little more quickly than the magnetizing-force.      From the series

sulting for k. In conformity with the foregoing, this was to be

simultaneously with *—although                                          M. Riecke            is more inclined to

    Before passing to the proper measurements, I will give an ac
 count of two preliminary experiments, which I made for the
 purpose of ascertaining the regular course of the phenomenon
                                                               -
 and to test its accordance with theory.
    If we leave the magnetizing current i unchanged, from equa
 tion (1) it follows:–1, that the induced electromotive force
increases proportionally with the number of the secondary turns;
2, that it depends only on the number, and not on the quality,
of the turns.
    Lenz found similar laws by experiment when investigating the
induced currents excited in a spiral wire enclosing an iron cy
linder as soon as the cylinder was pulled away from the pole of
a powerful steel magnetº.      Theoretically, however, these laws
can only be derived under the assumption that the cylinder is
infinitely thin and longt.
   I  conducted the current of a Daniell’s series through the pri
mary wire of the ring.      Divisions 100, 150, 200, and 250 of
the secondary wire were connected with each other and with a
galvanometer of great deadening force.        The connexion was
made in various ways, so that the numbers of effective turns were
respectively 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, and 700. As the resist
ance of the secondary circuit remained unaltered, the deflections
observed on the galvanometer when the primary current was re
versed were proportional to the induced electromotive forces.
The mean numbers of these deflections, each from eight obser
vations,    were:—
 with 100 turns,          200, 300,     400, 500,      700,
  = 47-2 scale-divisions; 94'4; 140°4; 189; 236'4; 329-9.
   Starting from the number 3299, the others are found by cal
culation to be
           47-13, 94.26,   1414, 1885, 235-6.
   When the divisions were so combined that the number of
turns running in one direction was equal to the number in the
opposite direction, I obtained on the reversal of the current the
small deflections + 1-5, which are probably to be attributed to
the imperfect homogeneousness of the iron mass or of the                              pri
mary turnst.   When 150–100–50 turns were employed,                                   the
magnet remained perfectly at rest.

   Similarly it was proved that the form and other conditions of
the secondary turns are without influence.        When        I
                                                           caused a
thicker wire to  run,  in 50 wide and   irregular  turns, round the
ring, and formed a secondary closing out of this wire, the oppo
                                                               I
sitely directed division of 50 turns, and the multiplier, obtained
a sensible deflection on reversing the primary current.
   Generally the consecutive induction-impulses are very constant,
if only  the precaution is taken to turn the commutator several
times after each change of the magnetizing-force before com
mencing the observations, as the first deflections are influenced
by residual magnetism.
    Ipass now to the proper measurements of k and R.
    As we have seen, it depends upon ascertaining the ratio              º of
the induced electromotive force to the intensity of the inducing
current.     For this purpose, according to the strength of the
latter, various methods were employed.
   With stronger primary currents, the arrangement shown in
fig. 3 (Pl. III.) was adopted. The current of a galvanic apparatus
K   (mostly 4–12 Daniell’s elements, for more powerful currents
12–14 Bunsen) was conducted through two commutators (C,
and C.), the primary wire P of the ring, and a circular roll of
wire (lt) of known dimensions.         This roll, intended for the
measurement of the      primary  current, is placed perpendicular to
the magnetic meridian, eastward of a magnetometer (M); the
axis produced of the roll meets the middle point of the magnetic
bar.   The distance of the latter from the centre of the roll was
mostly fixed at 1000 or 1250 millims.
  Moreover the magnet M is now surrounded by a multiplier with
close windings. Through this multiplier, provided with a damper,
the induced currents are conducted.        That is to say, the con
ducting wire of the multiplier is either wound in several turns
round the ring, or connected with the above-mentioned divisions
of the second layer of wire upon the ring.        Lastly, W is a Sie
mens’s   resistance-scale,  by  which the   primary   current can be
weakened.     The observation was effected with scale and telescope.
   The constant current in the roll R imparts to the magneto
meter a certain deviation from the magnetic meridian.        By turn
ing the commutator C1, the current in the primary wire P only
is reversed.   Thereby an induction-shock is produced in the mul
should have been altogether independent of whether a current passed
through the turns and in which direction. This, however, was far from being
verified when I placed the ring close beside the galvanometer—which   again
intimated the before-mentioned want of homogeneousness.        At  all
                                                                     events

        it    its usual place.

   In every observation, the temperature of the air close to the
multiplier was noted; and a second thermometer was applied to
the second layer of the ring, which with more powerful primary
currents was considerably heated by contact with the primary
wire. The resistances were reduced to the readings of the two
thermometers; and herein the increase of a resistance w (of cop
per) with a heating of 1°C.could be supposed equal to 0-00387 wº.
   The number above denoted by m, which specifies in what ratio
the action of the multiplier was more powerful than that of the
roll (the currents in both being equal), was measured once for all.
For this purpose the current from a galvanic apparatus was con
ducted through the roll; a known portion of the same current
was sent through the multiplier by means of a derivation of
simall, accurately measured resistance.    There was found m =
2414 for the case in which the roll was 1000 millims. distant
from the suspending thread of the magnet.      From the constants
of the roll to be given below, the corresponding number m could
be calculated for the case in which the distance was different.

than the one above described, because they must furnish more
accurate results, provided that the form of the ring be verified
with equal exactness*.   It has not yet been possible for me to
complete my work in the directions mentioned.
   The closer investigation of this subject might present many
and various points of interest.    On the one hand, a deeper insight
would be   thereby  gained   into the essence of that molecular pro
cess which we designate as the magnetization         of a substance.
From the facts here considered it seems to follow that the hypo
thesis of the existence in iron of convertible molecular magnets, in
the form in which it is developed by Webert, does not correspond
to the course of the phenomenon with feebler decomposing forces.
On the other hand, more exact knowledge of the function k might
be of practical utility, especially in the construction both of elec
tromagnetic motors and of those magneto-electrical machines of
a newer kind (those of Wilde, Siemens, Ladd, &c.) in which the
temporary magnetizing of iron plays so important a part.

this research was carried on, and who kindly assisted me with

      had long been observed that a certain number of solutions
      —for example, of nephritic wood (lignum nephriticum)—
possessed the property of giving, in incident light, a peculiar
reflection, quite different from the colour presented by the
same bodies in transmitted light.     Brewster and Herschel were
the first to recognize that this property extended to a great
number of substances; they thought to explain             the one                it,            by

tive.   Only the rays beyond B can be excluded from the num
ber of those which produce fluorescence; at least I know of no
substance which is fluorescent in that portion of the spectrum.
But when we consider that the light emitted by fluorescence is
less refrangible than the exciting rays, we can well understand
how it is that fluorescence excited in the extreme red is not
visible to our eyes.
 . As regards the greater or less extent of fluorescence in the
spectrum, great differences are found between different sub
stances.  There are cases in which fluorescence commences in
the violet,   after the line G–for example, fluor spar, and a
 solution which          I
                     first studied and which must contain bisulph
 anthrachinon; while in other cases it extends nearly through
the spectrum, as takes place with ethereal and alcoholic solution
 of chlorophyl, alcoholic solution of naphthaline-rose and thio
melic acid.     In the direction of the extreme violet, fluorescence
 always extends beyond the group H.
    In respect of intensity in the different parts of the spectrum
 this remarkable fact presents itself—that in a great number of
 cases several different maxima of fluorescence are observed, sepa
 rated by bands of relative minimum. These maxima are not
 all equally marked; the difference           brightness between them
                                                     of
 and the minima likewise varies.
    The number               of
                        these maxima also         very variable.
                                                             is       Thus,

five with solution        lampblack

absorption in addition to that corresponding to the fluorescence.

    Spectra of the Light emitted by Fluorescence, or Fluorescence
Spectra—I have given particular attention to the study and
description of fluorescence-spectra, which are presented under
the most varied forms.               I
                                   shall here notice only those which
appear to me of special interest.
    The different kinds of light already known to be emitted by
fluorescence present the greatest variety in their colours, accord
ing as they are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, or violet; but
it is only by spectral analysis that an exact idea can be obtained
of their composition.
    It is moreover established that there are very great differences
in the breadth of the fluorescence-spectrum.                 That of chlo
rophyl has the least breadth; it is so narrow that we might
almost suppose that the light thus emitted is a homogeneous
red. Those of thiomelic acid, fluor spar, and others, on the
contrary, exhibit a very great breadth; the fluorescence-spectra
of these substances include rays belonging to the different
portions of the spectrum from the red to the violet.
    An interesting point to note            thatis,       great number
                                                                in   a                  of

but pass gradually into one another; and the dark bands are
not absolutely black, but more                  or

a fluorescence identical in appearance with that of the former
solution, similar intermissions are hardly to be distinguished.
    It might be supposed that the interruptions in the spectrum
projected upon the surface of a fluorescent substance correspond
to the intermissions of                 of its
                               fluorescence-spectrum, the one being

   When a substance is fluorescent in the solid state, does it ne
cessarily follow that it must also be so in the liquid state, and
vice versd?    The answer to this question differs according to the
different substances.                 -
   There are substances, as the double cyanide of platinum and
                                                                                               all
barium, which are fluorescent in the solid and not at                 the                      in
liquid state. There are others, such              nitrate      uranium, as                of
which       solids give
             as             very intense fluorescence, and

         I do not intend here                  to launch into                   a   criticism of the different
 theories by which it has been attempted to explain fluorescence.
 I will merely affirm that mone of those theories is adequate to
 account for the immense variety of the phenomena, and that it
 will be long before any future theory will be so.
    The ideas expressed by Stokes are still at present the best
 basis for an attempt at a theory of fluorescence. Thus we must
 admit with him that the undulations of the aether which strike
                                           set

 War Department Weather Maps. Signal-Service, United-States Army.
                        Friday, November 22, 1872.
    We have received the three maps of the above date, 7.35 A.M.
 4.35 P.M., and 11 P.M. Washington time respectively. An improve
 ment has been introduped, particularly in the insertion of the
 Oceanic Currents with their velocities per hour.          The land sur
 face is coloured green, the principal mountain-ranges shown, and
 elevations above 8000 feet left white.          A distinction is made
 between surfaces above and below 800 feet, the former being
 darkly shaded, the latter lightly. The ordinary isobars, isotherms,
 state of weather, &c. are shown as formerly.
     One of the latest results of the operations of the American
 Signal-Office, as reported in the ‘New York Herald, Nov. 16, is
 the discovery of a vast acrial wave which passed over the States in
 November.       It originated in the Pacific Ocean, and was traced    di
 stinctly over the whole breadth of the continent; so that America as
 well as Western Europe has a “great November wave.” The
 American storm-warnings in connexion with this wave were issued
 from two to three days in advance.
     The issue of three maps daily is of great advantage, as it con
 tributes so much more efficiently to an acquaintance with atmo
 spheric changes, than by an issue of one map daily.          The weather
 maps of the English Meteorological Office are of great utility; but
 this utility would be greatly increased by two additional maps being
 issued daily, for 4 P.M. and midnight. Probabilities, as on the American
 plan, could then be deduced with more or less success, either officially
 or privately by subscribers.
 The Atmosphere of the Sun.        The Rede Lecture, 1871. By J. Nor
          MAN LockYER, F.R.S.        London: Macmillan and Co.
    This Lecture contains a résumé of the work effected by Mr.
 Lockyer in connexion with Dr. Frankland, relative to their joint
 researches on Solar Physics, an account of which has for some
 time been before the public.      The lecture, which is well conceived,
 is based upon Newton's query of the sun and fixed stars being
 great earths vehemently hot, from which vapours and exhalations
 arise and are compressed and condensed by the vast weight and
 density of their atmosphere. .
     The remarks of Mr. Lockyer, bearing on the reply to Newton's
 query, are of somewhat a desponding character, inasmuch as they
 allude to the more than century and half century that the world
 has had to wait for the “outcome" of the splendid genera
 lization by which the proof has been obtained, that the sun and
 fixed stars are undoubtedly “vehemently hot.” Nor is his tone
 more encouraging towards the close of his lecture; for in speaking
 of our witnessing the birth of a new science, he says it is one
 which requires costly apparatus and appliances above the means
 of most individuals, with thoroughly organized work extending over
 centuries.    How then is the science of the sun to progress 2

Do    some liquids, such as alcohol, act as nuclei            by combining with a
      portion of the water of              the solution and liberating a little salt

   Exp. Supersaturated solutions of sodic sulphate were prepared,
in the manner described, in 2-oz. flasks, which were closed with a
plug of cotton-wool through which a bulb-
                                                                                          -
tube was passed, of the form figured *, con
taining absolute alcohol.
    After waiting some time to be certain
that nuclei had not gained admittance, some
of the alcohol was run out on to the surface
of the solution by momentarily loosening the
stopper.
   This experiment was repeated many times,
at different temperatures and with alcohol of
various strengths; but never did the alcohol
act as a nucleus.
   Previously to the experiment the alcohol
had been boiled to destroy nuclei.
   Erp. Concentrated sulphuric acid was
substituted for the alcohol, but likewise with
no result. The smallest quantity of acid was
added, so as to prevent any undue rise in
temperature, which would of course vitiate
the result.     The flask was likewise kept
cold   by a stream of water.
   In a later form of these experiments, a
small glass bulb with a long neck blown
from glass tubing, such as is used in the
elementary analysis of a fluid by com
bustion, was made use of.
   The bulb was first well heated in a
Bunsen burner, so as to destroy any

        Mr. A. Liversidge on Supersaturated Saline Solutions.                                              69
cotton-wool included, inactive, the steam escaping through the inter
stices of the cotton and not affecting the spirit. When cold a dro
of the spirit or acid was delivered by merely heating the glass bulb.
    Erp. Trial was next made of several solid dehydrating substances,
such as calcic chloride, anhydrous chromic acid, phosphoric anhy
dride, freshly ignited quicklime, &c.
   These bodies were placed in sealed thin glass bulbs and heated
nearly to redness and then dropped into the supersaturated solution;
the flasks were plugged with cotton-wool, through which a glass rod
passed, and boiled up, after which they were allowed to cool for some
hours; when quite cold the bulb was broken by means of the glass
rod and its contents set free, but, as in the case of the liquid, with
no result.
   It should perhaps here be mentioned that each flask was always
proved to be thoroughly supersaturated by dropping in a crystal of
the salt or touching the solution with a dirty rod, after the sub
stance made trial of was found to be wanting in nuclear power.
   From the foregoing it appears that the crystallization of super
saturated saline solutions is not determined by the removal of water
by chemical agency; neither do porous bodies, like wood, charcoal,
sponge, spongy platinum, earthenware, &c., determine the solidifi
cation of solutions by mechanical absorption of the water.
                   Concerning the action of thin films.
   In the same paper it is stated that while oils, fats, and greasy
bodies generally do not act as nuclei when chemically clean and in
the bulk, i.e. in the form of a solid mass, lens, or drop, yet these
identical bodies when in the form of thin films do act as nuclei, and
that any substance which possesses a nuclear action has derived
such power from having become contaminated with a thin film of
greasy matter, which it acquires by handling, wiping with a dirty
cloth, or by mere exposure to the                              air
                                              containing the products                                      of
respiration and other excretions, &c.

   Experiments were made with recently generated crystals               the                                                    of
normal salt.
   Exp. Two beakers, containing fully supersaturated solutions, were

72                             Royal Society:—
covered   with watch-glasses, and allowed to cool; in one of the
beakers   a small glass bucket, attached to a thread, had been placed
and boiled up with the solution.           Next, both beakers were arranged
under a large bell-jar, and the silk thread from the bucket passed up
between the stopper and the neck of the jar. The solutions were
 then uncovered, after waiting ten minutes for any nuclei which might
 have been disturbed to fall; a fine wire was passed down into the
 beaker containing the bucket, and as far as possible from the part
 of the solution through which it would pass on being drawn up.
    The bucket, now full of the crystallized normal sodic sulphate
 (Na, S0, 10H,0), was raised, and lowered into the second beaker
of still fluid solution; immediately that the point of one of the crys
 tals hanging from the under surface of the bucket touched the solu
 tion, crystallization was set up instantaneously throughout the mass.
    This experiment was performed many times, and with every pos
 sible care to prevent the entrance of nuclei other than those pur
 posely borne by the wire.
    A modification of the above plan was tried and with similar
results.
    Exp. A tubulated glass bell was fitted with a cork bearing two
 glass tubes, open below and closed above with cotton-wool; they
 were bent so as to permit both of them being placed in one and
 the same beaker, or into either separately.
    In the first place, the ends of the tubes inside the bell were freed
from nuclei by passing them through a flame; two beakers of cold
 supersaturated solution were then placed in position under the bell
jar, and their covers removed. After waiting five minutes or so for
 any dust to settle, both tubes were next lowered into one of the
 beakers, on opposite sides, so as to be as far apart as possible.              A
 dirty wire was now passed down one of the tubes, when, of course,
 crystallization immediately took place, and was propagated across the
 beaker.      The second tube, with              its
                                               adhering crystals, was then
 raised and lowered into the second beaker, when, the moment the
 extreme point    of    the longest crystal touched the surface          the so
                                                                            of
 lution, crystallization immediately started from that point, and the
 whole contents became solid.
  A      third variation was then made            this experiment.
                                                       in                One          of
 the two beakers was       replaced      by U-tube
                                             a                   of
                                                         thin, hard glass, one
of   the before-mentioned tubes being inserted into either limb. Crys
 tallization, when set   up                                                       to
                              in  one limb, travelled round the bend and
 into the  other,  from which    crystals  were transferred,        before,
                                                                       as         a up
 beaker   or  flaskof    solution also under the   bell-jar.
    The three modifications        ofthis form         of
                                                  experiment were tried time
 after  time,   and  always    with the same    unvarying    result.   Solutions
 which were supersaturated although not perfectly, and therefore
less sensitive, were operated upon           this way; but, even with such
                                              in
less favourable      circumstances,     the normal crystals always started

capsule of sulphuric acid was placed under the bell. The crust of
crystals was by this means dried, and became effloresced to a greater
or less extent. Now, on lowering them into a supersaturated solu
tion of alum or of magnesic sulphate they were proved to be inactive,
having been changed to the inactive anhydrous salt.
    But such dried normal crystals were active to a solution of sodic sul
phate, even after three days’ exposure to the sulphuric acid”.             It
seems as if the normal crystals become covered with a coating of
effloresced anhydrous salt, which acts as a protection to the under
neath portions in the same way as oxide of lead does to metallic
lead; hence it takes a long time to convert a crystal of the normal
salt into the anhydrous by simple exposure to dry air, although it is
an exceedingly short operation to perform at temperatures superior
to 34°C.
    Yet another form of this experiment was tried again and again, and
always with the same result.
    A glass tube bent into the form of an
elongated letter S was suspended by a plug
of cotton-wool in the neck of a flask con
taining a supersaturated solution; the so
lution was boiled, and the tube was also
boiled in        it,   so get

          Supersaturated solutions of common potash alum were
treated         same way and with the like results; alum, perhaps,
                 in the
affords a prettier example even than sodic sulphate, since the crys
 tals formed in the tube are of an opaque white, and can therefore be
 more readily observed during their growth.
    Exp. Supersaturated solutions of magnesic sulphate were also
operated upon and with the same success; but the experiment is
not so striking, owing to the much longer time required by magnesic
sulphate to crystallize.
    Although pure clean crystals of the normal sodic sulphate are
active to a supersaturated solution of sodic sulphate, yet, as might be
expected, they are not active to a similar solution of alum or magnesic
sulphate, and vice versá.
    For example, let us take a supersaturated solution of alum, and one
of sodic sulphate, and also crystals of both their salts, which crystals
have just formed and are taken from their still warm mother-liquors.
   Exp. A crystal of alum from       mother-liquor was addedits      super                                 to

                                  Crystallization immediately took place.

   I  trust that by the above-mentioned results I have clearly proved
 the following facts with respect to supersaturated solutions of sodic
sulphate:—
    1. That liquids and solids, such            as alcohol, quicklime, &c., do
 not determine crystallization by removing water.
   2. That thin films, when sufficient precautions are taken to guard
against the entrance of nuclei, do not act as nuclei.
   3. That chemically clean crystals of the normal salt (Na, SO,
 10H,0) do act as nuclei and are most powerful.
   4. That crystals of the normal salt are not produced in super
saturated solutions of sodic sulphate on allowing it to evaporate
spontaneously, but that crystals of the modified (and known inactive)
salt are.
                        I
   In conclusion may perhaps be permitted to state that the above
series of experiments have extended over a period of three years,
less a few months, and that most of them have been repeated a count
less number of times, and with every conceivable modification and
check.      Some few of them have already been published in the ‘Che
mical   News,     but are here referred to again for the sake of compre
hensiveness.

    At present the writer does not venture to put forth any definite
 theory respecting the presence and nature of the nuclei which are so
 universally diffused throughout the atmosphere; but when it is con
 sidered how much sodic chloride is constantly present in the air, and
what quantities of sulphurous acid are evolved daily, which becomes
 partly converted into sulphuric acid, the presence of particles of sodic
 sulphate in the air would not be surprising; and that it does exist is
 proved by drawing air through water and finding comparatively large
 quantities in the solid matter arrested by water.
    Sodic sulphate solutions, too, crystallize on exposure much more
 readily than those of any other salt. The other salts which form
supersaturated solutions are certainly less diffused than sodic sulphate.

       ON  THE DISTRIBUTION        OF MAGNETISM.        BY M.  JAMIN.
 A" notethe last Meeting of the Academy, M. Trêve communicated a
             on magnetism, in which    he states, among other things, that
 the poles of a magnet are displaced, being removed from the extre
 mities, when an armature of soft iron is applied.          He believes he
 demonstrates this by placing opposite to the magnet a magnetized
 needle, by showing that its direction changes after the application
 of the contact, and by supposing that the pole is in the prolonged
 direction of the needle.
    We ought first to define the word pole; we must then remark
 that, in this experiment, the magnetized needle is submitted to the
attractive action of the steel which forms the magnet, of the iron
 which constitutes the contact, and, again, to the attraction or re
 pulsion of the free magnetism of the magnet.         Its direction is along
the resultant of these actions—a resultant evidently very compli
 cated, depending on the distance, the weight, and the form of the
 contact: it is clear that the direction of this resultant cannot lead
 to any precise conclusion.
    What it is necessary to determine here is the distribution of the
 magnetism in the magnet, both before and after the application of
the contact; this is a question with which          I have long occupied
 myself, and on which      I will now say a few words.
    I study this distribution by two mutually corroborative processes.
The first consists in placing upon a point of the magnet a small
electromagnet of soft iron enveloped in copper wire which commu
nicates with a galvanometer, and suddenly pulling it away.               An
induction-current is produced, a galvanometric deflection; and from
the magnitude of the arc of impulsion        I can calculate, after a suit
able graduation, the magnetic intensity at the point touched.
    The second process, analogous to Coulomb's, consists in placing on
the point one wishes to study a small sphere of soft iron supported
by a spring, which is stretched progressively till separation takes
place. Its tension at that moment is proportional to the square of

   Thermodynamics defines the calorie very clearly; it only indi
rectly defines the temperature, by means of Carnot's theorem: hence
the difficult and embarrassed course of the theory.     have proposed              I
to  myself   to remedy this defect.
                                                              I
   In the first part of the work which have the honour to submit
to the Academy                I
                     demonstrate that Carnot's theorem is identical
with the following:—The mean vis viva of an atom forming part of
a body, the absolute temperature of which is r, may be ea pressed by ar,
a being a specific coefficient which can only                       be dependent on the              nature
of   the atom.
     The following is a compendium of the demonstration of this                                       pro
position       :-
     If we producea change in the elementary state of a body sub
mitted at every instant to external forces which balance the internal
forces, we shall have
                                   dz-HEd0=d<U+017F>I+d6+ dy,
dz    being the variation of the external work, d0 the quantity of
heat supplied to the body, dTI the variation of the potential function
corresponding to the displacement of each atom from          mean po                      its
sition, dº the variation    the actual energy, and dy the variation
                                        of
of  that part   the potential energy which depends

motion.    On account     the constant equilibrium between the ex
                                    of
ternal and internal forces, we have

   Let us suppose Q, and Q, infinitely small, as well as the arcs of
the lines of equal energy corresponding to them. Let us draw,
through the intersection of the line of equal energy p, with the
adiabatic line on the left, an infinitely small arc of an isothermal
curve stopping at the adiabatic line on the right; and let us make
the same construction for the point of intersection of the curve of
equal energy p, and the left adiabatic line.  The quantities of heat
Q, and Q,' which must be respectively supplied to and withdrawn
from the body along the isothermal arcs thus traced will, in virtue
of Carnot's theorem, be connected by the relation
                                            % = 2,

ro and r, being the absolute temperatures corresponding                                  to the   iso
thermal lines.
  Now it is easily demonstrated that Q, and Q,', Q, and Q,', re
spectively differ only by infinitely small quantities of the second
order.   We have therefore
from which, finally, is deduced the general relation between the
mean actual energy p and the absolute temperature r,

    the Philosophical     Magazine for December 1867 I pub
IN lished the results    of observations on the spectrum of the
Bessemer-flame, made with a one-prism spectroscope on the Lon
don and North-Western Company’s Works at Crewe.             These
experiments    showed that the Bessemer-spectrum contained,
besides the lines of potassium, sodium, and lithium, certain lines
due to iron; but most of the lines were not found to be coinci
dent with the known lines of carbon or of any other element.
Nevertheless I held strongly the opinion that the spectrum was
mainly due to carbon, for the following reasons:—
   (a) Carbon      known
                     is       give more than one spectrum (Phil.
                                    to
Mag. Oct. 1869, Chem. News, Oct. 1870); and though the
Bessemer-spectrum    does not coincide with any recognized spec
trum     carbon,

                                                  be the essential
element present.
   (b)   The spectrum disappears   almost precisely      the right   at
moment for    stopping  the blast, which     supposed  is    when     to   be
the carbon    the pig iron has been burnt out and the iron

mainly due to manganese owide (not, as has been stated, to man

Barrow Haematite Steel Company at Barrow; and am glad to                               I

carrying out of experiments, but even by contributing to the

84               Dr. W. M. Watts    on the Spectrum
   The observatory was placed against the wall of one of the
sheds, about on a level with the top of the convertors, close to
two convertors, and commanding a distant view of two others.
The distant convertors were found to be the best for careful
measurement, the shaking being less than when the blow was
taking place at one of the near convertors, although the spec
trum from these was, of course, the most intense.         The best
method of   introducing  the  reference-spectrum   was found to be,
to throw an image of the Bessemer-flame upon the slit by means
of a large lens of about 10 inches focus, and to bring the spark
discharger (or Bunsen burner) between the lens and slit.          A
screen was arranged so as to cut off the light of the Bessemer
flame when required, so that either of the two spectra could be
obtained alone at pleasure, or the one could be superposed on
the other.
   The metals employed to furnish the reference-lines were the
following, besides which the lines of the air-spectrum were made
use of:—aluminium, copper, cadmium, iron, lithium, lead, mag
nesium, manganese, platinum, sodium, thallium, tin, and zinc.
Further, the Bessemer-spectrum was carefully compared with
various spectra, especially with those of iron, sodium, lithium,
manganese, and manganese oxide.           The spectra were either
arranged under the Bessemer-spectrum by the use of the reflecting
prism, or were superposed on it in the manner described above.
The spectra of iron and manganese were obtained by taking
the electric spark between wires of these metals—the spectra
of sodium, lithium, and manganese oxide by the use of a Bunsen
burner, or by heating the substance in the flame of the oxyhy
drogen blowpipe.       When manganese chloride (or manganese
carbonate or pyrolusite) is heated in the oxyhydrogen flame a very
brilliant spectrum is obtained, which, as will be seen afterwards,
is for the most part coincident with the Bessemer-spectrum.
Observations were, further, made on the spectrum of the flame
obtained on adding the Spiegeleisen, on the temperature of the
flame at different stages in the process, and on the differences in
the spectrum caused by the employment of different iron.        The
results obtained will be detailed in succession.

     Of the      Bessemer lines which do not occur in the manganese
 oxide    spectrum,        the following are due to iron                   :-

 The line at 5167 is also nearly coincident with the double iron
 line
         {#           ; and the edge               of the band at 5229 coincides nearly

 of the iron spectrum are drawn which were actually mapped
 together with the Bessemer-spectrum,                              when the two were seen
 simultaneously.

   The same figure shows also the result of a direct comparison
of the Bessemer-spectrum with that of manganese oxide: those
lines only of the manganese oxide spectrum are drawn which
were seen to coincide with the Bessemer (or Spiegel) lines.
   It is worthy of remark that the identification of these iron
lines proves that iron may exist as vapour at a temperature below
the melting-point of iron, since the Bessemer-flame is not hot
enough to melt wrought iron. The presence of a few only out
of the 180 lines which constitute the spectrum of the electric
spark between iron poles, is only the same thing that we observe
in the case of sodium, lithium, and thallium when the spectrum
is produced at a low temperature.

88                 Dr. W. M. Watts       on the Spectrum
II.   On the Temperature of the Flame, and the differences observed
                             at different times.
    It is in the flaine obtained on adding the highly manganiferous
Spiegeleisen     that the manganese-oxide spectrum is most fully
developed.      In the experiments at Crewe a marked difference
was almost always observed between the ordinary Bessemer
spectrum and that of the Spiegel, arising from a difference in the
relative intensity of the different lines.        The difference was so
marked that it was not at first perceived that the two spectra
were in any way the same; but at Barrow this difference does
not exist, the Spiegel-spectrum being identical with the Bessemer,
only more intense. The ordinary Bessemer-spectrum at Barrow
is in fact identical with the Spiegel-spectrum as obtained at
Crewe.
   A reference to fig. 2, Plate W. (which represents the two
spectra on the scale of a one-prism spectroscope), will render
this difference clearer.
    It will be observed that in the Barrow spectrum there is a
more marked division of the separate lines into groups having a
general resemblance, the group m (65 to 67) being the brightest;
while in the Crewe spectrum the brightest portion is nearer the
red (58 and 59), and the spectrum does not extend so far into
the blue.      This difference is probably due simply to difference
of  temperature;      but it can be distinctly connected with the kind
of iron   employed:     the steel at Crewe was intended for the axles
and tires of wheels; that made at Barrow was to be employed for
rails.    The same difference was remarked in observing two
“blows'' at the Bolton Iron and Steel Works. The first was of
iron of No. 1 brands, and the second of inferior iron. The
spectrum in the first case was the same as the Crewe one, but
the Spiegel-spectrum was the same as that observed at Barrow;
in the second “blow * the spectrum was nearly that of Barrow.
   An attempt was made to determine the temperature of the flame
by observing whether wires of gold, platinum, and of an alloy of
90 per cent. platinum and 10 per cent. iridium were melted
when held in the flame.         It was found that towards the middle
and end of the blow the gold was always melted; but on no oc
casion was either the alloy or the platinum melted, even when
the wire was kept in the flame for several minutes.              At the
beginning of the blow, however, gold does not melt.              A wire
held in the flame from the commencement was not melted when
the sodium-lineappeared flashing across the continuous spectrum,
but did melt about the time that the sodium-line became con
stant, and before any of the Bessemer lines proper made their
appearance.       If we take the melting-point of gold to be 1300° C.

                            of the Bessemer-flame.                     89
and of platinum 2000°C., it follows from these observations that
the temperature of the flame at the commencement of the blow
     ;
is below 1300°, but gradually rises, never, however, reaching
2000° C.
   This result is confirmed by the fact, that of the sodium-spec
trum only the double line D is present.      In the Philosophical
Magazine      for August       1870,   I   showed    that the sodium-lines
            may be employed as an index of temperature,         since they
are present in the spectrum of any flame containing sodium the
temperature of which is high enough to melt platinum, but do
not appear at lower temperatures.     The Bessemer-flame obvi
ously contains abundance of sodium; but this sodium double line
is absent.   The lithium orange line also, which comes out at a
somewhat less temperature, is absent.
   The Bessemer-spectrum is seen more or less distinctly in several
other flames. The jet of flame which issues with the Spiegel
from the Spiegel cupola shows it brilliantly. This flame also
melts gold but not platinum.       The Bessemer-spectrum is seen
also in the flame from the melting-cupola for the pig iron, in the
flame from the bottom of the blast-furnaces at work at Barrow,
and in the flame of the coke used in warming the cupola after
re-lining (which spectrum exhibits also the lines of sodium,
lithium, and potassium brilliantly), and in several other flames.
The flame obtained on adding the Spiegel, which gives the Bes
semer-spectrum     most brilliantly, is also incapable of melting
platinum, but melts gold.
    There are certain of the lines which seem to linger after the
rest, and which, when the blow has been carried rather far, are
occasionally seen alone (upon a continuous spectrum) after the
regular Bessemer-spectrum has disappeared.         Some, but not
all    these, are iron lines. The following are those which have
      of
been   noticed:—
5107,       5167,    5269Fe,      5327 Fe,     5359,      5370Fe,   5395,

    It is very difficult to understand why these lines, which are
not those of carbon, should disappear at the exact point at which
the blast ought to be stopped, and that they should be due to a
substance of which so little can be present.               The following ana
lyses of the metal at different stages in the process, quoted from
Mr. Snelus's paper read at the Meeting of the Iron and Steel
Institute in December 1870, show that in some cases the quan
tity of manganese present is inappreciable:—

XII.   Note on the History of certain Formulae in Spherical     Trigo
           nometry.    By I. Tod HUNTER, M.A., F.R.S.
    To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,
Thº           are four formulae in Spherical Trigonometry which
        are usually called Gauss's Theorems or Gauss’s Analogies.
These formulae are
              sin   a cos    (B-C) =sin     #A sin  (b+c)
and three others   of a  like nature.
   The formulae, however, are really due to Delambre; but in
consequence of an erroneous reference, his claim has been ob
scured, and mathematicians have been put to inconvenience in
investigating the matter.
   Gauss printed the formulae in 1809 in his Theoria Motus,
p. 51. He says they would be sought for in vain in books on
trigonometry; he omits the demonstration             for the sake of
brevity.
   Delambre, in the first volume of his Astronomie, published in
1814, claims the formulae (see his pages 164 and 195); in both
places he refers to the Connaissance des Tems for 1808.        The re
ference, however, should be to the Connaissance des Tems for
1809, which was published in April 1807.            Here the four for
mulae are given without demonstration, together with some
others which follow immediately from them.              One of these
other formulae is
                tan ; a     tan   (b–c) sin (B+C).2.
                                   sin (B-C)
this Delambre ascribes to M. Henri.
   As Delambre is here discussing the solution of an astrono
mical problem given by M. Henri, it might at first sight have
appeared probable that after this formula had been used by M.
Henri, the four formulae improperly ascribed to Gauss were         in
vestigated by Delambre.         But it may be inferred from the top
of page  446 of Delambre's remarks, that he had been previously
acquainted with the formulae.
   Delambre claims the formulae and gives the correct reference
on p. 349 of the Connaissance des Tems for 1812, which was
published in July 1810: Delambre is here reviewing Gauss’s
Theoria Motus.
   Delambre's erroneous reference has been adopted by some
writers. Thus Bowditch says on p. 737 of the first volume of
his translation of the Mécanique Céleste, “Delambre, in his       As
tronomie, vol. i. p. 164, observes that he had given several of

On the History of certain Formulae in Spherical Trigonometry.     99
these theorems in the Connoisance des Tems, 1808, before the
publication of the work of Gauss. . . .” T. S. Davies says, on
p. 37 of the second volume of the twelfth edition of Hutton’s
‘Course of Mathematics,” “The four formulae . . . are usually
known as Gauss’s Analogies, their demonstration having been
first given by that illustrious geometer in his Theoria Motus
Corporum Caelestium (1809); but they had been published by
Delambre some years previously in the Connaissance des Temps
 (for 1808)   ...”   Here, besides the expansion of an exact two
 years into an indefinite some years, we have the statement that
 Gauss gave a demonstration of the formulae in 1809; but as we
have already stated, Gauss omitted the demonstration.           In a
 note Mr. Davies adds: “Gauss did not deliver his       theorems,  or
their investigations, in precisely the forms given in the text...”
 But Gauss did deliver his theorems in those forms. Then what
 Mr. Davies goes on to say respecting the forms and investiga
 tions may perhaps apply to some other work, but does not apply
 to the Theoria Motus, where Gauss delivered the theorems.
     It must be observed that Gauss had been anticipated even in
 Germany in the publication of the formulae. They were given by
 Mollweide in Zach’s Monatliche Correspondenz for November
  1808, with a demonstration.
     The subject is noticed in an article in Klügel's Mathematisches
  Wörterbuch, vol. v. p. 211; the passage has been reproduced in
 the ‘ Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society,’ vol. iii.
 p. 320. The writer states correctly the positions of Gauss and
 Mollweide; and then he adds that Delambre published the for
 mulae in the Connaissance des Tems for 1808, and so French
 writers usually call them after him.      But these few words rela
 ting to Delambre seem to me to fall below the usual high standard
  of German accuracy.      For in the first place the erroneous date
  (1808) must have been borrowed without verification, although
  there is nothing to warn us of this.     And in the next place the
  writer  apparently puts   the claims of Mollweide and Delambre
  as equal, by ascribing to both the date 1808, overlooking the
  fact that the Connaissance des Tems for an assigned year is
  published in advance of that year.
     Thus, finally, although Mollweide has priority over Gauss,
  yet he comes about a year and a half after Delambre ; and there
  fore until any other person can be shown to have published the
  formulae before April 1807, they must be justly ascribed to
  Delambre.
      Demonstrations of the formulae in two ways were published
   by Delambre in his Astronomie (see pp. 164 and 196 of his first
   volume). It would appear from his page 164 that he consi
   dered this to be the first publication of a demonstration; but,
                                  H 2

100          Mr. R. Moon           on the   Law of Gaseous Pressure.
as we have stated, Mollweide gave a demonstration in 1808.
In his second way, Delambre makes use of a diagram from
which he obtains both his own Analogies and those of Napier.
This way of demonstration is substantially the same as that
which was independently discovered and printed in the ‘ Pro
ceedings of the London -Mathematical Society,’ vol. iii. p. 13.
One step in the recent process, however, is simpler than the
corresponding step in Delambre's, namely the proof of the equa
lity of the angles M WA and CW P.
   It may be remarked that if one of Napier's Analogies is given,
we may deduce another immediately by using one of the trian
gles associated with the fundamental triangle; and then Napier's
two other Analogies follow by the aid of the polar triangle.
Thus we may say that the other three may be deduced immedi
ately from any one of them.     But with respect to Delambre's
Analogies, the case is rather different. Take these in the order
in which they are given in my “Spherical Trigonometry.” Then
(1) and (4) are so related that either can be deduced from                        the
other by using an associated triangle; but nothing new is ob
tained from (1) or from (4) by using the polar triangle. And
(2) and (3) are so related that either can be deduced from the
other by using an associated triangle, or by using the polar tri
angle. Thus from one of Delambre's Analogies we cannot de
duce immediately the other three.     If one of Napier’s Analo
gies is given and one of Delambre's, we can deduce immediately
the other six.   Also the other    may       six
                                            deduced immediately
                                                      be
from (1) and (2)        of
                     Delambre's  Analogies;   and the other six
may     bededuced immediately from (3) and (4)       Delambre's  of
Analogies.

In his first paper (see Phil. Mag. for July last) Mr. Strutt ap

102         Mr. R. Moon on the Law of Gaseous Pressure.
enables us to determine the law of pressure in the fluid at that
time, that the law of pressure at the time in question may be
                 In fact, if when t=0 we have p-fº(a), where fa
                                                                       <U+017F>º),
any whatever.
denotes any continuous function, we shall have
                          <U+017F>º--ji, tº                                                               .     .       ()
an equation which can be satisfied by means of p, and of which
indeed it is the special and exclusive office to determine p. This
can be done as follows:—
     Putting                                                 &
                                         f(0+fº                   =e.
and solving with respect to                           r,    we get
                                a   = funct.          0-<U+017F>,(o)              suppose.
                                                      -<U+017F>º
Hence (4) becomes
                                                                  2
                      Jº<U+017F>.(o)}                =                             +   b (o),
which determines the form of p.
   It thus appears that the office performed by (1) is of this kind;
viz. the law of pressure prevailing at a certain time, and also the
laws of velocity and density prevailing at the same time being
given, (1) enables us from those data to determine the law of
pressure prevailing in the same case of motion at any other time.
Obviously, therefore, it is as unreasonable for Mr. Strutt to ask
me to state “the real physical law of pressure true at               times                             all
and places,”          as
                       would
                          it       for me      require him

                                                                determine                     to
in  any particular case        motion the velocity and density
                                          of                            any                              at
instant     bymeans        Euler's  of
                                     equations,   without   affording  him
any information             as

   Of the particular cases         failure which have adduced against

of  pressure held under these circumstances,             would contradict          it
the principle that action and reaction are equal and opposite.
   Mr. Strutt meets this                       by
                                  suggesting that “an infinitely small
.
.

.      layer         of   air
                      situated      the boundary  at   subject         infi        is              to   an
nite  acceleration,”    and that the fact “that the pressures which
act   on   its
            two faces are unequal          therefore not     contradiction
                                                             is                          in

   Now      by“infinitely small” Mr. Strutt must mean here                                                   “in

                                       the circumstances which        have                             I

                 Mr. R. Moon                on the Law of Gaseous Pressure.                                           103
supposed to exist at the time t are precise and definite.         That
any thing indefinite should arise out of that state of circumstances
is simply impossible. In the case supposed, acceleration may,
and indeed will occur at the time t; but the breadth, great or
small, over which it prevails must be a definite breadth; and
whether great or small, if it have magnitude, if it have existence,
throughout that breadth Boyle's law does not hold. Mr. Strutt's
apology for the law, therefore, in this case of     manifest failure,                      its
 is,
in     effect, simply     admission    an  failure, coupled     of
                                                              with         its                                             an
wholly unfounded assertion that the failure will              confined                                      be
 within extremely narrow limits.
   The next case treated         Mr. Strutt     of
                                                where by   vertical cy            is                  a

    Mr. Strutt,       the other hand, maintains that “precisely the

the following mode of giving the desired pitch to the resonators
in question.
   Tune a string of the sonometer to the fundamental tone of the
sound, and produce on it the harmonic notes one after another.
Then place the proper resonator in communication with the ear
instead of with the manometric capsule; and while the india
rubber tube is in the ear, it becomes very easy to determine their
arrangement and the position for the strongest resonance.

each branch is in communication with a separate capsule. These
two capsules, whose action on each other is annulled by two ac
cessory capsules, are provided with two gas-pipes instead of one.
On a stand are placed three burners, which are fixed at different
elevations; the centre one is arranged for the reception of two
india-rubber tubes.    I connect now one gas-pipe of the one cap
sule with the highest  burner,  one pipe of the other capsule with
the lowest, and by means of the remaining two exit-pipes I place
both capsules in communication with the centre burner. If          I
now strike the tuning-forks while the lengths of the tube-branches
are equal, the three flames in the rotating mirror show three
equally deeply serrated flame-series one above another, of which
the centre alone changes into a simple band of light on length
ening one of the branches a half wave-length of the note, while
both the other flames continue to vibrate with unchanged inten
sity. Thus we have here at the same time a view of the action
of the sound-waves when they approach through the one arm
alone, when they have passed through the second only, and
also when they arrive united at the flame after passing through
both.

vary), so that the galvanometer may be affected the most by any
slight departure from the balance which occurs when a b=c: d.
 The nature of this problem may be more easily understood from
 the following considerations:—
      1. If b, c, d, e, and fare given, then there is only    one value
 of   a  which will produce
      2. But if   c, d, e, and
                               a balance, viz. a = º
                               fare given, but not b, then there is an
 infinite number of pairs of values of a and b which will produce
 a balance by satisfying the relation a b=c: d, and one parti
 cular pair will constitute the best arrangement, by which is meant
 that the galvanometer will be most sensitive to any slight depar
                                 ar
  ture from the equality of b and à when those particular values
  of a and b are used.
      3. And if only d, e, and fare given, then for any value we give
  to c there is a pair of values of a and b which constitutes the
  best arrangement for that value of c; and there will be a parti
  cular value of c which, with the corresponding values of a and
  b, will be the best arrangement for the given values of d, e, and f.
      In order to find what functions a, b, and c must be of d, e, andf
   to constitute the best arrangement, it will be first necessary to
   find the best values of a and b when c, d, e, and      f  are given.
   This   I now proceed to do.
       It is well known, and may be easily proved by Kirchhoff's
   laws, that the current passing through the galvanometer is re

make u a maximum. As Ed is constant, it may be dismissed.
As to the numerator (ad—bc), it vanishes when at a balance;
but of course such a thing as an exact balance is unattainable.
Let d-EA be the real value of the resistance we are measuring,
d being the calculated value #, and A        a small difference, then
                       a(d+A) —bc= + a<U+017F> A.
Therefore the numerator varies as a or as b, since in the present
case a and b vary together.     Hence we may write b for (ad-bc).

the same battery and galvanometer be always used, the side a of
the bridge will be a constant resistance, and a Table of the near

this action takes place. These experiments were made in a
similar manner to the former.     I took the glass globe formerly
used; and into this the mixed gases were led with the addition
of a little water; it was then placed in another vessel containing
cold water, arranged so that it could be raised to any required
temperature, or boiled if necessary.   A thermometer communi

I find, then, from this experiment that at 200°F. action com
mences, that at that temperature the sulphurous acid begins to
act upon the nitric acid, whilst the second experiment shows
that the heat developed by the action itself is pretty considerable.
   The globe was now left for twenty-four hours in the cold
water (see exp. II.), and after that time had elapsed the con
tents were submitted to analysis.   I here give the result of three
analyses:—

    Inthe above experiments it is seen that the temperature never
rose to the point of boiling water, but that that degree was very
nearly approached.
    Section IV. The Distribution of Heat in the Lead Chamber.
   We have seen in the preceding section that 200°F. is the
temperature at which nitric acid begins to act upon sulphurous
acid.    I
         now wish to show the temperature of the lead chamber
in which the preceding action takes place on a large scale, and
then to see if  Ican draw some conclusion as to the best tempe
rature at which to keep the sulphuric acid-chamber.
   In order to obtain a good idea of the temperature, I took daily
observations at different points in the chamber during a year,
and have condensed the results obtained into the form of diagrams.
   Ordinary maximum and minimum thermometers were em
ployed; but instead of being fixed, as usual, upon a wooden
back, a glass back was employed, upon which the degrees were
etched, and the thermometers fixed thereto by thick platinum
wire, thus having instruments capable of resisting acids.                       all

   These thermometers were lowered into the chamber at the
different points by long “threads” of lead and allowed to re
main for about two hours, the yield of vitriol and general appear
ance of the chamber being carefully noted each day. The results
obtained by this investigation have been very completely borne
out by those already shown in Section III., which, although                                                               I
considered their proper place in the paper to be before the pre
sent section, nevertheless came later in the course of investigation.
   As in a former case, I divided the chamber into separate parts,
so that       I
           could have some definite plan of procedure.        In this
case the chamber was divided along          length     four heights,    its                     at

   126            Mr. H. A. Smith       on the Chemistry     of
      Little is to be said respecting this diagram which has not been
   said on the former.      In this also is noticeable the great fall in
   temperature which has taken place from 10 to 20 feet from end
   of chamber; in this case the fall is even greater than before,
   changing here from 227°F. to 126°F., a difference of 101°F.
   This is accounted for by the fact that the entrance-pipe is much
   nearer this point than the former, being in fact just above the
   spot where the temperature was observed.            The regularity of the
   heat after this sudden fall is     also,  as in the former case, ve
   remarkable—the variation being between 126° and 133° F. till
   we reach 120 feet from end of chamber, when the temperature
   falls to 110° F., the average temperature, however, being about
   126° to 128°F.,-in this case also bearing out the fact (by refer
   ence to exp. II., previous section) that the upper part of the
   chamber is unnecessary.

128      On the Chemistry        of Sulphuric Acid-manufacture.
  In Diagram           III. we find a higher average of temperature,         vary
ing for the most part between 150° and 166°F.; whilst at en
trance and exit the temperature is comparatively low, rising
towards the centre of the chamber.      Here, now, we approach
very nearly the required temperature, 200°F. being the observed
degree at which nitric acid acted on sulphurous acid; and by
reference to my former paper we find that this portion of the
chamber is really the “working” portion.      It is necessary also
to observe along with this diagram the next, Diagram IV.        In
my former paper           I
                     showed experimentally,   by analyses of the
gases at 3 feet from bottom of chamber, that the greatest amount
of action went on at that portion; and           I   have shown also         (Sec
tion   III.)that the temperature at which nitric acid began to
act on sulphurous acid was 200°F.; so that now by observing
these two diagrams we see how closely the laboratory and the
manufacturing results agree. I have already spoken of this in
Diagram        III.;
                  but it is much more distinctly observed in Dia
gram IV. Beginning at 112°F., the temperature rises suddenly
till at 20 feet from entrance it attains 195° F., whilst the tempe
rature is for the most part from 195° to 199°F.    After 90 feet
from entrance of chamber it falls at an almost regular amount
of 20 degrees for each 10 feet of chamber length, until at 140
feet from entrance of chamber the temperature is 120° F.
   Here, then, we have an example of almost perfectly suitable
temperature.     At this time also the yield of vitriol obtained
from this chamber was as nearly the theoretical amount as could
practically be obtained; and it was found that whenever the
temperature of the chamber was allowed to increase or diminish
the result was bad. At this time the amount of nitric acid esca
ping was almost nil, whilst the colour of the liquid coming from
the Gay-Lussac tower showed that the gas escaping was really
NO” with a scarcely appreciable amount of nitric acid. (I may
say here that whenever the colour of this liquor is of a dark red
colour, it is a sign of the escape either of nitric acid or some of
the higher oxides of nitrogen.)
   The conclusions I draw from these and the preceding investi
gations may be summed up thus:—
   1. The best form of chamber to be employed is one which is
long and not high, the analyses pointing to one of somewhat
the following dimensions—150 feet long, 25 or 30.feet wide,
and about 10 or 12 feet high. We have thus a large condensing
surface, the mixed gases coming readily into contact with                        all
parts   of the chamber, whilst they are also           contact with
                                                           in
the  previously  condensed acid which rests               on
                                                    the sides   the         of
chamber.
  2.   The temperature          of   the chamber should    be   kept   as   nearly

as possible about 200° F., this also acting as a regulator for
the amount of steam thrown into the chamber.
   3.   That in “starting” a chamber, sulphuric acid should be
run on the bottom in preference to water, which is at present
generally employed.

    Such,    I  believe, is the real march      of the process of fractional
distillation; and these formulae offer an explanation why by fre
quent repetitions and judicious management the chemist is able
to effect almost perfect separations by means of fractional distil
lation.     The coefficient of volatility, however, is something
more than the tension of the vapour at the boiling-point of the
mixture.       Ten years ago I showed that the density of the vapour
had to be taken into account (and Berthelot has also indepen
                 I
 dently, but, believe, subsequently, insisted on the necessity of
regarding vapour-density in judging of relative volatility).               The
coefficient of   volatility    comprises  at least the tension of the   vapour
and the density of the vapour.
    The heat rendered latent during evaporation must also be re
presented in this coefficient.           Possibly, too, adhesion between
the   liquids   will require     representation    in certain classes of    in
stances; and this will cause difficulty and complication.                 I am
 of opinion, however, that in the vast majority of cases the con
joined influences of tension, density, and latent heat will ade
quately express the coefficient of volatility.            If t be put for the
 tension and d for the vapour-density, then                 I  propose v-ta”
 for the value of the coefficient of volatility.            This will be more
 fully explained on a future occasion. At present my main object
 is to insist on the fact that, when distilling in mixture, different
 liquids have different coefficients of volatility, and that the com
 position of successive portions of distillate is governed by these
 coefficients and by the original proportions of the liquids present
 in the mixture, in the manner set forth.
     I   have made some experiments on mixtures of A and B
 wherein the quantity of A is overwhelmingly greater than that
 of B. This disposition of the quantities offers certain advantages
 for investigating the general march of fractional distillation.

after long and careful scrutiny, to see the line double. The line in the
nebula was narrower than the double line of nitrogen; this latter line
may have appeared broader in consequence of irradiation, as it was
much brighter than the line in the nebula.”          When the spark was
placed before the object-glass of the telescope, the light was so much
weakened that one line only was visible in the spectroscope.         “This
line was the one which agrees in position with the line in the nebula,
so that under these circumstances the spectrum of nitrogen appeared
precisely similar to the spectra of those nebulae of which the light is
apparently monochromatic.        This resemblance was made more com
plete by the faintness of the line; from which cause it appeared
narrower, and the separate existence of                               its

   First line.—With spectroscope B and eyepiece 1 and 2, the slit
being made very narrow, this line was seen to be very narrow, of a
width corresponding to the slit, and defined at both edges, and
undoubtedly not double.    The line of nitrogen when compared with
it appeared double, and each component nebulous and broader than
the line of the nebula. This latter line was seen on several nights
to be apparently coincident with the middle of the less refrangible
line of the double line of nitrogen. This observation was on one
night confirmed by observation with the more powerful spectroscope C.
   The question suggests itself whether, under any conditions of pres
sure and temperature, the double line of the nitrogen-spectrum be
comes single; and further, if this should be found to be the case,
whether the line becomes single by the fading out of          more re                                        its

the other lines remain very faint. Under these conditions I have
always been able, though with some difficulty, on account of the
faint light when the necessary dispersive power (spectroscope B with
second or third eyepiece) and a narrow slit are used, to see the
line to be double; but it is narrower than when the gas is more dense,
and may be easily mistaken for a single line.            I  have not yet been
able to find a condition of luminous nitrogen in which the line has
the same characters as those presented by the line in the nebula,
where it is single and of the width of the slit.
                       I
    Upon the whole am still inclined to regard the line in the nebula
as probably due to nitrogen.
    If  this should be found to be the case, and that the nebular line
has originally the refrangibility of the middle of the double line of
mitrogen, then we should have evidence that the nebula is moving
 from the earth. The amount of displacement of the nebular line
from the middle of the double line of nitrogen corresponds to a velo
city of 55 miles per second from the earth. At the time of observa
tion the part of the earth's orbital motion, which was from the
nebula, was 14.9 miles per second.           From the remaining 40 miles
per second would have to be deducted the probable motion from the
nebula due to the motion of the solar system in space.             This esti
mation of the possible motion of the nebula can be regarded as only
 approximate.
    If the want of accordance of the line in the nebula with the middle
of the double line of nitrogen be due to a recession of the nebula in
the line of sight, there should be a corresponding displacement of
the third line as compared with that of hydrogen.                For reasons
which will be found in a subsequent paragraph,           I have not been able
to make this comparison with the necessary accuracy.
    In my former paper*       I gave reasons against supposing so large a
motion in the nebula; these were based on the circumstance that
the nebular line falls upon the double nitrogen line, which the pre
 sent observations confirm.     I was not then able to use a slit sufficiently
 marrow to show that the nebular line is single and not coincident
with the middle of the double line of nitrogen.
    I am still pursuing the investigation of the parts of this inquiry
which remain unsettled.
     Second line.—This line was found by my former comparisons
to be a little less refrangible than a strong line in the spectrum of
 barium.     Three sets of measures give for this line a wave-length
of 4957 on Angström's.scale; this would show that the line agrees
nearly in position with a strong line of iron.                       I
                                                         At present am not
able to suggest to what substance this line belongs.
    This line is also narrow and defined.      I suspect that the brightness
of this line relatively to the first line varies in different nebulae.
    Third and fourth line.—My former observations show that these
lines agree in position with two lines of the spectrum of hydrogen,
that at F and the line near G.

  These lines are very narrow and are defined;
the hydrogen therefore must be at a low ten
Slon.
   The brightness of these lines relatively to the
first and second lines varies considerably in dif

ferent nebulae; and suspect they may also vary
in the same nebulae at different times, and even
in different parts of same nebula; but at present,5;
I have not sufficient evidence on these points”.
I  regret that, in consequence of a continuance
of bad weather,     I have not yet been able to
obtain decisive observations as to the possible
motion of the nebula in the line of sight. With
spectroscope Bandeyepiece.2, the lines appear to
be coincident with those of hydrogen.       In con
sequence of the uncertainty of the character of
 the first line, which is single, while that of ni
trogen is double, this determination can now
only be made by means of the comparison of
 the third line with that of hydrogen.         This
 third line becomes very faint from the great
loss of light unavoidable in a spectroscope that
gives a sufficient dispersive power, and the com
parison can only be attempted when the sky is
very clear and the nebula near the meridian.

Prof. D'Arrest in the “Astronomische Nachrichten,'

     §   2.      On the Motions                  of some Stars towards or from the Earth.
   In the early part of 1868                                I
                                  had the honour of presenting to the
Royal Society some observations on a small change of refrangibility
which         I
          had observed in a line in the spectrum of Sirius as com
pared with a line of hydrogen, from which it appeared that the star
was moving from the earth with a velocity of about twenty-five miles
per second, if the probable advance of the sun in space be taken
into account *.
   It is only within the last few months that I have found myself in
 possession   of the necessary instrumental means to resume this
inquiry, and since this time the prevalence of bad weather has left
 but few nights sufficiently fine for these delicate observations.
   Some time was occupied in obtaining a perfectly trustworthy method
of comparison of the spectra of stars with those of terrestrial sub
stances, and it was not until I had arranged the spark within the tube,
as described at the beginning of this note, that              felt confidence                               I
in the results of my observations.
   It may be well to state some circumstances connected with these
comparisons which necessarily make the numerical estimations given
further on less accurate than I could wish.        Even when spectroscope
C, containing four compound prisms, and a magnifying-power of 16
diameters are used, the amount of the change of refrangibility to be
observed appears very small. The probable error of these estimations
is therefore large, as a shift corresponding to five miles per second
(about            T'o   of
                the distance              D*),    evenof     D'

means of apparatus now being constructed, to be able to get more
accurate determinations of the velocity of the motions.
     Sirius.-The comparison of the line at F with the corresponding
line of hydrogen was made on several nights from January 18 to
March 5. Spectroscope C and eyepieces 2 and 3 were used. These
observations confirm the conclusion arrived at in my former paper,
that the star is moving from the earth; but they ascribe to the star
a velocity smaller than that which         I then obtained.
     These observations on different days show a change of refran
gibility corresponding to a velocity of from 26 miles to 36 miles per
second.       The part of the earth's orbital motion from the star varied
on these      days  from 10 miles to 14 miles per second.        We may take,
 therefore, 18 to 22 miles per second as due to the star.
      The difference of this estimate, which is probably below rather
 than in excess of the true amount, from that which            I formerly made
 may be due in part or entirely to the less perfect instruments then at
 my command. At the same time, if Sirius be moving in an elliptic
 orbit, as suggested by Dr. Peters, that part of the star's proper
 motion which is in the direction of the visual ray would constantly
  vary”.
      Betelgeur (a Orionis).-In the early observations of Dr. Miller
 and myself on this star, we found that there are no strong lines coin
 cident with the hydrogen lines at C and F. The line H a falls on
 the less refrangible side of a small group of strong lines, and H 9
 occurs in the space between two groups of strong lines where the lines
 are faint.      On one night of unusual steadiness of the air, when the
 finer lines in the star's spectrum were seen with more than ordinary
  distinctness, I was able with the more powerful instruments now at
  my command to see a marrow defined line in the red apparently co
  incident with H a, and a similar line at the position of H 3. These
  lines are much less intense than the lines C and F in the solar spec
  trum; there are certainly no bright lines in the star's spectrum at
  these places.
      The most suitable lines in this star for comparison with terrestrial
  substances for ascertaining the star's motion are the lines of sodium
   and of magnesium. The double character of the one line agreeing
   exactly with that of sodium, and the further circumstance that the
   more refrangible of the lines is the stronger one, as is the case in
   spectrum of sodium and in the solar spectrum, and the relative dis
   tances from each other and comparative brightness of the three lines,
   which correspond precisely to the triple group of magnesium, can
  allow of no doubt that these lines in the star are really produced by
      * Dr. H. Vogel at Bothkamp seems to have repeated my observations on Sirius
  with the necessary care.   He says (Astron. Nachr. No. 1864):—“Mit der eben
  beschriebenen    Anordnung gelang es Herrn Dr. Lohse und mir am 22. Mârz
    1871) bei ganz vorzüglicher Luft die Nichtcoincidenz der drei Wasserstofflinien
      s, H 3, und Hy, der Geissler'schen Röhre mit den entsprechenden Linien
   des Siriusspectrum zu sehen...... mit Berücksichtigung der Geschwindigkeit der
   Erde zur Zeit der Beobachtung berechnet sich die Geschwindigkeit mit welcher
   sich Sirius von der Erde bewegt zu 100 Meilen in der Secunde, wogegen Procyon
   sich 13.8 Meilen in der Secunde von unserer Erde entfermen wilrde.”

 142      Royal Society:—Dr. W. Huggins         on the  Motions  of
the vapours of these substances existing there, and that we may there
fore safely take any small displacement of either set of lines to show
a motion of the star towards or from the earth.        The lines due to
sodium are perhaps more intense, but are as narrow and defined as
the lines D, D, in the solar spectrum: they fall, however, within a
group of very fine lines; this circumstance may possibly account for
the nebulous character which has been assigned to them by some ob
Servers.
   The bright lines of sodium  were compared with spectroscope B and
eyepiece  3;  they appeared to fall very slightly above the pair in
 the star, showing that the stellar lines have been degraded by the
star's motion from the earth. The amount of displacement was esti
mated at about one fifth of the distance of D, from D, which is
probably rather smaller than the true amount. This estimation would
give a velocity of separation of 37 miles per second. At the time
of observation the earth was moving from the star at about 15 miles
 per second, leaving 29 miles to be due to the star.
   When magnesium was compared, a shift in the same direction, and
corresponding in extent to about the same velocity of recession, was
observed; but in consequence of other lines in the star at this place,
the former estimation, based on the displacement of the lines of
sodium, was considered to be more satisfactory.
   Rigel.—The lines of hydrogen are strong in the spectrum of this
star, and are suitable for comparison.
   The line H 3 is not so broad as it appears in the spectrum of
Sirius, but is stronger than F in the solar spectrum: this line was
compared by means of spectroscope C and eyepieces 2 and 3. The
line of terrestrial hydrogen falls above the middle of the line in the
star; the star is therefore receding from the earth. The velocity of
recession may be estimated as rather smaller than Sirius, probably
about 30 miles per second, the earth at the time of observation
moving from the star with a velocity of 15 miles, leaving about 15
miles as due to the star. This estimate is probably rather smaller
than the true velocity of the star.
   Castor.—The spectra of the two component stars of this double
star blend in the spectroscope into one spectrum. The line H 3 is
rather broad, nearly as much so as the same line in the spectrum of
Sirius.
   The narrow line of rarefied hydrogen was compared in spectro
scope   B with eyepiece 3; it appeared to fall on the more refran
gible side of the middle of the line in the star, leaving more of the
dark line on the side towards the red.        The shift seemed to be
rather greater than that in Sirius, and may probably be taken at
from 40 to 45 miles per second    ; but the earth's orbital motion was
nearly 17 miles from the star,    thus leaving about 25 miles for the
apparent velocity of the star.    This result rests at present on obser
vations on one night only, but    they seemed at the time to be satis
factory.
   Regulus.--The line at F rather broad. The corresponding line of
hydrogen falls on the more refrangible side of the middle of the dark

the star of from 40 to 50 miles per second, to which must be added
3.9 miles for the earth’s motion from the star.
   a Cygni.-The hydrogen line at F in the spectrum of this star
is narrower than in the spectrum of Sirius and of a Lyrae, though
probably rather broader than the same line in the solar spectrum.
I  have at present observations made on two evenings only, on both of
which the state of the air was unfavourable for the comparison of this
line with that of terrestrial hydrogen.     They give to the star a
motion of   approach  of about 30 miles per  second, which would have
to be increased by 9 miles, the velocity at the time of the earth from
 the star.
   Pollur.—The lines of magnesium and those of sodium are very
distinct in the spectrum of this star. As the air was not very steady
at the time of my observations,          I
                                     found it more satisfactory to use
for comparison the lines of magnesium, which are rather stronger than
those of sodium. The three lines of magnesium appeared to be less
refrangible than the corresponding dark lines in the spectrum of the
star by about one sixth of the interval from Mg, to Mg,. This esti
mation would represent a velocity of approach equal to about 32
miles per second.    The earth's motion from the star was 17.5 miles,
which increases the apparent velocity of approach to 49 miles per
second.     On one evening only was the air favourable enough for
a numerical estimate, but the observations were entered in my ob
servatory-book as satisfactory.
   a Ursae majoris.-The spectrum of this star is different from
the spectra of the other bright stars of this constellation. The line
at F is not so strong, while the lines at b are more distinct, and are
sufficiently strong for comparison with the bright lines of magnesium.
The bright lines of this metal fall on the less refrangible side of the
dark lines, and show a motion of approach of from 35 to 50 miles
per second.     The earth's motion of 11.8 miles from the star must be
added.
    y Leonis and s Boötis.-In both these double stars the com
pound spectrum due to the light of both component stars was ob
served. Both stars are most conveniently compared with magne
sium.    I do not consider my observations of these stars as quite
satisfactory, but they seem to show a movement of approach; but
further observations are desirable.
   The stars y Cygni, a Pegasi, y Pegasi, and a Andromedae were
compared with hydrogen on one night only.            It is probable that
these stars are approaching the earth, but I wish to reobserve them
before any numerical estimate is given of their motion.

it   seems probable           that y Cassiopeiae              has a small motion              of reces
sion.
   In the calculation of the estimated velocities the wave-lengths em
ployed are those given by Ångström in his ‘Recherches sur le spectre
solaire’ (Upsal, 1868). The velocity of light was taken at 185,000
miles per second.
   The velocities of approach and of recession which have been
assigned to the stars in this paper represent the whole of the motion
in the line of sight which exists between them and the sun. As
we know that the sun is moving in space, a certain part of these
observed velocities must be due to the solar motion.          I have not at
tempted to make this correction, because, though the direction of
the sun's motion seems to be satisfactorily ascertained, any estimate
that can be made at present of the actual velocity with which he is
advancing must rest upon suppositions, more or less arbitrary, of
the average distance of stars of different magnitudes.          It seems not
improbable that this part of the stars' motions may be larger than
would result from Otto Struve's calculations, which give, on the sup
  osition that the average parallax of a star of the first magnitude
is equal to 0"-209, a velocity but little greater than one fourth of
the earth's annual motion in its orbit.                            -
   It will be observed that, speaking generally, the stars which the
spectroscope shows to be moving from the earth (Sirius, Betelgeux,
Rigel, Procyon) are situated in a part of the heavens opposite to Her
cules, towards which the sun is advancing, while the stars in the
neighbourhood of this region, as Arcturus, Vega, a Cygni, show a
motion of approach.       There are in the stars already observed excep
tions to this general statement; and there are some other considera
tions which appear to show that the sun's motion in space is not
the only, or even in              all      may                      be

pointed out by Mr. Proctor are the stars 3, y, 3, 5, & of the Great
Bear, which have a community of proper motions", while a and m of
the same constellation have a proper motion in the opposite direction.
Now, the spectroscopic observations show that the stars 3, y, 3, 5, &
have also a common motion of recession, while the star a is approach
ing the earth. The star m, indeed, appears to be moving from us, but
it is too far from a to be regarded as a companion to that star.
    Although it was not to be expected that a concurrence would
always be found between the proper motions which indicate the ap
parent motions at right angles to the line of sight and the radial mo
tions as discovered by the spectroscope, still it is interesting to remark
that in the case of the stars Castor and Pollux, one of which is ap
proaching and the other receding, their proper motions also are
 different in direction and in amount—and further, that y Leonis,
which has an opposite radial motion to a and 3 of the same constel

    “Researches in Spectrum Analysis in connexion with the Spec
trum of the Sun.”—No. I. By J. Norman Lockyer, F.R.S.
    The author, after referring to the researches in which he has
been engaged since January 1869 in conjunction with Dr. Frank
land, refers to the evidence obtained by them as to the thickening
and thinning of spectral lines by variations of pressure, and to the
disappearance of certain lines when the method employed by them
since 1869 is used. This method consists of throwing an image of
the light-source to be examined on to the slit of the spectroscope.
    It is pointed out that the phenomena observed are of the same
nature as those already described by Stokes, W. A. Miller, Robinson,
and Thalen, but that the application of this method enables them to
be better studied, the metallic spectra being clearly separated from
that of the gaseous medium through which the spark passes. Pho
tographs of the spark, taken in air between zinc and cadmium and
zinc and tin, accompany the paper, showing that when spectra of
the vapours given off by electrodes are studied in this manner, the
vapours close to the electrode give lines which disappear from the
spectrum of the vapour at a greater distance from the electrode,
so that there appear to be long and short lines in the spectrum.
    The following elements have been mapped on this method:—
Na, Li, Mg, Al, Mn, Co, Ni, Zn, Sr, Cd, Sn, Sb, Ba, and Pb,
the lines being laid down from Thalen's maps, and the various
characters and lengths of the lines shown.

  beam; and immediately above it the broad crown terminates in two
  or more points. No tyne is thrown off on the posterior side of the
  antler, and the sweep is uninterrupted from the antler-base to the
  first point of the crown. The antlers differ in curvature and other
  wise from those of Cervus megaceros; but there is a general resem
  blance between the two animals, and the verticornis must have
  rivalled the Irish Elk in size.       A second species of Deer, the
   Cervus carnutorum,    which had been furnished by the strata of St.-
  Prest near   Chartres,  must be added to the fauna of the Forest-bed.
  The Cervidae of the Forest-bed present a remarkable mixture of
  forms, such as the Cervus polignacus, C. Sedgwickii, C. megaceros,
  C. carnutorum, C. elaphus, and C. capreolus, seeming to indicate
  that in classification the Forest-bed belongs rather to an early stage
  of the Pleistocene than to the Pliocene age. This inference is
  strongly corroborated by the presence of the Mammoth, which is so
  characteristic of the Pleistocene age.
     3. “The Classification of the Pleistocene Strata of Britain and
 the Continent by means of the Mammalia.”        By W. Boyd Dawkins,
 Esq., M.A., F.R.S., F.G.S.
     The Pleistocene deposits may be divided into three groups:—1st,
 that in which the Pleistocene immigrants lived, with some of the
 southern and Pliocene animals in Britain, France, and Germany, and
 in which no arctic mammalia had arrived ; 2nd, that in which the
 characteristic Pliocene Cervidae had disappeared, and the Elephas
 meridionalis and Rhinoceros etruscus had been driven south; 3rd,
 that in which the true arctic mammalia were the chief inhabitants.
     This third or late Pleistocene division must be far older than any
 Prehistoric deposits, as the latter often rest on the former, and are
 composed of different materials; but the difference offered by the
 fauna is the most striking. In the Pleistocene river-deposits twenty
 eight species have been found, the remains of man being associated
 with the Lion, Hippopotamus, Mammoth, Wolf, and Reindeer. On
 examining the fauna from the ossiferous caves, we find the same
 group of animals, with the exception of the Musk-sheep; and it is
 therefore evident that the cave-fauna is identical with that of the
 river strata, and must be referred to the same period. Some few
 animals, however, which would naturally haunt caves, are peculiar
to them, as the Cave-bear, Wild Cat, Leopard, &c.
     The magnitude of the break in time between the Prehistoric and
late Pleistocene period may be gathered also from the disappearance
in the interval of no less than nireteen species.
    The middle division of the Pleistocene mammalia, or that from
which the Pliocene Cervida had disappeared and been replaced by
invading temperate forms, is represented in Great Britain by the
deposits of the Lower Brick-earths of the Thallies valley, and the
older deposits in Kent's Hole and Oreston. The discovery, by the
Rev. O. Fisher, of a flint-flake in the undisturbed Lower Brick-earth
at Crayford proves that man must have been living at this time.

                     the Classification      of Pleistocene Strata.               151
The mammalia from these deposits are linked to the Pliocene by
the Rh. megarhinus, and to the late Pleistocene by the Ovibos mos
chatus. The presence of Machaerodus latidens in Kent's Hole, and
of the Rh. megarhinus in the cave at Oreston, tends to the conclu
sion that some of the caves in the south of England contain a fauna
that was living before the late Pleistocene age. The whole assem
blage of middle Pleistocene animals evinces a less severe climate
than in the late Pleistocene times.
   The fossil bones from the Forest-bed of Norfolk and Suffolk show
that in the early Pleistocene mammalia there was a great mixture
of Pleistocene and Pliocene species.     It is probable also that the
period was one of long duration; for in it we find two animals which
are unknown on the continent, implying that the lapse of time was
sufficiently great to allow of the evolution of forms of animal life
hitherto unknown, and which disappeared before the middle and
late Pleistocene stages.
   The author criticised M. Lartet's classification of the Late Pleis
tocene or Quaternary period by means of the Cave-bear, Mammoth,
Reindeer, and Aurochs, and urged that, since the remains of all these
animals were intimately associated in the caves of France, Germany,
and Britain, and, so far as we know, the first two appeared and
disappeared together and the last two lived on into the Prehistoric
age, they did not afford a basis for a chronology.
   The latest of the three divisions of the British Pleistocene fauna
is widely spread through France, Cermany, and Russia, from the
English Channel to the shores of the Mediterranean.      The Middle
Pleistocene is represented by a river-deposit in Auvergne, and by a
cave in the Jura, in which the presence of the Machaerodus latidens,
and a non-tichorine    Rhinoceros, and the absence of the charac
teristic arctic group  of the late Pleistocene and of   the peculiar   all
animals   of   the early Forest-bed           stage, prove that that era must      be
Middle Pleistocene. The Early Pleistocene division   represented       is
inFrance        by
              the river-deposit Chartres, being characterized by
                                             at
the presence        of   two non-Pliocine      animals, Trogontherium and Cervus
Carnutorum.

the animals:—the northern, into which the southern forms never
penetrated, the latitude of Yorkshire being the boundary of the
advance of the southern animals; the southern, into which the
northern species never passed, a line passing through the Alps and
Pyrenees being the limit of the range of the northern animals;
and an intermediate area, in which the two are found mingled
together.
   Two out of the three zones are proved by the physical evidence of
the Pleistocene strata.
   We see by the discoveries of Dr. Bryce, Mr. Jameson, and others,
that the Pleistocene mammalia must have invaded Europe during
the first Glacial period before the submergence; for the Reindeer
and the Mammoth have been found in Scotland under the deposits
of the Boulder-clay.     Dr. Falconer and ethers have also discovered
the latter animal in the preg'acial Forest-bed.    The Glacial period
can therefore no longer be looked on as a hard and fast barrier sepa
rating   one fauna from another.    If man be treated as a Pleistocene
animal, there is reason to believe that he formed one of the North
Asiatic group, which was certainly in possession of Northern and
 Central Europe in Preglacial times.
   The Pleistocene mammalia may again be divided into three
 groups—those which came from Northern and Central Asia, those
from Africa, and those which were living in the same area in the
Pliocene age.     Had not the animals which lived in Europe, during
the Pliocene    age, been insulated from those which invaded Europe
from   Asia,  by  some impassable barrier, the latter would occur in
 our Pliocene strata as well as the former.   Such a barrier is offered
by the northern extension of the Caspian up the valley of the Obi
to the Arctic Sea.    The animals of Northern and Central Asia could
 not pass  westwards until the barrier was removed by the elevation
 of the sea-bottom between the Caspian and the Urals.
   The same argument holds good as to the African mammalia,
 which could not have passed into Sicily, Spain, or Britain without a
 northward extension of the African mainland.
   The relation of the Pleistocene to the Pliocene fauna is a ques
tion of great difficulty.   If the Pliocene fauna be compared with
that of the Forest-bed, it will be seen that the difference between
 them is very great. The Pliocene Mastodon ald Tapir, and most of
the Cervidae, are replaced by forms such as the Roe and Red Deer,
unknown until then; but many of the Pliocene animals were able
to hold their ground against the Pleistocene invaders, although they
were ultimately beaten in the struggle for existence by the new
comers. The fauna which the author adopted as typically Pliocene
is that furnished by the lacustrine strata of Auvergne, the marine
sands of Montpellier, and the older fluviatile strata of the Wal
d’Arno.

A LETTER          addressed to me by Dr. Sprengel under date of No
      vember 1st, 1872, in which he says, “Perhaps it will not have
escaped your observation, that the invention of the water air-pump,
which you have constructed after the principle of my mercury air
pump, according to your paper published in 1868 on the Washing
of Precipitates, is almost everywhere attributed to you,” induces -

final result, therefore, after an action of a certain duration, must
differ according to whether one of the elements separated is solid,
liquid, or gaseous at the surrounding temperature, and must depend
on the more or less elevated temperature produced by the passage of
the spark, as well as the recompositions which may be effected in
the vicinity of the latter.  M. Thenard placed himself in conditions
such that the calorific action extended only the least distance
possible around the electrified points.   Instead of sparks bursting
forth in a eudiometric tube, he made use of the electrical effluvium
—that is to say, more or less obscure discharges produced from
place to place among the gaseous particles themselves.        For this
purpose he had recourse to the simple and ingenious arrangement
of apparatus devised by M. Houzeau for the production of ozone,
as the conditions necessary to that allotropic transformation of
oxygen appeared similar to those which he proposed to utilize.
This arrangement permitted him, besides, to submit to the electric
influence successively and in distinct portions any volumes what
ever of gas or vapour.
   Several important additions to and modifications of this mode of
oxperimentation have been made by M. Armould Thenard, and very
carefully studied for the purpose of ascertaining the most favour
able conditions for the production of ozone as well as for the de
composition of carbonic acid. . His observations led him to perceive
that it is preferable to produce the electric effluvium between
smooth surfaces of glass instead of between metallic conduc
tors.    He likewise saw that the action of electricity disaggre
gates glass at       its
                   surface, covering        with fine powder which ends

that the oxygen proceeding from the decomposition of carbonic
acid in the apparatus in question was sensibly ozonized.         must    It
be remarked that the decomposition of carbonic acid by electricity
in these circumstances is effected at apparently a very low tempe
rature, and that this seems to be the first time that an approxima
tion has been made to conditions analogous to those of the decom
position of that gas by green leaves under the influence of the- light
of the sun.
  It  would be desirable that these new experiments, which have
been made with much care, and the principal results of which we
have been able to verify, should be extended to other gases and
vapours—the electric intensities being varied between wider limits,
as well as the surrounding temperature and the velocity of the
gaseous currents.
   Physico-chemical researches directed to the modifications caused
by electricity in simple substances and in compounds present great
scientific interest; for they may elucidate the question, still so ob
scure, of the allotropy of simple bodies, and may lead to the expla
nation of the decomposition undergone by certain compounds in the
organism.—Comptes, Rendus de l'Acad. des Sciences, vol. lxxv. pp.

           GREAT BAROMETRIC               DEPRESSION OF JANUARY.
   On the 16th of January, 1873, a fall of the barometer of no or
dinary magnitude set in at several stations in the north-west of
Europe. This fall became more general on the 17th, was fully
established, except at Biarritz, on the 18th, and continued with such
rapidity that at sixteen stations the fall exceeded 1 inch of mercury
between 8 A.M. of the 18th and 8 A.M. of the 19th.      In the evening
of this day a violent gale from the south-west accompanied this rapid
fall. Except at a few stations in France, the minimum reading (below
29 inches) occurred on the 20th.     The following readings at Thurso,
in the north of Scotland, will show the extent of the entire fall;
while those at Toulon will indicate the extensive area over which
the fall occurred.

   It is noteworthy that in 1872 a somewhat similar depression oc
curred on January 17–18. The recorded minima were as follows:–
Kew, 28:90; Falmouth, 28:75; Valencia, 28.50; Aberdeen, 28.09;
Glasgow, 28:08; Stonyhurst, 28-07; Armagh, 28.06. In 1871 a
similar depression occurred on January 15–16, the minima being as
follows:—Kew, 28.878; Falmouth, 28.769; Stonyhurst, 28:592;
Aberdeen, 28.411; Glasgow, 28-313; Valencia, 28-198; Armagh,
28-176.    In 1870 a depression occurred on January 14, minima as
follows:–Kew, 29.40; Falmouth, 29-30; Walencia, 29:15; Aber
deen, 29.00; Glasgow, 28.85; Stonyhurst, 28.80; Armagh, 28:75.
In 1869 a depression occurred on January 14–15, minima as fol
lows:—Kew, 29.55; Aberdeen, 29.50; Glasgow, 29:25; Falmouth,
29:15; Armagh, 29.05; Stonyhurst, 29.05; Valencia,              28.85.
These depressions taking place so nearly at the same epoch in five
consecutive years, appear to indicate that about this time in January
there is a tendency to a great reduction of pressure- over Western
 Europe.
    The above may be interesting at the present time, especially as
 the last great depression is so recent.

ON   THE THERMAL EFFECTS                     OF MAGNETIZATION.                          BY   J.   MOUTIER.
   The experiments of MM. Jamin and Roger have shown that
the intermittent passage of a current in the wire of an electromag
net produces heat: heat is developed at the interruption of the
circuit; it is due to the vanishing of the temporary magnetism of
the electromagnet.     M. Cazin has lately announced", after new
experiments, that the heat thus produced is proportional to the
square of the intensity of the magnetism and to the polar distance.                                            I
have sought to account for this simple law by theoretical consider
ations.
   M. Clausiust has demonstrated the following theorem relative
to the stationary motion of a system of points—that is to say, a
motion in which the position and the velocity of each point do not
continually change in one and the same direction, but remain com
prised within certain limits:—The mean vis viva of the system is
equal to    virial. The virial, which      questions   mechanics plays
                                                                                is of

                         to    the  potential,

any two points      the system
                       of            the force which acts between those

   The subject of Mr. Moon's paper (Phil. Mag. vol. xlv. p. 38)
deserves consideration physically as well as mathematically.         The
formula for the intensity must necessarily embrace two factors, viz.
one representing the number of waves (of a given length), and the
                                                                 º:
other giving the amplitude of the vibration of the particle of aether
under consideration in each particular wave.
   In regard to the former, the Astronomer Royal's assumption as
to intensity of light from two candles                perfectly alike) is
obviously legitimate; at the same time          conceive (Mr. Moon's   I
view) that the “amplitude of the vibration” (not           square) truly            its
represents the other factor      the intensity formula.

XX.       On the Optics of Mirage.               By Professor EveRETT,              M.A.,
                         D.C.L.,    Queen's     College, Belfast”.
I       PROPOSE in    the present paper to investigate some of the
     principles which govern the formation of images in a medium
of continuously varying index of refraction, with special reference
to the phenomena of mirage and atmospheric refraction.
   I. I shall first establish the following proposition:—
   In a medium in which the absolute index of refraction varies
continuously, the path of a ray will in general be curved; and                               its
curvature     -     at   any point   is   given      by    the formula

   denoting distance measured along the normal towardsthe centre
of N   curvature, and therefore                denoting rate        of              in
                                         dN                              increase        the
direction of the centre            of curvature.
   The simplest proof               of   this important proposition           is derived
from the principle that                   varies inversely               the velocity        of
                                                                    as
                                     a                              v
light.
  Draw normal planes      ray     two consecutive points
                                    to
                                    a           at                                      of   its
path. Then the distance    their intersection from either point
                                         of
will     be   p,
        the radius   curvature.of  But these normal planes are
tangential         to   the wave-front         in    its   two consecutive    positions.

a    point in the plane of maximum index; but the law of index
there deduced involves similar consequences for rays emanating
from any other point; for the substitution of a + tra for a in
equation (F) merely changes the sign of y.   Hence rays diver
ging from a point (w, y) will converge to a focus at the point
(a+Tra, -y), then to another focus at the point                                                   (a   +2"ra, y),
and so on.
      thus appears that in a medium in which the law (E) pre
        It
vails, every object will yield a series of real images, alternately
inverted and erect, tra being their common distance asunder in
a direction parallel to the plane of maximum index; while, as
regards distances measured normal to the plane of maximum
index, each image in the series corresponds to the reflected

image of       predecessor with respect        this plane.                    to                            It    is   of

     2.Distant objects seen inverted above their true positions.
Some instances        this formof    mirage are described of      Vince                           by                in
the “Bakerian Lecture,” Phil. Trans. 1799; many more are
described              by
               Scoresby from his observations      the Arctic re                       in

               calm water.   Usually two images are seen, namely
an  erect image     the true   what appears

inverted image is visible when the erect image is hidden by the
convexity of the intervening water.
   Earplanation.—A very rapid inerease of temperature upwards in
a stratum of air overhead.   The inverted images are formed by
rays incident from below upon this stratum at such an obliquity
that (as explained in W.) they cannot get through, but are com
pelled to descend again, and thus undergo a kind of reflection.
The upward increase is supposed to be more sudden here than
in (1), and confined to a thinner stratum.
   3. Multiple images seen above the true position of the object.
   Eaglanation.—Either several strata of rapid upward increase
of temperature, each of them, as in (2), fulfilling the office of a
mirror, or a single such stratum of irregular shape, yielding re
flections in different places.
   4. An appearance as of architectural columns, obelisks, spires,
or basaltic cliffs. Such appearances are said to be common in
the illusions of the Fata Morgana at the Straits of Messina;
and many instances are described, with illustrative plates, in
Scoresby’s “Greenland.” Such appearances are always due to
the vertical magnification of real objects.
   Eaplanation.—In the arrangements of III. and VI. an object
at a short distance in front of or behind a focus conjugate to
the position of the observer's eye, will be greatly magnified in
the vertical direction,             its
                           vertical diameter being seen under the
same angle           as
                 the eye were
                       if         this conjugate focus.
                                               at           between                 If
the eye and the first conjugate  focus,    will appear  erect;
                                                          it     be                       if
tween the first and the second conjugate focus, inverted.                                       I
believe that, when vertical magnification     exhibited with any    is
thing like regularity,    arrangement approximately resembling
                                    an
that described    (VI.) prevails

tween the observer and the objects magnified.
   The same appearance      often seen
                                     is                        on
                                          land (small bushes, for
example, being magnified into tall trees), and          similarly         is   to   be
explained.

XXI.      Correction to a Paper “On an Eaperimental Determina
     tion of the Relation between the Energy and Apparent Intensity
     of Sounds of different Pitch.” By R. H. M. Bosanquer,
     Fellow of St. John's College, Oaford+.
IN directly,
    the      paper above referred to it was
                by experiment, the following
                                                          sought to establish
                                                      relation:—“The ap
parent intensity of a musical note is proportional to the mecha
 nical energy expended in the production of the tone, and                 in
versely as the wave-length or periodic time.”      At the end of
the   paper  certain deductions were made from this law, with
reference to the relations connecting amplitude, pitch, and pe
riodic time with apparent intensity. The writer has to acknow
ledge with regret that the reasoning of this latter portion is
erroneous. The error does not seem to be very obvious, as no
one has yet pointed it out, to the writer’s knowledge. It was
intended to wait until some measures could be completed by an
improved method, and to make a more complete communication.
But as the performance of this has been unavoidably delayed,
and the writer finds the erroneous result quoted as correct by
Dr. Mayer, in his interesting paper, Phil. Mag. Feb. 1873, it is
desirable that the mistake should be corrected at once.
    The error committed was precisely of the nature against which
a warning was given on the last page of the paper.          It was
assumed that the energy of the vibration of the plate of air con

at one end of a straight cylindrical tube having the given section.
The waves then traverse the cylinder without sensible diminution
of intensity, if we neglect the influence of the walls.    Let the
delivery of the sound commence at the beginning of a second

 course, occurs in the lunar and planetary       theories, but with this
 difference: there the    difficulty is introduced by the method of
 solving the differential equation, and is avoided by modifying            *
 the first approximation to a solution; here it is inherent in the
differential equation, and can only be avoided by making that
equation express more completely the physical circumstances of
the motion.      One or more of the assumptions on which the dif
ferential equation rests is invalid.         We must look either to
terms of   higher   orders of  smallness,  to resistance of the air, or
to internal friction. With the modifications due to the last
cause We are now concerned.
    The approximate effect of internal friction is probably to
add to the stress          produced by the strain
                     Eg.                              # when    the parts
of the body are relatively at rest,    a term  proportional to the rate
at which the strain is changing;       so that the stress when       there
is relative   motion will

    The solution of this equation will contain two classes of terms.
First,  a series corresponding to those under the sign of summa
tion in (2), which principally differ from (2) in the coefficients
decreasing in geometrical progression with the time, the highest
fastest, and in the total absence of the notes above a certain
order as periodic terms; these terms we may consider as wholly
resulting from the initial conditions, and as having no perma
nent effect on the motion.        Second, a term corresponding to the
first term of   (2), and which expresses the state of steady vibra
tion when work enough is continually done by the forced vibra
tion of the extremity to maintain a constant amplitude. The
investigation of this term is a little more troublesome, because the
motion is periodic, the effect of friction being to alter the motion
in a manner dependent on the position of the point, not on the
time, and equation (3) cannot be satisfied by a sine or a cosine
alone of the time.
    Assume           f=f(a) sin mt---      (a)cos mt,
or a series  of such terms, if possible, each pair satisfying equa

    We infer that the energy imparted to the string varies as the
square of the amplitude of vibration of the extremity, that it
rapidly increases as the period approaches that of the string,
that, if these periods differ materially, the work is directly pro
 portional to the friction and increases rapidly with the number
 of vibrations—but that if the periods are identical, the work
varies inversely as the friction, the diminishing of the friction
 being more than counterbalanced by the increased amplitude.
     It is interesting to examine how this energy is distributed
 over the string.     This is easily done by writing down the work
 done   by  one portion  of the string from w to l, on the remainder
 from 0 to a, and then taking the differential; we readily find that

XXIII.           On the Action of Solid Bodies on [Gaseous] Supersatu
                   rated Solutions.   By F. C. HeNR1c1+.
        O. 52 of the Naturforscher (1869) gave a short account
          of numerous experiments by Mr. Tomlinson on the action
of solids on supersaturated solutions, as brought before the Che
mical Society.        The views which Mr. Tomlinson has founded
thereon, and which in their exposition called forth some objec
tions, do not appear to me to follow from the phenomena; and
as some experiments of my own strengthened my objections,                                                              I
determined to investigate the matter fully.           I have limited my
numerous experiments to gas-impregnated water, a limitation
which can have no injurious effect on the inquiry.
     It is necessary first of                                                                            we

                       the air-molecules.      There      also under the             is

 are wanting.        Hence,     the water contain too little air,

carbonic acid. The gas was generated           means     common            by                of
effervescing powders, which enabled me       impregnate the water         to

to the required strength, and made me independent of the va
riations which constantly occur in spring-water*.         By the use
of small quantities of the powder and the before-mentioned solids
immersed in the water, as soon as it became clear the action was
very decided, so that decreasing quantities of the powder were
cufficient to cause the solids to be covered with innumerable
bubbles as soon as they were immersed.         A fuller impregnation
of the water  produced   a lively effervescence.  The results are so
beautiful as to leave nothing to be desired.      Moreover the car
bonic acid remains a remarkably long-time in the water.           In
less than two cubic inches of carbonic-acid water, brass and silver
wires acted after twenty-four hours and produced an abundant
separation      of bubbles.
   Since, by frequent repetitions of these experiments, the same
results were always obtained, and as I had bestowed the greatest
care on the cleansing of the submerged solids, I am fully con
vinced that solids made perfectly clean, coming into contact
with gas-impregnated water, is a necessary condition for the
unequivocal production of the phenomena in question.      This is
in direct opposition to the hitherto received view, according to
which unclean, and especially dusty surfaces, produce the sepa
ration of the bubbles in question.      This view does not seem to
have been submitted to    rigid proof,  but rather to have been sup
ported by a solitary experiment.       If a given surface, such as a
silver wire, a glass rod, &c., be submitted to the action of a small
flame of spirits of wine, such a surface will scarcely act, or not
act at all, in separating gas.   Hence it has been concluded that
                                                            so as by

clean.    This conclusion, however, follows      little from the pre
mises, that the flame produces only       change  a   the covering and in
converts   itinto carbon or ash. This consideration has led me
to  inquire further into the matter; and the following are the
results:—

will be found to contain minute furrows, and if plunged into
aérated water will be immediately covered with innumerable
scarcely visible bubbles which arrange themselves in the furrows;
while on the first wire less numerous and, on that account, more
quickly growing bubbles appear.           In the same way behaves a
strongly oxidized zinc wire that has long been exposed to the
air, the minute roughnesses of which are easily detected by rub
bing with the finger; only in this case the furrows are absent.
An oxidized brass wire, as compared with one free from oxide,
shows, on the contrary, no great difference.
    It has been already remarked that the temperature has a great
influence on the quantity of gas held in solution. If of two
volumes of equally impregnated water one be warmed, there is
a diminution of attraction between the air and water particles, and
also in the expansive force of both ; supersaturation sets in; and if
this already existed, it is increased.       Hence in air- or carbonic
acid-impregnated water, it may happen that no bubbles can be
separated, but if gently heated by a small flame, or a warm metal
plate, the action sets in at once. By this simple means soda-water
or spring-water that has long been exposed to the air and appa
rently of no further use, may again be brought into activity.       In
water   kept   until the next   day,  in which no bubbles can be  sepa
rated (as is almost always the case), a gentle heating causes them
 to appear anew and swell out in large numbers.
     The experiments with oxidized zinc wire and with scratched
 brass wire plainly show how important is the mechanical con
 dition of the surface on the liberation of gas. It was very
 interesting to notice the action of the parts of these sap-containing
 plants the surface of which is slightly rough, such as the stems
 of the strawberry, milfoil or common yarrow, birch leaves with
 their peduncles, &c. When these were immersed in the air- or
 carbonic-acid-impregnated water, their minute projecting points
 were quickly covered with numerous bubbles, which took up an
  enormous quantity. The phenomenon was very interesting in
 water weakly impregnated with air and carbonic acid, when this
  was gently warmed.       As the bubbles gradually formed, they were
  from the first   easily seen;   the smallest appeared on the finest
  hairs of the  pine  or Scotch  fir, which were entirely covered with
  them, and in sunshine displayed a brilliant show of colours.
     These oft-repeated experiments convinced me that the air
  bubbles at the moment of their appearance are so small as to
  be invisible, and by slow growth attain a visible size.      How the
  cohesion of the liquid at any given point within it (as is required
  by the origin of a bubble) is overcome, cannot be made a matter
  of observation; but that this takes place by means of the
  slight roughnesses of the surface, fine points, &c., cannot, ac

188             M. F. C. Henrici             on the Action      of Solid       Bodies
cording to my experiment, be doubted.        Once admit the origin
of a  bubble, an enclosing liquid surface is thus created, into the
hollow space of which other bubbles can penetrate, as continually
happens at the free outer surface of the liquid, where the air
particles can follow the bent of their force of expansion upwards.
    The bubbles have, as a rule, so far as       have been able to   I
make out, a spherical form ; but they assume, in consequence
of rapid growth, especially when thick together, an elongated
form.    In this case              I
                          have not remarked that they coalesce
 (a plain proof of the tenacity of the boundary walls), but they
rather, when they have attained a certain size, become detached
and ascend.     Nor are the bubbles in actual contact with the
operating surfaces, which may be accounted for by the adhesion
of the liquid to the wet surfaces, whereby the fluid particles
lose to a great extent their mobility; and hence it is intelligible
why the bubbles cling with such remarkable tenacity to the
surfaces: the smaller ones can scarcely be loosened by striking
the vessel, and it is not till they have attained a certain size
that they acquire ascensional force sufficient to detach them;
so that on perpendicular or oblique surfaces they often ascend
with diminished speed”.    The nature of the surface seems from
these results to have an influence. The bubbles do not attain
so large a size on glass as on metal; the attraction between
glass and water must be less than between metal and water,
and hence the water particles would have less adhesion to glass.

of the smallest bubbles were continually reflected from the under side                              of

test-glass.  Fragments of carbonate of soda, saltpetre, common
salt, &c. descended in concentrated streams visible to the eye.
During this descent and before the solution had time to accu
mulate at the bottom of the jar and diffuse through the liquid,
numerous bubbles separated on introducing a glass rod or silver
wire; and this continued long in action, although only very small
fragments of the salt were used. On using caustic alkali on air
impregnated water, there arose an opaque cloud of the finest
bubbles as the saline streams descended; and this cloud slowly
ascended and disappeared.    The further course of the experi
ment was as with the other salts.  This experiment was tried
with water that had been boiled; but it is needless to add that
nothing followed.
   The well-known phenomenon will be remembered, where an
effervescent wine, in which, after standing some time, bubbles
no longer rise, foams when the glass is struck or agitated, and
slight condensations of gas appear on the surface.    If a blow be
struck on the side of the glass with a rod of wood, bubbles
immediately appear at the point struck.
   De Luc referred these phenomena to the film of air which
covers    all
            bodies exposed    the atmosphere.

tuents is indeed always connected. Only in the case in which the
gas in solution unites chemically with the solid so as to form a
gaseous body, could there be a separation of gas-bubbles.
   There are many bodies which have for gases a strong conden
sing force or power of absorption, such, for example, as charcoal
for carbonic acid. But their great porosity and numerous points
and roughnesses (which soon exhaust their absorbing powers)
render them scarcely available for experiments of this kind.                                       I
have endeavoured to prepare a piece of charcoal by plunging
it red-hot into previously boiled water and keeping it immersed
some days with occasional heating.     On plunging it into highly
impregnated water, only a few solitary bubbles appeared on                                        its
surface, while    silver wire similarly immersed was completely

of  carbonic  acid, produced       bubbles, notwithstanding the

acquainted    were proved by Lambert in the Berlin Memoirs for
1761; he has there shown that the tangent of every rational are
 (viz. arc commensurable with the unit arc, equal to radius) is
irrational, and that the tangents of          angles commensurable                            all
with   a right angle, except tan 45°, are irrational.  From the first
of    these results                it      follows that                     T       is    irrational (since tan                *=        1);

  It       is not essential that the exponents of the powers of q
should be  given  by an algebraical  formula   p(n); the reasoning
is equally successful when  they are the series of prime  numbers,
or of their squares, cubes, &c.
  I  need scarcely remark that the sole condition for the success
of the method is that the groups of 0’s or 9’s do not circulate;
so long as this is the case the signs + may occur in the terms
in any order.     A good example is afforded by the product
(1-q) (1–q") (1–4°)...,                              which Euler proved to be equal to

XXV.   On a Method of Testing Submarine Telegraph Cables during
   Paying-out.   By Thomas T. P. BRUCE WARREN, Electrician
   to Hooper's Telegraph Works, Limited; Member of the Society
  of Telegraph Engineers *.
IT    is a singular circumstance that although within the last
      few years we have become, as it were, inundated with new
appliances for testing submarine telegraph-cables  during their
manufacture, so little has been effected towards the improve
ment of electrical testing during the paying-out.
    Apart from the uncertainty which has lately been shown to
exist in galvanometric measurements themselves, there are many
little difficulties to encounter when testing on board ship, which
at times are so embarrassing as to make one forego a very large
share of confidence in the results. The electrical condition of
the cable must consequently be a matter of great anxiety, until
a steady observation     enables the electrician to decide that every
thing is     all
             right.
   The practice has hitherto been               make the duties   to      the                            at
shore station too subsidiary         matter      the system

instead      relying upon the results obtained
             of                                                shore                     on                  as   of
primary importance. Considering the facilities offered when
the instruments are perfectly           rest and consequently admit
                                                      at                                                          of
much more accurate adjustment and indication than                   possible                   is
 on  the ship,          evident that we should look

observations with        equal,  an  not greater interest.

   In  the present systems          testing, the shore operations have

                    formulated that any separate              independent               or
observation      quite
                   is     inadmissible,     and,   unless   distinctly    and
definitely preconcerted                by
                               the ship, would lead        serious results.         to

any modified operation required            the ship; and either the ship

   The electrician has        provide  tofor two kinds       faults, one                of                        of

         Mr. T. T. P. B. Warren             on a Method   of Testing
   Not to rely solely upon the electrometer for the measure
ments of tensions, a modification of the condenser method pre
viously described, and which will serve equally well to convey
continuity-signals to the ship, will supply a check-measurement
of these tensions, and in a way so as to give at once continuity
indication to the ship and the tension in volts to the shore
observer.
   The charge abstracted from the cable in one condenser is sent
through a delicate galvanometer in one direction, simultaneously
that a condenser of similar capacity, charged to the same tension
from a constant battery, flows in the other direction; a current
will be perceptible on the galvanometer flowing from one con
denser to the other, should they not be charged to the same
tension.   The changes due to the galvanometer itself will not
interfere; and thus not only will a considerable amount of irk
some testing and calculating be avoided, but the results them
selves be more accurate.
   These tensions will be telegraphed to the ship at stated times.
The tension of the ship's battery will be carefully measured on a
 delicate portable electrometer on board ship for comparison with
the results sent from the shore station.     The fall of tension on
the cable can then be simultaneously noted on the shore as well
as on the ship; and during this time the continuity-signals
need not be interrupted, as the sensibility of the ship's elec
trometer will allow the small impulses to be noted, but, instead
of in a current form, either by regular and equal abstrac
tions of charge, or by the shore attendant at stated times re
storing the full tension. This, in addition to forming a perfect
continuity-signal, will at once indicate to the ship the loss ob
served on shore during any specificd space of time.     In the same
way the ship may inform the shore observer; and both will be
able to verify or compare their results.
   Any difference of tension can thus be instantly communicated
from shore to ship, or vice versä, without the necessity of sig
malling the results as noted by the sliding resistances or by the
condenser method; the signal itself will convey        the data re
                                                            all
quired  by  the ship, should this difference        of
                                                tension arise from
the existence      of
                    fault.

every case    bemade with the constant cells     Mr. Latimer Clark.

Now the    ship  and the shore   doing  this  independently     each   of
other, should still arrive   the same result,

remains right; but      inthe event     slight fault occurring, the
                                        of   a
two results will not coincide, and the difference observed will
correspond    to the magnitude       the fault; and

difficulty should be considerably diminished in localizing small
faults.
    The balancing of the ship's battery on the shore-electrometer
by a similar battery stationed on shore, should be done either
with a set of ordinary resistance-coils, or, preferably, by a set of
Sir William Thomson's resistance-slides.
    The points for consideration are, that the battery which has
 the highest potential should be bridged over with a resistance
sufficiently high, so that it may be impossible to produce any ap
preciable alteration whilst the test is being applied”. The same
remark applies to the constant cells employed to balance the dis
 charge from the condenser used for the continuity-signals; for
 this purpose, too, it will be useful occasionally to take the con
 denser-tensions on the quadrant-electrometer with the resistance
 slide and constant cells in opposition. The insulation of the
 condensers should be so perfect that no loss can be perceptible
 during the time of making these tests; and they should also,
 on this account, be properly and completely charged, whether
 from the cable or batteries.    When using the condensers with
  the ship's electrometer for continuity-signals to ship, it is equally
 important that they should be completely discharged.         Any ten
dency      in the condensers to give too great residual discharges
should be carefully studied beforehand, and their effect on the
portable electrometer well noted.
   The constant cells used on the ship and on shore, and also
the electrometers, should                    all
                                  very carefully compared

at the seat      of the shot, it follows that in such a system of rifling
the studs may have scarcely any work to do at the muzzle, while
they may be severely strained at the commencement of motion.
  6. If then, the defect of the ordinary or uniform system of rifling
be that the studs are severely strained at the first instants of
motion and are insignificantly strained at the instant of quitting
the gun, it is obvious that it is possible to remove this inequality
and at the same time allow the projectile to leave the bore with
the same angular velocity by reducing the twist at the seat of
the shot and gradually increasing it until it gains the desired
 angle at the muzzle.    In fact, if we know the law according to
which the pressure of the powder varies throughout the bore, it
is theoretically possible to devise a system of rifling which shall
give a uniform pressure on the studs throughout the bore.
   7. These reasons doubtless led the late Ordnance Select Com
mittee, to whom the application of the increasing twist to the
service guns is due, to propose                    its

   21. I proceed to apply these formulae, and propose to examine
what are the pressures actually required to give rotation to a
400-lb. projectile, fired from a 10-inch gun with battering charges,
under the following conditions:—1st. If the gun be rifled with
an increasing twist as at present.      2nd. If it be rifled with a
uniform pitch, the projectile in both cases being supposed to
have the same angular velocity on quitting the gun.          As the
calculations for the uniform     pitch are the simpler,  I shall take
this case first.
   22.  I have before remarked that with a uniform twist the
pressure on the studs of the projectile is a constant fraction of
that on the base of the shot, and represents, so to speak, on a
reduced scale, the pressure existing at any point in the bore of
the gun.   Calling the fraction in equation (17) C, we have

   24. The results in the Table show the pressures required to give
rotation, if the 10-inch gun be rifled on a uniform twist. I turn
now to the rifling as it actually exists, and which is defined to
be a parabolic twist, commencing with one turn in 100 calibres
and terminating at the distance of 9.833 feet with a twist of one
turn in 40 calibres; and first to determine the equation to the

    26. From an examination of the values of R given in this Table,
 it will be seen that the total pressure on the driving-surface
 reaches about 31 tons shortly after the commencement                    of
 motion, and the projectile quits the bore with a pressure of
 about 36 tons. With the view of making the variations which the
 pressures undergo more readily comparable,          I have laid down in
 Plate VI. the curves derived from equations (15) and (17) for
 the battering charge of pebble-powder.
    From these diagrams the pressures on the driving-surface
at any point of the bore, both for the uniform and parabolic
twists, can be seen by simple inspection. The line of abscissae
gives the travel of the shot, and the ordinates give the corre
sponding total pressure on the studs.
    The curves show that with the uniform spiral the pres
sure on the studs reaches nearly 70 tons after a travel of 3
feet, rapidly falling to about 9 tons at the muzzle, while with
the parabolic rifling the pressure at 3 feet of travel, correspond
ing to the point of maximum pressure, is only 31 tons. The
pressure then falls slightly and amounts to 28 tons at about 1
foot travel; thence it gradually increases to a maximum of 36
tons at the muzzle.
                                I
    By way of comparison, have added in the Plate a curve
showing the pressures required to give rotation to a 400-lb.

projectile fired from the 10-inch gun with uniform twist when
R. L. G. instead of pebble-powder is used.
    The curve in this case is of the same nature as that derived
from the pebble-powder; but the variation is greater, the maxi
mum pressure being much higher and the muzzle-pressure,
owing to the smaller charge, somewhat less.

216     Mr. R. H. M. Bosanquet on the Measure of Intensity
which the principal plane of the crystal makes with the original
plane of polarization. The verification is stated to have been
made photometrically by Arago; but it is easy to obtain a veri
fication for one's self. If the ray that has passed through a Nicol
fall through a hole on a crystal of Iceland spar of suitable thick
ness so that the emerging rays overlap, it is quite easy to recog
nize that, as the crystal is turned round, the intensity of the
overlapping part is constant.     Now the amplitudes of the po
larized pencils will be
                           a cos 2 and a sin a,
if a be the amplitude of the original ray, and a the inclination of
the principal plane of the prism to the plane of polarization of the
Nicol. But if these amplitudes were the measures of the inten
sities, the intensity of the overlapping part would be represented
by a (sin a +cosa), and would vary with 2. The question is here
submitted to direct experiment; and we see that it is only by
taking the intensity to be measured by the square of the ampli
tude that the experimental result can be accounted for; we have
then, of course, a” (sin” a + cos” a)=a”.
   In the case of sound, the law of Töpfer, which is quoted in
my paper in the Philosophical Magazine, November 1872, shows
that in organ-pipes of equal intensity the wind consumed is pro
                                              I
portional to the wave-length. As have remarked, this is equi
valent to saying that the work done is proportional to the wave
length. Töpfer's law is beyond dispute. It might well have
been left to rest on his authority, except that, for once, he gives
no measures or evidence for it; but he is generally so accurate
that his enunciation of the law carries weight. The evidence in
the case of sound does not at present amount to actual proof of
the representation of intensity by mechanical energy, but to a
high degree of probability.          I
                                 have devised a better method of
observation, which requires special arrangements, and hope to
throw some additional light on the subject when        have an op     I
portunity of carrying this out.
   As one of Mr. Moon's suggestions is sometimes felt as a diffi
culty by learners, I will just touch upon

twice the energy proportional            to        we

the two vibrations are      superposed they must

position in nature in many cases. Thus, if two similar organ
pipes are sounded near each other in exact unison, they always
arrange their vibrations in opposite phases, and the two tones
destroy each other. No doubt also the explanation given by
Airy of the doubling of intensity by use of two candles points
in the correct direction. As, however, it takes no account of
the alteration of the plane of polarization in common light, a
matter of which we know scarcely any thing, it can only be re
garded as an illustration.        The complete explanation cannot be
given or recognized till we know more about the alteration of the
plane of polarization. We must note, however, that the doubled
light of two candles is not to be regarded as an axiom, but as a
fact ascertained in the every-day processes of photometry.
   Still it may often happen that two such vibrations may be
superposed with coincident phase; it happens, for instance, at
the loudest part of the beats given by two organ-pipes nearly in
unison.     In these cases we must not treat each vibration as a
cause in itself, invariable under                     by
                                              conditions.       we regard                 If

quantity.
   Secondly, if the organ have a heavy wind, and the pipes have
narrow windways, so that the greater portion of the pressure at
the windway is due to friction, velocity communicated to the ex
ternal air, &c., and only a small part to the reaction of the sound
impulses, then even considerable variations of the work trans
formed into sound will not alter perceptibly the pressure at the
windway or the velocity of exit: thus, on superposition, the two
vibrations would retain their form, and the intensity of the swell
of the beat would be in the extreme case four times that of the
single vibration. This case is analogous to the introduction of
a resistance into an electric circuit whose resistance                                      is already
great, or where the battery is arranged for tension.

   The following communication was read:—
   “On a new Method of viewing the Chromosphere.” By J. N.
Lockyer, F.R.S., and G. M. Seabroke.
   The observations made by slitless spectroscopes during the
eclipse of Dec. 11, 1871, led one of us early this year to the con
clusion that the most convenient and labour-saving contrivance for
the daily observation of the chromosphere would be to photograph
daily the image of a ring-slit, which should be coincident with an
image of the chromosphere itself.
   The same idea has since occurred to the other.
   We therefore beg leave to send in a joint communication to the
Royal Society on the subject, showing the manner in which this kind
of observation can be carried out, remarking that, although the me
thod still requires some instrumental details, which will make its
working more perfect, images of the chromosphere, almost in                                           its
entirety, have already been seen     several days during the present
                                               on

   The image of the sun is brought to focus on a diaphragm having a
circular disk of brass (in the centre) of the same size as the sun's
image, so that the sun's light is obstructed and the chromospheric
light is allowed to pass. The chromosphere is afterwards brought
to a focus again at the position usually occupied by the slit of the
spectroscope; and in the eyepiece is seen the chromosphere in
circles corresponding to the “C” or other lines. The lens D is
used to reduce the size of the sun's image, and keep it of the same
size as the diaphragm at different times of the year; and the
lenses F are used in order to reduce the size of the annulus of
light to about $ inch, so that the pencils of light from either side
of the annulus may not     be too divergent to pass through the prisms
at the same   time,  and that the image of the whole annulus may be
seen at once.     There are mechanical difficulties in producing a
perfect annulus of the required size, so one # inch in diameter
is used, and can be reduced virtually to any size at pleasure.
   The proposed photographic arrangements are as follows:—
   A large Steinheil spectroscope is used, usual slit being replaced
                                                               its

working opticians; and the information published            the subject          on
being scanty, this has probably prevented the scientific analyst from
giving that aid which might have been expected.

                                  to

separating lenses suitably corrected, there were one          two posi               or
tions  in which the  spherical   aberration was balanced.      This was
explained    inpaper read before the Royal Society
                 a                                           1829.                   in                  In
the year 1831 Mr. Ross was employed           construct the first achro

 matic object-glass in accordance with this principle,                               which       per
 formed with “a degree of success never anticipated.”
       Mr. Ross then discovered that, afterhe had adjusted the interval
 of his lenses for the aplanatic  focus, that position would no longer
 be correct if a plate of thin glass was placed above the object; this
 focus had then to be    sought  in a different plane, and the lenses
 brought closer together, in order to neutralize the negative aberra
 tion caused by covering-glass of various thickness.          From this
 period the “adjustment” with which all our best object-glasses
are now provided became established.        Fig. 1 is the form of object
glass used at this time, consisting of three plano-concave achro
matics, whose foci were nearly in the proportion of 1,2,3.
    No greater angle than 60° could be obtained with this system
in a 3-inch objective (the highest power then made), for reasons
apparent in the diagram.        The excessive depth of curvature of
 the contact-surfaces of the front pair is unfavourable for the pas
sage of the marginal rays; the softness of the flint glass forming
the first plane was also objectionable. In the year 1837 Mr. Lister
gave Mr. Ross a diagram for an improved “eighth,” having a triple
front lens in the form shown in fig. 2. By this the passage of ex
treme rays was facilitated; and in order to diminish the depth
of curvature, a very dense glass was used, having a specific gravity
of 4.351. Faraday's glass, having a density of 6-4, had been pre
viously tried, but was abandoned on account of a difficulty in
working      it.  The polished surfaces           both these qualities
                                                        of                  dense      of

                             of

 introduced the triple back lens.

practically this would be no disadvantage, as these surfaces are
united with Canada balsam, whose refraction is higher than the
crown; so that the rays in this case must proceed with very little
deviation.    But incidences beyond the angle of total reflection may
be considered detrimental, as they imply excessive depth of curva
ture; this can be discovered by looking through the front of an
object-glass held close to the eye, any air-films in the balsam near
the edge of the lens appearing as opaque black spots.
    At the commencement of the present year the author caused
a few object-glasses to be made, with a middle of the form of
fig. 5, the performance of which was very satisfactory. . In this
the extreme rays pass at more favourable incidences, and within
the angle of total reflection.    The upper lens is of dense flint.
    When the experiments on the single front were concluded, and
the remarkable corrective power of the triple back in conjunction
 therewith had been proved, the next attempt was to make the
 middle also a single lens, leaving the entire colour-correction to be
performed by the one biconcave flint in the back. After numerous
 trials it was found that though something like over-correction or
 negative aberration could be obtained with the back, in the degree
 requisite for balancing the under-correction of the single middle
 and front when set at the prescribed distance of the aplanatic focus,

             a convergence of the blue and red rays. A single lens of longer

set off in the diagram behind, and neither of them in front of the
ray in course of projection; this leaves the way clear, with the least
confusion of lines.
    At the same time a second or counterpart diagram should be at
hand, to which the rays only are transferred as soon as their direc
tion is ascertained; with these precautions a mistake is scarcely
possible.
    Now it is hoped that some improvements may be effected by
this investigation, on account of the simplicity attained in the com
bination, in which we have two single lenses of crown, whose foci
bear a definite proportion to each other; while all the corrections
are performed by one concave of dense flint, the acting condition of
which is not altered by the influence of any other concaves acting
in the combination, and hitherto taking a share of the duty. This
one flint is now to be considered singly as the heart and centre
of the system in reference to the correction of the rays entering
and leaving.
    This memoir is of necessity incomplete, for want of definite   in
formation concerning the optical properties of various kinds of
glass.    Data obtained from working them into small lenses fur
nish only a rough approximation to the mean dispersive power of
the combined flint and crown having the best apparent effect.
Of the intermediate rays, little can be known beyond the mere ap
pearance of more or less of a secondary spectrum.
   Nothing of importance has been published since Fraunhofer's
Table, containing the refractive indices for each of the seven pri
mary colour-lines of the spectrum for ten kinds of glass: great
advance has been effected since that date in the manufacture of
optical glass, a most complete collection of which of every variety
has been made by the Rosses up to the present date. Selected spe
cimens from this will be worked into prisms, and the relative
spectra mapped out by the Fraunhofer lines, leading, it is hoped,
to the discovery of a combination of crown and flint glass which
shall be free from secondary spectrum or absolutely achromatic.
The result of this investigation will be the subject - of a future
communication.

Mr. R. H. Tiddeman        on the Ice-sheet in North Lancashire.     233
tween Shepherd's Bush and Hammersmith, and in the neighbour
hood of Turnham Green, which resulted in the discovery, at the
latter place, of a large quantity of animal remains (noticed by Mr.
Busk in the following paper), all of which, like the implements of
the high terrace, were at the bottom of the gravel; but no evidence
of human workmanship was found in the mid terrace.
    All these were found together, in the same seam of gravel, 12
feet beneath the surface; and all appeared to have been deposited at
the same time. The surface was here 25 feet above the Ordnance
datum, and consequently about 50 feet lower than the implements
of the high terrace, 14 mile to the north. The section across the
valley, taken through the two places, here shows the strip of the
London Clay intervening between the two terraces.
    The chief points of interest which the author submitted to the judg
ment of geologists, consisted in :-the presence of drift implements
 in the high terrace, their absence in the mid terrace, and reappear
 ance in the existing bed of the Thames; the great rarity or absence
 of animal remains in the high terrace, and their abundance in the
 mid terrace; and the occurrence of both implements and animal re
 mains at the bottom of the gravel in both terraces. The writer
 concluded by adducing proofs of the great antiquity of the present
 river-bed, which it was shown must have run in its present mean
 dering course in the bottom of the valley for at least 2000 years.
     3. “On the Animal Remains found by Col. Lane Fox in the
  High- and Low-level Gravels at Acton and Turnham Green.” By
 George Busk, Esq., F.R.S., F.G.S.
     The author described the mammalian bones referred to in the
 preceding paper.
     The remains from the High-level Gravels at Acton belong to the
  genera Bos, Ovis, Equus, and Elephas?, The greater part belong to
  the first-named genus, and are probably modern, as are also those
  of Ovis. The remains of Equus may be of greater antiquity.         The
  other bones found may belong either to Elephant, Rhinoceros, or
  Hippopotamus;     they include a large portion of an Elephant's
  molar, and are much rolled.
     The remains from the mid-level gravel at Turnham Green gene
  rally present the characters of great antiquity. They include bones
  of Rhinoceros hemitoechus, Equus caballus, Hippopotamus major (one
  of them the left frontal of a very young animal almost unworn),
   Bos (probably B. primigenius, and some perhaps Bison priscus),
   Cervus (C. clactonensis, Falc. = C. Browni Dawk., C. elaphus, and
   C. tarandus), Ursus ferow priscus, and Elephas primigenius.

   adjoining parts of Yorkshire and Westmoreland.”      By R. H. Tidde
  man, Esq., M.A. Oxon, F.G.S., of the Geological Survey of England
  and Wales.
     The country of which the earlier glacial phenomena were de

234                         Geological Society.
  scribed in this paper lies between the Lake-district on the north and
  the plains of South Lancashire and Cheshire on the south, and extends
  from the great watershed of England to the Irish Sea.
     On the west is a sea-side plain rising to levels of less than 200
  feet. On the north-east is a portion of the Pennine chain, com
  prising Ingleborough, Pennigent, and other Fells, rising to heights
  of from 2000 to 2400 feet. Between these, from south to north,
  we pass over:-1, a range of moorlands from 1000 to 1500 feet high,
  called the Rossendale Anticlinal, which forms the watershed be
 tween the basins of the Mersey and the Ribble; 2, the valley of the
  Burnley and Blackburn Coal-field, which drains north through gorges
 in (3) the Pendle chain of hills into (4) the broad valley of the
  Ribble; 5, a group of Fells rising to a general level of 1800 feet,
  between the valleys of the Ribble and the Lune, called, for the pur
 poses of this paper, “The Central Fells;” 6, north of this the valley
 of the Lune and the estuary of the Kent. The main direction of all
 these features, between the sea-side plain and the Pennine chain,
  is from north-east to south-west.
     The paper was illustrated by a map of the district on the scale of
 1 inch to a mile, coloured to represent elevations, the level-contours
 having been reduced from the 6-inch scale. Upon this all the ice
 scratches found on the solid rocks were inserted.        A diagram illus
 trating the proportional number of scratches in different directions
 showed that 20 per cent. of them were due south, although the
 general direction of the valleys was to the south-west.                 --
     An instance was mentioned of a         ridge   1400 feet in    height;
 which had scratches at the top running directly across it to the
 south, although no land of equal height occurred north of it within
 a distance of 7 miles. A similar instance was shown to exist on the
 ridge north-east of Pendle Hill.     A roche moutonnée in the gorge of
 the Calder at   Whalley   was shown to have been formed by ice work
 ing from the north, although the river drains from the south. Other
 systems of scratches were mentioned in detail.        All these tended to
 show that, though the general slope and drainage of the district is
 to the south-west, the movement of the ice at the period of maximum
 cold was to the S. or S.S.E., or nearly parallel to the watershed.
     The author goes on to describe certain disturbances at the
 surface of the rocks which dip at high angles to the south, they
having been overturned by some force coming from the north.
 Such surface-disturbances are not found on rocks dipping to the
north; and this fact may be explained by an illustration: in one
case the brushing was with the nap, in the other against              it.
                                                                        was     It
shown that these phenomena could not          be attributed      any other
                                                                     to
agent but a    great ice-sheet pushing  on from    itsnorthern gathering
grounds, recruited     by   the greater elevations       on    its
                                                               course, but
overriding the lesser, grinding down and smoothing               by       its
                                                                   friction
rocks presenting but   a    gentle incline, tearing      up
                                                         and turning over
the basset edges confronting its approach.
    The author next described the arrangement              the Till
                                                          of                     as   to
colour and material, and endeavoured         to show that all the facts

                   Intelligence    and Miscellaneous Articles.            235
which he has observed are in favour of the existence of an ice-sheet
travelling south in this district.
    Mr. Cumming's observations in the Isle of Man were considered to
confirm these views.          He describes the general glaciation of the
island as being from the E.N.E. or Lake-country, and describes
many large blocks of granite which had been carried from their
parent rock up the high hill of South Barruh and down the other
side.    This was referred by Mr. Cumming at the time to a great
“wave of translation;” but the facts are quite easily explained by
an ice-sheet.       Other observations of Mr. Cumming upon the drifts
of the Isle of Man were taken by the author as confirmatory of his
views.     Mr. Morton's observations on the glaciation of the Mersey
basin were touched upon ; and it was suggested that the glaciation
of that district was produced by an ice-sheet, not coming from the
south-east, as Mr. Morton holds, but working to the south-east from
the Lake-country, and across a part of what is now the Irish Sea.
    Professor Ramsay’s observations on the glaciation of Anglesey being
to the S.S.W. instead of from the Snowdon group, as might have been
expected, were considered by the author to be confirmatory of his
views of a great ice-sheet having filled what is now the Irish Sea,
and emptied itself by St. George's Channel on the one hand, and by
the Cheshire plain on the other, as well as by some of the passes in
the Pennine Chain.

   ON  THE ACTION       OF A CONDUCTOR ARRANGED SYMMETRICALLY
            ROUND AN ELECTROSCOPE.               BY CH.-W. ZENGER.
  | HAVE      the honour to address to the Academy the result of some
      fresh experiments on the electric inertia of a conductor arranged
  symmetrically round an electroscope.
     Ruhmkorff found that if static electricity exercises no action on
  the electroscope disposed as        I  have indicated, it is not so with dy-
  namic   electricity  or the   electricity of induction.

  236            Intelligence  and Miscellaneous   Articles.
     This result is only a confirmation of my theory of electric inertia,
  since the condition of equal distribution (equal superficial tension),
  and symmetrical, is not fulfilled when induction-apparatus is used.
  In fact the tension of the current after the opening and after the
  closing of the inducing current is not the same, and the charge of
  the symmetrical conductor is successively positive and negative;
  the superficial tension cannot be none, nor even equal, since a cer
  tain time is required for the two electricities to combine after two
  alternate unequal discharges, considering the tension and the nature
  of the electricity.    The tension at the part of the symmetrical con
  ductor furthest from the point of discharge will be quite different
 from that at the part nearest to the conductor of the Ruhmkorff;
 and the condition of equal superficial tension at every point of the
 symmetrical conductor is not fulfilled. Failing this essential con
 dition, there will be an action nearly equal to the difference of ten
 sion of the sparks of opening and of closing.
     To show the influence of the symmetrical distribution,        I put
 symmetrically round a gold-leaf electroscope a rectangular copper
 wire; the electroscope and the wire are placed upon the brass plate
 of another electroscope (with straws instead of gold leaves), larger
 and less sensitive.      From the conductor of an electrical machine
 strong sparks go to one of the angles of the wire; the upper elec
 troscope shows not a trace of tension, while the straws of the large
 electroscope below are strongly affected.
     If the experiment be modified by placing the knob of the upper
 electroscope not symmetrically in relation to the middle points of
 the sides of the conductor, there will be seen a movement of the
 gold leaves at every discharge from the conductor of the machine.
 The greater this defect of symmetry, the more sensible will be the
action.—Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences, vol. lxxv. p. 1765.
      ON  THE HEAT OF TRANSFORMATION.            B.Y. M. J. MOUTIER,
    A substance may present itself at the same temperature in two
different states, which we will call M and M'. In passing from M
to M' a kilogramme of the substance absorbs a quantity of heat Q,
which we will call heat of transformation.       Let us suppose that in
both conditions the substance can be vaporized, and that the ten
sions p and p' of the vapours at the same temperature are unequal;
we propose to determine a relation between the heat of transforma
tion Q and the tensions p and p".
    Let u and w' be the specific volumes of the substance in the states
M and M', v and v' the specific volumes of the vapours given by M.
and M', L and L' the heats of vaporization.
    Let us conceive the following cycle of operations effected at a
constant temperature:–
    (1) The substance passes from the state M to M' under a con
stant pressure r ; it absorbs the quantity Q of heat. The quantity
of heat consumed by external work is Ar(u'—w), A being the heat

equivalent  of the work; the heat expended on internal work is
Q—Ar(w'—w).
   (2) The body M' is reduced to saturated vapour. The heat con
sumed by external work is Ap'(v'—w'); that consumed by internal
work is L'—Ap'(v'—w').
   (3) The temperature being kept constant, the volume of the
vapour formed is changed so that the pressure becomes equal to p;
the internal work consumes the quantity q of heat.
   (4) We condense the vapour under the constant pressure p;
the body returns to the initial state M. The heat disengaged is
L, of which the portion corresponding to the internal work is
L– Ap(v–w).
     The cycle is closed; the change of internal heat is nil:
       Q—Ar(w'—w)+L'—Ap'(v'—w')+q—[L–Ap(v–w)]=0;
       Q=L–L'+Ar(w'—w)+Ap'(v'—w')—Ap(v–w)—q.                                                          .   .   (1)

  Thus,    M. Favre announced a little while after M. Schroetter's
             as
discovery, white phosphorus disengages heat, in passing into the
condition of red phosphorus.   From an experiment by M. Hittorf,
the transformation of liquid white phosphorus at 280° determines
a sudden rise of the temperature from 280° to 370°.    Designating
by c the specific heat of the phosphorus the temperature of which
thus rises, we should have c X90=17:5; from this we deduce
c=0.19, a number which differs little from the specific heat found
by M. Regnault.—Comptes Rendus de l'Acad. des Sciences, vol. lxxvi.

    In his very interesting memoir on sulphurous and chlorhydric
acids (Comptes Rendus, Jan. 13, 1873), M. Melsens says that from
 1860 he has been seeking to determine the exact boiling-point of
liquefied sulphurous acid, that he has made very numerous trials
with vessels of          sorts, but that all his attempts have been fruit

242        .     The Marquis of Salisbury on Spectral
the electric action on the thermometer is of the same kind as
the action upon the conductor.
    But whatever the process of electric excitement in the ther
mometer       may be—whether by induction or by conduction
through leakage—the exhibition of light without any but
the minutest development of heat is worthy of notice.              The
heat caused by a full discharge through Geissler's tubes is
well known.        It will, as Wüllner notices, disintegrate the glass,
producing sodium-, and at last even calcium-lines.         If increased
by resistance of gas of 500 millims. pressure, it will soften and
bend aluminium electrodes.           But in the thermometer, where the
resistance is that of the thickness of a tube of glass, scarcely any,
if any, rise of temperature is produced. With thermometers
of the ordinary bore, I have failed, after many trials, to dis
cover any alteration of reading at the end of five minutes’ expo
sure to the discharge of the coil in the manner I have described.
Four experiments with a thermometer of very fine bore, gradu
ated to tenths of a degree Fahr., have given an average rise of
three quarters of a degree Fahr. in the course of five minutes.
I  am doubtful whether even this rise is to be attributed to heat,
and for this reason. In two other thermometers a small portion
of the column of mercury was separated from the rest. The
 action of the coil after a short time made the interval wider,
pushing up the separated fragment without expanding either
portion; and in the interval so created a brilliant light ap
peared.      It is evident, therefore, that the coil tends to produce
 a motion in the mercury of the thermometer analogous to that
 observed by Poggendorff in larger tubes; and the slight appa
 rent rise of three quarters of a degree in five minutes, produced
 by the coil in a thermometer of very small bore, may be due to
 an action of this kind.       But even if there be a real rise of tem
 perature to this extent, it is so minute as to be practically unim
 portant. In effect, therefore, the light was produced at a tem
 perature of less than     60°F.
    This light is strong enough to be examined in the spectro
 scope.    One prism, of course, only must be used; and the room
 must be perfectly dark.        It is also necessary to use cross-wires
 in the telescope, as cross-hairs are too slender to be seen in so
 dim a light.       Of course much the easiest mode of examination
 is to dispense    with a slit altogether; but on that plan the lines
 of the spectrum, in some thermometers at least, are so rugged
 that it is difficult to identify them. I have therefore been com
 pelled to use the slit. To my surprise, I found that different
 thermometers gave different lines; or rather, some gave more lines
  than others.      Instruments made by the best makers, such as
 Casella or    Elliott, give only the three following lines. All the

lines observed have beenidentified by means of comparison with
Geissler's tubes showing known spectra.    The wave-lengths of
the lines in the tubes  so used for   comparison     afterwards                               I
measured with a grating, and verified by Dr. Watts's catalogue.
The light of the thermometer itself is too feeble to permit of
direct measurement with a grating.
                                                                    X   =        Dr. Watts's No.

These are three of the brightest mercury-lines. The tube of
comparison was one in which, previously to exhaustion, some
mercury had been vaporized.         I mention the grounds of my
conclusion, because in Wüllner's experiments it was shown that

simpler one, at least in some cases, may be offered.   Every pho
tographer must have observed the singular power which glass,
exposed to an inhabited atmosphere, possesses of attracting not
only moisture, but also thin films of grease.   If a photographic
glass plate be thoroughly cleaned and put aside for some days, it
can very seldom be used at the end of that time without further
treatment. Unless it be cleaned afresh with some solvent of
grease, such as ether or strong acid, or rubbed with tripoli, it will
probably show on the finished picture the streaks which betoken
an imperfectly cleaned plate.        What is true of a glass plate is
probably true of the inner surface of a tube.           Unless it is cleaned
with  something   more    powerful  than    water,   it is pretty certain to
retain a film of  grease.     interpret I  these  carbon-lines,     therefore,
as a simple proof of slovenly preparation. Their presence or
absence may serve as an easy test, not of the skill, but of the care
with which the thermometer has been made.                  I find that it de
pends more upon the reputation of the maker than on the price
charged for the instrument.        One of Elliott's that showed only
mercury-lines is a common two-shilling instrument.                     In one
costly, but apparently very dirty, thermometer—besides the four
carbon-lines, one or two other very faint green lines showed
themselves in the part of the spectrum near the solar line E ;
but they were too faint to be identified. In this thermometer,
after frequent exposure to the action of the coil, a slight grey
deposit was observable in the tube just over the point where the
mercury ordinarily stood.
    But if these carbon-lines show grease, why does the hydrogen
present in grease not show                      its

As a cannot be less than unity, the law can only hold as far as
r=C. Within this distance, a ray, starting at any point, in a
direction normal to the radius vector drawn to it from the centre
will describe a circle about the centre. A ray starting at any
other angle will describe an equiangular spiral having the centre
for pole.

      any medium in which the surfaces-of-equal-index are con
centric spheres, if we denote by 6 the angle at which a ray cuts
the surface-of-equal-index at the point considered, and by p the

   In the Number of this Journal for July, 1872, I published the
description of a new form of “Lantern-Galvanometer,” which
article was subsequently republished in Dr. Carl’s Repertorium.
This instrument, although it served admirably in the experiments
for which it was specially devised, yet is of difficult construction
and of limited application when compared with the very simple
apparatus I will now proceed to describe.
   G is the glass shade of the galvanometer, on which, at g,
are drawn in india-ink the vertical graduation-lines of the in
strument.    A is a piece of aluminium wire, to whose lower
end are fixed the needles of the galvanometer, and whose upper
end is perforated with a small hole, so that the system can
be suspended by a silk fibre.      A fine wire of German silver
(W) is attached transversely to the aluminium wire, and has                                                its
                                                                        by its
ends bent downwards        right angles at    length. This trans  to
verse wire can     placedbe  any azimuth     rotating
                                             at        around                               it             its
centre, which   coiled two
                    is         three times round the vertical wire
                                              or
of aluminium. On one of the bent ends of the transverse wire                                               is
cemented    diamond-shaped piece
               a                     light paper     foil; and the
                                                          of                           or

shade     at
          about    millimetre from its interior surface, with its

                                                   of
galvanometer; and this scale                       is   therefore derived from                   a   careful
calibration of the instrument.
     The sharpness        of       the image        on    the screen             is   admirable; and

262        To project Galvanometer-deflections                     on a Screen,
with the calcium-light it is distinctly visible in a room consi
derably illuminated by daylight.     With less, illumination of
the room I have used the instrument when the calcium-light
was replaced by a kerosene-flame.
   Evidently the precision of the indications of the apparatus
just described are vitiated by the parallax of the index; for it
 does not describe a cylinder which is an extension of the one on
 which are drawn the graduations.       This error is avoided by
 cementing on the inside of the shade a curved piece of glass
 whose radius of curvature equals the arm carrying the index,
 and whose centre coincides with the axis of the aluminium wire.
With this modification in the apparatus          have succeeded in I
reading with precision deflections to 6' of arc.
   By the following arrangement, deflections to 1" in an arc
extending 59 on each side of the 0-point can be determined. A
thin slip of microscope-cover     glass is coated with a layer of
black   varnish, and through   this varnish are cut, in a dividing
engine, fine equidistant lines.    The diamond-shaped pointer is
replaced by a light piece of cover-glass, also coated with var
nish, and having cut on it one fine vertical line. These lines
are illuminated by the lantern; and in front of them is placed
an inch or an inch-and-a-half objective.         On the screen we
have the    graduations  as a series of   bright   lines on a dark
ground, and along them moves the bright index-line of the
pointer.
   The zero-points of the scales can be brought accurately to
 coincide with the normal position of the index by revolving the
 shade on       its
               base; and          by
                             turning the transverse wire        that                  so
it points towards the screen when the needles           the galvano     of
 mometer have come        rest, we can readily project the image
                           to
 ofthe index and scale   any desired direction.

   Although there are some advantages     having the scales atin
tached     to
            the galvanometer and      obtaining     in

their magnified images, yet                 we
                                     can save much time      the con           in

   Now, if the coil be small and consequently the wire to be

resistance of the coil, when the resistance to be measured varies
between two fixed or variable limits, can be solved mathemati
cally by the application of the variation calculus.

     Formula (V.) shows distinctly that for p" nearly = 1 the
strength of the distillate is approximately proportional to that of
the mother-liquor for the same fraction of A distilled (observed
by Mr. Wanklyn). If r >1 or B volatile compared with A, for
mula (IV.) shows that, with repeated distillations of the early
passing-over distillate, the B strength of the distillate will
rapidly increase with the number of distillations, and formula
(VI.) shows that, to a rude approximation, the rate of increase
is in geometrical progression.
    It has been assumed that the distillation is pure, i. e. that the
vapour does not carry over any liquor held in mechanical sus
pension; for in this case the coadhesive function of the liquids
will influence the result. Further, it is supposed that the whole
distillate has been separated from the still-liquor and, if it is
used, collected.    This requires that no part of the distillate
 (especially at the beginning) condenses on the sides of the still,
in time returning to the still-liquor. The following formulae
afford a test of the accuracy of the experiment (assuming the
theory to be true), and also a means of correctly calculating r,
even with a common still properly protected, although the
second of the above-mentioned     difficulties tends to vitiate early
made observations or those continuous from the beginning.

Let r be calculated from (X.) and (VII.), (VIII.) is determined
by observation for (X.); thus r may also be calculated from
(XI.) and (VIII.). The latter value of r will be the more reli
able if the elements of (X) be accurately observed.  The distil
lation is supposed to be continuous. The value of r may also
be calculated very accurately from (II.), obtained from (I.) by
evaporation under the air-pump.
   For simplicity of formulae        I
                                have assumed the mixture to be
homogeneous and to remain so throughout the operation; but
the instant evaporation commences this condition is violated.
Thus in the deduction     of the formulae through Mr. Wanklyn’s
 theory, the process is true only for the first infinitesimal distil
lation, and   all
                subsequent distillations will involve     function

Henrici, was absolutely passive, even when set in motion so as
to expose fresh surfaces to the solution.
   When a surface is properly cleaned by one or other of the
methods pointed out, the test of the cleansing process is so deli
cate, that on immersing the solid in soda-water the greater or
less appearance of the bubbles or their entire absence marks
exactly how much, or how little, or how completely the pro
cess has been successful.     For example, the middle portion of
                                      tli,
a thick platinum wire was held in the flame of a spirit-lamp
until it glowed. It was then put into soda-water, when there
 was an abundant deposit of               above and below the part
 that had been heated, but not a bubble on that part. . A glass
tube was dipped into sulphuric acid to the depth of about 2
inches; a cork was then driven into the upper end, and the tube
sunk to the depth of 4 inches in the acid.          It was then taken
out and rinsed, the cork being removed, and so placed in soda
water to the depth of 6 inches. 4 inches of the outside and 2
inches of the inside were free from bubbles; but the remainder
of the tube, both inside and out, was thickly coated with them.
A glass cylinder 7 inches in height, that had been made clean
by the action of strong sulphuric acid, was wiped with what
would be called a clean duster to the depth of about 2 inches at
the open end, and then filled up with soda-water.         The part that
had been wiped was accurately delineated by being covered with
bubbles, while the remaining 5 inches of surface were com
pletely free from them.     In a clean glass full of soda-water the
finger was introduced below the surface with friction against the
side.   The finger-mark became immediately apparent in conse
quence of the formation of bubbles upon                    was formerly

for while the gas adheres strongly to such bodies, the water has
a much weaker adhesion.       Hence, while such bodies are not
wetted by the water, they are so by the gas; and consequently
in a supersaturated gaseous solution their surfaces become
covered with bubbles, which increase in size, loosen their hold,
and ascend, while other bubbles are formed in their place. This

   1. The induction-coils were arranged in the following manner.
A copper wire, 0.5 millim. thick, insulated with silk, was wound
in the rectangular incision on the circumference of a circular
wooden plate.       Four such coils were used. Two of the plates
had a diameter of 44.4 centims. ; the breadth of the incision
was 0-9 centim., and                      its
                              depth 0:55 centim.; thus the radius
of the plate, from                 its               the incision, was
                                                     of to

21.65 centims.       The spirals    these two coils were arranged                                            in
two sets. The other two plates had radius               695 centims.   a                 of

          centimetres was extended.       The primary coil was fixed

In on
    the end         of                                                                                       it.
     every experiment the plates were placed with their plane

    The primary current was produced              galvanic battery         by   a                            of
four     six Bunsen’s cells. The intensity
        to                                           this current was               of

                 common axis with
                       a                handle.    The peripheries

the wheels were divided,         means          by                of
                                           sixteen brass plates, into
intervals alternately conducting and non-conducting.               Two
 brass springs      equal length pressed
                           of                  each periphery.      Theon

                                                   circuit.   Thus,                                         by
turning the handle, the primary current was alternately esta
blished and destroyed;        the moment   at     breaking, the other  of   its
pair     springs was

wheel, thus completing the secondary circuit,         which Weber's                 in
magnetometer was inserted.        But when the first pair       springs                         of a
just touched      brass plate, then the second pair pressed
                        a
                                                                                                            on

non-conducting interval, and the secondary circuit was incom
plete.    By this arrangement                          we
                                     got only secondary currents                                            of
the same direction, viz. those produced         breaking the primary       by
current.
   In  the experiments the handle         the disjunctor was turned
                                                                  of

gently in an incision on the handle, whereby the experiment
could be stopped after a certain number of turns.                 Usually five
turns were made in an           experiment;       the   amplitude   of the first
deflection that the eighty secondary currents produced in the
magnetometer was taken as a relative measure of the strength
of induction. The amplitude was observed with a telescope
and a millimetre-scale by means of the mirror fixed to the mag
netic needle.       Whenever the handle was turned more or less
than five times, the observed deflection was reduced to that for
eighty currents.      The conducting-power of the secondary cir
cuit was measured by means of a magnet inductor.                    Before the
commencement of an experiment the wheels of the disjunctor
were always in such a position as to complete the primary cir
cuit. The wires from the battery, the coils, and the magneto
meter were twisted together two by two, or went parallel a short
distance.      Thus every other inducing effect, except that between
the   coils, was prevented.
   2. We will relate the series of experiments in the order
in which they were made. The following designations may be
used:—i represents the intensity of the primary current; m the
number of windings in the primary coil, and n that in the se
condary coil; l the conducting-power of the secondary circuit,
and     J the first deflection of the needle of the magnetometer for
eighty currents. The distance between the coils, denoted by 2,
is estimated from the plane of the middle winding in the one to
 the corresponding plane in the other coil.
    Series 1. One of the large coils was taken as primary,
 and one of the small as secondary coil, i=tan 15°, m-31,
n=51. The current induced by the magnet inductor deflected

  the sum of the inner radius of the coil (21.65 centims.) and the
  thickness (0.05 centim.) of the inner set of spirals. As regards
  the smaller coils, to their inner radius (6-95 centims.) must be
  added half the depth of the incision on the peripheries (0:15 cen

   In  calculating the values of A by this formula, the terms have
been determined to four decimals.                       The more the value of a
exceeds    unity,    the more          rapidly    does this series converge.     Ge
nerally 4 or 5 terms were sufficient.                     Only for values of a very
near unity was it necessary to calculate 6 or 7 terms besides the
first.  An is found              =0-7079 .# ; in this value are contained the

   4. We will now consider the case in which the integral of the
first term in expression (1) disappears.        Let the induced circuit
turn, about the diameter parallel to the y-axis, 90° from                                                               its

              in
into    relative position      which      induction exists.

         Metals undergo when in contact with cold Material.                                 297
tact. Faraday”, Seebeckt, and Tyndallf have adopted this expla
nation; and they have shown that most of the facts which they
and others have ascertained respecting these vibrations are easily
explained upon this view of their cause, supposing only that the
expansion is sufficiently great to produce any sensible effect.
   Professor James Forbes $, on the other hand, after an extensive
series of experiments, was led to reject Sir John Leslie's expla
nation, one of his principal reasons for doing so being the im
possibility, as it appeared to him, that the expansion occasioned
by so slow a process as the conduction of heat could produce any
sensible mechanical effect.   He says, “Even at first sight it does
appear  very difficult to conceive how, when the vibrations are
increased to 500 or more in a second, a process depending upon
so slow an operation as the conduction of heat should cause the
metal to expand and contract successively by a finite quantity.
The effect has every appearance of being one of active and almost
instantaneous repulsion, and bears no resemblance whatever to
the slow mechanical elevation of the surface by the process of
expansion.” After remarking that such inferences are often erro
neous, he enters into a closer consideration of the phenomenon,
but finds no reason for altering the opinion expressed in the
passage     just quoted.
   It thus appears to be an interesting problem to determine by
calculation the amount of expansion produced in the block in
any given time, and to find whether it is sufficiently great to
cause the vibrations in question.   This is what have attempted       I
to do in the  present paper;  and the conclusion at which   have                        I
arrived confirms the truth of Sir J. Leslie’s explanation.
   I. To find the expansion produced in any given time.
    It will be convenient to consider in the first place the follow
 ing problem —A large heated piece of metal is laid upon a large
 cold piece of the same kind of metal, the surfaces in contact being
 horizontal planes.    To find the height through which the sur
 face of the cold metal has been raised in any given short time.
    The time being short, the depth to which the heat will have
 penetrated will be small; and the pieces of metal may therefore
 be considered infinite in extent. We have, then,       determining        for
 the temperature         v   at   any depth     w    after the time       t,   the following

     Let us now consider the                   case   in which the area of the surfaces
in contact is very small, which will be the case applicable to the
rocker and block.
     If
     the heat which flows out of the hot metal and into the cold
metal were wholly confined to those parts which are vertically
above and below the surfaces in contact, then the height to which
the surfaces would rise would be given by the expression already
found.    But in general a certain portion of the heat will flow
laterally; and consequently the height to which the surfaces rise
will in general be less than the expression already found. The
proportion of heat which escapes laterally will be greater the
greater the depth to which the heat has flowed.
   Thus let a a be the
part of the surfaces in
                                                                 r"        |r r

            the two metals    their points

           Metals undergo when in contact with cold Material.                              305
smaller amount than the temperatures of the general masses of
the two metals.      A difference then of 50° or 100° in the tempe
ratures of the two metals will probably -be quite sufficient to pro
duce the vibrations in question.
   It has already been seen that the larger the areas in contact,
the greater the proportion of heat available for raising the block.
For this reason large areas in contact are advantageous for the
production of vibrations. But, on the other hand, the larger
the areas in contact, the more slowly will the two metals tend to
regain their original difference of temperature during the intervals
when they are not in contact; and for this reason large areas in
contact are disadvantageous for the production of vibrations.
There will therefore be a certain magnitude for the area in con
tact which will give stronger vibrations than either larger or
smaller areas. This conclusion is borne out by experiment.
     I
     have pointed out that when the hot and cold metals are of
the same material there will in general be no vibration, because
the contraction of the hot metal will exactly compensate for ex
pansion of the cold metal.       This, as a result of his experiments,
Forbes has stated to be a general law.         There       however,        is,              an
exception     this  law,
                       to  first noticed and  explained       Professor          by
Tyndall,     whichto    should refer. He found that when the hot

rocker rests upon the edges         thin sheets   ofupon points       or

same metal       itself, vibrations will often occur. The

   Another general result which Forbes deduced from his expe
riments          is,
             that “the vibrations take place with         intensity pro    an
 portional (within certain limits)     the difference   to the conduct     of
ing-powers              of
                 the metals for  heat,   the metal    having    the least
conducting-power being necessarily the coldest.” Now,                  the            if
various metals differed from one another only              regards their   as
conductivities this law would          strictly true; for
                                                       be        this case       in
the  possibility               of
                    vibration could only    arise from the lateral flow
of  heat out      the hot metal being greater than the lateral flow
                        of
into the cold metal, and this would only                         be
                                                 the case when the hot
metal was the better conductor           heat.    But       of
                                                           any case the    in
lateral flow            of
                  heat has    important     an
                                           influence   upon   the vibra
tions; and consequently the above law will                            be
                                                    approximately true.

    “Note on the Wide-slit Method of viewing the Solar Promi
nences.”      By William Huggins, D.C.L., L.L.D., F.R.S.
    When     editing    the English translation of Schellen's ‘Spectrum
Analysis,'     I  discovered that the short account of the method of
viewing the forms of the solar prominences by means of a wide
 slit, which   I  had the honour of presenting to the Royal Society
 on February 18, 1869t, does not agree exactly in one respect
with the account of the observation of February 13 as it was
entered at the time in my observatory book. The short note was

 written at the suggestion of a friend during a Committee held in
 the Royal Society's Apartments, and, as the concluding words
 show,   was intended to be followed by a more detailed account
 of the method of observation. The point in question relates to
 the position of a second slit which was used to screen the eye
 from every part of the spectrum except that under observation.
 The words in my book written at the time are, “narrow slit found
 to be best at focus of little telescope with positive eyepiece.” In
 the note the second slit was stated to have been placed before
 the object-glass of the little telescope. Such an arrangement was
 tried in connexion with some other experiments in progress at
 the time. The plan of limiting the field of view to the part of
 the spectrum corresponding to the refrangibility of the light of
 the prominence, as well as the employment of a ruby glass, is of
 value when the air is not favourable, or when a spectroscope of
 small dispersive power is used.

  “On a new Relation between Heat and Electricity.” By Fre
derick Guthrie.
  It is found that the reaction between an electrified body and a
neighbouring neutral one, whereby the electricity in the neutral
body is inductively decomposed and attraction produced, undergoes
a modification when the neutral body is considerably heated.
    Under many circumstances it is found that the electrified
body is rapidly and completely discharged.      The action of dis
charge is shown to depend mainly upon the following conditions:—
(1) the temperature of the discharging body, and     distance from                 its
the electrified one; (2) the nature (+        —)       the latter'sor               of
electricity.
   With regard        (1),

                                     is                                                                 of

hot body    diminishes      as
                            its distance increases, and increases with its
temperature; but, concerning the temperature,                       proved thatit   is

isolated, have an exceedingly great power of discharging both kinds
of electricity.
   The effects in regard to discharge are shown to be similar when
platinum wire, rendered hot by a galvanic current, is used, and also
when the condensed electricity of a Leyden jar is experimented on.
   As hot iron shows a preferential power of discharging — over
 + electricity, so it is found that white-hot but isolated iron
refuses to be charged either with + or — electricity.            As the
iron cools, it acquires first the power of receiving —, and afterwards
of receiving +. Further, while white-hot iron in contact with
an electrified body prevents that body from retaining a charge of
either kind of electricity, as it cools it permits a + charge to be
received, and subsequently a

should be retained for the sodolithic species first discovered at
Penig by Breithaupt; and the white or violet-tinted lamellar masses
abundant at Montebras will be included under it; the hydrated
and entirely lithic species, comprising the laminar specimens and
the crystals from Maine, as well as some greenish masses from
Montebras, should be embraced under the name montebrasite.
    The amblygonite of Montebras has only been met with in
laminar masses with a faint tinge of violet. These masses exhibit
two cleavages presenting nearly the same degree of facility,
making with one another an angle of 105°44'.             Close observation
shows that the sharpness of the reflected images is generally a
little greater on one of the cleavages than on the other; and
this induces one to suppose that they do not both belong to equivalent
crystallographic    planes.     The study of some of their optical pro
perties, though presenting certain special difficulties, arising from
the small extent of the transparent portions and the presence of
numerous twin plates, even in the specimens that to             appearance                 all
 are the most  homogeneous,      has  proved   that the laminar masses                                         of

and one of them can be traced for a distance of nine or ten miles. The
ore, according to Mr. Gregory and Mr. D'Oyly Aplin, is always asso
ciated with red granite—i.e. “the felspar a pink or red orthoclase,
and the mica generally black; but when crystals of tin-ore are found
in situ, the mica is white.” The crystals of tin-ore are generally
found in and along the margins of quartz threads or veins in bands
of loosely aggregated granitoid rock, but are sometimes imbedded
in the micaceous portions. The report concludes with some state
ments as to the present condition and prospects of the district as

                                    of
ralizations were then put forword:—
     1.The stones are mostly subangular; some consist                friable                     of
sandstones and shales, which could not have borne even                  brief                     a
journey over the ocean-bed.
     2.Many are      large size, especially when compared with the
                          of
 fine silt     in
             which   they  were imbedded; the stones and silt could
 not have been borne   along                  by
                                 the same marine current.
     3.The stones are     various lithological characters, and might
                                of                                                                          be
referred    granitic, schistose, volcanic and sedimentary rocks, pro
               to

which are very friable, have    been brought from various localities
and yet retain their angularity, were thought sufficient evidence for
their transportation by ice. The majority showed no ice-scratches;
but the small proportion of scratched stones in the moraine matter
borne away on an iceberg, and the small percentage of ice-scratched
boulders in many deposits of glacial drift, show that the absence
of these striae is not inconsistent with the glacial origin of the                                in
cluded fragments.     Besides this, the stores of the Greensand con
sisted of rock from which ice-mar's would readily have been re
moved by the action of water.       The authors stated, however, that
they had found more positive evidence in a stone which was unmis
takably ice-scratched, consisting of a siliceous limestone, and pre
served in the Woodwardian Museum.        The fauna, so far as it proved
any thing, suggested a cold climate; though abundant, the species
were dwarfed, in striking contrast to those of the Greensand of
Southern England and the fauna of the succeeding Chalk.             The
authors concluded that a tongue of land separated the Upper-Green
sand sea into two basins, the northern of which received icebergs from
the Scottish-Scandinavian chain; the climate of this was cold, that of
the southern basin much warmer.

   has long       known that the electrical resistance of metals
                   been
             as their temperature rises. This increase has been
measured up to 100° by M. Becquerel and by Matthiessen, and to
200° in some metals by M. Lenz and, more recently, by M.
Arndtsen.      Iproposed to myself to trace the variation beyond
these limits, and to determine the increment of specific resistance
at very high temperatures.

not being easy to realize, on account of the too great sensitiveness

tions of the resistance of the exterior circuit with galvanometers of
short helix,     I  made the experiment with electromagnets, the attrac

and Jacobi, admits of the same conditions of a maximum relative to

 following are the results           I obtained with one and the same electro
 magnet excited by a Daniell pile of 20 elements, to which                  I  applied
 successively magnetizing coils of two different resistances, viz. a
 resistance of 75 kilometres of telegraphic wire of 4 millims. dia
 meter, and a resistance of 200 kilometres.                 In order to avoid static
 reactions, the attractive forces were measured with 1 millimetre
 distance of separation from the armature.

during which the current was closed was long enough to develop
the maximum of magnetization.
   Now we see by these numbers that it is when the resistance of
the coils is much superior to the exterior resistance that the maxi
mum is attained, and that, for the exterior circuit of 100 kilometres,
the marimum is obtained with the helices  of 200 kilometres—that is
to say, helices presenting double the resistance.   Calculation leads
to the same deduction; for in the electromagnet the thickness a of
the helix was equal to the diameter c of the electromagnet, and con
sequently the value of                  H, which must be equal to

        STRATIFICATION IN A LIQUID IN OSCILLATORY MOTION.

   Fine powder diffused in a horizontal tube containing a column of
water set in motion to and fro distributes itself in slices or strata
perpendicular, to the direction of the motion.           To study this, M.
Stefan employed a very simple arrangement, which consists in                                                         in

tube of glass with two vertical prolongations.         To one of these ver

XLI.     On the Ultramundane Corpuscules of Le Sage, also on the
     Motion of Rigid Solids in a Liquid circulating irrotationally
     through perforations in them or in a Fiated Solid.     By Sir
     WILLIAM THoMson, F.R.S.*
      E SAGE, born   at Geneva in 1724, devoted the last sixty-three
            of a life of eighty to the investigation of a mechanical
        years
theory of gravitation.    The probable existence of a gravific me
chanism is admitted, and the importance of the object to which
Le Sage devoted his life pointed out, by Newton and Rumford+
in the following statements:—
     “It is inconceivable
                        that inanimate brute matter should,without
the mediation of    something   else, which is not material, operate
upon, and affect other matter without mutual contact; as it must
do, if gravitation, in the sense of Epicurus, be essential and                             in
herent in      it.
                 And this     the reason why
                                    is           desired you wouldI

the maximum of magnetization.

   Now we see by these numbers that it is when the resistance of
the coils is much superior to the exterior resistance that the maxi
mum is attained, and that, for the exterior circuit of 100 kilometres,
the marimum is obtained with the helices of 200 kilometres—that is
to say, helices presenting double the resistance.   Calculation leads
to the same               for in the electromagnet the thickness a of
the helix was equal to the diameter c of the electromagnet, and con
sequently the value of                  H, which must be equal to

        STRATIFICATION IN A LIQUID IN OSCILLATORY MOTION.
                           BY J. STEFAN.
   Fine powder diffused in a horizontal tube containing a column of
water set in motion to and fro distributes itself in slices or strata
perpendicular, to the direction of the motion.                  To study this, M.
Stefan employed a very simple arrangement, which consists in                                                            in
troducing water holding in suspension oxide of iron into a horizontal
tube of glass with two vertical prolongations.               To one of these ver
tical branches is fitted a piece of caoutchouc tubing closed at                                                         its
free extremity with           cork.

minutely Le Sage's details on these points, and to judge whether
or not the additional knowledge gained by observation since his
time requires any modification to be made in the estimate which
he has given of the possible degrees of permeability of the sun

But science took another course, and works of this nature gradu
ally lost appreciation.  Le Sage has never failed on any occasion
to call attention to the system of Redeker, as also to that of
 Fatio” +.
  Le Sage shows that, to produce gravitation, those of the ultra
mundane corpuscules which strike the cage-bars of heavy bodies
must either stick there or go away with diminished velocities.
He supposed the corpuscules to be inelastic (durs), and points out
that we ought not to suppose them to be permanently lodged in
the heavy body (entassés), that we must rather suppose them to
slip off, but that, being inelastic, their average velocities after
collision must be less than that which they had before collision<U+017F>,
   That these suppositions imply a gradual diminution of gravity
from age to age was carefully pointed out by Le Sage, and re
ferred to as an objection to his theory. Thus he says,          Donc,                 “...
la durée de la gravité seroit finie aussi, et par conséquent la durée
du monde.
   Réponse.    Concedo; mais pourvu que cet obstacle me contribue
pas à faire finir le monde plus promptement qu'il n'auroit fini
 sans      lui, il doit àtre considéré comme nul” $.
     Two suppositions may be made on the general basis of Le
 Sage's             doctrine:—
   1st (which seems to have been Le Sage's belief). Suppose
the whole of mundame matter to be contained within a finite space,
and the infinite space round it to be traversed by ultramundane
corpuscules, and a small proportion of the corpuscules coming
from ultramundanespace to suffercollisions withmundane mattter,
and get away with diminished gravific energy to ultramundane
space again. They would never return to the world were it not
for collision among themselves and other corpuscules.       Le Sage
held:—that such collisions are extremely rare that; each collision,
even between the ultramundane corpuscules themselves, destroys
some energy      that     not infinitely remote past time they were

the same after collision with molecules     different from them in
form or in elastic rigidity as after collision with molecules only
of their own kind.     All that is necessary to complete Le Sage's
theory of gravity in accordance with modern science, is to assume
that the ratio of the whole energy of the corpuscules to the trans
lational part of their energy is greater, on the average, after
collisions with mundame matter than after intercollisions of only
ultramundane corpuscules.      This supposition is neither more nor
less questionable than that of Clausius for gases, which is now
admitted as one of the generally recognized truths of science.
The corpuscular theory of gravity is no more difficult in allow
                   at its
ance of      fundamental assumptions than the kinetic theory                                                              of

316             M. H. C. Vogel           on the Absorption         of the
determined.           I
                   have endeavoured to solve this question, and
take the   liberty to communicate now my observations.
   Herschelº, Claudett, and others have already tried to deter
mine the intensity of light by photographic colouring; but the
experiments did not succeed in consequence of the difficulty of pre
paring a photographic layer of the same sensitiveness throughout,
and of discovering a law connecting the time of exposure,intensity
of light, and the shade of tint of the photographic paper. The
photochemical researches of Bunsen and Roscoef have even
shown that no proportionality exists between the intensity of the
light and the tint of the photographic paper after a certain
time of insolation.     Their observations, which were made with
great care, showed “ that equal products of the intensity of the
light into the times of insolation correspond within very wide limits
to equal shades of tints produced on chloride-of-silver paper of
uniform sensitiveness.”   Calling the intensity of light I, and the
time of insolation t, the equation Ita Int, exists for equal shades.
By the discovery of this important law we are enabled to express
the intensity of light in comparable measures.
   The observations of Bunsen and Roscoe only relate to the
chloride-of-silver paper, but do not remain valuable for photo
graphs on collodion, since the development of the image on collo
dion changes the relative intensity of the shades, as is known to
every photographer.            I
                          have therefore prepared photographs of
the sun on chloride-of-silver paper in order to measure the in
tensity of the light emitted by different points of the sun's disk.
   The paper was carefully prepared, stretched over a plate of
glass, and exposed in the camera fixed to the telescope. Two
images of the sun were prepared on the 8th of March, 1872;
one was exposed during 30 seconds, the other during 40
seconds.       The diameter of the images was 108 millims.; the
weakening of the light towards the edge of the disk was clearly
seen in both.     I then determined four points of equal intensity
by a scale prepared photographically S. We assume that the
intensity i of the light used for the preparation of the scale was
                                                                                        in all
constant, and that the time t of exposure was the same for
points    of
          the sun's image.             the intensity    the light      of

  I  have tried to determine the relative intensities of the larger
sun-spots, their penumbrae, and the adjoining surface of the sun.
The mean of several observations showed the ratio of the inten
sity of the spot to the adjoining parts of the sun's surface to be
0.067; that of the penumbra was 0-630*.
  If  we take the distance from the centre as abscissa, the                                     in
tensity as ordinate, we obtain a curve showing the decrease of
the intensity from the centre of the sun's disk. The ordinates                                      I
of the curve which agrees best with the observations have been

  If these researches were executed for homogeneous rays, we
might obtain interesting information as to the constitution of
the sun's atmosphere.
   The author of the above paper seems to have been unaware
of the observations taken by Professor Roscoe in 1863 and com
municated to the Royal Society (see Phil. Mag. vol. xxvii. p.384).
Professor Roscoe has proved that the intensity of the chemically
active rays at the centre of the sun is greater than at the edge
of the disk. The absorption of the sun's atmosphere, according
to Professor Roscoe's experiments, is not so large as that result
ing from Vogel’s observations.          Calling the intensity at the
centre of the solar disk 100, the mean of Roscoe's observations
gives about 28 for the intensity at the edge, while Vogel gives 13.
The discrepancy may be partly accounted for by the rapid de
crease in the intensity near the edge; but it is            that this is          id:

 *   Communicated                    the Author, having been read before the National
Academy     of
           Sciences                     Cambridge,      Massachusetts, November 22, 1872.

                    in changing the Dimensions of Iron.          351
wires, each 110 yards long and ºr of an inch in diameter,
were bound together by tape so as to form a good and at the
same time very flexible conductor. The bundle of wires thus
formed was coiled upon a glass tube 40 inches long and 1% inch
in diameter. One end of the tube was hermetically sealed; and
the other end was furnished with a glass stopper, which was itself
perforated so as to admit of the insertion of a capillary tube. In
                                                      l
making the experiments, a bar of annealed iron, yard long and
% an inch square, was placed in the tube, which was then filled
up with water.        The stopper was then adjusted, and the capil
lary tube inserted so as to force the water to a convenient height-
within it.
     “The bulk of     the iron was about 4,500,000 times the capacity
of each division of the graduated tube; consequently a very
minute expansion of the former would have produced a very
 perceptible motion of the water in the capillary tube; but, on
connecting the coil with a Daniell’s battery of five or six cells
 (a voltaic apparatus quite adequate to saturate the iron), no per
 ceptible effect whatever was produced either in making or break
 ing contact with the battery, whether the water was stationary
 in the stem, or gradually rising or falling from a change of
 temperature.      Now, had the usual increase of length been un
 accompanied by a corresponding diminution of the diameter of
 the bar, the water would have been forced through twenty divi
 sions of the capillary tube every time that contact was made with
the battery.
     “Having thus ascertained that the bulk of the bar was inva
 riable,  I  proceeded to repeat my first experiments with a more
 delicate apparatus, in order, by a more careful investigation of
 the laws of the increment of length, to ascend to the probable
 cause   of the phenomenon.
     “A coiled glass tube, similar to that already described, was
   ...;
  fixed vertically in a wooden frame.       Its length was such that
  when a bar 1     yard    long was introduced so as to rest on the
  sealed end, each extremity of the bar was a full inch within the
                   extremity of the coil. The apparatus for obser
  ving the increment of length consisted of two levers of the first
  order, and a powerful microscope situated at the extremity of the
  second lever. These levers were furnished with brass knife-edges
  resting upon glass.       The connexion between the free extremity
  of the bar of iron and the first lever, and that between the two
  levers, was established by means of exceedingly fine platinum
 WireS.
      “The first  lever multiplied the motion of the extremity of the
   bar 7-8  times;   the second multiplied the motion of the first 8
   times; and the microscope was furnished with a micrometer di

352      Prof. A. M. Mayer on the Effects of Magnetization
vided into parts each corresponding to 2320 of an inch. , Con
sequently each division of the micrometer passed over by the
index indicated an increment of the length of the bar amounting
to  rail, as of an inch,
    “The quantities of electricity passing through the coil were
measured by an accurate galvanometer         of tangents, consisting
of a circle of thick copper wire 1 foot    in diameter, and a needle
#  an inch long furnished with a suitable index.
    “The quantities of magnetic polarity       communicated    to the
iron bar were measured by a finely suspended magnet 18 inches
long, placed at the distance of 1 foot from the centre of the coil.
This magnetic bar was furnished with scales precisely in the
manner of an ordinary balance; and the weight required to bring
it to a horizontal position indicated the intensity of the magnetism
of the iron bar under examination.
    “After   a few preliminary trials, a great advantage was found
to result from filling the tube with water.        The effect of the
water was, as De la Rive had already remarked, to prevent the
sound. It also checked the oscillations of the index, and had
the important effect of preventing any considerable irregularities
in the temperature of the bar.
                                    I
    “The first experiment which shall record was made with a
bar consisting of two pieces of well-annealed rectangular iron
wire, each 1 yard long, 4 of an inch broad, and about            of an
inch thick. The      pieces were fastened   together  so as to form a
bar of nearly 4 of an inch square.      The coil was placed in con
nexion with a single constant cell, the resistance being further
increased by the addition of a few feet of fine wire. The instant
that the circuit was closed, the index passed over one division of
the micrometer. The needle of the galvanometer was then ob
served to stand at 7°20', while the magnetic balance required
0:52 of a grain to bring it to an equilibrium.           It had been
found by proper experiments that a current of 7°20' passing
through the coil was itself capable of exerting a force of 0.03 of
a grain upon the balance; consequently the magnetic intensity
of the bar was represented by 0:49 of a grain. On breaking the
circuit the index was observed to retire 0.3 of a division, leaving
a permanent elongation of 0-7, and a permanent polarity of 0.42
of a grain. More powerful currents were now passed through
the coil and the observations    repeated as before, with the results
tabulated below:—

the elongution is in the duplicate ratio of the magnetic intensity of
the bar, both when the magnetism is maintained by the influence
of the coil, and in the case of the permanent magnetism after
the current has been cut off.        The discrepancies observable
will,   I think,
               be satisfactorily accounted for when we consider
the nature of the magnetic actions taking place.    When a bar
experiences the inductive influence of a coil traversed by an
electrical current, the particles near               axis            its
                                                                not receive          do                   as

                                                  because the former have

ber     ofmagnetic particles than the latter.             This phenomenon
will be diminished                 in

crease   ofthe electrical   force,  and will finally disappear when the
current       sufficiently powerful
              is                              saturate the iron.

current, the magnetism             the interior particles will suffer

three bars         of    soft steel.            As these bars had considerable degrees
of retentive power, the anomalies occasioned            the above                         by
described actions did not exist     any  considerable   extent,

lume of the Philosophical Magazine, Dr. Joule gives accounts
of numerous experiments made upon wires and bars of soft iron,
cast iron, soft and hardened steel, subjected to various pressures
and tensions while they were magnetized.        As an example of
the effect of tension on the phenomena, he states that in the case
of a bar 1 foot long and # of an inch in diameter, a tensile force
of about 600 pounds caused         the phenomena           all
                                                        changes                                   of                      of

   will be properly estimated.
      Although the cognate discovery by our countryman Page, in
   1837, that iron bars produce sound on their magnetization, has
   been carefully studied by Delezenne, De la Rive, Beatson, Mar
   rian, and Wertheim, yet in the annals of science    have found                                       I
   only two experimental investigations, in addition to the one by
   Joule, on the phenomena of the elongation produced in iron rods
   on their magnetization. The first is by Wertheim, in the Ann.
   de Chim. et de Phys. 3 ser, vol. xxiii.; the second by Tyndall,
   contained in a paper entitled “On some Mechanical Effects of
   Magnetization,” published in his “Researches                                               on 1)iamagnetism

         The apparatus used                          by   Dr. Tyndall consisted                    of   two vertical

brass rods firmly cemented into a block of stone. . Between
these rods, securely fixed in the stone, were placed the rods of
iron whose elongation he desired to measure.      On the vertical
rods slid a transverse bar of brass carrying “a vertical rod of
brass which moves freely and accurately in a long brass collar.
The lower end of the brass rod rests upon the upper flat surface
 of the iron bar. To the top of the brass rod is attached a point
 of steel; and this point passes against a plate of agate, near a
pivot which forms the fulcrum of a lever. The distant end of
the lever is connected by a very fine wire, with an axis on which
is fixed a small circular mirror. If the steel point be pushed up
against the agate plate, the end of the lever is raised; the axis
is thereby caused to turn, and the mirror rotates.” The angular
deflections of the mirror he determined by the method of Pog
gendorff—that           viewingis,   by

  Admitting, after some hesitation, “that two vibrations may
be superposed with coincident phase,” he proceeds as follows:—
      “In these cases we must not treat each vibration as a cause
in  itself, invariable under              by
                                     conditions.       we regard the two            If

                    as                      all

   This line        defence cuts away the ground upon which rest
                         of
the    undulatory    theories       light and sound. Those theories
                                                of
alike assume the application             the principle of  the superposi                 of

tion      small motions                  in

                           interference assumes that the motion                                               in
wave may          be
                represented        the ordinateby      particle—and that        of  a
where two waves are superposed                                  in                                  is
                                            which the vibration         the                         in
same    plane, their  joint  effect      represented   is  the  algebraical              by
sum       the expressions for the ordinates corresponding
         of                                                            each                              to
wave taken separately.
   This implies that the superposition            two equal waves       theof                             in
same    phase  will produce,       regards  anyasparticle      given  time,                   at

                  investigation of the phenomena which occur
IN ina searching
       the inflection (diffraction) of light, I have arrived at re
sults which deviate from the representations hitherto given, in
several, and,       I
               think, important points.
   Some time since (see Pogg. Ann. vol. cxlvi. pp. 1–65, 1872),
I treated theoretically the phenomena which are perceived when
                                                          at,
a point or a line of light is looked       with  telescope   with         a                        or
the naked eye, through      diffraction-grating—that
                                        a                  combi                          is,  a
nation      of   apertures        of
                         the same size and shape and             equal dis               at
tances from each other. The       theory   therefore   comprises   gratings
with opaque         or
                  transparent bars,         well   assuch     are cut with
                                                                    as              as

a                        plane glass
                              in   a         metal plate.      Besides the
validity      Huyghens's principle,
             of                               was therein     presupposed
that    afurrow-grating consists          depressions with little stair
                                                  of
like steps, one face     which    of parallelis    the untouched face
                                                                   to                                       of
the plate.
    For furrow-gratings the formulae are much more complicated
than for gratings with opaque bars. They show,                  accordance           in
 with the experiments, that the luminous intensity with these
 gratings (which      practice are used
                             in                 preference) depends very
                                                          in

    The investigation      reflected light affords this advantage, that
                                   of
 the experiment  can              be

elevations  of a grating have a very considerable influence on the
difference  of intensity of the light polarized parallel and perpen
dicular to the principal diffraction-plane. The phenomenon
changes with the colour of the flame, the substance in which the
diffraction takes place, and the angle of incidence of the rays.
   Further, in front of the object-glasses of a collimator and an
astronomical telescope, I placed two Nicol prisms, the azimuth
of which could be determined with accuracy to minutes on ver
tical circles.   The grating was placed between the prisms. In
some instances   the telescope was laid aside, and the eye looked
directly through the analyzing Nicol at the grating.       The slit
of the collimator was usually illuminated with daylight.
   When the Nicol prisms were crossed, the illuminated slit in
the eyepiece of the telescope appeared black; on inserting the
grating, it was illuminated, and the maxima or spectra of the
second class became visible.     The central image of the slit ap
peared variously coloured, according to the position of the Nicol
prisms. Viewed with one eyepiece-prism, it mostly shows a
dark streak in the spectrum, parallel to the Fraunhofer lines;
and on rotating the analyzing Nicol to greater azimuths, with
some gratings this streak travels towards the red, with others
towards the blue. The latter case, where the component pola
rized parallel to the principal plane of diffraction is greater                                      for
the red than for the blue,    the more frequent.

 ization is perceived, which with the same angle of incidence
 and the same spectrum of the second class is different in amount,
 and the absolute value of which may become greater or less as
 the wave-length increases.        To an azimuth + 2 or —a of the
 incident light corresponds after the diffraction the same azi
 muth + 8 or     -8    of the transmitted or reflected light.    For the
 directly transmitted or reflected rays (corresponding to the dif
 fraction-angle 0°) the rotation of the plane of polarization
 may amount to a few minutes or several degrees—with the
 lateral maxima of the second class, to 90° or more. The more
 frequent case is where the amplitude polarized perpendicular
 to the principal diffraction-plane, or parallel to the lines (fur
 rows) of the grating, is greater for blue than for red light.
    5. A grating inserted between Nicol prisms or polarizing ap
 paratus, when the incident light is white, imparts to the directly
 transmitted or reflected light similar colours to those shown by
 plates of crystal between polarizing arrangements.
    6. Ratio of amplitude and difference of phase vary, under
otherwise like conditions, with the inclination of the grating to
 the incident rays.
    7. Ratio of amplitude and difference of phase change, for nor
 mal as well as for oblique incident rays, with the substance of
 which, with transmitted light the surface of the bars, with re
flected light the furrows or elevations of the grating consist.

 width of the apertures or the form of the furrows or elevations.
    9. The finer the grating, or the more it is inclined to the      in

 cident rays, the greater, casteris paribus, is the change produced
by diffraction in the ratio of amplitude and the difference of
         of the light-waves polarized parallel and perpendicular to
 the principal plane of diffraction.
    10. The light reflected from furrowed metallic mirrors directly
 in the principal diffraction-plane exhibits very nearly the same dif
ference of phase as with smooth mirrors of the same material.
The amplitude polarized parallel to the reflection- or principal
diffraction-plane predominates still more over the amplitude po
larized perpendicular to the plane of incidence than with unfur
rowed metallic mirrors.        The direct reflected light from fur
rowed metallic mirrors approaches nearer in            itsproperties to
that reflected from transparent substances than does that which
is  reflected from smooth unfurrowed metallic mirrors.
    11. With gratings      in  other respects alike, the phenomena
vary with the substance     in  which the diffraction takes place.
    12. The    secondary   maxima,   for which the theory does not
account, exhibit the same remarkable behaviour towards polar
ized light  as   the maxima     of
                                 the second class.

     13.Furrow- and elevation-gratings of symmetrical form ex
hibit so nearly the same behaviour towards polarized light,
if right and left are exchanged, that the phenomena may be re
garded as identical.
    For the explanation of these phenomena,       think it must be           I
admitted that difference of phase and ratio of amplitude of the
light polarized parallel and perpendicular to the principal diffrac
tion-plane depend on the diffraction-angle and also on the substance
and the magnitude of the boundary between the heterogeneous parts
of a grating upon which the unit of cross section of the incident
light falls.
    This tells in favour of an influence of the molecules of the
 substance upon the oscillations of the aether particles, and the
inadmissibility of Huyghens's principle at the margins of the
apertures or furrows of a grating.
    The theorems found by experiment for gratings with groups
of apertures of like form, at equal distances from one another,
must hold also for gratings with similar-formed groups of aper
tures at unequal distances from each other or for single groups
of apertures, and even for heterogeneous particles distributed
in a homogeneous base. Therein the distance and magnitude
 of these particles may be less than a wave-length.
    Indeed polarized light exhibits the same behaviour towards
 single slits and furrows, or towards gratings with like-formed
 groups of apertures at unequal distances from one another,                                         as,
 according       the searching investigations

with the translation of Joannis Neperi Rabdologia, which he gave
in the volume just described.      In the second volume he pur
posed to give the translation of Henrici Briggii Arithmetica
Logarithmica and the Tables of Edmund Gunterus [Professor in

some patience till that second volume be printed [“ verwachten

    Now this second volume has never appeared, and by and by
I  will give a conjecture why not.

    Now Adriaen Vlacq, being the printer of this smaller work,
certainly was already occupied with the calculation of his Tables,
that were published two years later (Gouda, 1628); and as these
contained far more than the great work [groote werck] of de
Decker promised or could contain, and as, in the second place, the
last of the books before named was a manual that was very con
venient for use, I think we might give these two reasons for the
non-appearance of the second volume.     Perhaps, also, logarithms
being still nearly unknown, de Decker may have sold but few
copies of his smaller work     least                    (at
                                           now very scarce), and      it     is
       thought    prudent not    commit his purse       editing the                                by
                                                            of to
have                      it

the reason that sufficient number

has shown.
I      think    I     have shown that these small Tables were printed,
and the English Latin text translated         Vlack, and that                     by                                    de
Decker collected these works       his Nieuwe Telkonst;      that

it may          be
           surmised that Vlack,  after having  completed his own
calculations and edited his “Arithmetica Logarithmica’      1628,                                            in
regarded this, his great work,      completely eclipsing his first

    Pages viii. (not paged) contain the title, Preface au Lec
 teur and Fautes à corriger (which is generally missing); sheets
 a—g (pages 1–84) contain thirty chapters of explanation; sheets
 A—Kkk (720 pages not paged) contain Tafel der Logarithmi
 voor de ghetallen van  laf  tot 100000 (this title, not the French
 one in the copy at the British Museum, is that occurring in
 Miller's edition); sheets Lll–Sss (96 pages not paged) contain
 Canon Triangulorum sive tabula artificialium Sinuum, Tangen
 tium et Secantium, Ad Radium 10,00000,00000, et ad singula
 scrupula Primi Quadrantis.      It should be noticed that every
 sheet contains 12 pages.
    My copy, as appears from a notice on one of the fly-leaves,
was changed on March 26, 1667, for the second volume of de
 Decker's ‘Nieuwe Telkonst;” so that it follows again that this
 latter work was very scarce.
    Postscript.—I have found a further proof of the connexion
between Vlack and de Decker not having been loosened by the
former publishing his ‘Arithmetica Logarithmica,’ and thereby
forcing the latter to suppress his “great work,” the second vo
lume of the ‘Nieuwe Telkomst.’
    The same de Decker gave, some years later, a treatise on
Navigation:—

    This work contains sheets A–D (the title, dedication, preface,

tables proceed by 1' and give 10 decimal-places; as to the loga
rithms, there is mentioned at the last page the Nieuwe Telkonst
in octavo); sheets C–Dál contain some explanations, and then
Chapters I. to IX. of the Navigation (pages 1–304, where the
last page bears the erroneous superscription “Achste Hooft

printed at Rotterdam, 1659.
   This first edition being printed in 1631 by Vlack himself,
the author residing then at Rotterdam, refutes, I think, the idea
of Vlack and de Decker having quarrelled; neither is the as
sumption of a quarrel, as think           I
                                     have shown, necessary to I
explain the non-appearance of the “Groote werck,” or the
fact that Vlack does not mention de Decker, as the parts of the
two volumes of the Nieuwe Telkonst that were translated from
Neper, were Vlack's own work and not de Decker’s.

XLVIII. On Early Logarithmic Tables, and their Calculators.
 By J. W. L. GLAISHER, B.A., Fellow of Trinity College, Cam
  bridge*.
      HERE                      in connexion with Prof. de Haan’s
                  are a few remarks

viously to publication) that it will be convenient to make in im

rise  to     My
           it.  former  communications,  October and December
 (Supplement) 1872, contained descriptions     two works which                of
had apparently dropped completely out       notice     regard            of              in                  to

                                          in in
services rendered
point, however, was, that      both there are allusions      much                             to   a
larger work            on
                 logarithms, for which the reader was directed                                               to
wait patiently, using the Nieuwe Telkonst merely             make                         as   a
shift till       its
              appearance.    Now the    only  book     which these                  to
promises (supposing them         have been fulfilled) could apply
                                              to
was the Arithmetica Logarithmica           1628, which,           of
                                                               well                           as   is
known, was published                     by
                              Vlacq alone, and contains not the

                                       I
was equally remarkable; and expressed an opinion “that Vlacq
must have quarrelled with Decker, or for some other cause have
had a set purpose to ignore his book entirely.” The hypothesis
of the quarrel rested on no other evidence except such as the
                                           I
foregoing facts afforded; and am very glad Prof. de Haan, by
showing that friendly relations existed between Vlacq and De
Decker in 1631, has proved it to be untenable.        He considers
the smaller tables were printed by Vlacq, and merely collected
by De Decker, and attributes the silence of the former in the
Arithmetica to the fact that, in comparison with this work, he
was rather ashamed of his earlier performances; while De
Decker did not keep his word, because Vlacq occupied the
ground he had intended to cover. The explanation is not very
satisfactory (as, whatever the circumstances may have been, De
Decker and the promises should not have been ignored); but it
 is perhaps the best that will ever be obtained.   Prof. de Haan
apparently grounds his statement that Vlacq was a bookseller
 under the firm of Pieter Rammaseyn on the fact that the pri
 vileges are made out to him *.   At the time of writing my papers
I   was surprised, though I find that                    I
                                         have not alluded to the
  matter, at Vlacq’s name being mentioned in both the privileges
 (while neither De Decker's nor Rammaseyn's appear at                                    all
                                                                                               on in
that     the Nieuwe Telkonst, where De Decker's alone appears
        of
the titlepage); and       I       do
                             not even now see the reason very
clearly. With regard        the date when Vlacq became
                                  to                      book                      a

378               Mr.    J. W.      L. Glaisher        on   Early Logarithmic
esse    cogebar,ut exemplaria excusa distribuerem; istaq; de
occasione  primum    in Galliam, deinde etiam in Angliam profec
tus sum, ubi me rem meam bene acturum putabam ” (Joannis
Miltoni Defensio secunda. . . . . Hag. Com. 1654. Typographus
prose-ipso).    These words, taken literally, imply that Vlacq was
not connected with the bookselling trade until he began to print
the Arithmetica, which must have been subsequently to 1626; but
I  do not think that great importance is to be attached to their
exact meaning, as Vlacq here, as in the Arithmetica, ignores his
early work performed in conjunction with De Decker; and as we
know that the Arithmetica itself was also printed by Ramma
seyn.    Thus most likely either Vlacq had nothing to do with
printing or bookselling till after the publication of this work in
1628, or he was connected with the trade in some way or other
through Rammaseyn from the date of his (or De Decker's)
earliest logarithmic work in 1626. The latter view is that
adopted by Prof. de Haan, and is very likely correct; but the
simple meaning of Vlacq’s own words agrees better,             think,                            I
with the former. It is    proper  to state here that a list of names
 (with dates and places) of editors of logarithmic tables appended
to a tract of Prof. de Haan's, “Iets over Logarithmentafels'’”,
contains that of De Decker (Gouda, 1626); but this              far                        is,   as          as

upon untrue suggestions, caused them to be seized and sold to
Vlack for £100. Vlack is now preparing to go beyond seas to
avoid answering his late bringing over nine bales of books con
trary to the decree of the Star Chamber, and procures some
persons to pretend that he is indebted to them (as formerly
Hooganhuysen did), thereby to get the books into their posses
sion. Petitioner prays order to bring the bales to Stationers’
Hall, there to remain till Vlack shall re-deliver to him the said
four vats of books, or at least at the same price he bought them.
Reference to Sir John Lambe to take three Commissioners’
hands, and by warrant bring the books above-mentioned to
Stationers' Hall, till the cause may be heard.      13th November,
1637° (Vol. ccclxxi.     p. 94).
    This series of the Calendar of State Papers is not as yet pub
lished beyond the beginning of 1639, so that it is not certain
whether Vlacq’s name will occur again; but we know, from his
own account (Phil. Mag. Oct. 1872), that a compromise was
effected.    The case of Hooganhuysen (David van Hooganhosen
as he   generally  appears) was repeatedly before the court for more
than a   year.   He originally had James Bleau as his co-defendant;
but the latter was discharged on June 26, 1634, and judgment
against the former given on June 15, 1635, in the following
words:—“Considering the ill-consequence and scandal that
would arise by strangers importing and venting in this kingdom
books printed beyond seas, it was ordered that Hooganhosen
should not bring over or sell Mercator’s Atlas or Atlas Major in
English, and if such be brought over by any one they are to be
seized.” He was also subsequently (July 7, 1635) ordered to
carry out his contract with regard to the delivery of Amesius
upon the Psalms and other works to certain booksellers. It
 will be seen how well the quotation about Vlacq agrees with
 his own account.       He was about ten years in London, and
 finally left on the breaking out of the civil war; so that he spent
 the years from 1632–1642 in England”, the first few very
 peaceably, but afterwards he was treated as he describes.       The
 petition of Richard Whitacres was very likely the commence
 ment of hostilities.
    Of the books which Vlacq names as having been printed by
 himself between 1642 and 1648 at Paris,         I
                                                 have not been suc
 cessful in seeing a copy that satisfies these conditions; but          I
     I
  * take this opportunity of correcting a mistake of a name in my first
communication    (Oct. 1872). Dr. Johnston should be the well-known
Dr. Juxon, who became Bishop of London in 1633, and as Archbishop of
Canterbury in 1660 crowned Charles       II.
                                          The Latin  is Jorstonius, which,
considering the w   misprint for

only partially remembered the name.

    In the Calendar of State Papers (Domestic Series), 1600–
1638, Briggs's name occurs several times. He was a Commis
sioner of Sewers for Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridgeshire, &c., and
in conjunction with Sir Anthony Thomas, John Worsopp, Hilde
debrand Prusen, and others was an undertaker for draining the
fens (Dec. 2, 1629). When in February 1625 the tides over
threw 1120 rods of bank in the neighbourhood of Yarmouth,
Briggs was consulted with regard to the levels.    He was also a
member of a commission to effect the removal of several houses in
Oxford; and his death is reported by the Vice-Chancellor (Jan.27,
1631) as having occurred the previous day.                                 is,

assessed run from £6            George Miller,to      £40       William                to                to

become acquainted with the fact that this condensed catalogue has
been brought up to the date of publication by the industrious
author, and thus supplies the hiatus created by the “Bedford Cata
logue’ being out of print; indeed the “Bedford’ is now becoming
a record of the past, exceedingly valuable as showing the state of
this branch of astronomy in 1844, but inadequate to the wants of
the working amateur in 1873.
   The first edition of the “Celestial Objects’ was marked by a fea
ture almost unique, the only parallel being Tables of Lunar objects
(mostly from Schröter) in the late Sir David Brewster's Supple
mentary Chapters to Ferguson’s “Astronomy,’ published in 1821,
accompanied by a map of the moon by Mayer, a predecessor of
Schröter.    Mr. Webb embellished his first edition with an admi
rable lunar map from Beer and Mädler's Mappa Selenographica,
which for clearness of detail and facility of reference can hardly be
surpassed, and gave the names of the 404 objects which are found
on the German map, accompanied with short descriptive notices of
the most important.    It was the publication of this map and cata
logue which drew that attention to the study of the moon's surface
which has resulted in a revised impression of the map, containing
ninety additional numbers referring to as many new names in the
list. An appendix includes the latest information bearing on tele
scopes, observations of the Sun, Venus, the Moon, Jupiter, Comets,
and the so-called fixed stars.
   We apprehend that no amateur astronomer would willingly be
without this valuable compendium of his science.
   Turning from Amateur to Government work, we regret to find,
from the Report of the Astronomer Royal for Scotland, that no
thing additional is to be given to the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh.
It appears that an extensive task is projected—that of forming a
general catalogue of Edinburgh stars from the earliest days of the
activity of the Observatory.      The personal staff consists of the
Astronomer Royal for Scotland and two assistants only, the daily
duties being the computation of meteorological observations from
fifty-five stations of the Meteorological Society of Scotland, the ob
servation of stars for time, and           its

THE“On        the Vapour-density of Potassium.”—Preliminary Notice.
By James Dewar and William Dittmar:
   Since the elaborate experiments of Deville and Troost on the vapour
densities of substances at high temperatures, little has been added
to chemical science in this field of research. Doubtless this is in
great part owing to the difficulty of any one student manipula
ting the complex apparatus necessary for the execution of the
experiments.      But the operations are greatly increased in difficulty
when we select bodies that are readily inflammable in air and attack
with facility glass and porcelain at the high temperatures to which
they are exposed. This is the reason why the molecular weights
of a most important class of elementary bodies, viz. the alkali
metals    (although   these are volatile at moderate temperatures),
have remained to the present time undetermined.         It was with the
 view of adding something to our knowledge in this department, that
we recently undertook some experiments with potassium, the results
of which we now beg leave to lay before the Society. The special
difficulties we had to overcome are involved in the endeavour to
answer the following questions:—
    1. Is it possible to convert potassium into a gas of one atmo
sphere's pressure at any of the constant temperatures we can at pre
sent command 2
    2. Is it possible to generate pure potassium-vapour and to keep
it from getting oxidized ?
    3. Supposing a definite volume of such vapour to have been pro
cured, how can its weight be ascertained ?
    After a succession of failures, which we shall not detail, we at
last succeeded in devising a workable process, which may be briefly
described as follows:—
    A cylindrical iron bottle of at least 200 cub. centims. capacity,
of a thickness in the body ensuring sufficient rigidity at even a
bright red heat, and provided with a well-ground inbent neck,
pierced with a canal of about 2 millims. diameter, is employed as
a generator and receptacle of the vapour.
    A mass of about 20 kilogrs. of zinc contained in a plumbago
crucible, which being placed in a forge-fire can be readily heated
up to the boiling-point, serves as a bath.
   The experiment begins by first deoxidizing the inside of the
receptacle at a red heat by means of a current of dry hydrogen,
which is continuously maintained until the bottle has cooled down
below redness.       At this stage about 200 grims. of pure mercury
are introduced into the bottle, which is then inserted into the red
hot zinc, without, however, covering the upper extremity of the

                                Royal Society.                             385
bottle.      After # of the mercury is distilled off (which is accom
plished in a very short time), the neck is withdrawn; and while the
mercury-vapours are still streaming out, an iron test-tube, previously
prepared with great care and charged with 4–5 grms. of potassium,
is dropped into the bottle, the neck reinserted, and, after the whole
of the bottle has been immersed in the zinc, the blast of the forge
is forcibly increased so as, in the shortest possible time, to bring
the zinc into the state of boiling, proper arrangements being made
for keeping the neck of the bottle red-hot.             The potassium in a
short time       begins  to  volatilize,   issuing in jets into the air and
depositing caustic potash at the nozzle, which must be kept clear
by means of an iron wire.         As soon as the distillation of the potas
sium     ceases,  the nozzle is closed by means of a ground-in wire
plug, at once immersed into a mass of mercury contained in a
test-tube, and the bottle withdrawn to a proper support, on which
it is allowed to cool.
     After it has reached a manageable temperature, the bottle is
 inserted into a mass of recently boiled water, the wire plug with
 drawn, and the hydrogen formed by the action of the water on the
 potassium pumped out, by means of a “Sprengel,” into a eudiometer,
to be measured.
     In the experiments we have hitherto carried out, we have satisfied
 ourselves that the amount of mercury-vapour not swept out by the
 potassium is quite inappreciable; and as our object has been in the
 mean time to merely arrive at approximate results and to perfect
 our methods of manipulation, we have neglected the minute cor
 rection which, on account of that small remnant of mercury, ought,
 strictly speaking, to have been applied to the volume of the vapour
 as calculated from the capacity of the bottle in the cold, the coeffi
  cient of expansion of iron, and the temperature (1040° Deville) at
 which the vapour was measured.
     The results of our observations conclusively show that the density
  of potassium-vapour, as produced in the process described, cannot
  exceed 45 times that of hydrogen, and that therefore the molecule
  of potassium consists of two atoms (K.).
         e intend to prosecute our research in other directions, propo
  sing to ascertain, if possible, the densities of the iodides of caesium,
  rubidium, and potassium, these being, according to Bunsen's experi
  ments, the most volatile of the haloids of the alkali-metals.               -

      “Note on Supersaturated Saline Solutions.”                 By Charles
  Tomlinson, F.R.S.
      In  the year 1866,    M.  Gernez and M. Viollette published each a
  memoir on supersaturated            saline solutions*, in which the same
     * Annales Scientifiques de l'École Normale Supérieure, tome 3°, Année

conclusions are arrived at, namely:-(1) that the only nucleus
capable of suddenly crystallizing any one of such solutions is a salt
of the same kind as that dissolved; and (2) that all bodies, solid,
liquid, or aeriform, which apparently act as nuclei, are really con
taminated with a hydrate of the salt that forms the supersaturated
solution.
     I  cannot refrain from expressing my admiration at the unwearied
skill and patience with which these two memoirs were prepared.
 The experiments were repeated by hundreds, and under a large
 variety of circumstances, so that it seems scarcely possible to
 entertain any doubt as to the validity of the conclusions arrived at.
 I   had not seen these memoirs until long after the publication of my
                                             I
 second paper on this subject”; or should have hesitated in offering
 it to the Royal Society without special reference to them. What
 I   did see was a very brief abstract of M. Gernez's memoir in the
                                           I
 ‘Comptes Rendus;' and to this refer in my first papert, quoting
 the experiments and the decisive objections of M. Jeannel in oppo
  sition to M. Gernez's conclusions.
      The experiments of Mr. Liversidget are identical in principle with
  those of M. Viollette, and some of them mere variations, such as the
  proof that bodies greedy of water and capable of being hydrated do
  not produce crystallization; only M. Viollette made use of calcined
  sulphate of copper instead of calcic chloride &c.;                    Moreover no
  fresh proofs are wanted as to the non-nuclear action of the modified
  salt or of the anhydrous salt on supersaturated solutions of Glauber's
  salt.
       Recently MM. Gernez||and Viollette‘<U+017F> have each, on the occasion
   of the publication of my third paper (namely, that written in con
   junction with M. Van der Mensbrugghe"), called in question the
   integrity of my experiments, M. Gernez insisting that the oils and
   other liquids employed by me contain salts of the same kind as
   those of the solutions they apparently acted on.
       Such an assertion as this seems to me to be very difficult of
   proof; and it seems equally bold to assume that the air of an
   open garden in the country contains salts of various kinds, watchin
   their opportunity to get into my flasks and vitiate the results of
    my experiments.
       I desire to invite special attention to a statement made in my
    second paper—the more so because, without desiring for a moment
    to call in question the negative results obtained by MM. Gernez
       .

and Viollette, namely that pure oils &c., as used by them, whether
in the form of films or globules, do not cause the solutions to crys
tallize, the method indicated opens a new process for ascertaining
whether there is really any other nucleus except a salt of the same
kind. The statement referred to is as follows:—
   “A solution of two parts of Glauber's salt to one part of water
was boiled and filtered into three flasks, which were covered with
watch-glasses and left until the next day. A drop of castor-oil was
then placed upon the surface of each : it formed a lens which
gradually flattened; but there was no separation of salt, even when
the flasks were shaken so as to break up the               into small globules.         oil
.   .   .  If, while the flask being turned round, sudden jerk
            .                                        is                                           a                         be
given        to      it,   so   as
                          flatten someto       the globules against the side
                                                                    of
into   films,  the whole solution     instantly   becomes solid”                                         ".

     Now in this          case       it may be objected that a crystal of the sodic
sulphate hydrate was derived from one of the following sources:—
(1) from the air, (2) from the oil, (3) from the cork, or (4) from
the side of the flask. (1) It could not be derived from the air,
either of the laboratory or of the garden, because the solution
remained liquid long after the flask had been corked.             (2) It could
not have been derived from the oil, because this was dispersed
through the solution in myriads of globules, without any nuclear
action, and the flask was left to repose for an hour after the              had                                 oil
been       so
            dispersed.     (3) Nor could any nucleus have been derived
from the cork, because the solution never touched                   Nor could                    it.
a  minute speck         the sodic sulphate hydrate have fallen from the
                           of
cork; for the latter had been put into hot water, out            which     was               of                it
taken the moment          was put into the flask.         could not have been         It

solution        in the non-nuclear anhydrous state, and also because
two hours had elapsed between the corking                   the flask and the          of
solidification        of
                    the solution.      (4)      crystal could not have been
                                                                      A
derived from the walls             the flask, because the solution had been
                                             of
briskly boiled            in   it,   so
                              that steam escaped with considerable force
from the neck after the small beaker had been put on. Hence
I  am compelled          fall back
                               as to       my former statement *—namely,
                                                                 on

    A globular flask, containing the same solution and the same oil,

in  the former case,            avoid splashing against the cork.
                                        to                                 This

                in                                     my second paper, very     in
different from the minute radial action noticed when crystallization
sets    from pointt.
       in             a
    A similar flask, containing the same solution, was treated with
oil  ofbergamot,     drop  a                  of
                               which was allowed   trickle down the                    to
side   of   the flask.           As soon                as   the      oil   touched the solution,              crystal
lization set in, the radiant-point coinciding with such point                                                         of

from this point alone.
     In
     another case    drop       a                  of   the       oil   of    rosemary was deposited                  on
the centre        of
              the solution.                                    On shaking the flask, the solution
assumed the solid state.
   Two flasks, containing the same solution, crystallized under the
influence of oil of lavender.
     'ive flasks, with the same solution, crystallized under the action
of  sperm-oil.

   Experiment 5. Potash-alum—8 salt, 3 water.         The solution
crystallized suddenly, as with a flash, on being shaken up with

a nucleus is to produce                       a    solitary octahedron, which grows rapidly
until the solution becomes solid. This last effect was produced by
a less violent shaking of the solution in contact with              lavender.                         oil   of

of other nuclei than salt of the same kind as that of the solution

and one or two other salts”.   On the other hand, fine weather has
its advantages; not only are the surfaces of the solutions more
active and the evaporative force stronger, but hydrated salts, said
to exist in the air, part with their water of crystallization so readily
as to reduce them to the non-nuclear condition.             This is especially
the case with sodic sulphate.                                       I
                                         have already shown that super
saturated solutions of this salt may be exposed to the air, both in
fine and wet weather, for a long time without crystallizing t, as
well as the fact just noticed f, that a solution of a salt does not
act as a nucleus to                     its
                           supersaturated solution. Moreover,            sodic                                           if

that found by Professor         Seidel for the light of the stars.     By
employing      the table thus deduced, and also reducing the heat
determinations obtained on the various nights for change of dis
tance of the sun, a more accurate phase-curve was deduced,
indicating a more rapid increase of the radiant heat on approaching
full moon than was given by the formula previously employed, but
still not so much as Professor Zöllner's gives for the moon's light.
    By employing Laplace's formula for the extinction of light in
our atmosphere, the heat-effect in terms of the scale-readings was
deduced, and an approximation to the height of the atmosphere
attempted.
    From a series of simultaneous measurements of the moon's heat
and light at intervals during the partial eclipse of November 14,
1872, when clouds did not interfere, it was found that the heat
and light diminish nearly if not quite proportionally, the minimum
for both occurring at or very near the middle of the eclipse, when
they were reduced to about half what they were before and after
contact with the penumbra.

 Alleyne Nicholson, M.D., F.G.S., &c.
    The author described the general characters of Thunder Bay,
which is almost landlocked on the south-east by the bold promontory
 of Thunder Cape and a series of islands which form a continuation
 of this. The rocks immediately surrounding Thunder Bay belong
 to the “Lower and Upper Copper-bearing series” of Canadian
 geologists.     The latter, consisting of sandstones, shales, limestones,
 marls, and conglomerates, chiefly of a red or reddish colour, with
 interstratified traps, is regarded by the author as probably of Lower
 Silurian age, in accordance with the opinion of Sir Wim. Logan.
 The “Lower Copper-bearing series” is also very varied in character;
it  is traversed by trap dykes, and contains several well-marked
 interstratified traps.    It is penetrated by two sets of mineral veins,
 containing great abundance of silver.         The majority of these run
 along the strike of the beds in a general E.N.E. and W.S.W. direc
 tion; the remainder are transverse, running nearly N. and S. Of
 the latter the most important is the “Silver-islet vein,” which is
 3 or 4 feet in width, and consists of quartz with native silver and
 galena; picked specimens of the stuff have assayed from £1000 to
 42000 per ton. This vein has been worked for about two years,
 and has proved remarkably productive.           Of the former series the
 most important is the “Shuniah vein,” which runs along at a dis

tance of 14 to 2 miles from the north shore of Thunder Bay,
the mines in which, although quite in their infancy, promise
excellent results.        Its wid this 22 feet; and the vein-stuff consists
mainly of calc-spar. The silver is present in the native form and as
sulphide.      The vein traverses hard black shales, but does not run
exactly along the strike of the beds; it may be traced for several
miles towards the east.
    The country between Thunder Bay and Lake Shabendowan, along
the “Dawson Road,” is of an undulating character; and the surface
 of  its fundamental rocks everywhere exhibits unmistakable evidences
of   glaciation, the general direction           the striae being

 with the occasional occurrence                          of
                                                  minor set   a    grooves running      of
 nearly       E.and W. The greater part                   the country    of   thickly                   is
 covered with     drift,  composed                  of
                                          rocks which     appear     have travelled          to

the beds displayed in a section close to the base of the great land

in yellow clay and sludge. The whole neighbourhood was described
by the author as presenting evidences of former landslips.        The
author further described the appearances presented by the upper

                       BY M. A. CORN U.
      HAVE     the honour to present to the Academy the definitive re
    sult of  my  researches relative to the determination of the velocity
of  light, undertaken three years since. In a preceding communica
      I
tion have succinctly described the method of observation, which, in
principle, is that of the toothed wheel, due, as well as the improve
ments which have been made in                           it,

numerical results which         have obtained.
                                         I
I      will first briefly describe the arrangements. The observing
station    is   in    an
                     upper room       the pavilion
                                               of        the Ecole Polytech
                                                                        of
nique; the other,              in
                          the chamber        one      of
                                                     the barracks  of     Mont                 on
Valérien. At the former station are fixed the observing-telescope
(aperture 180 millims., focal distance 2.4 metres), the toothed wheel
and its motive mechanism, the illuminating system, the apparatus
for registering the velocities, the electric wires, &c. The opposite
station contains only the reflecting collimator, composed                    ob               of    an
jective (aperture 110 millims., focal distance 1-2 metre) mounted                                        as
a  telescope and with        small plane mirror
                                    a                   silvered glass
                                                                    of       the                    in
focal plane.

    Idescribe in detail in the memoir the precautions to be taken in
order to adjust in the same right line the optic axes of the two ap
paratus, and to place the surface of the mirror in the focal plane of
the collimator.    This second condition must be fulfilled very accu
rately; otherwise the loss of light on the return would be consider
able.    Isucceeded in fulfilling it completely by using as a reticule
the silver pellicle partially raised on certain points of the mirror:
the precision is then determined entirely by the defining-power of
the telescope.
   Among the improvements introduced in the course of these re
searches,     I
             will mention the construction of the motor of the toothed
wheel.    Froment's motor, with helicoidal tooth-range, was given up,
as it necessitated too great a motive force.                I
                                                 notably simplified the
arrangement by utilizing some clockwork mechanisms sold under
the name of roulants carrés (the sides from 12 to 15 centims.); the
escapement and wheelwork are taken away, and the ratchet-wheel
of the escapement is replaced by a lighter wheel with finer teeth:
I used for this purpose three patterns, wheels with 104,116, and
140 teeth.
   By fitting a powerful spring in the barrel,    have been able to I
attain velocities of from 700 to 800 turns in a second. Finally, as
a complement, on the axle of the minute-hand                    I
                                                     disposed an electric
cam   (necessary for the  registration of the velocity of rotation of the
mechanism), a brake (to regulate the velocity at will), and a second
barrel (permitting the toothed wheel to be turned in the contrary
direction).   This last arrangement is useful for the elimination of
certain  systematic  errors which might result from the mechanism
itself.
     I
     shall not dwell upon the description of an experiment.          The
observer, attentive to the variations of intensity of the return-light,

plishing the double of the distance between the two stations.            This
distance, carefully determined, was found to be 10310 metres, with
a probable error of less than 10 metres in excess or defect—that is
to say, an approximation to within one thousandth part.          I  effected
this measurement myself, with the aid of a little triangulation.            I
took advantage of the circumstance that the three salients of bas
tions No. 1, No. 2, and No. 5 of the fortifications of Mont Valérien
could be seen from the belvedere of the École Polytechnique.             Ta
king, with a good azimuth-circle, the angles subtended by those
three points,   I was able, by the calculation of the proper segments,
to obtain the data necessary for ascertaining the distance between
the two stations.     The dimensions of the fortress having been ac
curately measured by the engineers,       I obtained from the Dépôt des
Fortifications the distances between the necessary points, which
                                                                       -
enabled me to dispense with measuring a base.
    I found, besides, at the Prefecture of the Seine, two determina
tions of the distance from certain points on Mont Valérien to the
Panthéon (one derived from the operations for the Register, the
other from those of the Commission for the Plan of Paris). The
mean of the three closely agreeing values thus obtained gave the
number above adopted.         If a subsequent geodesic operation should
furnish more exactly the distance between the two stations, it will
be very easy to calculate the correction to be applied to my results.
    The following Table gives the result of the definitive calculations;

cond, are classed according to the order of the occultations of the
return-light which furnished them.

    The numbers in parentheses express the relative weight of the
corresponding values. They were formed by dividing by 10 the
product of the number of observations into 2n—1 (n being the order
of the occultation) and the coefficient 1, 2, 3, or 4, according as the
remark in the experiment-book was “pretty good,” “good,” “very
good,” or “excellent,” according to the state of the atmosphere.
    The compound mean gives 298400.             Multiplying this by the
index of refraction of the air, 1.0003, we obtain the number 29.8500
kilometres per second as the value of the velocity of light in vacuo
deduced from the totality of my observations.           I reckon that this
number approaches within air.
    The accordance of this result with Foucault's is not uninterest
ing; and it should      be remarked that Foucault's experiments re
quired verification, not only because the details of the observations
and procedure have not been published, and therefore have under
gone no discussion, but also because the rotating-mirror method is
exposed to grave objections (into the statement of which        I  shall not
now enter), while M. Fizeau's method is free from those objections.

Astronomers,   also, will find in this new determination of the velo
city of light an important confirmation of the value of the sun's
parallax 8"'86, which is obtained by comparing this number with
the constant of the aberration.     It is the value which M. Le Ver
rier has found  again  by  three series of observations relative to the
motions of the planets, particularly Mars and Venus.      The import
ance, then, for astronomy, of the precise determination of the ve
locity of light cannot be too much insisted on.
                      I                 I
   In conclusion, think am right in affirming, as M. Fizeau an
nounced immediately after his first researches, that the same expe
riments could, without much more difficulty, be repeated, under
favourable atmospheric and topographical conditions, with stations
from 20 to 30 kilometres apart. Then, with the aid of a special
geodesic operation,       I
                      doubt not that we could obtain a determination
of the velocity of light approximate within less than a thousandth
part.   I have the greatest desire to attempt this experiment, and
should deem it a great honour if the Academy would receive the
project favourably.     It is desirable, for the honour of French
science, that those grand labours commenced by Roemer at the Ob
servatory of Paris, simplified and continued by French savants,
should be completed in France with         the precision which comall
ports with their importance      the light    physics and astronomy.

   The whole of the experiments which         have made during the          I
last two years have led me, as an application, to the construction
of a musical instrument of an entirely new quality of tone, ap
proximating to the human voice.          have given it the name of I

upon one of the branches of a diapason animated, during the ex
periment, with a known vibratory movement.        In this second tele
scope the eyepiece is replaced by a plane mirror inclined 45° to its
optic axis, and reflecting the luminous rays to a parallel mirror
situated in the first telescope. This second mirror is transparent,
so that it transmits the rays coming from the fixed objective. The
observer, then, perceives simultaneously two luminous images of
the trajectory.    That given by the fixed telescope will appear
under the form of a rectilinear stroke of fire; the other, trans
mitted by the vibrating objective, will have the form of a sinusoid,
of which the rectilinear stroke will be the axis. If the number of
 vibrations of the diapason in the unit of time be chosen so that the
 number of branches of the sinusoid comprised between two parallel
 wires of the reticule does not exceed five or six, the observer will
be able to count them instantaneously,         and also to remember which
wires pass through the intersection of the sinusoid with                central                                its

 ON     THE DEVELOPMENT          OF HEAT BY THE FRICTION                OF   LIQUIDs
                         AGAINST SOLIDS. BY O. MASCHKE.
  It   is known that the energetic aspiration of a liquid through a
porous substance is accompanied by a rise of temperature, probably
resulting from the friction of the liquid against the walls of the
capillary channels into which it rushes.     M. Maschke gives some
measurements of the rise of temperature obtained by soaking amor
phous silica with various liquids.
   The porous body, reduced to grains of the size of mustard-seed,
is introduced into a test-tube closed by a stopper with three aper
tures, one of which gives passage to a thermometer, which measures
the temperature of the porous body and afterwards that of its mix
ture with the liquid introduced; another has a glass siphon which
dips to the bottom of the test-tube; through the third an aspiration
tube passes.

                By a prolonged stay in the same medium, the porous
                        are caused to have, at the commencement of
                   sensibly the same temperature.    The outer extre
mity of the siphon being immersed in the liquid, the operator                        in
hales gently through the discharge-tube, and observes the highest
temperature reached by the thermometer during the imbibing of the
liquid by the porous substance.
   M. Maschke has studied the following cases:–amorphous silica,
first moistened, then dried at a moderate temperature till it con
tained only 39.8 per cent. of water, treated with water; silica con
taining 18.8 per cent. of water, and water; dry silica and water;
calcined silica exposed to moist air (22.68 per cent. Hº O), and
water; silica calcined and then exposed to very moist air (28-24
per cent. Hº O), and water; silica calcined and cooled over sulphuric
acid, treated sometimes with water, and sometimes with benzole,
oil of almonds, concentrated sulphuric acid, or alcohol.
   The experiment lasted 3, 10, 20, 30, and even as long as 45 mi
nutes; but it was not at the end of the experiment that the ther
mometer immersed in the porous substance attained          maximum.    its

            LII.        On the Expansion of Superheated Vapours.

                                § 1.
IN     my earlier investigations on the variability of vapour-den
      sitiest, among other results it appeared that, under certain
feeble pressures, continually heated vapours contained within a
space of constant dimensions may have a smaller coefficient of
expansion than that which is attributed to perfect gases, viz.
0.003663. The numbers then obtained, however, rather pointed
towards such a behavionr of the vapours than decidedly proved
it,   as

air from the leg of the tube and fill it exclusively with a certain
quantity of the vapour. When the wished-for degree of filling
is attained, this leg is closed by melting the end with a pointed
flame.      As the boiling takes place under atmospheric pressure,
when we wish the half-leg filled with superheated vapour of
feeble pressure we have to keep only a corresponding fraction of
the interior of the leg free from mercury during the boiling, conse

   H is the difference (reduced to 0°) of the levels of the mer
cury in the tube at each experiment, and so the proper object of
the measurements.      In the calculations, H is given in milli
metres.
   v, R, and W are obtained in the following manner from the
mercury-weighings:—
     Ifwe imagine the tube divided into two exactly equal parts,
and if W, is the volume of each part at 0° expressed in the
weight of mercury at 0°, at the temperature t of observation it
becomes W3(1+8t), if & is the coefficient of expansion of the

tain quantity of aqueous vapour, which at low temperatures par
tially adheres and in various proportions at various temperatures.
It is seen what great changes this adhesion, consequently the
variable going out of play of a certain quantity of vapour, occa
sions in the values of q belonging to low temperatures.
   The method has accordingly been proved by a twofold test to
be perfectly applicable; and this is the direct confirmation of an
antecedently justified expectation.
                                          § 4.
    The vapours which            I investigated by this method were sul
phide of carbon, chloroform, and ethylic alcohol.                        The chloro
form was a small, carefully preserved remainder of the prepara
tion made use of in my earlier experiments; the two others were
newly prepared.         In the following the Tables on the vapour of
sulphide of carbon shall first be given. In the last column the
vapour-pressures p are still shown; they are calculated from p by
the formula
                                           $(273+t)

   It  may further be remarked that the absolute values of $ and
p  are affected by at any rate small errors in the above-mentioned
 weighings of the individual volumes of the tubes, which cannot
be excluded; and therefore in this point the possibility of small
errors must be borne in mind. The course of the values of
 $, however, which is alone of importance,                     depends essentially
 upon very exactly observed values of H. Where several series
 of observations gave somewhat differing numbers for the latter
 values,   I have noted down, in the column                   “H     corrected,” the
 numbers made use of for the                  calculation;    I  have also inserted
 in this column notices of the cessation of saturation. Here,
however, according to the Tables, the difference is never more
than 0.1 millim.

    The preceding Tables show that in the individual series of ob
servations       the vapour-volumes were approximately                           constant.
Heated in these constant spaces, the vapour shows for the lower
pressures, up to about 300 millims., constant values of p, while
for higher pressures p increases in a slight degree with rising
temperature; but in these cases the augmentation of p is de
cidedly spread uniformly over the whole interval of the set of
observations, and is by no means more prominent in the first
degrees of the superheating.                 In several series it is evident that

    There is now evidently a somewhat smaller quantity of vapour
in action than at the commencement of the experiments; and
this is recognizable in the feebler tension of the vapour.
    The influence of this adhesion shows itself also in the series
of the following Tables for alcohol.           have on each occasion          I
been able to convince myself of this by simply observing the
tubes narrowly: to a practised eye the difference in behaviour
between such an adhering substance and one that does not
adhere, in the vicinity of saturation and in the transition to sa
turation, is not to be mistaken.      It only remains surprising that
 in my earlier investigations I found alcohol not to be one of
 the number of adhering substances.          It may, however, be re
 marked that then and now I       investigated  two different prepara
 tions, and it is quite conceivable that the slightest shade of differ
 ence in preparing the material may call forth this property.

throws no light upon the exact behaviour of steam.          Moreover

               and with this my earlier experiments
must be remembered that the variations of   vapour-density  there
found are, in their significance, inversely proportional to the
variations of q which we have now obtained.
   It results further from the present observations (which often
extended over a wide interval) that this slight variation of q is
by no means confined to the first two degrees of superheating
above the point of saturation, but

                                     of Superheated              Vapours,                                 423
the attainment of the gaseous state a greater                                          superheating           is
required than
                         º      .   10 or 350°.
  We thus          that, wherever a sensible deviation of purely
                    see
saturated vapour from the gaseous state has place, a very con
siderable elevation of temperature is necessary in order by super
heating in constant volume to make it pass into the gaseous
condition.
    For practical application we hence obtain the not unimportant
result, that, at least so long as the limits of these experiments
are not exceeded (therefore to about 4 atmospheres pressure),
only trifling errors are entailed by putting the coefficient of pres
sure-expansion for a constant volume simply equal to the coeffi
cient of expansion of air, provided the limits of the temperatures
under consideration are not too wide, say not more than 50°.
    For the theoretical side of the question, however, such a tri
fling augmentation of q is perfectly sufficient to cause the pro
portions to appear quite different from what they would be with
% constant.   To see this it is best to keep in view the two di
rections in which I have followed the variability of the vapour
densities.  The earlier experiments give the variableness which
occurs when at a constant temperature the vapour expands                                                      its
volume; the present when, the volume remaining constant, the
temperature     raised.
                    is                         In
                             both ways the gaseous state        gra                                  is
dually reached.    Now     the latter this takes
                                              in place with singular
slowness.   Nevertheless we can       yet only say further that,as                                            in
the cases discussed, fully twice the absolute temperature        the                                 of
vapour   isnecessary.   Looking      the variations occurring when

the first way    taken, my  earlier experiments   show that     indi                                in
vidual cases        in an is

                  TELEGRAPHY,       the art of telegraphing simulta
        neously in opposite directions on the same wire, which was
first performed   by Dr. Gintl in 1853, and subsequently engaged
the attention of so many inventors, until lately seemed never
likely to be carried out in practice to any extent. According to the
very practical author of ‘Practical Telegraphy,” “this system has
not been found of practical advantage;” and if we may believe
another writer, the systems he describes “must be looked upon as
little more than feats of intellectual gymnastics—very beautiful
in their way, but quite useless in a practical point of view.”
 However, notwithstanding these unfavourable reports as to the
practicability of duplex telegraphy, the experience of the last
year has negatived them in a striking manner, and made the so
called “feats” very common-place affairs.           Circuits worked on
a  duplex   system    are now established in various parts of the
 United  Kingdom—not       to mention the United States, where the
resurrection of these defunct schemes took place—and continue
to give every satisfaction.     There seems little reason to doubt
that this  system   will eventually  be extended to       circuitsall not       of
 too great   alength, between the terminal points                   of
                                                            which there
is more than sufficient traffic for        single wire worked

ordinary manner—that              say, only one station working
                                 is    to                                           at   a

single wire was an impossibility; for it was argued that the two
messages, meeting, would get mixed up and neutralize each other
more or less, leaving only a few stray dots and dashes as survi
vors (after the manner of the Kilkenny cats, who devoured one
another and only left their tails behind).                However, Dr. Gintl
effectually silenced this powerful argument by going and doing                                                         it.

   The last plan will be easily recognized to be based on the
method   of comparing electromotive forces known as Poggen
dorff's compensation,   in which the battery having the lesser
electromotive force is not allowed to act. The other plan (fig. 3)
is also an adaptation of a method of comparing the working
electromotive forces of batteries, which   devised three years ago,     I
and subsequently   published  in the ‘English  Mechanic” for July
5, 1872, No. 380, p. 411. My only reason for mentioning this

      When two similar magnetized plates are superposed, the
curves representing the values of F rise, from the magnetism
leaving the faces which are placed in contact to take refuge at
the exterior parts. At the same time the curves approach each
other and the middle of the magnet.           This effect is increased on
the addition of a third and a fourth plate.              Finally the two
curves unite in the middle.
   From this moment the combination of force is at its maximum.

     To    the    Editors of            the   Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
          GENTLEMEN,
          BSENCE from England                   my seeing Mr.  has prevented
       Moon's last paper (Phil. Mag. Feb. 1873) until lately.
I question whether there would be any use in continuing the
controversy, as we seem to have hardly any common ground                                                                    for
argument; but Mr. Moon asks me one        two definite questions               or
which    ought not
          I                        to
                      leave unanswered.
I   am asked whether still “consider that Boyle's law has been
                                        I
experimentally proved     the case  motion.” in   forced     give   of                      If                   to
a categorical answer,   must say yes; for the simple reason that
                                      I
 allthe experiments                     on

                                             of     gas.     am free                    a                 I
to  admit that the experiments                                 by
                                           which Boyle's law established                             is
do not extend                 to
                       the case      relative motion. of
   Mr. Moon finds reductio ad absurdum of the received law of

 444                Mr. H. Wilde           on some Improvements in
    So far as I have communicated the results of my investigations
 on the principle of accumulative action in electrodynamics, they
 have been obtained with machines designed with reference to the
 peculiar form of armature contrived by Dr. Werner Siemens, of
Berlin. While possessing several advantages in point of efficiency
 over that of Saxton, the Siemens armature requires to be driven at
 a high velocity to produce a succession of currents sufficiently
 rapid to be available as a substitute for the voltaic battery. Little
 inconvenience, however, arises from the high speed when the ar
matures are of small dimensions; but as the dimensions increase
 it becomes necessary to lower the speed, and the large machines
are consequently not proportionately powerful in comparison with
the smaller ones.      Besides this, the advantage possessed by this
form of armature, in having the moving mass of metal near the
axis of rotation, is neutralized as the dimensions increase, by the
excessive heat generated by the magnetization and demagnetiza
tion of the iron.     It would also be convenient in some circum
stances to drive a machine direct from the crank or flywheel of
a steam-engine without the intervention of multiplying gearing.
    Considerations of this nature led me, towards the end of 1866,
to propose to myself the construction of an electromagnetic
machine with multiple armatures, which should remove the                                   in
conveniences inherent in those hitherto constructed by produ
cing a greater number of currents for one revolution of the
armature axis.      Since that time I have been engaged, with
more or less   interruption,  in carrying out this design, and have
at length constructed a machine the performance of which sur

The strength and proportions of the several parts of the machine
enable it to be driven with advantage from 300 to 1000 revolu
tions per minute.
   At the mediumvelocity of 500 revolutions per minute the
major current will melt eight feet of iron wire 0.065 of an inch
in diameter (No. 16, B. W. G.), and will produce two electric
lights in series, each consuming carbons half an inch square at
the rate of three inches per hour.
   When driven at a velocity of 1000 revolutions (equivalent to
16,000 waves) per minute, the current will fuse twelve feet of

and section comes to be an acknowledged measure of powerful
electric currents, as well as a method of comparison between the
power of electromotors of different kinds, as it must ultimately
be, the significance of this result will be fully realized.

machine may be so diminished that it may be driven directly
from the crank of a steam-engine, concurrently with an increase
of electric power proportionate to the number of electromagnets
and armatures in the electromagnetic circles.
  While the excitation of the electromagnets of the machine by
the current from several of its armatures is attended with some
advantages where portability is required, yet, as provision has to
be made for keeping the major and minor currents separate from
each other, the commutator arrangements         become somewhat
complicated, and faults in either of the circuits are not so readily
localized as when a separate exciting machine is employed.       In
those cases, therefore, where conveniences for driving separate
machines are at hand, and when the power of several of them is
required simultaneously, as in large electro-depositing establish
ments, some advantage will be gained by using a separate ma
chine of suitable power to excite the electromagnets of several
machines, when the currents from the whole of them may be
utilized, and a commutator on the axis of each machine will be
dispensed with.
   In my paper “On a Property of the Magneto-electric Current
to control and renderSynchronous the Rotations of the Armatures
of a number of Electromagnetic Induction Machines”*, stated                                 I
that this property would be available when the machines were
used for the electro-deposition of metals from their solutions.
It  has, however, been found that the small resistance presented
by depositing solutions to the passage of the currents prevents
this property from manifesting itself                        (in
                                            accordance with what                                 I

     At the outsettwo conventions (or lemmas, as they are called)
are adopted,  which may be paraphrased as follows:—
   1. A  straight  line, whether positive or negative, having par
allel motion and moving first in one direction and then in the
opposite, thereby describes parts of the same figure which are
affected with opposite signs.
   2. A straight line which, during motion in one direction, is
at one time positive and at another negative, thereby describes
parts of the same figure which are affected with opposite signs.

ding lines drawn at right angles to the circuit, and always on

   The next diagram being taken to illustrate the application of
the first convention may be passed over, as both conventions are
used in the consideration of the third diagram, to which we shall
now refer.     a, do, e n, mi, k (fig. 2) are successive positions
which the describing line occupies in the course of             parallel      its

456              On     a Compound                    of Sesquioxide of Iron and Lime.
    The existence of a little protoxide of iron is accounted for by
the presence of silica, which at a high temperature, even in an
oxidizing atmosphere, reduces sesquioxide of iron to protoxide,
with the formation of silicate of this oxide—though, when this
silicate is heated in an oxidizing atmosphere at a lower tempera
 ture,    its
          protoxide     iron     converted into sesquioxide, the pro

The Strength of Materials             and Structures.  By John ANDERSON,
  C.E., LL.D., F.R.S.E.,            &c.  London:   Longmans, Green, and Co.
  1872 (pp. 301).
                   consists of two parts, the first treating of “the
THIS   book
   strength       of materials, as depending on their quality, and as
ascertained      by testing-apparatus,” the second treating of “the
strength of structures, as depending on the form and arrangement
of their parts, and on the materials of which they are constructed.”
In the first part, after a few preliminary remarks, the author gives
an account of the machine in use at Woolwich for testing the
strength of materials, particularly when exposed to tensile or com
pressive stresses. He then passes in review the principal materials
used in constructions, with especial reference to their behaviour in
the testing-machine; he devotes a chapter apiece to cast iron,
wrought iron, and steel, one to copper aud other metals and their
alloys, one to timber, and finally gives, somewhat briefly, notices
of the resistances offered by materials to impact, torsion, and
shearing. The results obtained by experiment are gone into with a
good deal of minuteness, and are also recorded in Tables, which,
in the first part, are as many as thirty-eight in number. Many of
these Tables give results which have, to         appearance, been ob all
tained under the author's superintendence; others are taken from
writings    ofauthority, e.g. from the Report
                                                                           of of

         breadth         in inches x cube of depth in inches x constant'
The Table registers the “constant” needed for reducing this
formula to numbers for different materials.      Now this constant is
merely Young's “modulus” in disguise; e.g., in the case of wrought
iron the registered “constant” is 64,221, which is equivalent to a
“modulus” of nearly 28,000,000 lbs. per square inch. There are
several objections to this way of treating the deflection of beams;
the chief is that it leads the learner to regard deflection as a subject
by itself, whereas it is closely connected with simple extension and
compression, produced by moderate forces.  A reader who had not
obtained the knowledge elsewhere would not suppose that there
was any connexion between the constant just mentioned as given
in Table 39, and the experimental results registered in the early
part of Table 8.
   There is another point which may be noticed, and which will be
best introduced by extracting a part of p. 209. The figure “is,” says
the author, “a skeleton diagram of the form of trussed beam used
for overhead travelling cranes..... To ascertain the strain upon

mentioned in ‘British Rainfall, we gather that in 1872 the greatest
quantities for that year, as compared with the other three, fell at
fifty-six stations out of eighty-two, of which forty-five gave the
maxima for the years 1848 to 1872.       In the year 1852 sixteen sta
tions furnished the greatest falls, fifteen being maxima from 1848
to 1872. In 1848 the largest falls were at eight stations, five being
maxima as above. In 1860 there were only two stations at which
the falls were the greatest for the four years named; there were
no maxima at any of the eighty-two stations in 1860. Mr. Symons
gives a supplementary Table of seventeen stations, at each of which
the maximum rainfall occurred on other years than the four wet
years discussed. The figures quoted from, and the quantities re
corded in the Table of comparison mentioned show that in the
majority of cases 1872 was generally the wettest year on record.

   We are glad to find that the Meteorological Office has resumed
the issue of Weekly Summaries of the Weather in Western Europe.
It is intended to accompany the chart issued on Wednesdays by a
summary of the weather during the previous week, so that each
day's map will be more readily intelligible when examined by the
light thrown upon it by the summary, the course of a depression
more easily traced, and the general character of the weather much
better understood than it can be from the mass of figures comprised
in the daily reports. There                     is,

each other, as, for example, Haparanda and Biarritz, Christiansund
and Scilly, Cuxhaven and Valencia, Toulon and Stornoway.                                            If
 each pair     curves were projected
                  of                        the same line   on

 no doubt that one       two pairs

this determination.    The author described the peculiarities        these                       of
octahedra, and dwelt particularly upon the fact that these sections
of phosphatic nodules showed clearly that the fibres are really tubular,
and not,     Toulmin Smith supposed, solid.

462                   Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
Greensand had been in part referred to the genera Scyphia and
Porospongia, and in part left unidentified.   An examination of sec
tions of these forms by the microscope had revealed all the details of
Wentriculite structure; and a careful comparison with Mr. Toulmin
Smith's descriptions and specimens had resulted in the identification
of those examined with some four of Mr. Smith's species; thus
Scyphia tessellata was shown to be equivalent to Ventriculites tessel
latus (or, more correctly, V. terturatus), Porospongia ocellata to V.
cavatus, and other unnamed forms to V. quincuncialis and V.-mam
millaris respectively.    The occurrence of ventriculite-structure
in coprolitic material presents a favourable opportunity for a fresh
inquiry into its nature; accordingly the author described the minute
characters of the hexaradiate elements of which the skeleton is com
posed, and the combinations      of these hexradiates with one another.
Abnormalities occur sometimes by the hexaradiates becoming hepta
radiate or pentaradiate, and sometimes by some of their rays bend
ing quite away from their normal course. The whole of the skeleton
fibre is distinctly tubular.    Since the Ventriculite fibres have now
been found fossilized in chalk, flint, and calcic phosphate, there
can be little doubt that they were keratose, and not siliceous in their
nature.     If this be so, we have a difference between Vitrea and
Wentriculitidae of ordinal value at least, and we must look for allies
to the Wentriculites among the horny sponges.        Verongia resembles
Wentriculites in the simple hollow cavity of             its
                                                     fibre and the non
spiculate character       its skeleton; Darwinella offers
                               of                            resemblance
in    itshexaradiate horny spicules, and Spongionella                  in a
                                                              the regular
 arrangement        its fibres. These three genera are indices
                      of                                              the           of
 directions      in
                 which the Keratosa tended       vary. At
                                                    to         very early a
 period great variation occurred among the Keratosa, which already,
at  the time      the Weisse Jura, had evolved such highly symmetrical
                  of
 specialized forms     the Wentriculites. These, with their contemporary
 variations, such          as as
                        Verongioid forms, lived           great numbers
                                                         on    in
 throughout the Mesozoic period, with the close        which the Wentri
                                                           of
 culites altogether disappeared; while their nearest allies dwindled
 down        the dwarfed and rare genera Verongia, Darwinella, and
            to
 perhaps Spongionella.

   The experiments whose results                         I

the  Academy    seem to  prove, on the contrary, that the effects in
 question are chiefly due to the peculiar condition of the exterior
layers, and that the interior play no part, or only a secondary
part, in the phenomenon.
   The mechanical actions by means of which the drops are ordi
narily broken, necessarily produce vibrations in the glass, the effect
of which it is impossible to appreciate. That is why, in this                                               in
vestigation,          I
                have preferred to make use of fluorhydric acid, the
action of which can be moderated at pleasure, and which permits
us to destroy at will, and without any shock, any portion we wish
to attack.
    On suspending a Rupert's drop by a thread over a platinum
vessel containing fluorhydric acid, in such a manner that the extre
mity of the thin end dips into the liquid, we find that we can always
dissolve the whole of the thin end without destroying the drop;

indebted to the kindness of M. Friedel for a fine specimen of this
kind. The tubes obtained by letting melted glass flow in threads
of more or less thickness into water possess in a high degree the
explosive properties of Rupert's drops.            They have almost always
the form of cork-screws, on account of the extreme expansion of
the upper layers; and dipping the extremity in fluorhydric acid is
sometimes sufficient to cause an instantaneous explosion, with the
same characters in the fracture.          In fine, the lumps of glass which
remain at the extremities of the canes by means of which the tubes
are drawn have the form of large Rupert's drops, and are of consider
able weight.       When these are detached from the cane they are in
the   condition    of a drop of which the bulb has been sawn: during
their   cooling   in the air they break up, throwing off splinters with
violence; and their fracture is identical with that of the small drops
broken at the big end. A fragment of one of these large drops,
which  I  had brought from the works of MM. Appert at La Villette,
   resented an interesting phenomenon:              on slightly squeezing it
    tween  my   finger   and  thumb,  a considerable disengagement of heat
was   produced;      the  temperature   rose to about 40°C. This confirms
 the results obtained by M. Dufour concerning the heat disengaged
 during the explosion of Rupert's drops.
    The existence of layers cooled with unequal suddenness in the
thickness of the glass affords an explanation of the brittleness of
chilled glass.      In fact we may suppose that, on account of the low
heat-conductivity of glass, a verythin layer at the surface             from                               is,
