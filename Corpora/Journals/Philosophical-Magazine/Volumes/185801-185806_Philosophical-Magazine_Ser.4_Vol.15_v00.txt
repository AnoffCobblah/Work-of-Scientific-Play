                          in the United States of America. It may not be in the
                          public domain in other countries. Copies are provided
                          as a preservation service. Particularly outside of the
                          United States, persons receiving copies should make
                          appropriate efforts to determine the copyright status
                          of the work in their country and use the work accordingly.
                          It is possible that current copyright holders, heirs or
                          the estate of the authors of individual portions of the
                          work, such as illustrations or photographs, assert copyrights
                          over these portions. Depending on the nature of subsequent
                          use that is made, additional rights may need to be obtained
                          independently of anything we can address. The digital

4.             Mr.    J. J. Waterston   on Capillarity
weight descending through one inch, is the work that denudes
two square inches of aqueous surface.       The volume of water
equivalent to this weight divided by 2, ought to be about T+g
of a cubic inch, if the quotient (Q) of surface developed by the
work performed is the same as in the first series of observations.
   To try this, a slip of paper 10 inches long and half an inch
broad, with clean cut edges, was formed into a spiral having about
a quarter of an inch between each convolution.    It was then fixed
with lac upon a thin piece of plate glass while heated. The
lower edge of the paper was thus firmly established in a plane
parallel to the plate, and the whole suspended from the pan of a
delicate balance, and adjusted by means of a plate and spirit
levels, so as to hang with the lower edge of the paper perfectly
level. The paper spiral was now immersed a quarter of an inch
in a shallow vessel of distilled water and allowed to soak; the
level of the surface of the water being adjusted so that the spiral
edge of the paper should separate from it at the turn of the beam.
Thus arranged, the difference of weight just at the separation
and immediately after, was found by repeated careful observa
tions to be exactly 38 grains.    This being the weight of 0.1505
 cubic inch of water (at the temperature 86°), shows the volume
                            lº
raised by a water-line 20 inches long.    For one inch the volume
IS
     º5    =0.00752, or
thus determined is 1329.

   § 5. The generally recognized fact, that the power of capillary
suspension resides at the water-line—that the weight of the whole
column hangs, as it were, upon the water-line, and is equili
briated by the cohering energies of one ring-line of molecules,<
is clearly brought out by the following experiment.
   A column of water in a capillary tube was drawn out of it by
pressing the lower end on an absorbing surface until only a small
  ortion was left.   It was then brought down to touch a surface
of alcohol. The column rose in the tube, having a small portion
of air separating the water from the spirit; and the height
attained by the capillary column exceeded that of the water alone
exactly in the inverse ratio of the specific gravities of the two
liquids.    The spirit soon drew down the small heading of water
over the wet surface of the tube; and it was interesting to ob
serve, that, at the instant when it      all
                                           disappeared, the column
tumbled down     to the level proper    tospirit, which      in
                                                            fine tubes

 assumed to be constant for the same liquid at constant tempera
 ture. Supposing the tube to be drawn up one inch, the capil
 lary column descends one inch, denuding lin. x trilof surface, and
 the work performed     is the volume #d°th descending       one inch:
 we have therefore                  Trd     4.

  suspended column.       The value of dh, computed from Q=132
  [$2], is #=0.0303, which         agrees nearly with   Dr. Brewster’s
 value given   in Table, p. 279, of the Report of the British Associa
 tion,  l834. In small tubes,   where the abnormal tendency    [$8]  is
  manifested, the value of Q is about
                                          . of 132  or 88, and the cor
  responding value of dh is 0.045, which agrees nearly with that

  By similar reasoning, in the case of plates we have Q =           in
  which D is the distance of the parallel plates, and H the equal
  ized height of the capillary column.
      § 7. The 32nd volume of the Annales de Chimie (1851) con
  tains an extensive series of researches on capillarity by M. Simon.
  Water was the liquid chiefly employed, and the dimensions of
  the capillary column in tubes of different bores, and between
  plates at different distances, were measured with great minute
  mess.    The most remarkable result of these observations was the
   discovery of the fact, that the column between plates is only about
  one-third the height of the column in tubes, instead of one-half,
   as theory had previouslyindicated. If we assumed this as a general
  law, and employed the Table of specific capillarities given in p. 15
   for computing the values of Q for alcohol, aether, and carburet of
   sulphur, we should be led into serious error. The Table shows the
   comparative heights of the capillary columns in fine tubes only.
  Another table is required to show the comparative heights
  between parallel plates, in which, setting out with the height of
-
  water as unity, the numbers for carburet of sulphur, alcohol, and
  sulphuric ather must be multiplied by            The temperature   at
                                               #.
   which the observations were made is not specified, which is an
   omission of some consequence, seeing that there is proof that the
   ratios of capillarity change with the temperature [š 10].
       § 8, The existence and extent of this abnormal feature may

6               Mr.  J. J. Waterston  on Capillarity
be ascertained with very simple appliances.      I  employed a tube
about 3 inches long and ºth of an inch diameter, marked with
divisions cut by a diamond-point at intervals of about fºrth of an
inch, each line being a guide to the eye, and the exact length of
a reading being ascertained by scale and lens. There were also
several thermometer-tubes with flat bore and scale engraved upon
them. The glass plates employed were kept separate and parallel
by inserting a piece of thin tinned plate, beaten flat and coated
with lac, between them when heated.       One half of their surface
being thus cemented, the other half was left open for the capil
lary column, and their perfect parallelism could be easily tested.
One of the plates was crossed with diamond lines as guides to
the eye in observing, and afterwards for applying the scale and-
lens to obtain the exact reading.
    The liquids employed were,
                              1st Class.
                Distilled water.
                Sulphuric acid.
                Nitric acid.
                Ammonia.
                Saturated solution of common salt.
                               2nd Class.
                Alcohol.
                 Sulphuric aether.
                Sulphuret of carbon.
                Dichloride of sulphur.
                Acetic acid.
                Chloroform.
                Acetic aether.
                Acetone.
                Turpentine.
    The ratios of the capillary columns of these several liquids in
 the tubes and between the plates were compared, and it was
 found that the columns of the first five liquids (being of the
 nature of hydrous solutions) had a higher ratio to the others
 when measured in the tubes than when measured between plates.
 If the hydrous plate columns had changed in the same ratio as
 the plate columns of the other liquids, their height in tubes of
 small bore would have been abont two-thirds the height observed.
 Thus if Q were estimated from the capillarity of water in small
 tubes, the value is about two-thirds of 132 or 88 (Q being      in
versely as h, \ 6).
    The measure of the tensile force at the surface    of water and
hydrous liquids is thus not to be obtained from the apparent

   The value of Q for turpentine within parentheses was deter
mined by linear integration of the contours of two phases of the
drop suspended in tube B, as described in § 2; but the circum
stances were unfavourable.   The capillary power of turpentine
being small, the change in the position of the centre of gravity
that could be observed before the drop broke   did not exceed                                 off
#th      of    an

     § 11. M. Simon (de Metz) in his ‘Recherches sur la Capil
larité,” has observations of the influence of temperature on the
capillarity of water in tubes of from ºth to gºodth of an inch
 diameter: the details of the mode of observation are not stated,
but the mean result given is a descent of one-fourth from 0° to
 100°C.
     The following is quoted from his paper in the Annales                 de
 Chimie, vol. xxxii. p. 17:—
     “Ce rapport 4:3 ou 1.33 que donne l'expérience conduit a
 penser que la densité de l’eau est la cause qui produit cette dif
 férence d’ascension.        En effet, un volume d'eau augmentant de
 0.0466    pour   100 dégrés de température, il en résulte qu'une
 colonne d'eau Étant 1 a 0 dégréil sera 1.36 a 100 dégrés: rapport
 très voisin du rapport moyen des expériences ci-dessus,              L'as
 cension est donc en raison direct de la densité.” This conclu
 sion is so manifestly discordant with the premises, that it requires
 to be noted.      In the Annales de Chimie for February and March
 last (vol.  xlix.),  there is a paper by M. C. Wolf on the influence
 of temperature on capillarity in tubes of round bore. At p. 259
 there is a table of observations taken throughout one year at
 atmospheric temperatures from 0°C. to 25°4, with a tube of
 rigth
  1 00    of an inch diameter, in which every desirable precaution
                                        #,
 seems to have been taken to ensure accuracy.                From 0°35 to
 25°45 the descent was observed                   and it is stated that this
 agrees with the previous observations of M. Brünner (Poggen
 dorff’s Annalen, 1847).         If this rate is continued up to the boil
 ing-point, the descent from 0° to 100°C. would be
                                                                  #

 of observations with a smaller tube, the effect of temperature
 was found to be less by about Tºth.              It is probable that the
 abnormal feature in the capillarity of water in fine tubes affects
 these results in a greater or less degree.          As the true measure
 of the capillarity of hydrous liquids can only be obtained from

10                     Mr.   J. J. Waterston           on Capillarity
observations with parallel plates, it would be desirable to have
a set of observations made with water between plates at atmo
spheric temperatures between summer and winter, in the manner
adopted by    M. Wolf.
     That heat has less effect on the plate-column than on the
tube-column, is the impression                    I
                                   have from many observations.
When we consider that the effect of adding a very small propor
tion of alcohol to water is several times greater in tubes than
between plates, it appears as if any cause that increased the lim
pidity of the water had more effect on the capillarity of tubes
than of plates.
   § 12. In § 4 it was shown that the weight of 38 grains de
scending through one inch represents the work required to denude
20 square inches of aqueous surface at the temperature of 86°F.,
if the value of Q is 132-9. If it is 132, as assumed from the
observations in § 2, the weight must be taken at 38.262 grains
descending through one inch; and to denude one square inch,
it requires 1.9181 grain descending through one inch vertical.
This being the weight of .007577 cubic inch of distilled water at
the temperature of 86°F., this volume of water raised through
one inch is equivalent to the work of denuding a superficial stra
tum of one square inch, of overcoming the integral cohesion force
on one side—the outer side—of a superficial stratum of molecules;
being one-sixth of the cohesion integral of      the molecules         all                            in
the stratum.

   With similar data for other liquids we may compute the abso
lute volume of their molecules.

liquid compared with the similar quotient         another, gives of the
ratio of the absolute atomic volumes.
   We have thus two distinct modes           computing this ratio,

     § 13. From Regnault’s empirical formula, the latent heat of
aqueous vapour at 86°F. is 1054.        One cubic inch of water thus
heated is equivalent to one cubic inch of water at temperature
60°, raised through 1054° x 772 x 12 inches vertical, or 9,764,256
cubic inches raised through one inch.
    From the capillary force we have, as above, .007577 cubic inch
raised through one inch as the measure of one-sixth the cohesion
of one layer of molecules, and 045462 cubic inch raised through
one inch as the integral of one layer of the cubic inch.       Hence,

cube of the reciprocal of this is the absolute volume of one mole

     The similar data for alcohol are as   follows:—
     The latent heat of absolute alcohol at 174°F. is 376, accord
 ing to MM. Fabre and Silberman. (Ann. de Chim. vol. xxxvii.
 1853, p. 466). The specific heat is 0.64. The ratio of latent to
 sensible heat in alcohol is about the same as with water, according
 to M. Despretz, hence 415° may be taken as the latent heat of
 alcohol at 86°,

      Comparing this absolute volume with that of water, we have

      in capillary tubes the liquid should descend beyond the outer

        This was actually remarked by M. Wolf (Ann.
 Ihave also observed the convexity.  It quickly assumes a sugar
loaf aspect. It requires a steady temperature to show the sur
face a distinct line.
   M. Wolf further observed, that the rate at which the capillary
column of aether descended, increased at the higher temperatures
(p. 271).
   It seems to be almost certain that the rate at which latent
heat diminishes also augments with the temperature. The fol
lowing is the evidence on this point.
   M. Regnault’s empirical formula for the latent heat of
aqueous vapour is \,-606.5–0.695t (Centigrade).         the                                                     If

 M.Despretz, thenx,-209–(t–78)(0.695)(0-64)=244—0,45t,
 in which 209° is the latent heat of alcohol at the boiling-point,
 and 0.64            its
                 specific heat, according         MM. Fabre and Silber    to

16                Mr.  J. J. Waterston    on Capillarity
In § 6 it   was shown that    Q= # ;     and d being constant,       h is
observed     to diminish    with  the temperature [S 10],         hence
º ==#.           Also the latent heat has been observed to diminish
with the temperature, so that 8L requires the negative sign;
and the differential equation, which expresses the relation of
molecular volume, latent heat, and capillarity of the same liquid
while being acted upon by heat, is       º - º –%
   It is obvious from this that the first condition required is that
º   should exceed    º, because    *    is positive. The absolute value
of the difference of the decrements of capillarity and latent heat
to fulfil the equation is also indicated.
   The most precise observations on the decrement of capillarity
are probably those of M. Wolf [S 11].           The range of tempera
ture was   25°C.,   and the middle temperature 13°: the value of
# is   0477: the value of
                               *   is 00089 from       M. Despretz’s ex
pansion of water, and
                          #= '0293 from Regnault's         empirical for
mula.     Thus we have
              —-0477–'0293–'0184           instead  of .0009.
The first condition, viz. that    *- º       is satisfied, but the abso
lute values do not fulfil the equation. We must keep in view
that Regnault's formula assumes that the latent heat diminishes
uniformly with the temperature.          I have not seen the details of
the experiments upon which it is founded, but it is unlikely that
they can have indicated more than an average result.
   At 5°C. the point of maximum density of             water *=0 and
º =%.         It appears certain from    M. Wolf's observations, that
the decrement of capillarity is very uniform, and in tubes of not
less than Tägth of an inch diameter is not sensibly different from
the amount put down. Between plates the decrement is probably
less, on account of the abnormal feature in the capillarity of water
in tubes; but it cannot be less than two-thirds of the above, or
*0318.     The evidence of an increase of the decrement of latent
heat and of the specific heat at high temperatures has been stated
 [S 15]; there is consequently       no reason to suppose       that the
           T

landscape,  the dimensions of which are to those of the landscape
as the distance between the two eyes is to the distance between
the two positions of the camera from which the views were
taken.
   We have here the reason why these stereoscopic images give
a much clearer representation of the form of a landscape than
the view of the landscape itself, at least to a passing traveller,
who is not so well acquainted as the inhabitants with the single
objects of the neighbourhood. Towns, which to the observer on
a high point, appear merely as a desert of roofs, resolve them
selves in the stereoscope to rectangles bounded by streets; the
relative height of the houses is discerned, the width of the streets,
 &c. In accordance with this, I find that a better idea is obtained
of the gigantic dimensions of the higher Alps in the stereoscope,
than by an alpine journey; because those who are unaccus
tomed to such mountain excursions and prospects in most cases
consider the mountains too near, and hence too small, partly
from the want of aerial perspective, partly because the power of
judging of such great dimensions has not been exercised.                 Only
after the labour of      ascent,  and after   viewing   the same mountain
 successively from different positions, is a more or less complete
 motion of      itsmagnitude obtained. The advantages which the
 stereoscope offers         this respect have been thus far but little
                           in
 used, because      photographers          the whole seem unjustly
                                           on                                           to

ment or not.    All portions of the landscape that are not too
distant, assume the same bodily appearance as in the stereoscope,
and retain at the same time the whole richness of the natural
colours, so that images of surprising beauty and elegance are
obtained.
   Distant objects certainly appear flat, but still detach them
selves from their background.        Thus, for example, mountains
at two  English   miles distance detach themselves from the firma
ment. As in the case of stereoscopic photographs, the aspect of
groups of trees is very surprising; for the single boughs, and
the single twigs of each bough, detach themselves completely
from each other. Low clouds also appear frequently more solid,
and more separated from each other in the instrument, than
when regarded with the naked eye.
   The greater the distance between the two large mirrors, the
further in the distance does the instrument show the bodily form
of objects.    Large reflectors give a large field of view.   If there

ago   I found out that ozonized oxygen transforms ammonia into
the nitrate of that base.    Last year I ascertained that inactive
oxygen, on being put in contact with platinum or copper, acquires
the power of oxidizing, even at the common temperature, the
elements of ammonia into nitrous acid and water, nitrite of am
monia being formed. Now I have discovered that HOº, Mn” O7
(permanganic acid), or the salts of that acid, for instance per
manganate of potash, on being mixed with aqueous ammonia,
produce nitrites.    A singular fact                      is,

         HEN in   Faröe, I obtained at the cave in Naalsöe globules
           of Faröelite, composed of crystals large enough to afford
satisfactory measurements with the reflecting goniometer. They
are as   follows:—

   The Skye crystals are similar; but some of the Irish speci
mens seem to have planes truncating the edge Pb or the solid
angle a Pb.; these crystals, however, are too rough and too small
for measurement.
   I  have already shown in this Journal (January 1857) that
the chemical constitution of this species is quite distinct from
that of mesolite, with which it used to be confounded ; and the
above measurements       definitely set the matter at rest, as the
mineral is prismatic instead of oblique, being near Thomsonite,
and isomorphous with stilbite.
   It stands, indeed, intermediate, and connects the chain between
Thomsonite and mesolite.

  N.B. The crystals from which                        the figure was drawn were
examined    chemically,                to   determine that they were not stilbite.

 but stated at the same time that neither of these could be con

 seemed no longer to contain unchanged indican.            However, the
 compounds, the analyses of which have just been given, even
 after having been completely dried and decomposed with cold
 dilute sulphuric acid, yielded solutions which, after having been
 filtered from the sulphate of lead and boiled, deposited flocks
 consisting almost entirely of indigo-blue and indirubine, pro
 ducts indicating with certainty the presence of unchanged indi
 can. Since indican exhibits a tendency, as have before observed,                 I
 to take up successively a number of equivalents of water, it is

a dark colour, while the surface becomes covered with a blue
pellicle. The deposit is found to consist principally of indigo
blue with a little indirubine, and a trace of other products of
decomposition.        The filtered liquid, on being boiled, becomes
muddy and deposits some brown flocks, which contain no indigo
blue. The quantity of indigo-blue formed by the action of
nitric acid seems indeed to be comparatively larger than when
sulphuric or muriatic acid is employed.             It is hardly necessary.
to add, that if this be really the case, it cannot be ascribed to
any oxidizing effect produced by the acid.            A watery solution of
indican, on being mixed with oxalic or tartaric acid and left to
stand, yields a dark blue or purple deposit, consisting of indigo
blue and indirubine, which, when oxalic acid is employed, are
remarkably free from other products of decomposition.               The   li
quid filtered from this deposit yields in either case, when boiled,
a few more flocks, and after being filtered, mixed with sulphuric
acid and boiled again, it gives an additional quantity.              These
flocks contain indirubine and indiretine, but no indigo-blue.
Even acetic acid produces a slight effect on indican. On adding
that acid to a watery solution of the latter, the mixture deposits,
on standing, some dark flocks, consisting of indigo-blue and
indirubine, but their quantity is trifling.
    A more minute examination of this process of decomposition
 showed that it was more complicated, and that the products
 formed by it were more numerous than             I had at first imagined.
                                              I
 The products of decomposition which have observed are of three
 kinds. The first are insoluble in water, and are deposited in the
 shape of powder or flocks from the acid liquid; the second
 remain dissolved in the latter; the third are volatile, and are ob
 tained by distilling the liquid either whilst the action of the acid
 is proceeding or after it has ceased. For the purpose of pre
 paring these various products, I found it to be necessary to ob
 tain indican in a state of absolute purity by successive solution
 in alcohol, water and aether; for though some indican is always
 decomposed when        its
                          watery solution    isevaporated, the substances
 into which   it   isthereby converted afford,        by
                                                       decomposition with
 acids, products which         donot differ  in their nature, but only    in
 their relative proportions from those which are formed when
 perfectly pure indican       employed.
                              is             I therefore contented myself
 with extracting the dry leaves         the woad plant with cold alcohol,
                                        of
 evaporating the extract       in the apparatus above described, adding
 water  to the residue and     filtering.   The solution   of indican thus
 obtained was mixed with            aconsiderable quantity      ofsulphuric
 acid, and the green fatty matter precipitated             by the acid was
 separated    byfiltration.    The action    of  the acid passed,    as
                                                                     I    in

convenient to collect and treat the products formed at each stage
of the action     separately.      The filtered liquid, though clear at
first, soon became opalescent and muddy, and deposited dark
flocks, while the surface became covered with a blue pellicle.

caustic soda.     After being filtered from this precipitate, the
liquid appeared of a beautiful purple colour. It was mixed with
an excess of acetic acid and distilled or evaporated to about one
quarter of its original volume, and then mixed with a large
quantity of water, which precipitated the whole of the matter
dissolved in it in the shape of dirty purple flocks. These flocks
 were collected on a filter, well washed with water, and then treated
 with dilute caustic soda, which generally, however, only dissolved
 a minute portion of them. After being again filtered off and
 well washed, they were dried and treated with a small quantity
 of cold alcohol. The alcohol dissolved a portion, forming a
 solution of a deep reddish-yellow colour, which was filtered and
 evaporated, when it left a shining resinous substance of the same
 colour, which, as it possesses characteristic properties and a
 peculiar composition, I shall call Indifulvine.           By dissolving it
 in weak spirits of wine it was separated from a little impurity,
 which remained undissolved in the shape of a brown powder.
 The matter left undissolved by the cold alcohol consisted chiefly
 of indirubine. For the purpose of purifying this body, availed                               I
 myself of the property which it possesses, in common with
 indigo-blue, of dissolving in caustic alkalies in the presence of
bodies which easily take up oxygen.            On treating the mixture
containing indirubine with a solution of protoxide of tin in caustic
 soda and boiling, I obtained a solution which, after being rapidly
filtered, deposited indirubine on exposure to the air in the shape

tion on cooling in long crystalline needles, which were red by
transmitted light.     The alcoholic solution has a fine purple
colour.   It is perfectly insoluble in alkaline liquids; but if it be
treated with a boiling solution of caustic soda, to which some
deoxidizing substance, such as protochloride of tin or grape-sugar,
is added, it dissolves with ease, just as indigo-blue does under
the same circumstances, forming a solution from which it is
again deposited in purple flakes by the action of the atmospheric
oxygen. It dissolves in concentrated sulphuric acid in the cold,
forming a purple solution, which on the addition of water gives
a dark precipitate, the supernatant liquid remaining of a fine
purple colour. It is decomposed by boiling nitric acid. On
being heated between two watch-glasses, it produces on the
upper glass a sublimate consisting of beautiful purple needles
which dissolve in boiling alcohol, forming a fine purple solution,
which on cooling deposits crystalline needles.       This sublimate
seems to consist, not of any product of decomposition formed by
heat, but of the substance itself, which when freed from all-im
purities possesses the property of crystallizing.

in Western Africa, on the Old Calabar river, which discharges
itself into the Bay of Benin in latitude 53° N., and longitude 8°W.
The fish was described by Mr. Andrew Murray of Edinburgh
as a new species under the name of Malapterurus Beninensis”.
A lady, the wife of a missionary, notwithstanding her having                                            :
been shipwrecked, has now succeeded in bringing three living
specimens of the same species to Edinburgh.        Professor Goodsir
of Edinburgh, who is now travelling through Germany, has had
the extraordinary kindness to bring one of these three fishes to
Berlin and to place it at the disposal of Prof. J. Müller, who
has handed it over to me for experiment.
   The fish was the smallest, but the most lively of the three; it
measures about 15 centimetres (6 inches) in length.               It travelled
here by Leith and Rotterdam, with a few aquatic plants in an
ordinary gold-fish globe, which was placed in a suitable covered
basket. Since Saturday last it has been kept at the Anatomical
Museum in a larger vessel with aquatic plants and water from
the Spree, and appears to be very comfortable. It seeks the
dark, and is very quiet. They have not succeeded with certainty
in feeding    it. The spirit-specimens examined               Edinburgh hadin
the remains        of
                  freshwater crustacea           their intestines; and the

living fishes immediately chased similar pelagic forms which
were offered       them, and appeared, although they allowed them
                   to
to  escape again      first,

cess as that adopted by Faraday with the Gymnotus.      They con
sisted of strips of strong platinum-foil, 5 millims. in breadth,
bent into the form of the transverse section of the fish, and were
55 millims. in length for the thick anterior part, and 45 millims.
in length for the thinner caudal extremity. To these strips
copper wires coated with gutta-percha were soldered, serving as
insulating handles; the soldered parts were carefully covered with
varnish. The wires were connected with the ends of a multiplier
of 550 convolutions, with heavy double needles.      The platinum
saddles in Spree  water produced  no effect upon   this multiplier.
Lastly, in accordance with Galvani's arrangement            for the Tor
pedo”,   a prepared     frog was so placed upon the edges of the glass
jar, that it could not but betray by             convulsions every dis

Nitrate of ammonia in contact with the lead of cisterns forms
quadribasic nitrite of lead, with evolution of binoxide of nitrogen.
The binoxide of nitrogen is converted into nitrous acid, which
combines with the ammonia, forming again nitrite of ammonia.
The quadribasic nitrite of lead is decomposed by the carbonic
acid  of the atmosphere.   Three equivalents of the oxide are pre
cipitated as carbonate of lead, while the monobasic nitrite of lead
remains in solution. This monobasic nitrite in contact with the
metal forms again quadribasic nitrite, and by the decomposition
of water, ammonia.

  50         Mr. H. Medlock on the Reciprocal Action of Metals
  poses water, and forms again quadribasic           nitrite of lead and am
  In OIlla.
      In  the decomposition of the quadribasic nitrite of lead, much
  of the monobasic nitrite is carried down with the precipitated
  carbonate of lead”.          As there is a constant daily accession of
  new    organic   matter in a state of decomposition to our cisterns,
  and as similar changes to those above described are constantly
 going on, and may under special circumstances be suddenly                  in
 creased, it will be evident that the use of leaden cisterns exposes
  us to the danger of having lead dissolved in our water in doses
 which may sometimes rise to poisonous proportions.
      Having established, as        I believe by most conclusive experi
 ments, the remarkable reaction which takes place between lead
 and the organic matters contained in water,               I was induced to
  study more fully some singular phaenomena I had previously
 noticed, which become apparent when water remains for a few
 hours in contact with a large surface of iron.
      In September 1856, I was requested by the Directors of the
 Amsterdam Water Company to analyse several samples of water
 from the city of Amsterdam.            Complaints of the water had been
 made by many of the inhabitants.           The water possessed a peculiar
fish-like     odour;    and   although  perfectly  transparent and colour
 less, and free from the slightest chalybeate taste, it was found, after
 standing, to deposit a reddish-brown sediment, which coated every
 vessel in which the water was allowed to remain for a few hours.
     The service-pipes being of iron, the deposit was assumed to
 consist of the sesquioxide, resulting either from the decomposi
 tion of a protosalt of iron in solution, or from the attrition of the
 iron pipes through which the water is conveyed.
     I   may here observe that Amsterdam is supplied with water
from the “Duins” (sand-hills) in the neighbourhood of Haarlem.
Trenches five miles in length have been dug on the sides of the
hills to intercept the rain-fall. The water is conveyed to a large
reservoir, whence it flows to the filter-beds at the works, and
there filtered through 4 feet of filtering medium, consisting of
pebbles, shells, and fine sand. After filtration it is pumped up
an iron stand-pipe, 150 feet high, and conveyed thence by iron
mains to Amsterdam, a distance of eighteen miles.
     Five samples of the water were sent to me for analysis; one
from the works before the water came in contact with iron, the
other four from various stand-pipes in the city.
     In the water from the works, before it came into contact with

   52       Mr. H. Medlock     on the Reciprocal Action    of Metals
      The water had the peculiar fish-like smell of the masses of
    “flab’ (Ulva intestinalis)  floating on the surface. The stones on
   the sides of the  canals,  the hurdles placed to keep up the sand,
   floating pieces of stick, and indeed every solid body with which
   the water came in contact, was coated with a reddish-brown de
   posit similar to that which was found to separate from the filtered
   water in Amsterdam.         This deposit was particularly abundant
   near the iron sluice-gates.     A pipe from one of the mains in
   Amsterdam was examined at the same time, and found to be
   coated on the inside with a thick slimy deposit of vegetable
   remains, which presented under the microscope an appearance
   similar to that of the deposits above alluded to.
      Remembering the important fact established by Schönbein,
   that copper and platinum in a finely-divided state have the pro
   perty of converting ammonia into nitrous acid, and having myself
   demonstrated that lead, in any form *, possesses a similar power,
  it occurred to me that if the same property were possessed by
  iron, it would throw a light upon the fact of the separation of
  organic matters from waters which remain in contact with that
  metal.    Schönbein states that finely-divided copper and platinum
  convert ammonia instantaneously, at the common temperature,
  into nitrous acid, while “iron requires to be heated to a dull
  redness” before it will effect a similar change.         I have found,
 however, that on      placing  several coils of iron wire in a bottle
 and adding a few drops of strong ammonia, a slight elevation of
 temperature takes place, and after an hour nitrous acid may be
 detected by the acidulated starch-paste and iodide of potassium
 test.    I tried also the action of iron which had been reduced
 from the oxide by hydrogen, and found that it instantly converted
 a portion of the ammonia into nitrous acid.
     In order to study the action of iron upon the Amsterdam
          I
 water, submitted to analysis a quantity of this water which
 had never been in contact with iron, and at the same time im      I
 mersed several coils of iron wire in two gallons of the same water.
The water in which the iron wire was placed was perfectly bright
and free from colour, and had nothing visible in mechanical
suspension except a few of the siliceous tubes above alluded to.
The experiment was made in four open glass bottles.
     A series of remarkable phaenomena were observed. In five
minutes a faint white cloud was seen radiating from the coil of
iron wire and descending in the form of a parachute. In half
an hour the cloud increased in density, and the water became
opalescent.      In six hours the cloud assumed a brownish colour,
and there was a brown deposit at the bottom of each of the

bottles. The cloud continuing to increase during forty-eight
hours, assumed more and more a flocculent character and a
reddish colour, exactly like the deposit from the Amsterdam
water which had flowed through iron pipes. The water was now
filtered through fine Swedish filter-paper, submitted to analysis,
and a portion of the deposit examined under the microscope.
The latter consisted of the remains of algae, each separate flock
having a siliceous tube as a nucleus. The remainder of the de
posit was burned, and the ash found to consist of iron-oxide,
silica, and the carbonates of lime and magnesia.
    The following are the analyses of the water before and after
being in contact with iron:-

   By these analyses, it is seen that the 2-10 grs. of organic
matter originally contained in the water was decomposed or
thrown down by contact with iron. The water thus purified no
longer possessed the unpleasant fish-like taste and odour which
                  of its
had marked      previous contamination.
  A  portion     the water which had been      contact with iron in

 from the surface-drainage of richly manured and highly cultivated
 lands, and, more objectionable still, from the sewage and refuse
 of towns. The complex organic matters derived from these
 several sources are by certain influences, and in course of time,
 resolved into more simple compounds which are comparatively
 innocuous. Thames water, as is well known, if allowed to stand
 in an open vessel for a few days in warm weather, acquires a
 very offensive odour, arising from the decomposition             of the
 animal and     vegetable  matter held in solution.    This  water, not
 withstanding, is considered by maritime authorities to be the
 very best for the use of ships’ companies.         On board-ship the
 water is stored in wooden casks, which are stowed low down
 in the hold. During the first week or fortnight, according to
 the temperature of the atmosphere, the water undergoes a kind
 of fermentation, evolves a quantity of gas possessing a most
 offensive odour, and deposits a copious brown sediment.            The
 water gradually ceases to smell offensively, becomes bright and
 sparkling, and will then keep fresh and sweet for an indefinite
length of time. In other words, it loses by a natural process of
 decay, the whole of          its

quantity of iron and the length of time necessary to effect the
entire destruction or precipitation of the organic impurities con

   At the time these experiments were made (January 9, 1857),
the water was somewhat discoloured; and as it evidently varied
daily in composition,  it appeared necessary, in order to ascertain
the actual effectsof the iron, to determine at the same time the
solid residue and organic matter existing in the water when the
above three experiments were made.
   Two separate determinations were made (one gallon for each).

       by direct evaporation        .
   These analyses exhibit, at first sight, comparatively little dif
ference in the quantities of mineral constituents, but on examining
them carefully, we find that in the ordinary water there are, in
addition to a large quantity of organic residue, distinct traces of
sulphuretted hydrogen, while in the water which has been in con
tact with iron, no traces of this poisonous gas exist.                   Moreover,
in the    ordinary    Thames      water,      there are marked traces of am
monia, while in the water treated with iron, no trace of this base
remained, the ammonia having been converted into nitrous acid.
The great increase in the quantity of sulphuric acid, from 2:343
grs. to 5:302 grs. per gallon, is very remarkable, and probably
is owing to the oxidation of sulphuretted hydrogen, or sulphurets
pre-existing in the water.          This, however, requires further inves
tigation, and a series of experiments                I  am now engaged in, will,    I
hope, determine this question satisfactorily.                    In the above ana
lyses, <U+017F>or obvious reasons, I have substituted for the indefinite
term “organic matter,” the expression “matter volatile on                         ig
nition.”                                              -
   From the residue of one gallon of the water, 2.126 grs. were
expelled by ignition, while from the residue of one gallon of the
water which had been in contact with iron, only 1:108 gr. was
volatilized.     Moreover, the residue of the first water became
nearly black when heated, while the residue of the second was
scarcely altered in colour, except at the edges, notwithstanding
that it lost a little more than a grain by the ignition.                   This loss
was not    organic    matter, as no    charring         was observed,  but was due

            and the Constituents               of Well-         and River-waters.                           61

fact appears        offer, perhaps, the best proof
                     to                                        the partial       of                         or

    It  obvious that this method

with certainty the amount    putrescible organic matter originally

present.   The constituents of Thames water which are supposed
to be a fertile source of disease, escape from the water even at the
common temperature, and                 it follows      as a      positive certainty, that
during the evaporation of the water in order to obtain the solid
residue, the greater part, and probably the whole of those con
 stituents which are inducive of disease, are eagelled with the steam.
 The organic matter remaining with the mineral constituents of
 the water, is small in quantity and of an inert character.                                          I
 therefore regard it as unimportant, except so far as it may serve
 in some measure as an index of the quantity of malarious matter
 originally present in the water; but the loss of weight experi
 enced on igniting the residue of a gallon of Thames water is not
even a reliable index of the quantity of organic matter actually
in the residue, since other constituents present are volatile at a red
 heat, and in consequence untrustworthy results are obtained.
    In selecting a water for the supply of a town, providing the
 water be not what is called a decidedly hard water, the relative
 quantities of mineral salts are of little consequence; but the
question whether it contain putrescible organic matter, and                                         if
so, in what quantity, and of what nature, is the first to be deter

A    Handbook     of Chemical Manipulation.       By C. GREville WILLIAMs.
             London: John Van Voorst.             Post 8vo. Pp. 580.
THEofimportance  of skilful manipulation in several of the branches
       natural science, and especially in chemistry, can perhaps
scarcely be overrated; yet we have sometimes noticed in students a
tendency to cultivate it to the neglect of those mental powers, without
a due exercise of which mere manipulatory skill becomes little better
than a pleasing accomplishment.       Like mathematics to science, ma
nipulation should be to chemistry a skilful handmaid, whose mecha
nical aid, although of great value, must not be allowed to supersede
or degrade those higher powers of induction which stand in need of
her assistance.    It is well known that Dalton was one of the clum
siest of manipulators; his operations were performed in the crudest
manner, and his experimental results were, for the most part, far from
falling within that narrow circle around perfect accuracy which we
usually assign as the boundary of the errors of experiment.            But
although the great results achieved by the almost unaided intellect
of Dalton may serve to point out the true place of manipulation, yet
it cannot be doubted that those results would have been still more
brilliant, had that intellect been associated with manipulatory skill.
   We welcome, therefore, Mr. Williams’s book as a valuable contri
bution to a department of chemical literature which has long been
neglected; Faraday's admirable work on chemical manipulation, the
only one that ever appeared in our language, having been long out
of print. It is singular, but perhaps not wholly inexplicable, that
whilst the study of other departments of this science has of late years
been much facilitated by numerous treatises, this important branch
should have received so little aid from the same quarter.       The truth
is, that the clear and successful description      the manipulatory por

placed in the hands of an intelligent workman, when the construction
of any complicated apparatus is required.
   The book opens with a chapter on the arrangement of an experi
mental laboratory, full of information, most valuable not only to those
who have to improvise their work-room in a dwelling-house or other
previously-erected building, but also to the more fortunate chemist
who can build a laboratory specially adapted to the purposes of che
mical research. Then follow chapters on furnaces, lamps, blowpipe
apparatus, baths, heat-measurers, the balance, specific gravity, solu
tion, precipitation, &c., all containing in a condensed form much
useful matter which could only otherwise be found scattered over
the pages of numerous bulky volumes.
   A very important feature in the ‘Handbook’ is the devotion of con
siderable space to the description of certain classes of operations
employed in chemical research. The prosecution of investigations,
especially in the organic department of the science, has of late
years developed certain experimental methods, which from their
convenience and wide application have become of paramount import
ance to the investigator.      In this branch of his subject Mr. Williams
has  given  excellent  chapters  on “Volumetric manipulation,” “Gas
manipulation,” and “Pressure-tube operations.”             Under the first
named title, the manipulatory methods necessary to the performance
of the volumetrical operations devised by Mohr, Bunsen, Liebig and
others are described; whilst the chapter on gas manipulation con
tains descriptions of the apparatus employed in gaseous research by
Bunsen, Regnault and Frankland.           This chapter is full of most use
ful information   respecting  a department    of chemical inquiry which is
daily becoming more important: we could have wished, however,
that the author had devoted more space to the description of the
methods of the first-named chemist, to whom this branch of mani
pulation is so deeply indebted, and whose processes, from the sim
plicity of the apparatus required, and the ease with which the ex
perimenter may construct it for himself, are more likely to be em
ployed by the student than the more expensive instruments of Reg
nault and Frankland, which, although affording considerable advan
tages to the experienced operator, are not so well adapted for the be
ginner in gas manipulations.
   In the chapter on pressure-tube operations we conceive that the
author has slightly erred in the opposite direction.         He has clearly
and fully described     allthe simpler forms       apparatus used
                                                  of                 inthese
important operations, but      he has altogether omitted   to  mention the
more convenient though expensive contrivances, which have recently
come into use among those chemists who have extensively employed
these processes   in  their researches.

         “On the part which the Silicates of the Alkalies may play in
the Metamorphism of Rocks.”              By T. Sterry Hunt, Esq., of the
Geological Survey of Canada.
    In my last communication to the Royal Society on the Meta
morphic Silurian Strata of Canada, I endeavoured to show, from the
results of analyses of the altered and unaltered rocks, that it is the
reaction between the siliceous matters and the carbonates of lime,
magnesia, and iron of the sedimentary deposits, which has given rise
to the serpentines, talcs, pyroxenites, chlorites, and garnet rocks of
the formation.       I then cited the observation of Bischof that silica,
even in the form of pulverized quartz, slowly decomposes these car
bonates at a temperature of 212°F., with evolution of carbonic acid;
the same author mentions that a solution of carbonate of soda has
the power of dissolving quartz under similar conditions*. Desiring
 to verify these observations, - I have since made the following experi
ments.
    Colourless crystalline quartz was ignited, finely pulverized, and
then boiled for an hour with a solution of              weight     perfectly
                                                                       its                  of

mesia    but no silica in solution.       That the soluble silica was really
combined with magnesia was shown by boiling the insoluble mixture
with sal-ammoniac, which, dissolving the carbonate, left a large
amount of magnesia with the silica. This silicate was readily decom
posed by hydrochloric acid, the greater part of the silica separating
in a pulverulent form.
    The third experiment was suggested by some observations on the
reactions of silicate of soda with earthy carbonates.           Kuhlmann has
remarked the power of carbonate of lime to abstract the silica from
a boiling solution of soluble glass”, and it is known that alumina
exerts a similar action.        I have found that when artificial carbonate
of magnesia in excess is boiled with a solution of silicate of soda, the
latter is completely decomposed with the formation of carbonate of
soda, and a silicate of magnesia which gelatinizes with acids; and                                          I
have long since described this reaction in the evaporation of alkaline
mineral waterst. This mutual decomposition of carbonate of mag
nesia and silicate of soda, conjoined with the power of carbonate of
soda to dissolve silica, leads to a curious result.        If we boil for some
hours a mixture of ignited silica, obtained from the decomposition of
a silicate by an acid (and consequently readily soluble in an alkaline
carbonate), with a small portion of carbonate of soda and an excess of
hydrocarbonate of magnesia, we obtain a dense powder which contains
of all
     the silica united with magnesia, and may                             be

 the above experiments that similar results may                  obtained with      be

   “On the Cause of the Rhythmic Motion of the Heart,” being
the Croonian Lecture.     By James Paget, Esq., F.R.S.
   The author draws the following conclusions as to the most pro
bable explanation of the rhythmic action of the heart:-
   1. In the Vertebrata it is due to the time-regulated discharges of
nerve-force in certain of the ganglia in and near the substance of the
heart, by which discharges the muscular walls are excited to con
traction.
   2. In Invertebrata, the corresponding pulsatile movements of
hearts or vessels are probably independent of nerve-force.
   3. The time-regulated rhythmic action, whether of the nervous
centres or of the independent contractile walls, is due to their nutri
tion being rhythmic, i. e. to their being, in certain periods, by nutri
tive changes of composition, raised, with regulated progress, to a
state of instability of composition, in their decline from which they
discharge nerve-force, or change their shape, contracting.
   4. The muscular substance of the heart in the Vertebrata, governed
in     itsrhythmic action                             by
                                      appropriate nervous centres, has                                   a

   There could  be no doubt regarding the identity     of the basic com
pounds thus formed with triethylamine.         The base floating on the
surface of the saturated aqueous solution, possessed in a marked
manner the characteristic odour of triethylamine.        In order to ex
clude the possibility of a mistake, the hydrochloric solution of the
compound was mixed with a solution of bichloride of platinum.
Only after protracted standing of the highly concentrated solution,
deep orange-coloured, well-formed crystals of the platinum-salt
were deposited, the physical characters of which were still fresh in
my memory.
   The determination of platinum furnished results closely agreeing
with the formula

   I  have already applied this reaction in various directions, and
shall communicate the results which       I  have obtained at a future
period.    On considering how frequently, in the action of hydrated
potassa upon organic substances, the hydrogen of the water of
hydration is assimilated by the products of decomposition, the sub
stitution of ethylic potassa for the hydrate appears in many cases to
promise valuable results from this mode of ethylation.      The facility,
however, with which ethylic potassa decomposes at a comparatively
low temperature, must always be a serious obstacle to an extensive
use of this reaction.

    The following communications were read:—
    1. “On the Correlation of the Triassic and Permian Rocks of the
 Odenwald in the Vicinity of Heidelberg, and those of Central Eng
land.” By E. Hull, Esq., B.A., F.G.S.
    The author first referred to the memoir by Murchison and Morris,
in the eleventh volume of the Society's Journal, on the Palaeozoic
 Rocks of the Thüringerwald and the Harz, for the special description
 of the Permian formation in that part of Germany; and, as these
 deposits appear to be comparable, almost stratum for stratum, with
 those of England, Mr. Hull sought for a similar correlation at Hei
 delberg when on a visit there this autumn. He referred to Dr. Leon
hard’s ‘Geognostische Skizze von Baden,’ 1846, for descriptive details
 of the geology of this locality.
    Immediately overlying the granite at Heidelberg is a red breccia
 of porphyry and granite, upwards of 200 feet thick, which is the
 “Rothe-todt-Liegende” of the Odenwald, being similar to that rock
 in Thuringia and other parts of Germany, and comparable with the

      On the Triassic and Permian Rocks           of the  Odenwald.       73
trappoid breccia of Worcestershire.        It is of local origin; the parent
rock-masses being still seen in the neighbourhood.              Beneath the
Worcestershire breccia, however, is a series of red marls and sand
stones, not occurring in the Odenwald, but probably present in the
Thiiringerwald. The origin of this breccia is in Germany associated
 with volcanic phaenomena; and, according to Prof. Ramsay, it is of
glacial origin in England.        See Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc. vol. xi.
p. 187.
    Over the Heidelberg breccia lies a great mass of Bunter sand
stone, upwards of 1400 feet in thickness.            It is throughout of a
nearly uniform composition; and, except that it contains but com
paratively few pebbles, it is much like the conglomerate-beds of
Lancashire and Cheshire.        The author considers, that, from its uni
formity of composition, and consequent indivisibility into subdivi
 sions, and from its resemblance to the above-mentioned member of
 the New Red Sandstone of England, this red sandstone of Heidelberg
 belongs wholly to the Upper Bunter (Bunter-Sandstein), of Triassic
 age; and that none of it is referable to the Lower Bunter (Bunter
 Schiefer), which Murchison and Morris have shown to belong to the
 Permian series.
    In England the Bunter is divisible into three groups, viz. l.
 Upper variegated sandstone; 2. Conglomerate-beds;                 3. Lower
 variegated sandstone. Whilst the Bunter of the Odenwald would
 seem to be in this respect imperfect, as compared with that of En
 gland, yet the author thinks that the two districts in question pre
 sent but one contemporaneous formation.
    Mr. Hull treated of the Muschelkalk, next overlying the Bunter,
 in a few words, it being absent in England.         Of the succeeding for
 mation, or Keuper, the author stated that a true parallelism may be
 traced in the order of succession of the beds of this formation in
 England and around the flanks of the Odenwald.             First, or lowest,
 are  grits and   shales, about 100 feet thick,  with a calcareous breccia,
 of local   origin, in which a  fragment   of Bunter-sandstone has been
 met with. These beds are parallel with the “Waterstones” and
 Keuper-breccia of Worcestershire, Staffordshire, and Cheshire, and
 form the “Lower Keuper-sandstone.”             Evidences of unconformity
 between the Waterstones and the Bunter in England are not want
 ing, though not so strong as those of the unconformity of the Lower
 Keuper and the Bunter of the Odenwald.
    A series of gypseous shales and marls, about 150 feet thick, sepa
 rate the Lower from the Upper Keuper-sandstone.            The last, about
 10 feet thick, contain plant-remains, and are similar to the so-called
 “Keuper-sandstone,” with Posidonomya minuta, of England. A con
 siderable thickness of variegated shales, with gypsum and haematite,
 covers the Upper-sandstone.
    In conclusion, the author dwelt upon the quasi-triassic aspect of
 the Permian formation, with its two argillo-arenaceous groups and
 intermediate calcareous band, as pointed out already by Sir Roderick
 Murchison, and as shown in a synoptical table by which the paper
 was illustrated.

     November 18,    1857.-Col. Portlock, R.E., President, in the Chair.
     The following communications were read:—
     1. “On Estuary Strata in Shotover Hill, near Oxford.”                By
John     Phillips, LL.D.,   F.R.S.,  F.G.S.,   Reader in    Geology   in the
                                   -
University of Oxford.
     The author presented, in the first place, an historical notice of the
facts and opinions published in regard to the sandy strata which in
this detached hill rest upon the Portland series. From the time of
Holloway (1722), to that of Smith (1800–1815), these deposits,
with their ochres and variously-coloured sands, were always classified
with the ferruginous sands, with ochre and fuller's earth, of Bedford
shire and Buckinghamshire, and received the general title of “Iron
Sand.” Conybeare (1822) uses the same title, traces them along
the vale of Aylesbury, and refers them to the Hastings Sands.             At
this time, however, the Lower Greensand was not perfectly discri
minated from the Hastings group.
     In 1827 Dr. Fitton appears to have ascertained the occurrence of
Purbeck deposits at Whitchurch in Buckinghamshire.              About 1832
the Rev. H. Jelly discovered Paludiniform shells in the sands of
 Shotover; and in 1833, and again in 1836, Mr. H. E. Strickland
communicated notices of this discovery to the Geological Society and
to Dr. Fitton, in whose great Memoir “On the Strata below the
Chalk” the information was published.          From that time to the pre
sent no further notice has appeared; but, previous to 1854, Mr.
 Strickland, by his own researches, added a distinct Unio to the shells
already collected ; and since 1854 the author of the present notice
has been enabled to augment the list of fossils, and to ascertain pre
 cisely the main facts regarding their geological position.
     The Portland rocks (70 feet thick), consisting of green sand, en
 closing one band of clay and two or three layers of large subcal
 careous concretions, are rich in fossils, and some of these (Pecten,
 Perna, &c.) can be traced through the whole deposits to near the very
 top. This group is suddenly covered by sands, white, yellow, brown,
 reddish, or black, but not green; banded somewhat regularly by
 white or cream-coloured clays, and marked by imperfect ramifying
 layers of deep-brown peroxide of iron; chert-masses also occur. The
 stratification, where most regular, as in the white sands and clays, is
 often undulated, but there is very little trace of oblique ordrift-bedding.
 Ochre occurs in several parts of the section, and has been much
 worked in the upper part. The whole series is about 80 feet thick.
      In all the lower half of the series, but only in the hard ferruginous
 layers and geodic masses, and there not abundantly, we find conife
 rous wood, small spiral shells, and bivalve shells. The bivalves are
  of the genus Unio—one comparable in size to Unio Valdensis, but
  different in general figure, and in the characters about the fulcrum,
  ligament, and posterior slope. The other is of smaller and more

76                      Geological Society:—                     *
delicate type, like U. subtruncatus. A Cyclas or Cyrena occurs in the
specimens collected by Mr. Jelly. The spiral shells are partly Palu
dina, of two or perhaps three species, one approaching in size to
ordinary examples of P. fluviorum, the others smaller,-and partly
of other genera. One is striated parallel to the volutions, like a
Littorina. Another resembles somewhat the cast of a Natica.          No
Cyprides have yet been recognized with certainty.         Regarding two
of the species of molluscs above alluded to, as possibly belonging to
salt-water, but all the others as due to the influence of river-action,
the author concludes that through a considerable part of the thick
ness of these sands there is evidence now obtained of the estuarine, but
not lacustrine, origin of the sediments.       The upper parts of the
series have been    carefully  explored to the summit, especially about
the   ochre-bands, but to this date   they  have yielded no fossils, and
the author desires to leave it for further inquiry whether these
crowning sandstones are of the same estuary character, or belong to
a detached part of the Lower Greensand strata, which undoubtedly
exist to the south-west and north-east.
    Founding his inferences on Shotover, but confirming them by re
ference to points in the neighbourhood, where Purbeck strata are
seen below these “Iron Sands,” the author expresses his opinion that
in these sands we have a northern equivalent of the Hastings Sands,
—that the river to which they may be ascribed was probably not
that of the typical Wealden, but a different stream, nourishing dif
ferent Unionidae, –and that its effects will be traced much farther to
the north-eastward, along the country now under survey by the
 Government Geologists, to whom is committed the very important
 task of tracing the difficult boundaries of the Lower Cretaceous and
 Upper Oolitic deposits.
    2. “On the Mineralogical and Palaeontological characters of the
 Palaeozoic Strata of the State of New York.” By     J. J. Bigsby, M.D.,
 F.G.S.
     In this communication the author presented a     resumé of the chief
 geological points characteristic of the palaeozoic basin of New York,
 which may thereby be compared with other districts of palaeozoic
 rocks.     These points of character and comparison were arranged
 under the following heads:—“mineral character,” “mode of trans
 ition from group to group of strata,” “place,” “position or dip,”
  “thickness,” “fossils in general,” “typical fossils,” “fossils occur
 rent in Europe,” and “fossils recurrent in New York.”                  -
     The evidences used in this synopsis are based upon a series of
  elaborate tables constructed by Dr. Bigsby from the writings of
 James Hall, Vanuxem, Conrad, De Verneuil, Murchison, Sharpe,
  Sowerby, Portlock, Salter, M'Coy, Morris, and others. The author
  commenced with a sketch of the geographical features of the region
  under consideration, illustrated by the great geological map of middle
  North-east America prepared by himself.
     The characters of the several members of the palaeozoic basin of
  New York were then concisely described in succession, under the

Dr. Bigsby      on the   Paleozoic Strata              of the State of New York. 77
heads above referred to, the following being the order of classifica

rocks; 14. Waterme rocks; 15. Lower Pentamerus limestone;
16. Delthyris shaly limestone; 17. Upper Pentamerus limestone.
D. Lower Devonian: 1. Oriskany sandstone ; 2. Cauda-galli grit;
3. Schoharie grit; 3. Onondaga limestone; 4. Corniferous limestone.
E. Middle Devonian: 5. Marcellus shale; 6. Hamilton rocks; 7.
Tully limestone; 8. Genessee slate ; 9. Portage sandstone; 10.
Chemung rocks. F. Upper Devonian: 11. Catskill or Old Red
Sandstone.
    From the consideration of the many members of this great palaeo
zoic series of Central North America, severally and collectively, the
author drew numerous inferences, and offered them to the notice of
the Society, not as           all
                             being new         unassailable, but

 elsewhere, there is intimate connexion between the fossils and their
 sediment or habitat. The iron-ore frequently accompanying inverte

 other reasons) the new sediment with its new flora was only able to

NoTE ON THE DEcoMPosition of CERTAIN SALTs, PARTICU

                    BY M. C. DESPRETZ.
    an experiment made with the view      determining the propor
INtion   which copper and lead are deposited

of combining, as he expected, at the negative pole, separated, the
lead being deposited in the form of oxide upon the positive, and the
copper in a metallic state on the negative plate.
    The decomposition was effected by two of Bunsen's elements; the
acetates of copper and lead were mixed in atomic proportions and
dissolved in seven to eight parts of water.            As soon as the circuit
is closed, the positive (charcoal) platinum plate is seen to acquire
 a reddish-brown tint.        In eight or ten hours the positive plate is
 covered with a coat resembling a black varnish, and if the experiment
be continued still longer, the deposit becomes detached from certain
 points and falls to the bottom of the vessel, or rises to the surface
 by means of the adherent gas.
    The deposit on the negative pole is red copper mixed with traces
 of lead. This copper dissolves rapidly at the ordinary temperature
 in pure nitric acid of spec. grav. 1:329, or diluted with water. The
 black deposit of the positive pole only dissolves in small quantity in
 such nitric acid at a boiling heat, even by several days of contact.
 On the addition of muriatic acid the action is brisk, and the black
 substance is changed into white chloride of lead. This chloride,
 treated with an excess of nitric acid, is converted into nitrate.
    The black substance heated by the spirit-lamp in a glass tube,
 acquires the red colour of bichromate of potash without losing                                                        its
 lamellar form.               In

                                         the belief that the black matter                                              is

   In the meantime he inquires how these compounds, which are
found at the positive pole, are formed.                 They did not exist in the
solution.      It can hardly be supposed that a portion of the metal is
carried to the positive pole and then oxidized by absorbing the
oxygen disengaged at that pole.                   It is more probable that the
division takes       place  at the    negative     pole; that a portion of the
oxide   gives   up       its
                         oxygen       another    portion,

XII. On Gravitation and the Conservation of Force. By ERNST
    BRücke, Member of the Academy of Vienna, and Professor of
    Physiology in the University*.
      N the 27th of February of the  present year (1857) Faraday
       gave a lecture in the Royal Institutiont, in which he
sought to prove that our usual conception of the force of gravity
is not in harmony with the principle of the conservation of
force.  In accordance with this conception, he defined gravity
as “a simple attractive force exerted between any two or      the                          all
particles       or
                masses       matter,
                                of         every sensible distance, but with
                                                 at
a strength    varying inversely              as
                                         the square               of
                                                         the distance.”     He
draws attention          the circumstance that this definition presup
                           to
                                  point which Newton himself found

results are inconsistent with the law of the Conservation of Force.
If  we imagine a particle isolated and without gravitating force,
and afterwards introduce another, an attractive force is supposed
to be set up on both sides, and thus again, according to the
usual conception, we should have a creation of force.
    Further, if we conceive the particle B to be separated from
the particle A for an infinite distance, the attractive force is
thereby infinitely diminished; it                   fact,      is,     respect

stand these images in themselves, nor the objects from which
they proceed; but we see that under the same circumstances the
same images always appear, and                              this regularity of their appear
ance permits us to determine them beforehand.       We construct
formulae, either verbal or in mathematical symbols, and name the
principles from which these are deduced Laws of Nature.
    We have motion incessantly before us, partly as the motion
 of masses, and partly as the motion of the ultimate particles of
 matter among themselves, in the form of heat; or when the rays
 of this heat excite our organs of vision, in the form of light.
 We have so studied the circumstances under which these motions
vary and succeed each other, that we can predict their mode of
 appearance,   their intensity and their direction; and we have
found that the formulae which serve for this purpose assume
their simplest form, when we ascribe to the ultimate particles of
matter attributes which we name forces, the magnitude of which
we make dependent on mass and distance.             No one can prove
that these attributes have a real existence, in the strict sense of
 thethe
     word, that they exist        the things themselves, and beyond

                I                          proceed from Faraday's            to
own example.      Let the mass        separated from the mass
                                                           A         be                                                  B
 by       an
         external  force; while this separation  takes place, the
attraction diminishes, the attractive forces being    the inverse                                 in

                          the Conservation of Force.                                              85
ratio of the squares        of the              distances.        Where abides the force
which is here destroyed 2    The reply is:—If the mass A be left
to itself, it moves back towards B, and when it has arrived at its
original position, it will be attracted by B with the same force
as before;     besides     this it has attained a velocity, half the square
of which, multiplied          by the mass of A, is exactly equal to the
work which was             formerly expended in removing it from B.
There is therefore no force destroyed by the change which the
external cause has wrought; but just as much force appears at
the end as was expended in producing the change.   Let us look
a little more closely into the matter with which we have here to
deal. What is our measure of the force of attraction?       It is
the augmentation       of velocity which a body experiences in the
unit of time by the action of the force.               In virtue of inertia,
the  impulses     of gravity    are accumulated in the body, the velo
city augments in the same proportion, and the quantity stored
up in the unit of time serves as a measure for the magnitude of
the attractive force. This is the only true and direct measure
of a force; for as the very notion of a force has been derived
from the concrete phaenomena of motion, the measure of a force
must also be derived from the same thing.
   It is this augmentation of velocity which follows the law of
the inverse square of the distance, and this stands in no con
tradiction, but in the most complete harmony with the principle
of the conservation of force. This principle affirms, that in every
system which is abandoned to itself the sum of the tensions
added to the sum of the vires viva, gives at                  times the same   all
quantity.            In
                   other words, that         every such system the quan

                     is

                              their velocities has      maximum, which a                          is

moreover nothing can                    be
                                 lost. Motion can never             destroyed          be
               be              regeneration, because motion disappears

calculated to convey the idea that these are three different forms of
one and the same thing; but we must not suffer ourselves to fall
into this delusion; we must always remember that they are three
totally different things. We call the sum of the motion actually
 existing vis viva. We denote it as force, as cause of motion,
 because it not only continues to act in accordance with the law
 of inertia, but because it can be communicated to other bodies,                                                        in

spaces between these masses being traversed by the forces.                                                                   If
the forces could be imagined as existing in space, it must also be
conceivable that matter may be annihilated without changing the
sum of the forces, and this, at least by me, is not conceivable.
   One more point remains to be considered, which       believe is                                         I
essential to the doubts raised by Faraday. We say the attrac
tion diminishes with increasing distance, and moreover that the
attracting forces are to each other in the ratio of the inverse
squares of the distances.  In Faraday’s process of thought, this
is understood as if we assumed a change of the cause of motion
which actually resides in the masses.                 do not know whether         I
this is a prevalent notion.         It is difficult to obtain information
on the point, for an investigator may write memoirs                     his life                               all
long and never once express his convictions upon the subject.
I  believe, however,       cannot        doubted that Faraday
                                        it                   be        right                                   is            in
opposing this notion, and          assuming with Newton the existence

         say that the                 forces  vary

                           also say that the       intensity      light   varies
inversely       the squares

stances, we can by no means refer this to the source of attraction;
we must rather assume that the latter is constant, and that also
the sum of the effects neither diminishes nor increases with the
distance.            An example will make this clear.
   Let a molecule be imagined with the space around it filled
with molecules which are scattered at equal distances from each
other.    For the sake of simplicity, let the latter be regarded as
of equal mass, and the mass of each of them as a vanishing
quantity in comparison with that of the first molecule, which I
will call the central molecule.   The central molecule will attract
all the   others, and the action upon each of them will vary as the
inverse squares of the distances. Let us suppose that around the
central molecule we have a spherical shell of definite thickness,
the sum of the actions proceeding from the central molecule will
always be the same within this shell, however great the distance
at which it is placed from the central molecule.             For the action
on the    single  molecules diminishes as the       square  of the distance
increases, but the number of the molecules which make up such
a shell, augments directly as the square of the distance.
    When, therefore, we say that the attracting forces are inversely
to each other as the squares of the distances, we wish to say
nothing else than that the attracting force which belongs to every
 mass is constant, and spreads                          its
                                         actions, undiminished          their                              in
totality,       in    all

 rate parts the greater the space over which they are spread. We
 are not hereby forced         assume      propagation
                                           to                a  the ordinary                in

XIII.     On the Nature of Flame, and on the Condition of the Sun’s
     Surface.   By JoHN W. DRAPER, M.D., Professor of Che
     mistry and Physiology in the University of New York+.
AMºº            the recent publications on photo-chemistry, there is
         one by Professor Dove on the Electric Light (Phil. Mag.
Nov.   1857),    which will doubtless attract the attention of those
interested in that branch of science. Examination by the prism,
and by absorbing and reflecting coloured bodies, leads him to
the conclusion that it is necessary to consider the luminous
appearance as having two distinct sources:—1st, the ignition or
incandescence of the material particles bodily passing in the
course of the discharge ; 2ndly, the proper electrical light itself.
As respects the first, he illustrates           method        its
                                                              increase from      of
low    to high temperatures,                   by

the nature of the other regional divisions distinguishable in such
a flame.    There must be a blue portion below; blue, because it
consists of the most refrangible rays, which issue forth in abun
dance, for there the exterior air is most copiously and perfectly
applied. At the upper end of the flame, particularly if the wick
be long and the supply of combustible matter abundant, the
light emitted is red, for the products of combustion ascending
past that part, make it difficult for the exterior air to get access.
   Upon these principles we may also predict what colour a
flame will have when we vary the circumstances of                burning.                      its

bear no relation to the burning of the carbon, but to the disen
gagement of the nitrogen they must be attributed.
    In other cases dark lines are replaced by bright ones, as in
the well-known instance of the electric spark between metallic
surfaces.     The occurrence of lines, whether bright or dark, is
hence connected with the chemical nature of the substance pro
ducing the flame.       For this reason they merit a much more
critical examination than has been yet given to them, for by
their aid we may be able to ascertain points of great interest in
other departments of science.      Thus if we are ever able to acquire
certain   knowledge   respecting  the physical state of the sun and
other stars, it will be by an examination of the light they emit.
Even at present, by the aid of the few facts before us, we can
see our way pretty clearly to certain conclusions respecting the
 sun.    For since substances which are incandescent, or in the
ignited state through the accumulation of heat in them, show no
fixed lines, their prismatic spectrum being uninterrupted from
end to end, it would appear to follow that the luminous condition
 of our sun, whose light contains fixed lines, cannot be referred
to such incandescence or ignition.        At various times those who
have studied this subject have offered different hypotheses: one
regarding the sun as a solid or perhaps liquid mass in a con
 dition of ignition; another considering the light to be electrical;
a third supposing him to be the seat of a fierce combustion.
 Of such hypotheses we have given reason for declining the first.
Prismatic analysis, which demonstrates no resemblance between
 the light of the sun and that of any form of electric discharges
with which we are familiar, enables us in like manner to reject
the second; and upon the whole, facts seem most strongly to
prepossess us in favour of the third, in artificial combustions
 similar fixed lines being observed.       If such is to be regarded
 as the  physical  condition of the  sun, we can no longer contem
plate him as an immense mass slowly and tranquilly cooling in
the lapse of countless centuries by radiation into space, as so
many considerations drawn from other branches of science have
hitherto led us to suppose, but he must be regarded as the seat
of chemical changes going on upon a prodigious scale, and with
inconceivable energy.
    If  the law designated above, that the more energetical the
 chemical action in combustion the more refrangible the emitted
light, be translated into the conceptions of the undulatory theory,
 it not only puts us in possession of a distinct idea of the manner
 in which the combustive union of bodies is accomplished, the
 quickness of vibration increasing with the chemical energy, but
 it also enables us to transfer for the use of chemistry some of the
 most interesting numerical determinations of optics,

       XIV.     On the Conduction    of Electricity in     Electrolytes.
                              By R. CLAUSIUs”.
l.        former memoirit I considered the effects of a                galvanic
     INcurrent
          a
               within conductor of the first class (i.e. one which
                          a
conducts without electrolysis), without taking into account the
manner in which the current was produced.           It was there found
that the laws   regulating  the production   of heat in such conduc
tors follow immediately from Ohm’s law, and from the principle
of the equivalence of heat and work. In a similar manner, if we
consider a conductor of the second class, that is to say, one which
conducts by electrolysis, without any reference to the other parts
of the circuit, we may deduce conclusions, some strictly accurate,
and others at least probable, which appear to possess some                  in
terest.                                    I
           In the following pages will endeavour to develope some
of these deductions.
   2. With respect to the laws of the production of heat, if we
admit the applicability of Ohm's law to conductors of the second
class, the conclusions of my former memoir may also be extended,
without any modification, to the case under consideration; as
before, however, we shall assume that the current is stationary,
and that it neither exerts nor suffers any inducing actions of an
electro-magnetic or electro-dynamic kind.
    In order to maintain the electricity in motion, notwithstanding
the resistance offered by the conductor, a force must be present
in every point of the latter, tending to move the electricity con
centrated in the same in a definite direction; or, assuming two
electricities, to drive the positive electricity in one direction, and
the negative with equal energy in the opposite direction. This
force proceeds from free electricity, which, as Kirchhoff has
proved, may exist on the surface of the conductor or on the sur
face separating two different conductors, but not in the interior
of the same. With respect to the interior of a homogeneous con
 ductor, no matter whether the same belong to the first or to the
 second class, if we admit the hypothesis of two electricities moving
 in opposite directions, we must assume that equal quantities of
 both kinds of electricity are always present in every measurable
 space within the conductor; and if we admit only one kind of
 electricity, we must suppose the normal quantity of electricity
 to be always present within a given space, in consequence of
 which that space appears unelectric.
    In our present case the work done by the moving force can be

themselves from the     electro-negative    ones with which they were
hitherto united; but        compensate this, they have united them

under the hypothesis      one electric fluid, we must assume, how
                                       of

that no accumulation of positive or negative partial molecules
alone takes place in any part of the conductor—in other words,
that both kinds of partial molecules are everywhere so uni
formly distributed, that in any given space there are an equal
number of each kind. For in this case, owing to the opposite
actions of positive and negative partial molecules, the forces ex
erted by the electricities of the surrounding partial molecules
upon the electricity adhering to any one cannot occasion any
strong resultant having a tendency to move the latter electricity

  started from one electrode, e.g. the anode, that the negative
 partial molecules of the decomposed complete molecules were
 here retained, whilst the positive ones proceeded to the next
 stratum of liquid, and there determined a new decomposition by
 combining with the negative partial molecules of that stratum,
 and liberating the positive ones; that the latter again withdrew
 to the following stratum, and there once more occasioned the
 same effects, and so on.      According to this, the decomposition
 of one stratum would cause that of the next following, and the
 action of the moving force in the conductor would be limited,
 first, to moving the liberated partial molecules of the first stra
 tum to the following one, and secondly, to facilitating the decom
position by also pressing forwards the positive partial molecules
of this latter stratum.
    The falsity of this view is at once proved by the fact that,
according to              it,
                       excess   anpositive partial molecules, and con
                                                of

they will remain as long as no foreign force acts on them, so that
the several molecules, although capable of oscillating about their
positions of equilibrium, are not able to quit the same entirely;
further,in accordance with the assumption which such an arrange
ment necessitates, let the attraction between two partial mole
cules combined into one complete molecule (and consequently in
close proximity to each other) be greater than the attraction
between the positive partial molecule of one complete molecule
and the negative one of another. If within this mass an electric
force, whose tendency is to drive the positively electrified partial
molecules in one direction, and the negatively electrified ones in
the opposite direction, begins to act, the question arises, what
influence will the same exert upon the deportment of the mo
lecules.
    The molecules being supposed capable of turning round a

   9. In this conception of the condition of the liquid, the above
mentioned difficulty disappears.    It is at once seen that the                                         in
fluence exerted  by the electric force upon the already existing,
though irregular molecular decompositions and motions com
mences at once in the manner above described, and increases
with the intensity of the force instead of remaining ineffective
until the force has reached a certain linit of intensity. The
 whole process, therefore, agrees very well with Ohm’s law.
    Why the electric conductibility, which depends upon the faci
 lity with which the molecular decompositions take place within
 the liquid, should be so different in different liquids; why, for
 example, these decompositions take place so much more readily
 in the molecules of hydrated sulphuric acid than in those of
 water; and why the dilution of sulphuric acid should have so
 remarkable an effect on                 its
                                conductibility,+are questions which

   11. The question has lately been several times discussed,
whether, in conductors of the second class, besides the conduc
tion by means of electrolysis, another kind similar to that in
conductors of the first class also takes place.
   From a theoretical point of view, the hypothesis of the co
existence of both kinds of conduction in one and the same body
appears to me admissible. The determination, however, in par
ticular cases of the quantitative relation between the two kinds
of conduction, must, for the present at least, continue to be
referred to experimental research, in consequence of the absence
of accurately established facts whereon to base theoretical con
clusions.
     Withrespect to the bodies hitherto examined in this respect,
and   which, on account of their frequent application, are most
important, it has been found that conduction without electrolysis,
if it at        all
             exists,     any rate very small; hence
                                        at               will not                     it
           be                   to is         conduction, which,
                                                                  in of
here      necessary    consider this kind
indeed, would offer little essentially new      theoretical point       a
of   view.
    12. Lastly, there remains         phaenomenon a            mentioned,   to   be
which,       many cases, accompanies electric conduction:
             of in
                                                                       refer                I

                     doing, has arrived

 of his first memoir, many        these laws are comprised
                                             of                     the fol             in
lowing theorem:—“An electric tension which exists                       both                 on

ner the electric force acting within the porous partition, and
 occasioning the current, depends upon that difference, we shall
 find that the above theorem may         more simply expressed thus:—

the potential of the free electricity upon the electricity flowing
through the partition.
   Within a porous partition the effects of this work, as trans
ferred to the material masses, are in some respects different from
those in a continuous liquid mass.       A portion, and in most cases
by far the greater portion of the work, will be employed in over
coming, in the ordinary manner, the resistance to conduction in
decompositions and recombinations of molecules, and in opposite
motions of the partial molecules.         This portion of the work
within the    partition  will be   completely   converted into heat.
Another portion of the work will, on the other hand, be em.
ployed in moving the whole liquid, and in reference to this
latter portion, a twofold deportment may manifest itself.
   We must distinguish between the cases when the liquid, in
passing through the partition, has, and has not to overcome a
counter-pressure, which latter may be considered as a hydro
static pressure.    If the liquid encounters no counter-pressure,
then there is only the friction within the partition to be over
come, and the portion of the work employed in doing so will
also be completely converted into heat.            When a counter
pressure exists, however, sufficiently great to impede, but not to
prevent the translation of the liquid, then the work employed in
forcing the liquid forwards is itself smaller because there is less
liquid moved; and of this smaller quantity of work, only a part
is converted into heat, the other being consumed in overcoming
the hydrostatic pressure, or, as we may express           annulled            it,                 by
the negative work        the hydrostatic counter-pressure. Lastly,

kilogrammes to a square metre, is then 10333, and in order to
obtain the work, expressed in kilogramme-metres, we must mul

through the partition and expressed in cubic metres.             For

the action, at a high temperature, of sodium on the double fluo
ride of titanium and potassium in an atmosphere of hydrogen.
It is a dark gray powder, like iron reduced by hydrogen. The
substances hitherto obtained in reduction experiments, and de
scribed as titanium, really consist of nitride of titanium.    Of
the two constituents of the atmosphere, oxygen is that which
offers most resistance to the preparation of elements in their
pure form; but in the case of titanium, it is nitrogen. A cru
cible lined with charcoal, and filled with a mixture of titanic
acid and charcoal, is impermeable to the oxygen of the furnace,
while it is penetrated with ease by the nitrogen.
   Wöhler and Deville mixed titanic acid and charcoal in the
proportion in which, by assimilation of nitrogen, they would
form the cubic titanium of the blast-furnaces, Ti C*N +3Tiº N.
A small charcoal tray was filled with this mixture, and heated in
a tube of dense carbon”, externally protected from combustion,
to a temperature at which platinum melts; at the same time a
stream of pure, dry nitrogen was passed through the tube. When
the temperature had reached a certain point, and the gas passed
through in a rapid stream, the tray became perceptibly more                                        in
candescent than the surrounding tube; and the nitrogen was so
rapidly absorbed, that nothing but pure carbonic oxide issued
from the other end of the apparatus. The apparatus was then
allowed to cool, the passage of the gas being continued. The
contents of the tray were then found to be changed into a cry
stalline substance of metallic lustre, which had     the chemical             all
and   physical properties     the titanium  of the blast-furnaces.   of

         Wöhler and Deville on    some properties  of Boron.       111
 method, which has already furnished them 500 or 600 grammes
 of this substance.     100 grms. of boracic acid, fused and coarsely
 powdered, are mixed with 60 grms. of sodium, and the mixture
 projected into a red-hot iron crucible. The whole is covered with
 40 or 50 grims. of fused salt, the crucible closed, and when the
 action is over, the contents stirred about with an iron rod. The
 mass, which contains boron swimming in a flux of boracic acid,
 borate of soda, and chloride of sodium, is poured, while still hot,
 into water acidulated with hydrochloric acid, then washed on a
 filter, first with acidulated water until free from boracic acid, and
 finally with distilled water. The boron remains on the filter and
 is dried in the air on porous tiles.
     When amorphous boron is heated in a current of ammonia, it
 appears to take fire, incandescence ensues, and the ammonia is
 decomposed, the nitrogen combining with the boron to form
 nitride of boron, and the hydrogen escaping.        Boron, or a mix
 ture of boracic acid and charcoal strongly heated in a current of
 pure nitrogen, is entirely converted into nitride of boron. Boron
 cannot therefore be heated in crucibles in ordinary furnaces
 without being changed into nitride.       Amorphous boron may be
 readily converted into crystallized boron by lining a crucible
 with amorphous boron, and placing in the cavity a piece of alu
 minium.       At an elevated temperature the aluminium becomes
charged with boron, which crystallizes out on cooling, and may
 be obtained by dissolving the aluminium either in soda or in
hydrochloric acid. To prevent the boron from absorbing              ni
 trogen, the crucible containing it is placed inside another cru
 cible, lined with a mixture of titanic acid and charcoal, which
stops both the nitrogen and the oxygen.
     At  a full red heat boron decomposes the vapour of water, with
the production of hydrogen and boracic acid. Part of the boracic
acid volatilizes with the vapour of water, and crystallizes at some
distance from the point at which the tube in which the experi
ment was made is heated.
     When heated in sulphuretted hydrogen, boron combines with
the sulphur, hydrogen being liberated, and the sulphide of boron
volatilizes in the excess of sulphuretted hydrogen, just as boracic
acid in the vapour of water; and the sulphide of boron is ob
tained crystallized at some distance from the point at which it is
formed.
     At a very moderate temperature hydrochloric acid gas is de
composed by boron, with evolution of light and formation of
chloride of boron; and bromide of boron is similarly obtained.
The chloride and bromide of boron are not gases, as generally
stated, but liquids, of which the first boils at 17° and the latter
at 90°C,

   Amorphous boron possesses properties as a reducing agent
which place it near carbon.   Its affinity for chlorine is so great,
that the chlorides of lead, mercury   and silver, are reduced at a
high temperature with formation of chloride of boron. Galena
is also reduced by boron, lead and sulphide of boron being the
products.

of a normal chloride is very difficult; and thirty-nine years ago,
when these determinations were made, the methods of preparing
pure cobalt and nickel compounds were very imperfect.
   Schneider's determination was made with the oxalates of
nickel and of cobalt, which have the advantage that they are
very insoluble in water and dilute acids, and also that the deter
mination of the carbon and the metal may be made with great
accuracy.
   Great care was taken to obtain the oxalates quite pure. The
oxalate of nickel was prepared by adding to a feebly acid solution
of perfectly pure chloride of nickel, a cold saturated solution of
oxalic acid, washing the resulting oxalate with water until it was
perfectly neutral and free from      trace                   all
                                              acid, and then con            of

    The oxalate         of
                    cobalt was obtained                             by
                                             digesting pure carbonate
    cobalt with oxalic acid, and then washing out the oxalate,

   Weber describes” the preparation of iodide of aluminium.
One part of aluminium in filings is placed in a sealed tube, and
ten or eleven parts of dry iodine added.     The tube is then sealed
at the other end and     gently  heated.   Combination takes place
with   strong evolution of light and heat: the granules of alumi
nium burn with a splendid violet light. On cooling, the iodide
appears as a solid mass coloured brown by excess of iodine; by
using a slight excess of metal, and resubliming the iodide once
or twice, it is obtained pure. It forms then brilliant white cry
stalline laminae, which melt to a very mobile liquid; on further
application of heat this boils readily, and sublimes in delicate
snow-white laminae in the colder part of the tube. Exposed to
the air, it fumes strongly, and readily deliquesces.       Heated in
the air it  decomposes  with the liberation of iodine. The formula

becomes almost solid without exhibiting a trace of anything cry
stalline. It dissolves in concentrated sulphuric acid in the cold,
forming a solution of a greenish-brown colour, which when
heated becomes black and disengages sulphurous acid.         It is
not much affected by nitric acid of ordinary strength even on
boiling, but fuming nitric acid dissolves it readily, even in the
 cold, giving a dark reddish-yellow solution, which on the addi
tion of water deposits orange-coloured flocks. If the solution in
fuming nitric acid be boiled, it gives off nitrous acid, and on eva
 poration it leaves a reddish-yellow resinous mass, the greatest
 part of which, on being treated with boiling water, remains un
 dissolved in the shape of a yellowish-red resin, resembling indi
fulvine itself in appearance, but differing from it in being easily
soluble in alkaline liquids, and soluble with difficulty in boiling
alcohol. The watery liquid filtered from this resin yields on
evaporation white needle-shaped crystals, which are not oxalic
acid.    A boiling solution of bichromate of potash to which sul
phuric acid is added decomposes indifulvine very slowly, the
solution becoming green from the reduction of the chromic acid.
Chlorine converts indifulvine, when suspended in water, into a
body which does not much differ from it in appearance, but is
soluble in alkalies. Indifulvine is not precipitated from            alco         its

   For the sake of distinction think it may be of advantage to
apply to the first of these modifications of indifulvine the term
a-indifulvine, and to the second that of b-indifulvine. The man

The insoluble residue, consisting of indihumine, was analysed,
when the following numbers were obtained:—
  0.3065 grm., dried at 100° C., gave 0.7065 grim. carbonic
acid and 0-1300 water.
  0.3285 grim. gave 0.3765 grm. chloride of platinum and am

phurous acid. A boiling solution of bichromate of potash, to
which sulphuric acid is added, dissolves and decomposes it
rapidly with an evolution of gas, the chromic acid being reduced
to oxide of chromium.           On being treated with boiling dilute
nitric  acid,  indifuscine is decomposed with a disengagement of
nitrous acid, giving a yellow liquid, which on evaporation yields
crystals of oxalic acid.       The mother-liquor of these crystals, on
being neutralized with carbonate of potash and evaporated, gives
brownish-yellow crystals, which detonate when heated, and give
with acetate of lead, nitrate of silver, and sulphate of iron, reac
tions showing them to consist of picrate of potash. When finely
powdered indifuscine is suspended in water and subjected to the
action of chlorine, it is converted into a yellow flocculent sub
stance containing chlorine, which is insoluble in boiling water,
but dissolves easily in boiling alcohol, forming a brown solution,
which on spontaneous evaporation leaves a light brown amor
phous residue.
    When the indican submitted to decomposition with acids has
not been purified, the quantity of indifuscine formed far exceeds
that of the other products of decomposition, which, with the
 exception of indigo-blue, are always produced in comparatively
 small quantities.      In this case a great part of the indifuscine
 owes    its
           origin       to

    In the first part of this paper have given for indiretine the
formula C*H*NO18.              The analyses which    I have made with
fresh  preparations    of this body lead to the formula   C*H"   NO”,
as will be seen from the following details.
    I. 0.3955 grim., dried at 100° C. and burnt with oxide of cop
per and chlorate of potash, gave 0.9565 grim. carbonic acid and
0-1995 Water.
    0-5215 grim., burnt with soda-lime, gave 0-1400 grm. platinum.
    II. 0.4250 grm. of the same preparation, heated to 190° C.
and then kept for several hours at 100° C., gave 1-0300 grn.
carbonic acid and 0.2090 water.
    0.5065 grim. gave 0.1370 grm, platinum.
    III.  04210 grim. of a different preparation gave 1-0200 grm.
carbonic acid and 0.2140 water.
    The theoretical composition, as compared with that derived
from these numbers, is as follows:—

    I think it is improbable     that the discrepancy between the two
formulae, which differ from one another merely by 3HO, pro
 ceeds from any impurity in either case, or that it is to be attri
buted to the substance having been more carefully dried at one
time than at another. Indiretine appears to furnish one of those
instances, of which       I have met with several during the investiga
tion of this    series,  of a body exhibiting when prepared on dif
ferent   occasions,  the same properties, but having at one time a
composition differing by the elements of water from that which
it has at others.
    Having described the several products of decomposition formed
by the action of acids on indican, which are insoluble in water,
 I shall now proceed      to the consideration of those which are solu
ble in water.                                    I
                   In order to obtain these, found it advisable to
 employ sulphuric acid for the decomposition of the indican.

was separated by filtration; the sulphuric acid was removed by

then mixed with about twice its volume                  aether,   which imme      of

muriatic acid left on evaporation a crystalline residue.             It was
easily soluble in caustic soda, and the solution evolved no am
monia on being boiled, but when the dry substance was heated
with soda-lime, it gave off a strong smell of ammonia accom
panied by a peculiar penetrating odour. The watery solution
was neutral to test-paper, and had no perceptible taste.             When
mixed with      freshly precipitated   oxide of  copper    and  boiled, the
watery    solution became sky-blue; the filtered liquid gave no
precipitate with caustic soda, and on being evaporated left a
residue consisting of bright blue crystals. The watery solution
gave no precipitate with nitrate of silver, but on the addition of
a little ammonia, there was deposited almost immediately a quan
tity of small crystalline scales, which blackened slightly on expo
sure to the light, and were not easily soluble in an excess of
ammonia.        The watery solution gave no precipitate with acetate
of lead, and even on adding ammonia there was only a slight
precipitate; but on allowing the ammoniacal liquid to stand for
some hours, there was formed a crystalline mass of a pearly lustre,
consisting of needles arranged in star-shaped masses.
   The analysis of the substance gave the following results:—
   0.3430 grm., dried at 100°C. and burnt with chromate of lead,
gave 0.6820 grm. carbonic acid and 0.3125 water.

excite surprise at the present time, when so many different

   These crystals, which are imbedded in syenite, are associated
with minute crystals of Allanite of the form M T n, and small
specks of Gadolinite (?).
   The largest crystal of sphene found was but the third of an
inch in length; at some places, however, they occur in such quan
tity as to become quite a constituent of the rock, and to commu
nicate to it their characteristic hair-brown colour.

 BBGNNº Mr. Galloway
                     in the study of chemistry are much indebted to
                         for the great pains he has taken, in the book
before us and in his “First Step in Chemistry,’ to remove from the
path of the student the many difficulties and obstacles which hinder
 his early progress.    These difficulties, so puzzling and discouraging
 to the pupil, are too often forgotten or neglected by the compi
lers of such text-books; but our author has evidently devoted con
 siderable and especial attention to them, and we think he has been
 successful in most materially facilitating the acquisition
                                                         -
                                                                of sound
knowledge in the first stages of chemical study.
    The book is written in a very clear and intelligible style; in fact
 the author has perhaps sometimes committed the pardonable fault of
repetition, in order to avoid any possible ambiguity.        The second
edition has also been considerably improved and enlarged, several
 new and useful chapters having been added. A most important
feature of the system pursued consists in contrasting the chief pro
perties of the individual members of each group of substances, by
placing a description of these properties in parallel columns; thus
the student, after experimentally demonstrating their behaviour with
 reagents, is enabled to devise for himself methods for the separation
and individual detection of the different members of the group before
him.     We cannot but greatly admire this plan of teaching chemical
analysis, which, whilst it calls into exercise the powers of observa
tion, at the same time appeals to the judgement and reasoning facul
ties of the experimenter.       The adoption of methods of study like
 this, cannot fail still further to increase the value of the natural
sciences as instruments of intellectual discipline.        We can con
fidently recommend Mr. Galloway's work as a valuable text-book,
both to the regular laboratory student, and to the beginner who has
not the advantage of professional instruction.

                         towards the History of Thialdine.”    By A. W.
Hofmann,      LL.D., F.R.S.
    Researches into the behaviour of several organic bases with       bi
sulphide of carbon, which I intend to lay before the Society at a
later period, have led to some experiments with thialdine, the
results of which I may be allowed briefly to state, since they are
but loosely connected with the principal object of the inquiry.

     It appeared           of interest to gain some insight into the constitution
of thialdine, which is the prototype of an important class of alka
loids containing sulphur.    To what group of bases does this body
belong? Is it a primary, a secondary, or a tertiary base? The favourite
method of questioning bases by means of iodide of methyle pro
mised to furnish some elucidation of this subject.
   Thialdine, dissolved in iodide of methyle, to which conveniently
its own bulk of ether has been added, furnishes after twelve hours a
solid crystalline mass, which may be readily freed from adhering
thialdine by washing with ether and recrystallizing from alcohol.
   The crystalline compound produced in this manner is the iodide
of a methylated base, generated, as proved by analysis, by the union
                                                                  -

experiments are required.
   Liebig and Wöhler, in their memoir on thialdine, state that the
whole of the nitrogen of this base is eliminated in the form of
ammonia, if the compound be decomposed by nitrate of silver.
This deportment appeared to furnish an easy mode of controlling
the formula of methylthialdine; after the decomposition of this body
by nitrate of silver,      I expected to find the whole of the nitrogen in
the  residuary    liquid   in the form of methylamine.           On performing
the  experiment,      it was found that the      liquid  contained considerable
quantities of ammonia, but together with the latter alkali a fixed
base.    This unexpected deportment reminded me of experiments
published several years ago *, on the action of oxide of silver on
thialdine, which is said to be thus converted into leucine.                 The
question presented itself, were the phenomena observed in the pre
sent case of an analogous character? had the above experiment given
rise to the formation of methylated leucine?
   Experiment proved that the decomposition of iodide of methyl
thialdine by oxide of silver gives rise to the formation of ammonia

decomposition of iodide of methylthialdine induced me to repeat the

myself, by a series of careful experiments, that this assertion is with
out the slightest foundation.
   Thialdine, when treated with oxide of silver, as might have been
expected, undergoes the same decomposition which Liebig and
Wöhler had effected by means of nitrate of silver.       It furnishes in
this process aldehyde, acetic acid, and ammonia, but no leucine.
   In conclusion, a remark which refers to a question connected with
this alleged formation of leucine:–Soon after the statement regard
ing this subject had been made, Wagner * observed that the action of
bisulphide of carbon upon amylamine gives rise to the formation
of a crystalline compound. This compound was not analysed, but
Wagner suggested that possibly it might be thialdine,

                              Amylamine.                Thialdine.
and      that in   case   this assumption proved to           be correct, the action
of bisulphide of carbon upon the homologues of ammonia might
lead to the artificial formation, not only of leucine, but of glycocine,
alanine, &c.
   During my experiments on the deportment of bisulphide of
carbon with organic bases,                 I
                                  have also had occasion to study the
compound of amylamine with bisulphide of carbon.              It is onl
necessary superficially to compare this substance with thialdine,
in order to perceive at once that they are two absolutely different
compounds; and if there is still a chance of producing leucine from
amylamine, it is because the action of bisulphide of carbon does
not give rise to the formation of thialdine.

  The facility with which the phosphorus-bases can    obtained                                be                  by

                     of                     phosphorus, has induced of
me     study the action
      to                   this       upon the terchlorides
                                         of                   arsenic                                of

and antimony.     I have found that triethylarsine and triethylstibine,
hitherto obtainable only with difficulty, by submitting the alloys of
potassium with arsenic and antimony to the action of iodide of ethyle,
may be procured by this process as readily and as abundantly as the
phosphorus-bases.
   In attempting to identify the substances obtained by the new pro
cess with those prepared by the old one, by the analysis of platinum
and gold-salts, I have been led to the discovery of a series of com
                                                                   -
pounds of remarkable beauty.
   Since the study of these bodies, and especially of their derivatives,
which are particularly numerous and interesting, will involve con
siderable time,  I beg leave to submit to the Royal Society, before
the session closes, a brief sketch of those substances, the composition
          I
of which have already established by analysis.
   On adding a solution of bichloride of platinum to an alcoholic
solution of triethylphosphine, of triethylarsine or triethylstibine as
long as the colour of the platinum solution entirely disappears, the
liquid deposits after a few moments magnificent slightly yellow or
colourless crystals.   The three salts thus formed may be considered
as the chlorides of three compound ammoniums containing platinum
and ethyle, united respectively with phosphorus, arsenic and anti
mony.     They have the following composition:—
                                                    Pt
              Chloride of Platophosphethylium...;        PCl.

  On substituting    for the bichloride of platinum a solution of ter
chloride of   gold, perfectly  similar phenomena present themselves.
The    gold solution is entirely  decolorized, and the colourless liquids
deposit three gold compounds, which, remarkably enough, are of a
dazzling white colour and silvery lustre.
   Analysis has proved these salts to correspond to the platinum
salts just mentioned, the platinum being replaced by an equivalent
quantity of gold.
  The formulae of these substances are—

 The analysis of the combustible gas proved that      I vol. consumed
3.43 vols. oxygen, and generated l'95 vol. carbonic acid; numbers
almost identical with those yielded by hydride of ethyle, with which
the gas is also identical in specific gravity. These results prove that

magnifying powers, and distinguished from each other                 various                          by
definite peculiarities.
   From these and other facts, the following conclusions were de
duced:—
     1.Crystals containing only cavities with water were formed from
solution.
     2.Crystals containing only stone-     glass-cavities were formedor
from    state
          a      igneous fusion.
                     of
     3.Crystals containing both water- and stone-         glass-cavities                    or

    Mr. Sorby   on the   Microscopical Structure of Crystals.                 153
were formed, under great pressure, by the combined influence of
highly heated water and melted rock.
   4. That the relative amount of water present in the cavities may,
in some cases, be employed to deduce the temperature at which the
crystals were formed, since the accompanying vacuity is due to the
contraction of the fluid on cooling.
   5. Crystals containing only empty cavities were formed by sub
limation, unless the cavities are fluid-cavities that have lost their
fluid, or are bubbles of gas given off from a substance which was
fused.
   6. Crystals containing few cavities were formed slowly, in com
parison with those of the same material that contain many.
   7. Crystals that contain no cavities were formed very slowly, or by
the cooling from fusion of a pure, homogeneous substance.
   Applying these general principles to the study of natural crystal
line minerals and rocks, it was shown that the fluid-cavities in rock
salt,   in the calcareous spar of modern tufaceous deposits, of veins,
and of ordinary limestone,—and        in the gypsum of gypseous marls,
indicate that these minerals were formed by deposition from solution
in water at a temperature not materially different from the ordinary.
The same conclusions apply to a number of other minerals in veins
in various rocks, and to many zeolites. The constituent minerals of
mica-schist and the associated rocks contain many fluid-cavities, in
dicating that they were metamorphosed by the action of heated
 water, and not by mere dry heat and partial fusion.
    The structure of the minerals in erupted lava proves that they
 were deposited from a mass in the state of igneous fusion, like the
 crystals in the slags of furnaces; but, in some of those found in
 blocks ejected from volcanos (for example, in nepheline and meionite),
 there are, besides stone- and glass-cavities, many containing water,
 the relative amount of which indicates that they were formed, under
 great pressure, at a dull red heat, when both liquid water and melted
 rock were present. The fluid-cavities in these aqueo-igneous minerals
 very generally contain minute crystals, as if they had been deposited
 on cooling from solution in the highly heated water. The minerals
 in trappean rocks have also such a structure as proves them to be of
 genuine igneous origin, but they have been much altered by the sub
 sequent action of water, and many minerals formed in the minute
 cavities by deposition from solution in water.
    The quartz of quartz-veins has a structure proving that it has been
 rapidly deposited from solution in water; and in some instances the
 relative amount of water in the fluid-cavities indicates that the heat
 was considerable.       In one good case the temperature thus deduced
 was 165° C.     (329°F.);    and apparently, when the heat was still
 greater, mica and tinstone were deposited, and in some cases pro
                                                                   of of by
 bably even felspar. There       is,then,   ashas been argued     M. Elie
  de  Beaumont, a   gradual passage  from  quartz-veins  tothose   granite,
  and     granite
         to        itself; and there   is   no
                                             such distinct line    division
  between them    as  might be  expected    one was deposit from water,

 fusion as the slags of our furnaces or the erupted lavas. When the
 constituent minerals of solid granite, far from contact with the stra
 tified rocks, are examined, it is seen that they also contain fluid
 cavities.     This is especially the case with the quartz of coarse
 grained, highly quartzose granites, in which there are so many, that
 the proportion of a thousand millions in a cubic inch is not at             un                                  all
 usual; and the enclosed water constitutes from one               two per cent.                  to

 the felspar and quartz contain excellent stone-cavities, precisely ana
 logous       those to  the crystals
                                 in        slag,     erupted lavas; and thus
                                                              of             or

  of  those minerals formed underaqueo-igneous conditions             the blocks                       in
 which are ejected from modern volcanos; and the very common
 occurrence        minute crystals inside the fluid-cavities still further
                          of
 strengthens this analogy.
     The conclusion      which these facts appear
                                     to                    lead,   that granite     to            is

palaeozoic rocks of the Franco-Belgian area beneath portions of the
cretaceous deposits of the South-east of England.     Mr. Austen con
siders that this palaeozoic ridge may be partly composed of some of the
coal-bearing strata, and that these may be covered in some parts of the
South-east of England by little more than the cretaceous deposits; the
Lower Greensand having been probably at some points the littoral or
shoal deposits of the chalk-sea along this old ridge.   Mr. Prestwich
expressed his belief that the usual uniform extension of the Lower
Greensand was certainly interrupted beneath London, and therefore
presented a difficulty in the way of obtaining everywhere the supply of
water from this formation which he had once anticipated; still how
ever he thought the interruption in the deposit was but local, as the
outcrop of the Lower Greensand to the north, west, and south of
London was very uniform in         features. its

series lie towards the west; that of the Lower Greensand is seen
in the Farringdon Gravels; that of the Gault in the Halden Sands.
The Chalk proper filled up the deeper and subsiding sea-bed at a
period synchronous with the deposition of some of these littoral
beds, and at the time of the greatest extension of the area of the
Cretaceous Ocean, the littoral beds of which are recognizable in
the South of Norway and Sweden, in Westphalia and Rhenish
Prussia, &c., and the area of which probably may be regarded as
reaching from the Rocky Mountains at the head of the Missouri,
over Texas, Florida, the eastern side of the Alleghanies, the West
Indies, and a broad belt of the Atlantic, to North Africa, Central and
Northern Europe, with bold extensions into Western, Central, and
even Eastern Asia. Central Europe then presented the aspect of

quite a correct statement.                He says that           if the
                                                         large mirrors are
kept parallel to the small              ones,
                                      the                   “right” or
                                                          natural relations
may be maintained between the dimensions of the object in the di
rection of the depth of the field of view and those on the surface.
Now this is not possible with any arrangement of the mirrors; for
the two retinal images being formed by visual rays which enter the
instrument at points considerably wider apart than the distance
between the eyes, must always have their difference so exaggerated
as to produce an exaggerated relief.        It is true that when, in uni
ting the two images, the optic axes are made to converge to a
distance considerably nearer than the object, the binocular image
appears reduced in size; but this kind of reduction does not restore
the natural relation between the two dimensions, although an optical
reduction produced by concave glasses does. Perhaps it is the use
of concave glasses in his instrument that has led the Professor into
this mistake.     But the fact             is,
                                    that the reduction        size produced          in

  ON   THE RELATIONS EXISTING BETWEEN CERTAIN GROUPS OF
      CRYSTALLINE FORMS BELONGING TO DIFFERENT SYSTEMS.
                       BY C. MARIGNAC.
  It has long since been remarked that    each system the different
                                                                in
forms are not distributed by chance.   They seem,    the contrary,                   on
to    be
      combined      such  way
                          in    a            as   to
                                   form certain number     groups,
                                                                a                          of

 outside of which there are only a small number of forms pretty distant
 from one another, and which will perhaps some day become types of
 new genera.
     It would be interesting to discover the common cause which
 determines the analogy of form in the different substances of the
 same group.       If it may be explained sometimes with Mitscherlich,
 by analogy of atomic constitution, and sometimes also perhaps by a
 relation between the atomic volumes, most frequently the cause of
                                                                           -
 this analogy cannot be suspected.
    The rhombohedric system contains one of these groups which is
very remarkable.         Bromate of potash, besides the cubic form of
 which M. Rammelsberg has recently expressed some doubts, cry
 tallizes in rhombohedra of 86° 18'. This form causes it to enter
 into a very numerous group, including very various simple and com
pound bodies, which, however, nearly all present a common and
 curious character, namely that by their nature, or by the analogy
of their constitution with that of other compounds, one would be
led to suppose that they had a cubic crystallization, but for the
power of determining their forms.
    The following are the bodies composing this group :—
    Arsenic, tellurium, antimony, bismuth: their quality of simple
bodies, and, especially as regards two of them, of simple metals,
rendered it probable that they would have a form belonging to the
regular system;
    Peroxide of iron, oxide of chrome, alumina and glucina, corre
sponding in constitution with oxide of antimony and arsenious acid;
    Bromate of potash; the corresponding iodate is cubic.
    The preceding substances particularly affect rhombohedric forms,
and are    all
             derived from rhombohedra             which the angle
                                                              of       comprised      is
                    and 87°4'. The following crystallize rather              hexa

gonal forms, but are naturally derived from rhombohedra                      which
the angle would           be
                         between 83° and 86°:

                           not clearly perceive similar relations, although
it   isnot impossible that they may exist.            These are,

    At the first glance this curious relation might seem               explained to   be
by the ordinary theory           isomorphism,

tioned being forms very nearly allied               the cube, and consequently

   But if this were the cause which unites all these substances in
this group, their forms ought to arrange themselves uniformly around
that of the cube, regarded as a rhombohedron of 90°. This is not
the case. The angle of the primitive rhombohedron for           these                                   all
twenty-six bodies, varies between 83° and 87°40';       average value                       its

is about 85° 30'.                         between the most extended
limits comprising the angle       90°, there are only ten substances,
amongst which only one, the chloroplatinate        aethylamine,   re              of                         is
lated     in    its   nature    to   the compounds belonging                         to   the cubic system.
The author therefore considers that this hypothesis must                                                be   aban
doned, but does not propose another.

minerals crystallizing      the form  in  epidote consists of the molecule                     of
(RO,       R2
          09)* SiO2.     This fundamental molecule may combine with
various quantities      diversely composed accessory molecules without

injury     to    its

  The general formula                     of   the epidotes              the restricted sense           is   there

fore   = (RO, R2 O3)2SiO3 + nBO, HO,               and that of the orthites
 =(RO, R2 O3)2SiO2+n HO.
    In all epidotes, properly so called, therefore, the sum of the atoms
of  oxygen   of (RO-H R* O°) must be equal to the sum of the atoms of
oxygen of (SiO2+ HO); in all orthites, on the contrary, the sum of
the atoms of oxygen of (RO--R* O”) will be equal to the atoms of
oxygen of SiO2, to which various quantities of water may then be
added.
    2. The vesuvians were formerly regarded as minerals possessing a
 similar constitution to the garnets, the proportions of oxygen in
RO : R* O3 : SiO2 being in the relation of 1 : 1 : 2. The author, how
ever, found another proportion, which has been confirmed by Scherer
and Rammelsberg.
    Rammelsberg supposes that the vesuvians are constituted accord
ing to the proportions 3(RO)3 SiO3 + 2R* O3SiO3; Scherer, on the
contrary, gives them the constitution (RO)3 (SiO3)*.
    Here also the author supposes that the bases RO and R2 O2 are
mutually displaced. Their fundamental molecule must be expressed,
just like that of the epidotes and garnets, by (RO, R2 O9)*, SiO4.
This fundamental molecule in the vesuvians also includes small and
variable quantities of water.           In the vesuvians, therefore, the sum
 of the atoms of     oxygen    of RO--R2 O3 will be equal to the number
 of atoms of    oxygen    of the silicic acid combined therewith, to which
 also various    quantities   of water may be added. The general formula
 of the vesuvians would consequently be (RO, R* O3)SiO2+n]HO.
    3. The garnets contain RO, R2 O9 and SiO2, usually in a propor
 tion in which the oxygen corresponds with the numbers 1 : 1 : 2.
 In the garnets, indeed, the proportion of oxygen of RO : R* 03: SiO2
 is subject to variation.       In all cases, however, the sum of the atoms
 of  oxygen     of RO+R*O3 is equal to the atoms of oxygen of SiO2.
 The  garnets    consequently have the same fundamental molecule as
 the epidotes and vesuvians, namely (RO, R2 O3) SiO2, and are there
 fore, as they also contain the same chemical constituents as those
 minerals, polymorphic with them. In individual cases the variations
of RO : R* Oº go so far that Rº O° is completely displaced. The
 minerals which, according to the author, belong here are the fol

1.         ETus consider a free body of any form whatever, and
           let us suppose it to receive a sudden impulse in virtue
of the action of a single force P, the direction of which passes
at an arbitrary distance from         centre    gravity    its

I shall call the centre             of
                          percussion.
     2. The  body  which has received this impulse being left                                              to
itself,    we consider the individual forces with which its several
          if
molecules are animated       any period whatever during
                                           at               motion,                         its
we shall find that              all
                         these forces are reducible     single one,                 to  a
identical with the original impulse      which set the body  P mo                                 in
tion. This conclusion evidently results from the general prin
ciple     of
          the conservation                  of
                              forces and moments.

which gives the distance of the point O from the centre of gra
vity G, shows that the position of the spontaneous centre depends
neither upon the mass M of the body, nor upon the intensity P
of the impulse applied at the centre of percussion C, but solely
upon the distance h between this point C and the centre of gra
vity G. The product ah having always the same value, it follows
that a increases in the same proportion as h decreases; thus the
nearer the centre of percussion approaches the centre of gravity,
the more the spontaneous centre on the other side recedes from
the same, and vice versd.
   9. If we suppose h–0, we find a-oo. Hence one might say
that when the centre of percussion coincides with the centre of
gravity, the spontaneous centre is infinitely distant: but, strictly
speaking, there is then no spontaneous centre of rotation; for,
since the body, in this case, receives a shock at

     If we
         wish to consider the distance X between the point T and
the spontaneous centre O, then since this distance is a +a, the
above equation gives

whence results the following theorem:—
   “The distance X of the centre of maximum percussion from
the spontaneous centre O of rotation of the body is the geome
trical mean between the distances of the centre of gravity, and
of the ordinary centre of percussion from the same point Q.”
   20. We may here observe that this theorem is susceptible of
another enunciation.     For since MK” represents the moment of
inertia of the body  with respect to the principal axis which passes
through         its    gravity, and since represents the distance
                                  O of
             centre                                                       G,a

   31. Let us suppose that the body really comes into collision
with an obstacle or fixed point C" at the distance a from the
centre of gravity G; the component Q will be destroyed, and
the body will remain under the sole influence of the component
p applied at O'. This force p will act upon the body just as if
the latter were free; for the point C', where the obstacle was
presented,   being the spontaneous centre with respect to the point
O', considered as a centre of percussion, it is evident that the
obstacle cannot in any way alter the effect of the force p.
   Thus the body which, before collision, was animated by the
force P applied at the distance h from the centre of gravity G,
will, after the shock, move under the influence of a new force,

treated   with alcohol, in which a great part dissolves, and the
alcoholic solution is then mixed with twice its volume of aether,
which causes a milkiness and produces a syrupy deposit con
sisting chiefly of indiglucine.     The liquid, after it has become
clear, is evaporated spontaneously, when it leaves a yellow trans
parent glutinous residue, having a bitter taste, which cannot be
distinguished in outward appearance from indican itself. This
residue, when dissolved in water and treated with acid, still gives

indirubine in a state of tolerable purity.
   On attempting, however, to prepare this substance on a some
what larger scale, I found it difficult to arrest the process at this
stage.    As soon as the solution ceased to give indigo-blue with
acids, it began to yield with acids a mixture of indirubine and
indiretine, and at length it gave indiretine only, after which no
further change took place.       By allowing a watery solution of                                   in

   In the first part of this paper I gave an analysis of the lead
compound of a substance having the formula C40H86 NO27, which
differed therefore in composition from this merely by containing
the elements of 3 equivalents more of water.         As it was impos.
sible to  analyse these substances in an uncombined state, there
were no means of ascertaining whether in that state they had
the same composition, as was most probably the case.
   Indicanine is formed from indican simply by the latter taking
up water and losing 1 equivalent of indiglucine, as will be seen
from the following equation:—
1 eq. Indican   C*H*
                        sº {º}:  -                   leq.   Indicamine.

                C52 H33 NO36           C52H33 NO36
   The indiglucine formed in the process is contained in the
brown syrupy deposit which falls on adding aether to the alco
holic solution of the indicamine.      Some of this deposit, after the
liquid had been poured off, was dissolved again in alcohol; the
solution was mixed with an excess of alcoholic solution of acetate
of lead, which produced      a brown glutinous precipitate, and to
the filtered liquid was added an excess of ammonia, which gave
a bulky sulphur-yellow precipitate. This precipitate was col
lected on a filter, washed with water, and decomposed with sul
phuretted hydrogen, and the filtered liquid was agitated with

animal charcoal until it had lost the yellowish tint which it pos
sessed at first. The liquid having been again filtered was mixed
with acetate of lead and ammonia, which produced a milk-white
precipitate. This precipitate, after being filtered off, was redis
solved in a mixture of alcohol and acetic acid, and by the addition
of a small quantity of ammonia a white precipitate was again
produced, which was filtered                         off
                                  and washed with alcohol.

 with sulphuric acid.       If    it be now evaporated in the same appa
 ratus as that used for          evaporation      of solutions of indican, it
 leaves a brown syrup, a great part of which dissolves in alcohol.
 On adding aether to the alcoholic solution, a syrupy deposit of
 indiglucine is produced, followed by the separation of crystals of
 leucine.    If  the liquid be filtered and evaporated, it leaves a
 brown    glutinous residue, having the properties of indicanine.
 The lead compound, which was obtained in the form of a sulphur
 yellow precipitate by adding acetate of lead to the alcoholic solu

 mitted to analysis, when it gave the following results:—

    When a watery solution of indican or indicanine is evaporated
in contact with the air, either spontaneously or with the assist
ance of heat, a portion of it is always converted into a substance
which is insoluble not only in aether but also in alcohol. That
the formation of this substance is due to the action of oxygen
on indicanine is proved by analysis. . Its formation, moreover,
is promoted by heating the solution of indicanine with peroxide
of lead, the filtered liquid, after the dissolved lead has been

188           Dr. Schunck     on the Formation   of Indigo-blue,
removed  with sulphuretted hydrogen, leaving on evaporation a
residue which is insoluble in alcohol. It differs, however, in
composition, according as the solution of indican has been eva
porated spontaneously or with the assistance of heat. The body
which is formed when a watery solution of indican is sponta
neously evaporated in contact with the air,        I
                                              propose to call—
                               Ovindicanine.
   So much of this body is produced during the preparation of
indican, that        I
                  found it unnecessary to prepare it purposely.
When the residue left after the evaporation of the watery solu
tion of indican by means of a current of air, as described above,
is treated with cold alcohol, the greatest part of the oxindica
nine formed during the process remains undissolved. It may
be purified simply by dissolving it in a little water and precipi
tating again with a large quantity of alcohol. Its appearance is
that of a brown glutinous substance, which on being left to stand
over sulphuric acid becomes almost dry, and assumes the appear
ance of gum.      It is insoluble in absolute alcohol, and only
slightly soluble in dilute alcohol. When heated on platinum it
swells up very much and burns, leaving a considerable carbon
aceous residue.    It yields, when heated in a tube, strong-smell
ing fumes, but only a slight trace of crystalline sublimate.       Its
taste is nauseous, but not bitter.    Its watery solution gives with
acetate of lead a copious, dirty-yellow precipitate, and the filtered
liquid gives a pale, primrose-yellow precipitate on the addition
of ammonia, or of a large excess of alcohol. When the watery
solution is mixed with sulphuric acid and boiled, it slowly de
posits brown flocks, which have the properties of indifuscine,
while the liquid contains indiglucine.      For the purpose of de
termining      its
               composition    employed the lead compound, pre

   The third of these laws does not hold, with respect either to
the solar- or to the lunar-diurnal variation. Thus, in the solar
diurnal variation of the declination, the changes of position of
the magnet throughout the night are comparatively small, and
do not correspond, with change of sign only (as required by the
foregoing law), to those which take place at the homonymous
hours of the day. The phaenomena of the lunar-diurnal varia
tion are even more opposed to the foregoing law, the variation
having two maxima and two minima of nearly equal magnitude
in the twenty-four lunar hours, and        values   homonymous      its              at
hours having for the most part the same sign.     Hence the phae

   0.341 grim., dried in vacuo, was kept for some time at 140°C.,

zinc thus treated had lost 0.059        grim.     in  weight,  and was partly

 syrup without yielding crystals.           When evaporated to dryness
in vacuo, a mass, consisting evidently of two substances, was

                  Glycerate    of Lead,      C*H*PbO",

and warm solution of glyceric acid pure oxide of lead is gradually
added in small portions, till the acid reaction of the liquid is
nearly destroyed, and the filtered solution concentrated by eva
poration on the water-bath.         If  it be now allowed to stand in a
cold place for some time, a hard crystalline crust of the above
substance is formed on the sides of the evaporating basin.               If the
glyceric acid employed be too concentrated, the lead compound
separates immediately after the addition of the oxide, as a white
crystalline powder.
   Glycerate of lead dissolves with difficulty in cold, but pretty
easily in hot water: the solution does not alter blue litmus

XXVII.   On the Law of Bode, with a remarkable coincidence in
i referenceto the Satellite System of Jupiter; and on the Rota
  tion of a Heavenly Body.       By Mr. SEPTIMUs TEBAY, B.A.,
  Head Master of Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School, Rivington,
  Lancashire”.
                                    planets from the sun were not
THEknown
    actual distances of the
          to the ancients, but        their relative distances were
known with considerable accuracy.        It was from the relative
distances that Kepler established his third law. This distin
guished geometer had noticed the regular increase in the di
stances of the planets proceeding outwards from the sun, and
predicted from analogy that a planet would hereafter be disco
vered in the enormous space between the orbits of Mars and
Jupiter, no planet at that time being known to occupy this
interval.
   The discovery of Uranus by Sir William Herschel in 1781,
gave additional weight to the prediction of Kepler; the distance
of Uranus being nearly double the distance of Saturn from the
sun. The remarkable law of Bode, which was about this time
discovered, caused astronomers to scrutinize more minutely the
space between Mars and Jupiter, in hopes of detecting the un
known world which had hitherto eluded observation; and early
in the present century four small planets were actually disco
vered, thus completing the chain of interplanetary spaces.        At
the present time not fewer than fifty-one of these small planets,
or asteroids, have been observed.    They are supposed by many
persons to be the fragments of a large planet, which from some
unknown cause has burst. Their mean distances are            all
                                                              nearly
equal, and (with sufficient accuracy) the same          as
                                                       that pointed
out   by Bode's law.   By this law,   ifthe mean distance          of

ant attraction does not in general pass through the centre of
gravity of the attracted body, but produces an angular accelera

 perature, the distance of the points above the straight line
 measured in the vertical is equal to 0.51 at 50°, to 0.48 at 60°,
 to 0.42 at 70°, &c. It is hardly possible to recognize this de
 flection on the chart, however large the scale employed, but it
 may be made quite apparent to the eye by projecting the points
 orthographically with the distances extremely foreshortened in
 the direction of the gradient.
    The points computed from M. Regnault’s observations with
 temperatures uncorrected being laid down as before described on
 a plane surface; suppose we look along the line of these points
 with the eye close to the plane on which they are marked, we
 shall see inequalities of position under a highly exaggerated
 aspect, in consequence of the extreme foreshortening of the lon
 gitudinal intervals between them.      Suppose the same observa
 tions with M. Regnault’s temperatures corrected by the formula
 are also projected in this way; we obtain the means of effectively
 comparing their positions, and thus of testing the value of the
 assumptions made with respect to the correction of the thermo
 meter and the gradient of density.

Sn intersects NB in NS which is the point corresponding to .
M. Regnault's observations at 60°, and So intersects CO in O,

   § 6. Thus M N OPQRS represent M. Regnault's observa
tions with temperatures uncorrected, and A B C D EFS the
same with temperatures    corrected by the formula.  If this latter
coincided with the  straight  line AS, we should have the desired
proof at once of the thermometric formula, of the law of density,
and of the extreme accuracy of M. Regnault’s observations.
   With reference to the slight apparent deviation, we must keep
in view that the tensions employed are, strictly speaking, not
those actually observed, but those given in the Table at the end
of M. Regnault's memoir computed from the empirical formula,
log e=a+ ba’—c6', the constants of which were determined from
the graphically equalized observations at 0°, 25°, 50°, 75°, and
 100°. There is abundant evidence in the memoir of the remark
able efficiency        of this formula to represent the observations within
their limits of error.     It does not profess to represent the true
line, but it must coincide with it at the five points, and at inter
mediate temperatures cannot be more than a small fraction of a
degree removed from                it.

218             Mr.   J. J. Waterston              on a Difference       in the march
between         50° and 100°.Otherwise M. Regnault's graphical
curve of            observations may thus far be removed from
             equalized
perfect accuracy, or it may be caused by the deviation from
Mariotte’s law affecting the air-thermometer. (See § 18.)
   That so small an adjustment should bring M. Regnault's
observations into perfect harmony both with the law of density
and with the thermometric formula constructed upon MM. Du
long and Petit’s data, cannot be viewed as otherwise than remark
able.    Can such a coincidence be accidental Is it illusory?
    § 8. The coefficient of the expansion of mercury in glass must
change with the quality of the glass.     M. Pierre found the co
efficient of glass between 0° and 100° to vary from 0026 to
:00.19%, which is from about ºth to Tºth the coefficient of
mercury; hence the absolute expansion of mercury in glass may
vary to the extent of gland part.
    How this may influence the comparison of thermometers, we
may perhaps most easily understand by means of a diagram
such as fig. 3.  Let A D represent the curve of expansion of
mercury in glass with the greater coefficient, and A C the same
                                             Let D C =
with the lesser coefficient.
                                                             # D B,           and   A B-100°.
If the arch A C were    flatter than the arch A D in the proportion
of B C to       BD,
                  there could be no difference between the thermo
meters, and the formula of correction for one would apply to the
other. The subtense of the arch of expansion represents the
uniform rate of the air-thermometer, and            extension beyond   its
100°   issituated below the curve        expansion, showing the air
                                                      of
thermometer           behind the mercury.
                      to   be                                     If
                                                 the absolute amount
of this difference     the two thermometers continued         have the               to

                                                        as
would      be
            the same, and thermometers       different kinds of  glass                    of
would keep pace with each other.

to air, it is easy to compute QT, and thence the asymptote tröH,-
and the equation of the curve EDP.
    The degree of curvature assigned to it by this law of tempe
rature, and the consequent aberration of the air-thermometer,
are probably in excess of the truth. The inquiry may thus serve
to mark the extreme limit of the disturbing influence of the de
viation from the primary laws of elastic fluids on the air-thermo
meter.     By an extension of the experiments with plugs, there is
little doubt that sufficient data could be obtained for computing
it   exactly between 0° and 100°.

  The denominators of these coefficients being in arithmetical pro
gression, indicates that the curve of expansion approximates closely
to a hyperbola, with the axes of coordinates parallel to the asym
ptotes.  We find, accordingly, by drawing that curve through the
coordinate points at 0°, 100°, and 200°, that it will be found also to
pass within ###th of a degree of the point at 300°.

   Sulphide of Allyle (Garlic Oil), Clo Hio S. —When iodide of
allyle is allowed to fall drop by drop into a concentrated alcoholic
solution of protosulphide of potassium, a very energetic action ensues,
the liquid becomes very hot, and an abundant crystalline deposit
takes place of iodide of potassium.        It is important that the iodide
of  allyle should only be added   gradually   to avoid spirting, by which a
part of the product would be lost. As soon as the action ceases,
the liquid is mixed with a slight excess of sulphide of potassium ;
addition of water now separates a light yellowish limpid             possess                                oil

 tity of iodide of allyl        is rapidly changed intoa mass of hydriodates
 of new compounds.          This   crystalline mass evidently contains a con
 siderable quantity of      the hydriodate of diallylamine, but to succeed
 in separating it from       this very complicated mixture would have re
 quired         more considerable quantity of substance than we had at our

   Fºylamin,       Cls His N.—The oxide of tetrallylammonium, to
which we shall  presently  allude, submitted to the action of heat, is
decomposed, with liberation of a basic oil. The perfect analogy of
the oxide of tetrallylammonium with the corresponding ethyl-com
pound, leaves no doubt respecting the nature of this basic substance.
It is obviously triallylamine. When saturated with hydrochloric
acid and mixed with bichloride of platinum, it deposits a yellow plati
num-salt, the analysis of which leads to the formula

     Owide of Tetrallylammonium, C24 Hoo NO, HO.—The chief product
 of the action of ammonia upon iodide of allyl is a magnificent crystal.
 line compound, which is deposited from the solution resulting from
 the reaction.     Iodide of allyl is rapidly attacked even by an aqueous
 solution of ammonia at the common temperature.             By a few days'
 contact, a large quantity of the iodide dissolves, and the solution be
 comes a solid mass.            If
                              no deposition of crystals take place from
the   solution, it is  only necessary   to add a concentrated solution of
caustic potassa, which causes the separation of an oily layer that
speedily solidifies.     The crystals thus formed are the iodide of te
trallylammonium, which, like the corresponding compound of the
ethyl-series, is but slightly soluble in solution of potassa.     It is ob
tained pure by exposing it to the air until the potassa is converted
into carbonate, and then recrystallizing it from absolute alcohol.
    The iodide, by treatment with oxide of silver, is immediately trans
formed into the oxide.      This forms an alkaline solution, which pos
sesses  all the properties       of
                               the oxide     tetrethylammonium.

    In order to determine whether the act of photochemical combina

 effect, for which an equivalent quantity of light is expended, or
 whether this phenomenon is dependent upon a restoration of equili
 brium effected without any corresponding equivalent loss of light, we
 must now study the phenomena occurring at the bounding surfaces,
 and in the interior of a medium exposed to the chemically active
 raWS.

 sents the fraction of the original amount of light which passes through
the medium, on the supposition that the light extinguished is pro
 portional to the original intensity of the light. The first series of
 experiments was made with the view of determining this point. The
intensity of the chemical rays proceeding from a constant source of
light was measured before and after passage through a cylinder with
plate-glass ends, filled with dry chlorine.   The amount of transmitted
light, I, was determined for various intensities of incident light,  and                                 Io,

the coefficient just found must remain unaltered when the chlorine
and hydrogen mixture is employed; if on the contrary light is not
only lost by the optical extinction, but an amount of light vanishes
proportional to the chemical action, experiment must give a larger
value for the coefficient.          .
   In order to determine this      important    question we employed an
apparatus (fully described in the Paper), by means of which we
could expose columns of the sensitive gas of various lengths, to
a constant source of light.      By determining the amount of action
effected in these columns of    varying  length, we are able to obtain the
value of the coefficient of extinction for the sensitive mixture.          A
series of experiments showed that when the light had passed through
234 millimetres of the sensitive mixture of chlorine and hydrogen at
0° and 0.76, it was reduced to                               Tºm

 nitride of the metal) takes place, indeed, with so much energy as
 to generate light and heat; and thus constitutes a genuine case of
 combustion, in which nitrogen, and not oxygen, acts as the sup
 porter.
     Although titanium is evidently present to some extent in most
 volcanos, the author is not disposed to think that it abounds suffi
 ciently to account for the large quantities of sal ammoniac that are
 known to occur; but, rather, he argues by analogy that probably
 not only titanium but other metals, such as iron, and probably even
 hydrogen, may combine directly with nitrogen in the interior of
 the globe, under conditions of great pressure and other circumstances
 likely to modify the nature of those reactions which take place
 under our eyes.                              -
     In a postscript the author adverted to the recently discovered fact,
 that boron, like titanium, has the property of combining directly
 with the nitrogen of the air, and that the compound which it forms
 with it also possesses the property of evolving ammonia under the
 influence of the alkaline hydrates.

 —1st, that both in Leinster and the County Down, the potash
 granites are more constant in composition, both mineralogical and
 chemical, than the corresponding soda-granites; 2ndly, that the
 potash-granites appear to be the standard type of granite, from
 which other granites and crystalline rocks are formed (as more or less
 overlying and superficial coatings) by the addition of bases; for
 example, the anorthite-syenite of Carlingford, the soda-granites of
 Newry, and in Leinster the outlying patches of granite between the
 main chain and the sea; 3rdly, that the potash-granite of Leinster
 is more persistent in external character than the potash-granites of
 Newry, although the latter are equally constant in chemical com
position.
     3. “On   the Classification   of the Palaeozoic Strata of the State of
 New York.”       By Dr. J. J. Bigsby, F.G.S.
     In the synoptical view of the strata and fossils of the palaeozoic
 basin of New York, read before the Society Nov. 18, 1857, the author
 desired to arrange the vast stores of information contained in the
 Official Reports of the State Geologists of New York in a methodi
 cal and accessible form; and in the present communication he treats
 succinctly of the stratigraphical arrangements hitherto used, and
 the classification now adopted by himself.        This was printed in the
 abstract of the author's former paper (Phil. Mag. Jan. 1858, p. 76):
it is but little modified from that proposed by De Verneuil; and is

mainly characterized by the union of certain sections of the series
into natural groups, A, B, C, &c., and by the establishment of a di
stinct middle Silurian stage, and an equally distant middle Devonian
stage. The lithological and palaeontological characters of the several
groups of strata are then treated of in succession; their resem
blances and differences, in these respects, being carefully noted.
From the consideration of the stratigraphical details contained in
this and the preceding paper, Dr. Bigsby deduces two main conclu
sions, namely, 1. That from the Potsdam sandstone to the summit of
the Carboniferous rocks, these strata were laid down in comparative
 quiet; subject to occasional, vertical, variable, secular oscillations,
which led to considerable superficial changes. 2. That their eleva
tion, foldings, fractures, and metamorphism were effected after the
 deposition of the whole, and in a single prolonged transaction, prin
cipally in a N.E. and N.W. direction, along the present Appalachian
ridges and their continuation from Labrador to near the Gulf of
 Mexico. The evidences on which these two propositions rest were
next detailed; and the views of the Professors Rogers on these
 points, and the author's objections, were stated in full.

   ON  THE INFLUENCE         OF MUSICAL    SOUNDS     ON  THE FLAME OF A
             JET OF COAL-GAs.       BY JOHN LECONTE, M.D.
 A     SHORT time after reading Prof. John Tyndall's excellent article
          “On the Sounds produced by the Combustion of Gases in
 Tubes”,” I happened to be one of a party of eight persons assembled
 after tea for the purpose of enjoying a private musical entertainment.
 Three instruments were employed in the performance of several of the
 grand trios of Beethoven, namely, the piano, violin, and violoncello.
 Two “fish-tail” gas-burners projected from the brick wall near the
 piano. Both of them burnt with remarkable steadiness, the windows
 being closed and the air of the room being very calm.           Nevertheless
 it was evident that one of them was under a pressure nearly suffi
 cient to make it flare.
     Soon after the music commenced, I observed that the flame of the
 last-mentioned burner exhibited pulsations in height which were
 eractly synchronous with the audible beats. This phaenomenon was
 very striking to every one in the room, and especially so when the
 strong notes of the violoncello came in. It was exceedingly inter.
 esting to observe how perfectly even the trills of this instrument
 were reflected on the sheet of flame. A deaf man might have seen
  the harmony.     As the evening advanced, and the diminished con
  sumption of gas in the ctiy increased the pressure, the phaenomenon
 became more conspicuous.         The jumping of the flame gradually        in
  creased, became somewhat irregular, and finally it began to flare
  continuously, emitting the characteristic sound indicating the escape
  of a greater amount of gas than could be properly consumed.           I then
  ascertained by experiment, that the phaenomenon did not take place
                   * Phil. Mag, S. 4, vol. xiii. p. 473, 1857.

236              Intelligence and Miscellaneous        Articles.
 unless the discharge of gas was so regulated that the flame approxi
 mated the condition of flaring.         I likewise determined by experi
 ment, that the effects were not produced by jarring or shaking the
 floor and walls of the room by means of repeated concussions.
 Hence it is obvious that the pulsations of the flame were not owing
 to indirect vibrations propagated through the medium of the walls
 of the room to the burning apparatus, but must have been produced
 by the direct influence of the aërial sonorous pulses on the burning jet.
     In the experiments of M. Schaffgotsch and Prof.          J. Tyndall, it is
 evident that “the    shaking of the  singing  flame within the glass tube,”
produced by the voice or the syrene, was a phaenomenon perfectly
analogous to what took place under my observation without the inter
vention of a tube.      In my case, the discharge of gas was so regulated
that there was a tendency in the flame to flare, or to emit a “singing
sound.”     Under these circumstances, strong acrial pulsations occur
ring at regular intervals were sufficient to develope synchronous
fluctuations in the height of the flame.           It is probable that the
effects would be more striking when the tones of the musical instru
ment are nearly in unison with the sounds which would be produced
by the flame under the slight increase in the rapidity of discharge of
gas required to manifest the phaenomenon of flaring.               This point
might be submitted to an experimental test.
     As in Prof. Tyndall’s experiments on the jet of gas burning within
a   tube, clapping of the hands, shouting, &c. were ineffectual in con
verting the “silent” into the “singing flame,” so in the case under
consideration, irregular sounds did not produce any perceptible            in
fluence.     It seems to be necessary that the impulses should accumu
late in order to exercise an appreciable effect.
     With regard to the mode in which the sounds are produced by the
combustion of gases in tubes, it is universally admitted that the ex
planation given by Prof. Faraday in 1818 is essentially correct.            It
is well known that he referred      these sounds to the successive     explo
sions produced by the periodic combination of the atmospheric oxygen
with the issuing jet of gas. While reading Prof. J. Plateau's admi
rable researches (third series) on the “Theory of the modifications
experienced by Jets of Liquid issuing from circular orifices when
exposed to the influence of Vibratory Motions*,” the idea flashed
across my mind that the phaenomenon which had fallen under my
observation was nothing more than a particular case of the effects of
sounds on all kinds of fluid jets.         Subsequent reflection has only
served to fortify this first impression.
    The beautiful investigations of Felix Savart on the influence of
sounds on jets of water, afford results presenting so many points of
analogy with their effects on the jet of burning gas, that it may be
well to inquire whether both of them may be referred to a common
cause. In order to place this in a striking light, I shall subjoin some
of the results of Savart's experiments. Vertically descending jets of
water receive the following modifications under the influence of
vibrations:—

itself               drops
           into separate    nearer the orifice than when not under the
influence of vibrations.
   2. Each of the masses, as they detach themselves from the extre
mity of the continuous part, becomes flattened alternately in a ver
tical and horizontal direction, presenting to the eye, under the influ
ence of their translatory motion, regularly disposed series of maxima
and minima of thickness, or ventral segments and nodes.
   3. The foregoing modifications become much more developed and
regular when a note, in unison with that which would be produced
by the shock of the discontinuous part of the jet against a stretched
membrane, is sounded in                   its
                                neighbourhood.    The continuous part
becomes considerably shortened, and the ventral segments are en
larged.

 1.       the Philosophical Magazine for July 1857, will be found
    IN    a paper “On the Cirrous Form of Cloud,” in which                           I
 attempted to show, from a simple experiment, that cirri are pro
 duced by the interfiltration of bodies of moist air, merely differing
 in temperature.       Simple differences of specific gravity, and
motions thence     resulting,   might, however, be said to be the actual
 cause of the cirrus.       Having since followed out the same mode
of  investigation   into more complicated and perhaps more inter
                    I
 esting cases, have now to publish the results to which                 have    I
been led concerning the cumulus, the cumulostratus, and the
nimbus or thunder-cloud.            It will be well, however, first of all,
to state    distinctly   the nature of the evidence and arguments
which   I shall adduce.

                                           take the first step to explain

momena which may be produced by the experimental arrange
ments described above, result from only two essential variable
conditions.
   1st. Original impressed momentum.
   2nd. Gravity, which is called into play whenever we use two
liquids differing, however slightly, in specific gravity, but which
does not in the least affect the internal motions                            of      a perfectly
homogeneous      fluid.
   Though we employ certain chemical salts and also liquids dif
fering in temperature, it will easily be seen, and must be borne
in mind, that these are merely devices for rendering the motions
of the liquids visible, or for altering their specific gravities.
   8. In the use of the section-glass, many curious facts have
been observed concerning the movements of jets and streams in
the interior of a body of liquid, which this is not the place to
describe, although the great variety of gracefully curved lines,
and of curious and complicated forms which are presented, give
a lively interest to the experiments.     In a few of the more di
stinct cases,    I hope      to show that they lead us to the understand
ing of analogous atmospheric movements on                 a much grander
and more important scale.
                                           Cumulus.
   9. The general nature and principles of the cumulus have
been understood for some time past; but as the explanations
which are given of it in meteorological works are, believe, more             I
or less erroneous, and always incomplete, must here state whatI
occurs to me concerning                  it,
                                before proceeding        the more com   to

   10. The pure cumulus             simple, roundish,
                                         is    a          hemispherical     or
heap  of  cloud matter, extending itself upwards from         horizontal         a
base, and appearing mysteriously suspended quite apart from                                   all

In  this pure form       occurs only during the day; and this fact

                                                  the observation

general form, and the curious internal motions which                often              it
exhibits, that    it
                  is occasioned                    by
                                       upward currents        warm and           of
moist air originating                                    of

                                           at                 obtains            as            in
every other part        the of
                             atmosphere.      Expansion    occasions the
increase    ofthe capacity for heat, and there          consequently   is                      an
absorption    ofsensible heat.     The rising air must therefore sink

 rough calculation which                  I
                               have made leads to the conclusion
 that the effect of the latent heat considerably overbalances that
 of the heavy watery particles; but from the difficulty of obtain
 ing satisfactory data as to latent and specific heats,        cannot                        I

 lowing be distinctly understood and allowed #:—

 exists to check the rising column of air, and sooner or later to
 cause it to descend below the plane of precipitation.

 contribute in some degree to produce this effect.
                                          Cumulostratus.
    17. The cumulostratus, which                       I
                                       have seen aptly described as
 the  anvil-shaped cloud, possesses a peculiar and distinctive form.
 It is a cumulus of which the higher parts or the summit extend
 horizontally into stratose projections, and is said to be the inter
 mediate or transition form between the cumulus and the nimbus
 or storm-cloud.
    18. The following are the conditions under which it was found
that a miniature cloud, bearing a striking resemblance to the
natural cumulostratus, could be produced in the section-glass
 (see figs. 3 and 4).
    Earp. 2. Place in the section-glass a stratum of water con
taining only a trace of common salt, and then gradually intro
duce below it a second stratum containing the same trace of com
mon salt, together with 2 parts in 1000 of sugar.              The latter
stratum, possessing the greatest specific gravity, will             tran                      lie

redescend, as   in the cumulus, into the lower stratum. But here
its downward motion will be again checked, so that in fact it
cannot attain equilibrium except by spreading out in the form
of a distinct layer or stratose extension intermediate to the other
two strata.    A cloud of chloride of silver is thus produced of
which two of the varieties of form are shown in figs. 3 and 4,
being drawn from photographs of the actual experiments.
   20. Assuming that the resemblance of the miniature and real
atmospheric cloud is sufficient ground, I can at once announce,
from the conditions of the experiment, that the cumulostratus is
a cumulus in which the tendency to redescend beneath the plane
of precipitation does not exist. On the contrary, the air, after
ascending and becoming cloudy, finds itself in equilibrium with
the surrounding air, and spreads out in more or less elevated and
horizontal projections.        But         I
                                       must remark, that the miniature
cloud    having    once  suggested   the conditions of the real cloud,
ceases to be the sole ground on which we accept these conditions
as true. The mind having once received a clear and salient idea
as to a probable cause of the cumulostratus, will apply it to every
 instance of that cloud which meets the eye in nature. This com
parison is the test of the theory, and must be the main ground
on which my readers may judge of the truth of my conclusions.
    21. Having established the simple dynamical conditions of
 the cumulostratus, it yet remains, as before explained, to trans
 late these conditions, and to show the ultimate physical causes
 of the cloud. One simple and apparently reasonable supposition
 is sufficient, viz. that a partial subsidence or separation of the
 watery cloud-particles takes place. The evident effect of this is
 to diminish the specific gravity of the remaining cloudy air.
 The latter was, in the first place, warmer than the surrounding
 air when it ascended, and became further warmed by the heat
 evolved in condensation.         Its buoyancy, however, was destroyed,
 and  its  upward    motion arrested above the plane          precipitation,
                                                                 of

                                       a         less degree.     But when
  the  watery  particles  fall away   from the   air,   part
                                                          a     leastat     of

  counteracting tendency         removed; the air becomes permanently
                                  is
  warmer and permanently lighter than before, and will not have
  the same tendency          redescend beneath the plane
                             to                                   precipita

it   is
     in     equilibrium with the surrounding air, and will there
  spread out    in those stratiform projections which characterize the
 cumulostratus.

                                                                as
is   not
       a    necessary   supposition,   since  many    appearances  indicate,

                Mr. W. S. Jevons           on the Forms   of Clouds.             249
I   believe,that subsidence may go on in the body of a cloud
without their aggregation into rain-drops of sufficient size to de
scend rapidly through the air to the surface of the earth.    Thus
may be explained,             I
                          suspect, the cirrose appearance which
Howard (“Climate of London,’ vol. i. p. lxix) detected in the
interior of quickly evaporating cumuli.                   I
                                               continually notice,
too, that peculiar bag-like projections or “droplets” form at the
under surface of a dense sheet of cirrostratus towards the latter
part of the day, evidently caused by the weight of subsiding
cloud-particles.
               The Nimbus, Rain-cloud, or Thunder-cloud.
   23. The nimbus or cumulo-cirrostratus is an organized com
bination of the simple forms, and is described by Howard as “a
horizontal sheet, above which the cirrus spreads, while the
cumulus enters it laterally and from beneath.”        The more
distinct forms of thunder-cloud to which              I
                                            now alone refer, more
resemble a cumulostratus with a crest of cirrus spreading from
the summit; and it occurred to me that it was only necessary to
combine the conditions of the experiment (see Phil. Mag. for
July 1857) by which the miniature cirrus was produced, with
the conditions of the miniature cumulostratus, in order to pro
duce an actual representation of the form of a thunder-cloud.
The experiment is conducted as follows:—
   24. Eap. 3. Pour into the section-glass a stratum of water
which contains about 2 parts in 1000 of sugar, with a trace of
common salt, and the temperature of which has been raised to
about 100°F.      Then carefully introduce beneath it a second
stratum at the ordinary temperature (about 60°), and containing
the same trace of common salt, together with about 2% parts of
sugar in 1000.     Lastly, project upwards from the lower edge of
the apparatus a jet of distilled water at the ordinary temperature,
containing merely a trace of nitrate of silver in solution.
                                                                                     its up

stratum, however, although containing sugar,                    is

stratus, ‘Climate of London,’ i. p. xlix, says, “The cirri vegetate,
as it were, in proportion to the quantity of rain falling.”       It
would be impossible to express more accurately the relation of
the subsiding cloud-particles and falling rain to the ascending
cirri, than to speak of the latter as “vegetating.”
     Ileave it for the reader to consider how various winds and
many different meteorological conditions will alter the general
shape and proportions of the thunder-cloud, and how the cirrose
crest will generally be swept away by a lofty current of air so as
to assume the form of a thin sheet or cirrose veil, often of an
arched form, and preceding the main body of the storm-cloud.
   Lastly, in proposing, as         I
                                 think, a fresh and original theory
of the  thunder-cloud,  I am not unaware of its crudeness. Whether
by others or myself, a quantitative estimation must be made
of the forces and velocities upon which it so entirely depends;
having suggested that the form of the thunder-cloud is a simple
mechanical phaenomenon, it will remain a mere suggestion until
it is presented as a rigorous mathematical theorem. The sim
plicity, however, of the principles involved, naturally inspires
much confidence that this may be achieved.
                 Electrical Theory of           the Thunder-cloud.
   30. It may have caused some surprise that I have offered a
theory of the thunder-cloud in which the principle, electricity, is
not even referred to.
    Thunder and lightning are indeed the most striking phaeno
mena which the thunder-cloud presents, and partly on account
of this, and partly from a propensity to form electrical theories
which seems almost universal, it has always been usual to con
sider that electricity must be, in some way or other, the cause of
storms.     It is treated, in short, as the fourth element of meteoro
logy, of which the first three are air, water, and the agent heat.

to mention electricity in conjunction with these.

256                            Prof. Callan on a Contact Breaker
    About two years ago M. Foucault described in the Comptes
Rendus     a contact breaker, in which the contact was made and
broken by a platina point caused to dip into mercury and rise
from it by means of an electro-magnet; the mercury was covered
                                                  I
with alcohol. Soon after had seen the description of this                                                  in
 strument,            I
                made one which acted very well as long as               used                          I
 only one voltaic cell; but when three cells were employed, the
alcohol took fire.                   I
                          mentioned this circumstance to M. Foucault
at the   meeting    of the British Association in Dublin. He said
 that he used thirty cells without inflaming the alcohol; that in
his contact breaker the alcohol over the mercury was about 2 inches
deep, and that in mine the depth of the alcohol must have been
too small. It was only about half an inch. . .
    In an instrument of this kind, have lately used platina,      I
copper, amalgamated copper, silvered copper, tin, and iron for
making and breaking contact by dipping into mercury and rising
from       it.The mercury was covered with oil, alcohol,                tur                      or
pentine. The same battery and electro-magnet were employed
to  make these various metals vibrate rapidly.           The amalgamated
copper acted with far greater effect than platina                any     the         or               of
                                                                                                            a so
other metals, but the contact was not made and broken
rapidly        when any

                                the other metals was used, because
small portion         mercury adhered

after  it rose above the surface         the mercury.   of Hence,      order                   in
to  break   contact,    was   necessary
                                it           make the   amalgamated

greater distance than that through which the other metals re
quired        to
              move.    When the amalgamated copper was used,
was   necessary       allow the armature

                              the electro-magnet.      Hence the contact
was not made and broken with                great  rapidity.   This defect

                             superior to any hitherto made.                                   257

                                the armature be drawn to the
poles of the electro-magnet through the        of an inch, the          ºth
amalgamated piece of copper, being at 6 inches from the centre
of motion, will ascend ºth of an inch, and will be raised out of
the mercury even when the armature does not vibrate through
a distance greater than the ºth of an inch. The vibrations
through so small a distance are very rapid, and consequently the
connexion of the coil of the magnet, and of the primary wire
of the induction coil, with the battery is made and broken with
great rapidity.
    Ihave used for the long arm of the lever a piece of thick
sheet brass about 6 or 7 inches long and an inch broad. A
piece #th of an inch broad and about 4 inches long may be cut
out of the middle of the long arm, so that a thin plate of amalga
mated copper, of platina, or of any other metal may be attached
to the lever by a small screw and nut, at any distance we wish
from the centre of motion.                    I
                                  have attached the amalgamated
copper at distances varying from 3 to 10 inches from the centre
of motion, and have found that it acts as well at 3 or 4 as at 10
inches from the centre.    It is useless to make the length of the
long arm greater than 6 or 7 inches.                              I
                                            have found that the use
of the lever just described is a great improvement to the contact
breaker, not only when amalgamated copper and mercury are
used, but also when the contact is made by platina or any other
metal and mercury, or by the pressure of two solid metals
against each other.

                                   have found that for working
this instrument,  the magnetism of one pole of the core of an                                              in
duction coil is abundantly sufficient. When only one pole of
the core is presented to the armature, a piece of soft iron should
be fixed near the end of the armature opposite to that on which
the core acts.
   It will be useful to divide the induction coil and its core into
two or more parts, and to       one end  fix
                                           each part           of

more   perfect  contact with    mercury  than platina does,         than two                  or
solid metals make with each      other,  and therefore produces greater

with questions of physical geography, geology, natural history,

ancient Abana, and the Awaj, ancient Pharpar,                  showing that
they enter into two distinct and separate lakes, flooding                 con                    a
siderable district       inwinter, and diminishing again              the dry               in

       MY DEAR SIR,                                       February 15, 1858.
                                   I
   In my former hurried note alluded to some experiments                      I
was making on sonorous flames.         I
                                       have since ascertained that
the  presence of a wick does not   prevent   the musical vibration.
In a tapering jet-pipe, one-tenth of an inch in diameter, I inserted
a wick of loose cotton twine or of asbestos, so as to project some
distance into the flame of common illuminating gas burned at
                      I
the extremity, and found it easy, by a proper adjustment of the
flame and enclosing glass tube, to obtain a clear musical note.
   After various attempts to secure the same result with alcohol
and other combustible liquids burned directly from wicks,    have        I
found that by using hollow circular wicks, and tubes but slightly
exceeding them in diameter, we can readily produce the musical
effect with the flames of sulphuric aether, alcohol, and the mixture
of the latter with spirits of turpentine, which in this country is
known as burning fluid.
   As the effect in these experiments depends on the access to
the flame of a current of air of definite amount and velocity and
in proper directions, it is necessary to adjust the diameter of the
wick and size of the flame to the dimensions of the tube em
ployed, and to hold the tube with          its
                                         lower edge     little lower

than that of the wick.                           The flame will then be seen to contract
and to lose much of                             itsbrilliancy, and will give forth tone                       a

   These results are readily obtained with the flame                small                                of   a
circular-wicked lamp, now used         the United States for burning

musical vibrations; but         they present someas      the effects                         of                      in

conclusion, that under proper conditions flames           every kind are                      of
capable         of

remain motionless, we must nevertheless assume that it has re
ceived a finite quantity of motion, which has been entirely trans
ferred there; and hence that the force applied has not been de
stroyed, but still subsists without the least alteration.
    Whenever, therefore, on encountering some fixed point, a body
is seen to become animated with a velocity greater than it for
merly possessed, we must, if we wish to know the quantity of
motion which exists after the shock, not only consider the quan
tity which the body possesses, but also that which it has im
parted, in a contrary direction, to the fixed point in question.
And if we take the difference between these two quantities of
motion, as we ought to do in this case, we shall find precisely
the same quantity as existed before the shock; so that the ge
neral principle of the conservation of force remains intact.               It
may easily be shown, too, that the principle of the conservation
of areas is likewise observed, provided the movement of the fixed
point—or rather of the free point, with an infinitely great mass
—be taken into consideration. Thus, as soon as we take cogni
zance, not of the moveable body alone, but of the system com
posed of that body and of the material point in question,                                                   all

upon the hypothenuse, supplies everything with respect           the                                                   to

The figure clearly shows, too, what takes place when the body
is endued with only one of these two motions. For:
   First. If the impulse which the body has received is due, solely,
to a simple force passing through the centre of gravity, the cen
tre C of percussion will coincide with the point G, the side CA
with the perpendicular GA = K, and the other side AO of the
right-angled triangle with the line through A parallel to the
hypothenuse. The centre T of greatest positive percussion,
therefore, now coincides—as it clearly should do—with the point
G, and the other centre T' of greatest negative percussion is at
an infinite distance; lastly, the two centres S and S of greatest
conversion are situated at the distance CA=GA= + K from
the same centre G.
   Secondly. If the body has received the impulse of a couple
merely, the spontaneous centre O will coincide with the centre
of gravity, the side OA with the perpendicular GA, and the side
AC with the parallel through A to the hypothenuse. The two
centres T and T' of marimum percussion are now at the distance
OA= + K from the centre G ; and of the two centres S and S'
of greatest conversion, the first S is infinitely distant, and the
second S' coincides with the same centre G.
   67. Lastly, in order to have a clear idea of the force or action at
any point a of the body taken arbitrarily on the hypothenuse CO,
we have only to join a with the vertex
A of the right angle of the triangle and
                              2

determine the fraction    W.; of the  whole
mass  M of  the body.     We may then say
that the   point  a acts as would a free 6                   G      r
point charged with this fraction of the
whole mass M. We see, too, that the point O reciprocal to a
would act as a free point charged with the remainder of this
mass; so that these two reciprocal points w and O divide the
mass of the body into two parts reciprocally proportional to 2A*
and OA*, or—what amounts to the same thing—into two parts
inversely proportional to their distances OG and wC from the
centre of gravity G of the body.
   68. It appears to us that truths so evident, and so easy of ex
pression as the above, are as new elements added to science, and
cannot fail to contribute to its advancement.          For we must
admit that the human      understanding   advances but little, other
wise than   by  the aid of such   simpler  ideas or more convenient
instruments which it invents and, so to speak, handles with
greater facility.   These new questions, therefore, appear to us
not  unworthy   of the attention of geometricians, and their novelty

and in the next place, we shall have a force equal and parallel to
the given force P, but applied at C, whose distance from the
centre of gravity G is r. We have seen that this force causes a
spontaneous rotation around a certain axis O'Y' parallel to G Y,
and situated on the other side of the centre G at a distance
                                          w!   = 6. ;

the angular velocity around this axis is

  In virtue of the impulse given                    at   C, therefore, the body tends
at one and the same time to turn around                         O'X    with the angular
velocity

Hence, according to the principle of the composition of rota
tions*, the body tends to turn around the diagonal of the rect
angle constructed on the two lines O'p and O'q which represent
the rotations p and q. The given force P, therefore, gives rise to
a spontaneous axis of rotation which cuts the axis of a at the

 of the spontaneous axis corresponding to a centre of impulsion
 whose coordinates are a and y.    Other equally simple solutions
 might be given, but it is not necessary to do so here.
   2. Considering t and u now as the coordinates of the sponta
 neous centre O, which is in the line C G produced, we have the
 relation
                                          t; u = @      :   y,
 which, combined with the preceding equation, gives

The coordinates of the spontaneous centre O are thus expressed
by means of those of the centre of impulsion C, or vice versd;
for it will be observed that in these two expressions, as in the
symmetrical equations whence they are deduced, we may inter
change t and w, and u and y; in other words, the two centres C
and O are always reciprocal.                          -
   3. If H be the distance Ma’--y” of the centre of impulsion
C from the centre of gravity G,
and A the distance V tº + u° of
the spontaneous centre O from
the same point G, we shall
have, by putting for t and u
their values in a and y, and
forming the product AH of the
distances in question,

                                AH   =   2*3°-3
Now, since the numerator and denominator here are each homo
geneous functions of the second degree in a and y, we may
replace the latter by any other two lines proportional to them.
If,                     we
      therefore,             agree that   w       shall now represent the co

The right line    CT,  having been represented by the equation
              -
                        a’aw 4-8°by + 2*S*=0,
may, manifestly, be regarded as the spontaneous axis correspond
ing to a centre O whose coordinates are a and b. The centre         I
of our ellipse, therefore, is the middle point of the line G O ;
and the ellipse itself is constructed upon G O as diameter homo
logous to the like-directed diameter in the central ellipse.
    16. Hence, regarding the given line CT as a spontaneous aris
corresponding to a centre O, we may say that if the several points
of this line be taken as centres of percussion, the corresponding
spontaneous centres will be all situated on an ellipse similar to the
central ellipse, and described upon the line G O as diameter homo
logous to that which the direction of G O determines in the central
ellipse.   And conversely, if the points of this ellipse were taken
as centres of percussion, the spontaneous centres would be all
situated along the line C.T.
    On account of the reciprocity between the centres C and O,
it is evident that if the centres of percussion were the points of
the line OS, parallel to CT, the corresponding spontaneous
centres would be on an ellipse similar to the first, but described
on C G as diameter homologous to O G.
    17. As a second example, let the centres C be taken on the
parabola represented by the equation
                                y”= Aw;
putting in place of    a and   y their values in t and u, we find the
equation
                    Aaºtº + A8°u°t + 2*8°u?=0,
 which gives the required locus of the spontaneous centres O     cor
responding to the centres C.
                                ;Vº
    Solved with respect to the ordinate u, this equation gives
                        w = +-         &* + At
                                               ;
whence, since 2, 8, and A are positive, we see that this curve of
the third order has only real ordinates u on the side of the nega
tive abscissae t; that, like the parabola (y”= Aw), the curve has
two equal branches which stretch to infinity above and below the
abscissa axis; but that these two branches cannot recede from
the ordinate axis to a distance greater than
                                t! = -A2%
 so that a line drawn parallel to the ordinate axis, and at a      di
 stance from the same equal to t, is an asymptote to both branches
 of the curve in question.

   Many other questions of the same kind might be proposed;
these examples, however, will suffice, and we will proceed to a
more important problem from which numerous consequences
may be deduced.

  20. To find the coordinates a and y of the point D where the
percussion Q is a mawimum, we have merely to form the two
equations
                                        *Q =0,        48-0
                                        de   Tº          dy.   Tº
which give
     a'a(2*a*4-8°y” + 2*8°)–22°w(2*aw-F8°by                                      + 2*8%)=0,
        Bºb(2*a*4-8°y?--a”6°)–28°y(2*aw-HBºby--2°3°)=0,
whence we immediately deduce the proportion
                                             a :   y = a b.
This shows, in the first place, that the required point D lies in
the direction of the line C G joining the centres of impulsion
and gravity.   Substituting, therefore, in either of the preceding
equations, for y         its   value          #,     and subsequently for                  w    its   value
#  y,     we   shall have,          for     determining        a
                                                                     or
                                                                     y      separately,          the   qua

these equations              are   exactly       similar; the first resolves itself into
the                by
       ºrd              simply changing               w    and       a    into   y   and   b,   and vice
QjerSu.
    21. But, since the required point        the given line CG,           on
                                                               D

let     make the distance v-DG between the required point
       us
and the centre     gravity

we shall have the proportions
                                        v:   H   =w  :a   =    y:    b,
whence
                                   **   =     #".   and y=      H4.
Substituting these values    the preceding equations,
                                              in                                                 we    have,

but,   A    being the distance between the spontaneous centre                                     O     and

                      M. Poinsot      on the Percussion           of Bodies,                     289
the centre of gravity G, we have
                                        2°8°            A
                                     2*a*-i-8°52       T H”
for, by art. 2, the first term expresses the ratio of the abscissae
or ordinates of the two reciprocal points C and O, and this ratio                                            -
is evidently the same as that of the two lines H and A.
   Employing this simpler expression, the equation for determi
ning v becomes
                                     v°-H2Av–AH=0,
and gives
                                v= —A-E w/A3+AH.
There are, therefore, two centres of mawimum percussion, one to
the right, and the other to the left of the centre of gravity G.
   In order to refer these two points to the spontaneous centre of
rotation O, we have only to make
in order at once to deduce
                                      DO=X=v-H A

where for brevity L represents the line OC=A+ H. We are thus
led to the following theorem:-
   The centre of maximum percussion is upon the line passing
through the body’s centres of impulsion and gravity, and distance                     its
A    from the spontaneous             centre      of

 of the phaenomena of electrical excitation.              As the experiments
 were undertaken principally for my own practical guidance,                                                  I
 did not publish them, but during some recent investigations with
my new induction coils, my attention has been frequently again
directed to the subject, and I have thought that some account of the
experiments might not be altogether unacceptable to electricians.
    My object in the present paper is to point out some of the
phaenomena attendant on the action of the electrical machine,
together with some circumstances by which they are modified.
 To ensure accuracy,                 I
                              have lately repeated the experiments with
 several  machines,    and   amongst     them the 104-inch cylinder before
alluded to, and with corroborative results.                                                                      -

 accordingly the same cylinder exhibits very different results
 with silk flaps            of
                         different kinds.       Without going into detail                                    of

experiments with flaps of various materials, including single and
double silk, plain and varnished with shell-lac, oil, caoutchouc,
and other materials, it will be sufficient to state the kind which
gives the greatest effect.  After more than thirty years’ experi
ence with some scores of machines,    have found that the thin yel

low oiled silk makes the best flap for an electrical machine, when
properly prepared for the purpose.      This material is best var
nished on one side only, the unvarnished side being applied to the
glass, and requiring no preparation.                                If
                                                the oiled silk be var
nished on both sides, it adheres so closely to the glass as to ren
der it impossible to turn the machine, and it therefore requires
to be prepared by giving it two or three coats of shell-lac varnish
on the side to be applied to the glass, which will effectually pre
vent the too strong adhesion.       A new flap of this kind improves
much in action after the machine has been excited three or four
times, evidently showing the gradual attainment of qualities not
possessed at first, and moreover proving that the flap itself is a
necessary element in the excitation.
    The arrangement of the rubber also is a matter of no small
importance. It is absolutely necessary that there shall be a per
fect contact of the cylinder with the rubber and silk flap, from
the face upon which the amalgam is spread to the end where the
prime conductor receives the electricity; hence the superiority of
oiled silk, the thinness of which enables it to adapt itself to the
irregularities of the cylinder.
    As a proof of the foregoing remarks, it is merely necessary to
try the following experiment.
    When the machine is in tolerable action, pass under the silk flap
a  piece of silk cord, in a direction parallel to the rubber, and at
an inch above        and holdit,        the ends

excitation of the electricity, either by increasing the distance of
the collecting points from the rubber, and thereby preventing the
too ready return of electricity from the conductor in sparks to
the rubber, or by becoming itself an agent in the actual excita

    Further experiments showed that the silk flap had                      own                   its
 peculiar function, for when the machine was                 good action, the     in
 rubber could           withdrawn altogether from contact with the

hour, or until reduced to a fine black powder, and preserved for
use in this form.     When used, it is ground up very fine with a
small  quantity of fresh lard, and laid upon the rubber as smoothly
as  possible.   With this amalgam, a well-constructed machine,
having a cylinder of 32 inches in circumference, and a rubber
9 inches in length, with a prime conductor 4 or 5 inches dia
meter and 20 inches long, should, without the necessity of
warming the cylinder, give from four to six straight dense sparks
of 3 to 3% inches in length, for every revolution of the cylinder.
   A 2-inch ball inserted into the conductor should throw off
spontaneously rapid brushes of electricity into the air, and fur
mish zigzag sparks of 9 inches or more in length.          It should
also charge a Leyden jar of ordinary thickness containing 4
square feet of internal surface, so as to discharge at 0:5 of an
inch with 48 or 50 turns.
   Whatever the size of the machine, excepting perhaps those of
very small dimensions, it may be generally assumed that the
friction of about 24 square feet should be sufficient to charge a
square foot of coated glass to the intensity of 0-5 of an inch.
    On comparing these effects with those obtained from a plate
machine, we observe an extraordinary difference in relation to
the quantity of surface submitted to friction, since the plate ma
chine scarcely yields with four rubbers as much electricity as it
might be expected to develope with one.                  I

faces, and whatever their construction, their effects are equivalent
to the number of rubbers employed.                                I
                                               In proof of this may
quote the following.      An excellent double 24-inch plate machine
with eight rubbers, each 5% inches long, and rubbing at each
revolution rather less than 184 feet, requires, when in good ex
citation, five turns, or 91 square feet to produce a given dis
charge.
   An excellent 3-feet plate machine, the property of Sir W. S.
Harris, fitted with four rubbers, each 10 inches long, rubs about
24 square feet at each revolution, and when in good condition
                                                                        º
requires the friction of 90 square feet to produce the same effect.
   I  have at various times compared these machines with each
other, and with smaller machines, all excited with the same
amalgam, and find a remarkable uniformity of result.
   It now remains to compare plates with cylinder machines.
On one occasion      I compared a 73-inch cylinder, rubbing 17625
square inches at each revolution, with Sir W. S. Harris's 3-feet
plate machine; both were in excellent condition, but not excited
with the same amalgam.           A standard jar was employed with a
Lane's   discharger,   and a  striking interval of 0-5 of an inch. The
quantity of surface rubbed by the cylinder to produce the dis
charge was about fifteen turns, or 18:33 square feet, whilst the
plate machine required 3; turns to produce the same effect. As
a single rubber rubbed about 6 square feet, the whole surface
would be 6 × 4 × 33 =90 square feet, or about five times the
surface rubbed by the cylinder.
   Again, the same cylinder was compared with a double 24-inch
plate machine in my own possession, every care being taken to
use the same amalgam and maintain the same conditions.               In
this case the    quantity    of surface rubbed     upon  the  plate was
rather more than four times as much as that on the cylinder.
   Thirdly, a 93-inch cylinder with an 8-inch rubber, rubbing
244 square inches at each turn, produced a given discharge with
a friction of 41.36 feet, whilst the double plate machine used at
the same time and excited with the same amalgam, required 165
feet to produce the same effect.
   It thus appears that cylinder machines have a great supe
riority in their exciting power over plate machines, and for ordi
nary experimental purposes are much more convenient. A
cylinder of 12 inches diameter, having a single rubber of 9 inches
in length, will be just equal to a 24-inch plate machine having
four rubbers, each 5% inches long; or if the cylinder be fitted with
two rubbers as before described, it will be equal to a double plate
machine which possesses the disadvantage of having eight rub
bers to keep in order.        In very large plate machines, where a
single pair of rubbers only is used, the sacrifice of power in pro

portion to the size of the machine must be very considerable;
and the only advantage which they appear to possess as a com
pensation for this loss, is that of affording very long sparks from
a large conductor.
    The cause of this difference in the exciting power of plates
and cylinders is not to me perfectly clear. . It is possible that
the difference in the chemical composition of plate- and flint-glass,
as well as the difference in the mechanical character of their sur
faces, the latter being a surface of fusion and the former a ground
and polished surface, may have some influence over their electric
capabilities. There is also another peculiarity to which             have                           I
before alluded in connexion with plate- and crown-glass, viz. their
retentiveness of the electric charge, which may operate as preju
dicially to the free action of electricity excited on         surface,                its                 as

I  am more inclined, however,           believe that the cylinder owes

    The whole of the action          thus determined        the external         to

   Independently of Cahours, but led by the same considerations,
Schülerº attempted the formation of coumaric acid by this reac
tion, but arrived at results differing from those of Cahours. He
found on mixing hydride of salicyle with chloride of acetyle, that
a brisk action was set up, the mixture became heated, a large
quantity of hydrochloric acid was disengaged, and the contents
of the tube on cooling solidified to a crystalline mass, which on
recrystallization was obtained in brilliant white crystals. These
crystals gave on analysis numbers corresponding to the formula
C18HZ O4.
   The formation of such a body is inexplicable on the suppo
sition of a simple action between the two substances.      Schüler
thought the substance not quite pure, and that        true formula                       its
                             -

results    analysis.

was the same.

                have to state, that in May 1854, while my own
paper was unfinished, I communicated to those gentlemen a for
mula for carbonic acid gas in which the value of a certain coeffi
cient, denoted by PoWo, was stated at about r}oth part less than
that which    Iafterwards found to be its correct value; but that
difference is of no practically appreciable importance in compu

XXXIX.         On the Intensity of Light during the recent Solar Eclipse.
                      By   J.  P. Joule, LL.D., F.R.S. &c.
    To the     Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,
     EING        desirous to obtain an image of the annulus                    in the late
  <U+2192>    solar eclipse,         I  took a camera to the Werrington                Junction
on the Great Northern Railway. A few minutes before the cen
tral eclipse, however, it became evident that the sky would remain
obscured with cloud, I therefore employed the camera simply to
obtain, if possible, a measure of the intensity of the light. The
country about the Werrington Junction is an extensive plain.                             I
placed the camera on the ground, directing it to the south-east
horizon. The sensitive plate was exposed during the five minutes
which preceded the central effect, and the image was developed
immediately afterwards. The next day, the weather appearing
almost exactly similar, possibly of the two a little more cloudy,
I exposed near Manchester plates prepared with the same collo
dion and nitrate of silver, and developed them with the same
solution of sulphate of iron; the direction in which the camera
was placed, the time of the day and every other circumstance
being as nearly as possible the same as before. In this latter case,
a picture, judged by Mr. Dancer, a gentleman of great experience
   Phil. Mag. S. 4, Vol. 15. No. 100, April 1858,                                 X

in photography, and myself to be of considerably greater inten
sity than that procured during the eclipse, was obtained in two
                    -
seconds.
   The ratio of luminous influence, as measured by the camera,
was therefore at the greatest 1 to 150. But the average exposed
area during the five minutes preceding the central effect, compared
with that of the entire disc, will be nearly as 1 to 24.      there                                    I
fore infer that the circumference of the sun's disc gives out a
                                                                                             by

quite       accordance with the experience          Mr. Dancer, who           of
finds that       in
                 the   photography      the   sun, the central part
                                                          of
always much more rapidly depicted than the circumference;                                                       so is
much so, that          he
                     finds   impossible
                                      it     obtain    the same image
                                                                 to                in

    On the eclipse becoming central, the darkness became sud
denly increased, remained for few seconds apparently constant,

   The apparatus made use of was sufficiently simple. The heat
was derived from a stove, the fire within which could be elevated,
depressed, or entirely withdrawn at pleasure.        A very shallow pan
of mercury was placed over the stove, the fire being so regulated as
to preserve the mercury at any constant required temperature. A
cylindrical block of any substance, the conductive power of which
was to be determined, was so placed as to rest with          base just                                  its                     in

Mr. Hopkins          on the Conductive Powers    of various Substances.   313
was there any sensible effect with chalk between a pressure of
4300 lbs, and 7500 lbs. per square inch.
   Clay which when incompressed had a conducting power='26, had
when compressed with 7500 lbs. per inch, a power ="33; and the
conducting power of a mixture of sand and clay in equal quantities
rose from 36 to 378 by an increase of pressure from 4300 lbs. to
7500 lbs. per inch.
   Generally the effect of pressure is much less than might have
been anticipated.
                                Effect of Discontinuity.
   4. When the conducting mass consists of a number of strata
superimposed on each other, the mathematical problem presented to
us requires a distinct investigation, which is here given under a very
general form, together with the experiments necessary to determine
the effect of this kind of discontinuity.  The result is that if a mass
of sandstone consisted of a number of strata, the conducting powers
of which should be about 5, the mean conductivity of the whole
would not be diminished by more than about ºth part, supposing the
average thickness of strata to be 1 foot; or by about ºth, if that
average thickness should be 6 inches.     This effect is much less than
might possibly have been anticipated.
                                  Effect of Moisture.
  5. This effect was very considerable in those rocks which are great
absorbents of water. The maximum effect appears to be produced
by a quantity of moisture which falls considerably short of producing
complete saturation.    The conducting power of a piece of dried
chalk was =   19, but became = 30 when the substance was very
moist. That of a well-dried piece of new red sandstone was =-25,
but became as much as ‘60 when saturated. Both these substances
absorbed a large quantity of water.      Ancaster oolites absorbed con
siderably less, and their conductivity was affected in a smaller degree.
For a block of dry clay the conductive power was 23, and became
'37 when well moistened.        Close indurated sandstone, palaeozoic
rocks of close texture, and igneous rocks are bad absorbents, and are
very little affected in their conductive powers by moisture.

that such must be the case.      He does not profess, in this paper, to

   It should be remarked that the argument derived from the above

but only against the manifestation of the remains of such heat as the
sole cause of existing terrestrial temperatures in the superficial crust
of the globe, at depths beyond the sensible effect of the direct solar
heat. Whatever may be the weight of the argument in favour of

   In the case of the perihelia no other two semicircles give a greater
disproportion between the numbers.         The semicircle 355° to 175°
contains 37 of the nodes, the opposite one 13.
   But in addition to this development of my original plan regarding
the heliocentric longitudes of the perihelia and modes, Mr. Graham
has found a remarkable coincidence between the foregoing numbers
and the periods of the discovery of the small planets.       It appears
that 28 have been detected between the vernal and autumnal equi
noxes, and only 15 in the other half-year.
   He states that this circumstance, which at a first glance might
seem to throw some light upon the facts, proves, after a moment’s
consideration, the exact opposite to what might have been expected,
at least in          its

    “On a remarkable fossil Specimen belonging to the Genus Neu
ropteris, from the Coal-measures of Lancashire, and Remarks on that

                          F. Bunbury, Esq., F.R.S., F.G.S.
    The author    begins    by noticing the comparative rarity, in a fossil
state, of theyoung half-expanded fronds of Ferns, showing the charac
teristic circinate vernation; and he remarks that the specimens in that
state, hitherto figured, belong to the genus Pecopteris.                He then
describes a well-characterized specimen of Neuropteris in this circi
nate condition; it appears to belong to N. gigantea, or a variety of
it,  and was procured from Oldham                         in

   The following communications were read:—
    1. “On Cephalaspis     and Pteraspis.”      By Prof. Huxley, F.R.S.,
F.G.S.
   Of the four species originally included by Prof. Agassiz in the genus
 Cephalaspis, two, C. Lloydii and C. Lewisii, are so different from the
others that the possibility of their proving generically distinct is
hinted at in the ‘Recherches sur les Poissons Fossiles.’
   Subsequently M. Kner endeavoured to prove that these two species
are not fish-remains at all, but are the internal shells of a Cephalo
pod, for which he proposed the generic name of Pteraspis.
   Roemer has still more recently expressed the opinion that the
Pteraspides are Crustacea.       These conflicting opinions clearly    in
dicate the necessity of revising and comparing anew the characters
of the different species of Cephalaspis and Pteraspis.        And a still
greater interest is lent to the inquiry into the true nature of Pte
raspis, from the fact that species of this genus are now known to
occur in undoubtedly Upper Silurian rocks. As the evidence stands
at present, they are, if fish, among the oldest (and nearly the very
oldest) representatives of their class.
   In undertaking this inquiry, the author of the present paper con
sidered it desirable, in the first place, to determine with precision the
microscopical characters of the shield of Cephalaspis. This shield is
exceedingly thin, nowhere exceeding Tºth of an inch in thickness on
the dorsal surface, and on the ventral suddenly thinning off a little
way from the margin into a mere membrane.
   The subjacent cranium appears to have been wholly composed of
cartilaginous or soft fibrous tissue; for the “layer of fibrous bone,”
which has been said to exist immediately beneath the shield, is in
reality nothing more than the matrix, which in these fossils, as in
others, is stained of a deep reddish-brown colour in the immediate
neighbourhood of the animal substance; the “fibres” of the supposed
bone are casts of the radiating semi-canals or grooves on the under
surface of the shield.                     -
   The shield consists of three principal layers; the outermost is
distinctly laminated, and contains numerous osseous lacunae, whose
long axes are disposed at a considerable angle to one another in the
successive layers, as in Megalichthys.         The lamellae and lacunae
disappear in the middle and outer layers.       The latter is arranged in
irregular tubercles, consisting of a substance very similar to the
“Kosmine” of Prof. Williamson. The inner openings of numerous
vascular canals are seen as points scattered over the inner surface of
the shield.     These canals traverse the inner layer obliquely, and
then   ramify  in the middle layer in a very peculiar manner, described
at  length  in the paper.
   It is from the disposition of these vascular ramifications that the
appearance of distinct ossicles or scales, interlocking by sutures,
which has been described, arises. The entire absence of any such

discoverable: the inner      very distinctly laminated; the outer,
                                                     is

consists          of
           Kosmine.   Vascular canals pass from the inner surface,
and ramify   the middle layer, terminating
                        in                    caeca  the outer layer,                 in             in
as      in   Cephalaspis.

   By a happy accident the only displacement in the whole length of
the vertebral column of this specimen has taken place between the
head and the atlas and axis, on the one hand, and between the
latter and the third cervical vertebra on the other.                   By a little
careful clearing away of the surrounding parts, it has thus been
possible to expose the atlas and axis very easily.                  They are, as
Prof. Owen has stated to be their character in this genus, anchy
losed; but their structure is totally different from what is seen in the
Ichthyosaurus, and closely resembles that of the corresponding parts
in the Crocodile.       An os odontoideum, very similar to that in the
Crocodile, represents, as Rathke long since demonstrated in other
 Reptilia, the central portion of the body of the atlas; while                                                           its

   For some time previous to the occurrence of a severe earthquake
shock, on or about the 30th August 1857, the Bay of Payta swarmed
with crabs, of a kind not generally observed, and ten days after the
earthquake they were thrown up on the beach, in a raised wall-like
line, 3 to 4 feet wide, and to the height of about 3 feet, along the
whole extent of the bay, and above highwater-mark.
   At the same time as the upheaval of the crabs took place, the
water of the bay became changed, from a clear blue, to a dirty
blackish-green colour, much resembling that off the Island of Chiloe,
Concepcion, and the southern parts of Chili.     Ten days afterwards,
Dr. C. Forbes found that    living  specimens  of the crabs were still
numerous in the bay, but         appeared     all sickly, and numbers
                                                                 to    be

Prof.  Nicol),  when   having  found still more fossils,       expressed his      he
conviction (at the British       Association,   Glasgow     Meeting,    1854)
that the quartzites             of
                          Sutherland and their subordinate limestones
were    ofLower Silurian age; and was strengthened               the opinion          in
(which       he
             had already published) that large portions             the cry                of
stalline rocks       the Highlands would prove
                           of                                the equivalents

                       of
and the latter geologist greatly extended all previous observations,
and communicated          the Society
                                to         memoir, showing that the old

                  of its
gneiss and       superposed conglomerate,         seen along as  very exten            a

Ross-shire and Sutherlandshire reposed. At the same time Prof.
Nicol hypothetically suggested, that, until the evidence of fossils was
more complete, the quartzite and limestone might be considered as
the equivalent of the Carboniferous series of the South of Scotland.
Another hypothesis, which had been propounded by the late Mr.
 Hugh Miller, regarded the quartz-rocks and hard limestones of
Sutherland merely as the metamorphosed representatives of the Old
 Red and Caithness series of the Eastern Coast.
   Both of these hypotheses, however, seemed to the author to be
quite incompatible with the physical order of the rock-masses in
question; for, according to the observations made long ago by Prof.
Sedgwick and himself, the above-mentioned crystalline rocks, in the
lower part of which the Durness fossils have recently been found,
are the inferior members of the great undulating mass of micaceous
and schistose rocks, which, rolling over to Caithness on the east,
there constitute the basis out of which the bottom strata of the Old
Red Sandstone are chiefly formed.
   Of late, Mr. Peach has, by his untiring perseverance, obtained a
still larger collection of fossils from Durness, and in better preserva
tion than those found in 1854, and Mr. Salter finds that this collec
tion of well-defined forms comprises genera belonging only to the Lower
Silurian of North America.        Hence all doubt is now dispelled; and
the author, following up the suggestions which he offered at the
Glasgow Meeting of the British Association, describes in the present
paper these rocks and their fossils; defining the great unfossiliferous
conglomerate-masses of Sutherland as of Cambrian age; the quartz
ites and limestones as Lower Silurian; and the overlying micaceous
and gneissose schists and flagstones as also of Silurian age.
   In the body of the memoir, Sir Roderick, after a brief notice of the
“fundamental gneiss,” described the “Cambrian red sandstone and
conglomerate,” alluding to the faithful descriptions by Hugh Miller
and Nicol.     He also detailed certain subsequent observations of
Colonel James and Mr. Peach on the unconformity of these rocks to
the overlying quartzites, and on the great dislocations exhibited in
these masses; and he also noticed the discovery of a porphyry be
 tween the gneiss and the conglomerate by the latter observer.
   The “Lower Silurian rocks, in the form of quartz-rock, crystal
line limestone, chloritic and micaceous schists, and younger gneiss,”
were then described.      The fossils from the quartz-rock consist of
small annelide tubes now named Serpulites Maccullochii, and traces
of fucoids. These fossils were long ago noticed, but of late they
have been traced in beds for great distances by Mr. Peach.       The
strong band of limestone between two quartz-rocks is estimated by
Colonel James to lie about 800 feet above the base of the series,
and is of great extent.    The fossils detected in it have been deter
mined by Mr. Salter to be Maclurea Peachii, spec. nov. (and its
curious twisted operculum), Ophileta compacta, well known in Canada,
Oncoceras, spec., and Orthoceras, a smooth species with a compressed
siphuncle.   They  all closely resemble fossilsof  the Lower Silurian
rocks of   North America, which range from the Calciferous rock up
                                 Y  2

to the Trenton limestone, both inclusive; a group especially to be
found in the limestones of the Ottawa River in Canada.
   Passing across Ross-shire in a more southern parallel, from Loch
Duich in Kintail, on the west, to the frontier of the Old Red
Sandstone on the east, the general succession of rocks was de
scribed to be much the same as that in North-west Sutherlandshire,
though there are considerable changes of lithological character when
the same rocks are followed southwards or south-south-west upon
their strike; and the author stated his belief, that not only may the
regularly bedded limestones which are intercalated in the chloritic
and quartzose rocks of Dumbartonshire be classed with some of the
oldest of those stratified masses which, like the limestones of Suther
land, are unquestionably of Lower Silurian age, but that the vast and
evidently overlying masses of mica-schist and quartzose-gneissic flag
rocks of the Breadalbane district may be some day found to be simply
the prolongations of the micaceous flagstones of the North-western
Highlands above alluded to, as overlying the quartz-rock and fossili
ferous limestone: further, that in the still higher limestones and
schists seen on the banks of Loch Tay, we may speculate on the
existence of the equivalents of younger and higher strata than any
which are observed in the Northern Counties.
    After some observations on the truly stratified condition of these
 micaceous and gneissose schists (younger gneiss) of the Highlands,
 Sir Roderick proceeded to the consideration of the “Old Red Sand
 stone of the North-east of Scotland;” defining the tripartite division
 of this great series, and demonstrating that the beds with Cephalaspis
 Lyellii and Pterygotus Anglicus of Forfarshire really              the base
                                                                                  lie

species of fish (at least twenty-one) found fossil in Caithness and
Cromarty occur in Russia commingled with the middle Devonian
mollusks of Devon, the Boulonnais, and the Rhine; and having
pointed out that the lowest member of the Devonian series, with its
Cephalaspides, is wanting in Russia, Sir Roderick insisted on the
importance of the Devonian series in the scale of formations, and
on the fact that the Old Red conglomerates, ichthyolitic schists, and
cornstones, with the overlying sandstones, of Scotland and Here
fordshire fully represent in time the Devonian rocks of the South of
England and the Continent, so full of corals, crinoids, and marine
mollusks.
    Some brief observations on the Newer Red Sandstone of the West
Coast of Ross-shire, and the Lias and Oolitic deposits of the North
of Scotland and the Western Isles, concluded this paper.
      February 24,   1858.-Prof. Phillips, President, in the Chair.
    The following communications were read:—
    1. “On the Gradual Elevation of a part of the Coast of Sicily,
from the Mouth of the Simeto to the Onobola.”        By Signor Gaetano
Georgio Gemmellaro.        Communicated by Sir C. Lyell, F.G.S.
    In this paper the author described in detail the physical evidences,
observed by him along a great part of the eastern coast of Sicily,
which prove—1st, that from the shores of the Simeto to the Onobola
undeniable characters of the former levels of the sea in the recent
period are traceable from place to place.      2ndly, that great blocks
of lava, with blunted angles, and rolled and corroded on the surface,
a calcareo-siliceous shelly deposit, and a marine breccia, which are
seen at different heights above the present sea-level, are the effects
of the continued and daily action of the waves of the sea at successive
levels.    3rdly, that the existence and disposition of the holes of the
Modiola lithophaga, Lamarck, in the calcareo-siliceous shelly deposit,
 and the local presence of shells, both Gasteropods and Lamellibran
 chiates, in their normal positions, support the view of a slow and gra
 dual elevation of the coast. 4thly and lastly, that the lithodomous
molluscs and the calc-siliceous deposit being found on the Cyclopean
 Islands (Faraglioni) up to the height of almost 13 metres, and large
rolled blocks of lava, invested with Serpular being also found there to
 the height of 14 metres, a mean height of 13 metres and 5 decim. is
established as the greatest extent of the now undeniable gradual
elevation of this portion of the coast of Sicily during the present
period.
    2. “On the occurrence of transported Pebbles and Boulders at
high levels in Aberdeenshire.”      By T. F. Jamieson, Esq. In letters
to Sir R. I. Murchison, V.P.G.S.
    The author stated that he had found indications of the district
having been submerged beneath the sea to the height of about 430
or 450 feet for a considerable time during the later Tertiary period.
Extensive ridges or hillocks of water-worn gravelly debris, bearing

326                     Intelligence      and Miscellaneous            Articles.
large boulders on their surfaces, occur in Aberdeenshire.         Beneath
the gravel of these mounds, the author has found beds of sand and
clay containing marine shells, generally broken, such as Nucula tenuis,
Leda pygmaea, Lucina ferruginosa, Cyprina Islandica, Mactra, Pec
ten and Mangelia.
   At higher levels, to the elevation of 800 feet at least, Mr. Jamieson
has found striated pebbles and boulders, but unaccompanied by depo
sits similar to the above. The last change of level in Aberdeenshire
seems to have been one of depression, indicated by beds of peat pass
ing below the sea at various places between Aberdeen and the Moray
Firth.
   3. Mr. Kennedy Macnab, of Inverness, communicated, in a letter
to the Secretaries, the fact of flint arrow-heads and whelk-shells
having been found at the depth of about 3        in. beneath the sur

  On the 14th instant an aurora was visible here of more than the
average brightness.     At    P.M.       11

                  it

zenith.     availed myself    the opportunity

and which are so abundant in the light of electric discharges; and
I found it to be so. A drop of disulphate of quinine on a porcelain
tablet seemed like a luminous patch on a faint ground; and crystals
of platinocyanide of potassium were so bright, that the label on the
tube which contained them (and which by lamplight could not be
distinguished from the salt at a little distance) seemed almost black
by contrast.
   These effects were so strong in relation to the actual intensity of
the light, that they appear to afford an additional evidence of the
electric origin of this phaenomenon, and as such I hope they may
interest some of your readers.

          GENTLEMEN,                                 March 15, 1858.
   My friend Dr. Robinson of Armagh has been so good as to point
out to me the fact, that a modification of Gaugain's rheometer
has been suggested by Jacobi which combines the advantage of M.
Gaugain's arrangement with a freedom from liability to those errors
of which I sought to determine the laws in a paper on the adjust
ments of the tangent-galvanometer       published in last February's
Number of the      Philosophical Magazine.   As Jacobi does not seem
to have contemplated this advantage in the form which he gave
to the instrument, it may be useful to direct the attention of phy
sicists to its existence.
   Gaugain's rheometer, as modified by Jacobi, consists of two equal
current circles having a common axis, along which they are sepa
rated by an interval equal to the radius of either.    The needle is
swung midway between them, and the circles are to be traversed in
the same direction by currents of equal intensity.
                           I am, Gentlemen,
                                         Yours faithfully,

ON  THE ACTION OF THE ELECTRIC CURRENT                                     ON AQUEOUS   SOLU
 TIONs of CHLORINE, BROMINE, AND IODINE.                                      BY M. A. RICHE.
   On passing an electric current through a solution of chlorine pre
pared in the dark with boiled distilled water, two kinds of phaeno
mena are observed. The first effect of the current, like that of
light and heat, is to decompose the water, whereby the oxygen
escapes, and the nascent hydrogen recombines with the excess of
chlorine, forming hydrochloric acid.            Soon, however, the opposite
effect is produced, that                  is,
                                 the nascent hydrogen escapes           the free             in
state, while the nascent oxygen combines with the chlorine present.
   Thus with ten          Bunsen's elements, the volume
                                 of                                free oxygen     of
after the first eleven minutes was about double that             the hydrogen.    of
In   about            an
                 hour the whole quantity                             of
                                                    the gases liberated were
nearly equal, showing that the hydrogen was gaining                the oxygen.         on
        an
of In
         hour and fifty minutes after the commencement, equal volumes
    hydrogen and oxygen were liberated             fifty-three and eighty-nine
                                                                     in
minutes respectively.       After four hours twenty-six minutes, the
times for the liberation          equal volumes were thirty-four minutes
                                           of
for hydrogen and 182 for oxygen.
   At this point the absorption           the oxygen was
                                                      of            maximum;      at   its
it commenced diminishing until the liberated oxygen was exactly
half that      the hydrogen.
                  of
   The oxygen absorbed forms perchloric acid with the chlorine.
M. Riche explains this phaenomenon                               by
                                                   supposing the water                            to   be
first decomposed alone, and thereby free oxygen and hydrochloric
acid     to    be

   M. Riche recommends the above method for preparing perchloric
acid.
    Bromine, iodine, hydrobromic and hydriodic acids furnished very
analogous results, with the exception that with these the oxidation
              of as
ceases       soon               as
                        bromic and iodic acids are formed, the higher
degree       oxidation not being reached.
     In the same manner, bromide            potassium gives rise
                                                       of               bromate              to

332       Mr.      J. J. Waterston         on the Integral          of Gravitation,
It  is impossible to imagine an infinite attribute belonging to a
finite entity.   It is therefore in space that the energy that con
tributes the  power   of gravitation exists, and the element of matter
merely gives to it a centripetal direction.
   This, as a consequent of the law of gravitation, seems notewor
thy from it probably being applicable to molecular forces gene
rally.  It favours the idea that the function of the material ele
ment is to give direction to a living force that pervades space.
   This is further discussed in § 14.
                            § 3.
The law of Gravitation with respect to the element of radial
     space.
   This law is usually defined with reference to a constant element
of time;  the increment of velocity generated being proportional
to the increment of time—whatever the direction or velocity of
the motion—and inversely as the square of the central distance.
If we view          reference to a constant element of radial space,
                   it with
we find that the increment of square velocity generated by the
force of gravitation is proportional to decrement of radial distance,
and inversely as square of central distance.      This holds what
ever the velocity or direction                  of the motion, whatever the orbit
of the projectile.
     Thus each element of radial distance has associated with it a
fixed element of mechanical force, to be given to or taken from
 all bodies traversing
                                  it;

element of matter is determined by the inverse square distance
of that element from another: precisely as if an emanative influ
ence had issued from each as a centre and become diluted as it
became diffused through an augmenting spherical surface.
   2. An impulse that accumulates square velocity on an element
in motion in a ratio combined of the rate at which its distance
from the central element diminishes, and of the amount of sta
tical impulse due to that distance, and to the number of elements
to which the impulse is directed.      This defines its dynamical
or force-producing  magnitude.
   3. An impulse operating exactly in the direction of and towards
the distant material element.
   4. An impulse cumulative to an apparently illimitable extent,
according to the number of the distant collocated elements of
matter:. e. g., at the earth’s surface an element of matter in pass
ing—in any direction and with any velocity—through a foot
vertical, has given to it 64 feet of square velocity. At the surface
of the sun, a foot vertical contributes 1800 feet square velocity.
   5. An impulse, that, so far as observation extends, although
dependent on matter at a distance, is uninfluenced by intervening
matter.
   6.  An impulse that is not diminished by the velocity with
which a body moves in the direction in which it operates.
   Two of these characteristics, the fifth and sixth, are physical
paradoxes of the same degree as the marvel in the wave theory
of light, that the medium or media that convey the impressions
of heat and light, although acting and acted upon by the ele
ments of bodies, presents no resistance to the planetary motions.
   The sixth has been put to the test by Laplace while seeking to
account for the secular inequality of the moon.           Mr. Adams
having lately found the treatment of this subject defective, it
might be worth while to examine analytically the influence that
an infinitesimal divergence from the law of gravitation in the
case of bodies approaching or receding from each other would
have on the planetary motions, so as to be prepared to recognize
its accumulated effects through geological periods        time. The               of

elements, matter, velocity, separately measurable.   When united
the standard of measurement is not obvious.      Is the velocity or
square of the velocity to be taken as that which takes equal part
with matter in the phaenomenon which results from their union?
This question, debated since the time of Newton”, seems now to
have settled down into a tacit admission of both. This was the
opinion of Dr. Thomas Young, who considered the fact that two
bodies while freely acting on each other obtained from their mu
tual action velocities inversely proportional to their respective
masses, as conclusive of the simple ratio of the velocity being the
natural standard.                         If
                         this proposition had been stated in other
terms as  above, $  4, viz. that bodies while freely acting on each
other obtained from their mutual action powers of producing
work inversely proportional to their masses, no such necessity of
adopting the simple ratio of the velocity would have been felt;
only a noteworthy characteristic of centripetal action. The po
sition of the centre of gyration in a revolving body is clearly on
the side of the square velocity being the natural standard. The
motion of impinging elastic bodies also requires the square
velocity.
   The following considerations as to impacts, it may be useful
to keep in view as accessory to the principle of the conservation
of force.

The condition of impinging bodies demonstrates the absurdity

rative force (§ 6).     Let the velocity acquired at the end of nine.
seconds be    9, and in the next second 10; the square velocity
increases in one second from 81 to 100, the augmentation in
each being 19, or 38 in the sum of both.         Let us now suppose
the   plates, before the  respective currents set upon them, to have
had a uniform velocity of 20 feet in the direction AB.        In nine
seconds after the currents commenced to act, the velocity of A
has become 29, and that of B 11.         In the next second, A is up.
to 30 and B down to 10, and in one second the square velocity
in A has increased from 841 to 900, and that of B decreased
from 121 to 100. The sum of both has during this second             in
creased from 962 to 1000; the augmentation being 38, as before,
when the common centre of gravity was at rest.           It will be re
marked that the relative motion of A and B, as well as the          in
 crease of their united vis viva, is the same in this last case as in
the former; nevertheless there has been a transfusion of force
 from B to A, the amount of which is 40, being equal to twice
 the velocity of the common centre of gravity.      If A had received
 no greater augmentation of square velocity than in the former
 case, the amount at the end of the tenth second would be
 841 + 19–860, but it is actually 900. Again, if B had received
 an augmentation the same as in the previous case, the amount
 at the end of the tenth second would be 121 + 19 = 140, but it
 is 100.     Hence 40 has been transfused from B to A.
     If the motion of the common centre of gravity had been in a
 direction perpendicular to AB, the relative motion and augmen
 tation of united vis viva would be the same, but there would be
 no transfusion; it is only when the current acts in the direction
 of or contrary to the absolute motion.
     Suppose the plates A, B to revolve around their common.
  centre of gravity with such velocity that the centrifugal tendency
 just equilibriates the effect of the currents. So long as the
 centre of gravity is at rest, no force is given to or taken from the
 impinging currents or particles; but when rectilineal motion is
  given to the system, transfusion takes place.     The greatest rate
  at which this takes    place  is when A and B are in the line of
 their absolute motion. At other parts of the revolution, when
 A and B have a position oblique to the direction of absolute
 motion, the rate of transfusion is diminished in the ratio of the
 cosine of the contained angle.      During one half of a revolution,
  the absolute motion resolved in the direction of the current goes
 with the current upon one of the plates and against it on the other,
  so that the flux and reflux of the force upon each plate alternates,
  positive and negative to exactly the same amount.
     It is thus that we may obtain a clear conception of transfu
  sion as a necessary sequent to the mode of action of the forces of

Destruction and Reproduction of Force in Nature is apparent,
  not real.
     In the mutual action of bodies there is an apparent destruc
tion and reproduction of force, but the more such phaenomena
are investigated experimentally with respect to their quantita
tive elements, the more reason there is to believe that the disap
pearance and reappearance are merely transference from one
agent to another, and are as exactly regulated as the communi
cation of force by impact in the preceding examples.
   Even if we had not those proofs of the existence of a universal
medium that the undulatory theory of light supplies, it would
be well to admit the existence of media to which ordinary mat
ter may be assumed to be entirely subordinate in             their poten                       all

    In great storms, the wind, on both sides of the line of mini
mum pressure, blows towards that line directly or obliquely.
    I have examined also Redfield's, Reid's, Piddington's, and
Thom's storms in the following manner:—In reading the account
                           I
of a storm, spread the chart on which was laid down the posi
tion of the ships in the storm, and drew arrows showing the                                                                                    di
rection of the wind at a particular moment, and    found that all                                                I
the arrows of the ships within the violence of the hurricane
pointed inwards to a central space of no great magnitude.
   So of tornadoes: they have been examined as they pass through
forests and cities, by Bache, Henry, Walter Johnson, Loomis,
Olmsted, Prof. Eustice and the Rev. Mr. Brooks; and they      de                                                                        all
clare, without   dissenting voice, that the air blew inwards, and

bodies backwards      the front                         by

        If the    on the right of the last equation is zero, the
                 expression

that this point is precisely that which constitutes the centre of
maximum percussion; for to make

and consequently to the supposition that the given percussion nE
has one of the values

but these are precisely the values of the two marima percussions;

    Lastly,   the second part
                   if               our equation were negative, the

    Hence the curve       the centres  of equal percussion n/2 of                                              is   an

the body strikes with the same force, but in an opposite direction.
   The magnitude of this percussion is measured by that of the
couple divided by the diameter 28 which the plane of the couple
determines in the central ellipse.
   32. A close relation, too, may be established between this
theorem and that in art. 20, so as to include both in one enun
ciation.  For without distinguishing the two kinds of impulsion
which the body may have received, and regarding merely the
motion it possesses, it is evident that in both cases we have to
consider a body which actually turns around a spontaneous axis
OS situated in one of its principal planes. Now in art. 20 we
found the centre of marimum percussion D to be situated in the
direction GO of the diameter 28 conjugate to the direction of
the spontaneous axis, and      distance             =

360                       Mr. D. Waughan                on the Solar Spots
meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of
 Science,   I alluded to the influence of large planets in altering
the amount of luciferous aether supplied to suns, and thus causing
a periodical occurrence of spots on our own luminary, and far
more decided changes in the brilliancy of many of the stars. On
comparing my theoretical conclusions with the results of obser
vations on the variable stars, the coincidence appears so satisfac
tory that       I
               again venture to call attention to the subject.
    The action of gravity must cause the aether of space to increase
its  density, not only              on
                                  the surfaces         suns and planets, but
                                                                   of
also along the regions through which they have taken their rapid
course.     To prove this,               only necessary
                                          it   is               investigate the    to
movements            of      an
                         immense number              bodies not larger than
                                                                of
cannon-balls;         they were scattered over

city, until they came within the range                                   of
                                                        the sun’s attraction.
It  will   bereadily seen, that the several planes                which each        in                     of

                                    the solar power, must have common                            a

                     in   a                                            their pri         of

and the space along this line would                  most densely populated

prevent the particles           the ofinterplanetary    medium from descri

  large planets have the power of concentrating the aetherial me
    dium in the regions over which they move; especially when their
    orbits are so wide, and the movement of the system so rapid,
    that their tracks in space deviate little from a straight line.
        Had the planets moved in planes coincident with the line of
    solar motion, the columns of dense aether which the larger ones
   leave behind them, would alternately pass over the sun and cause
   a perceptible augmentation of his brilliancy.                  In many of the
   distant   systems,     the track of the central body has so small an

The glacier moves.          yields     conformity with the sinuosities

 “M. Rendu,” says Professor Forbes, “has the candour not to
treat his ingenious speculations as leading to any certain result,
not being founded on experiments worthy of confidence. . . . My
theory of glacial motion, then, is this:—A glacier is an imperfect
fluid or viscous body, which is urged down slopes of a certain incli
 nation by the mutual pressure of           parts.”        its

the change of curvature may be inferred from an experiment

the Mer de Glace.    He divided a distance of 90 feet transverse
to the axis of the glacier into spaces of 2 feet each, and ob
served with a theodolite the gradual passage of this straight line
into a bent one.     The row of pins bent gradually so as to form
a curve convex towards the lower extremity of the glacier; their
deviations from a perfect curve were slight and irregular, nor
was any great dislocation to be observed throughout their whole
extent.    After six days the summit of the curve formed by
the forty-five pins was 1 inch in advance of the straight chord
which united       two ends.   its       not surprising     with this ex

Geological Society of France assembled at Porentruy in September
1838, M. Guyot gave the following interesting description of the
phaenomenon:-‘‘Since the word layer has escaped me, cannot               I
help recording as a subject of investigation for future observers a
                             I
fact, regarding which dare not hazard an explanation; especially
as I have not encountered it more than once. It was at the summit
of the Gries, at a height of about 7500 feet, a little below the line
of the first or high nevé, where the ice passes into a state of gra
nular snow..... In ascending to the origin of this latter (the gla
cier of Bettelmatten), for the purpose of examining the formation
and direction of the great transverse fissures,                    I
                                                        saw under my
feet the surface of the glacier entirely covered with regular fur
rows from 1 to 2 inches in width, hollowed in a half-snowy
mass, and separated by protruding plates of an ice more hard
and transparent. It was evident that the mass of the glacier
was here composed of two sorts of ice, one that of the furrows,
still snowy and more easily melted, the other that of the plates,
more perfect, crystalline, glassy and resistant; and that it was
to the unequal resistance which they presented to the action
 of the atmosphere that was due the hollowing of the furrows,
and the protrusion of the harder plates.       After having followed
them for several hundred yards, I reached the edge of a great
fissure, 20 or 30 feet wide; which cutting the plates and furrows
perpendicularly to their direction, and exposing the interior of
the glacier to a depth of 30 or 40 feet, permitted the structure
to be observed on a beautiful transverse section.         As far down
as  my  vision could reach         I
                              saw the mass of the    glacier composed
of a multitude of layers of snowy ice, each two separated by one
                                       I
of the plates of ice of which have spoken, and forming a whole
regularly laminated in the manner of certain calcareous slates.”
    A description of this structure, as observed upon the glacier of
the Aar, was communicated by Professor Forbes to the Royal
Society of Edinburgh on the 6th of December 1841, and pub
lished in the Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal for 1842*.
 He was undoubtedly the first to give the phaenomenon a theo
retic significance.
    While engaged in the Lower Grindelwald glacier, we sepa
rated plates of    iceperpendicular                            the gla  of

                                              transparent ice seemed

the transparent portions were sharply defined, and exhibited elon
gated oval sections, resembling that            of

374               Professors Tyndall and Huxley on the Structure
we therefore called this disposition of                                                              Fig. 6.

In other cases, however,       the sharpness
of      outline did not exist,  but still the
 tendency to the lenticular form could
  be discerned, the veins in some cases
 terminating in washy streaks of blue.
  This structure is probably the same
  as that observed by Professor Forbes
 on the Glacier des Bossons, and de
  scribed in the following words:—
 “The veins and bands . . . . are not
 formed in this glacier by a simple
 alternation of parallel layers, but the
 icy bands have                 all

           the Mer        Glace, and finally arrived

§    5.    On the Relation                   of      Slaty Cleavage               to   the Weined Structure.

Daniel Sharpe appear     have originated this theory.   He found
that fossils contained                      in to
                         slate rocks were distorted       manner                                          in   a

 theory, by computing, from the amount of the distortion of fos
 sils, the magnitude of the change which cleaved rocks have un
 dergone”. By the united testimony of these and other observers,
 whose researches have been carried out in different places, the
 association of cleavage and compression has been established in
 the most unequivocal manner; and hence the question naturally
 arises, “Is the pressure sufficient to produce the cleavage?”
 Sharpe appears to have despaired of an experimental answer to
 this question. “If,” says he, “to this conclusion it should be
 objected, that no similar results can be produced by experiment,
 I  reply, that we have never tried the experiment with a power at
 all   to    compared with that employed; and that this may
             be                                                                                                         be

378          Professors Tyndall and Huxley on the Structure
be stated, in general terms, to be the conversion by pressure of
irregularly-formed surfaces of weak cohesion into parallel planes.
To produce lamination in a compact body such as wax, it is mani
fest, that while it yields to the compression in one direction, it
must have an opportunity of expanding in a direction at right
angles to that in which the pressure is exerted; a second cause
is the lateral sliding of the particles which thus takes place, and
which may be very influential in producing the cleavage”.
    Before attempting to show the connexion between this theory
and the case at present under consideration, a mode of experi
ment may be described which was found to assist in forming a
conception of the mechanical conditions of a glacier, and which
has already been resorted to by Professor Forbes in demonstra
tion of the viscous theory. Owing to the property of ice de
scribed in § 3, the resemblance between the motion of a sub
stance like mud and that of a glacier is so great, that consider
able insight regarding the deportment of the latter may be de
rived from a study of the former.       From the manner in which
mud yields when subjected to mechanical strain, we may infer
the manner in which ice would be solicited to yield under the
same circumstances.

 if the substance were not so plastic as to prevent the formation of
 fissures, the state of things observed upon the corresponding
  portion of the glacier; namely, central fissures perpendicular to
  the longitudinal axis of the trough, and side fissures inclined to
  the same axis because pointing in the direction of the shorter
  axis of each ellipse. Between g h and ik the longitudinal ten
  sion is changed to compression; the central figure is flattened,
  while the side ones remain stretched.        In the corresponding por
 tion of the  glacier  we should    expect   the central fissures formed
 between ef and g h to be squeezed together and closed up, while
 the lateral ones would remain open.            This is also the case”.
 Between ik and m n we have          again  longitudinal  tension, and at
 the  corresponding    portions  of the   glacier  the transverse central
 crevasses ought to reappear, which they actually do.           Below the
 line  corresponding   to m  n, the  widening   of the valley, in the case
 now in our recollection, causes the ridges produced at the pre
 vious slope to break across and form prismatic blocks; while
lower down the valley these prisms are converted by the action
of sun and rain into shining minarets of ice. These results
 appear to be in perfect accordance with those arrived at by Mr.
 Hopkins on strict mechanical reasoningt.
    We will now seek to show the analogy of slaty cleavage to the
laminar structure of glacier ice.         Referring to fig. 8, it will be
seen that in the distortion of the side circles one diameter is
elongated to form the transverse axis of the ellipse, while another
is compressed to form the conjugate axis. In a substance like
mud, as the elongation of the major axis continues,               inclina                          its

substance one of limited extensibility like ice, fissures would be
formed when the tension had reached a sufficient amount, or in
other words, when the major axis of the ellipse had assumed a
definite inclination to the axis of the glacier.
    Thus, in a glacier of the form represented by our trough, owing
to the swifter motion of the centre, we have a line of maximum
pressure oblique to the wall of the glacier, and a line of maximum
tension perpendicular to the former; crevasses are formed at
right angles to the direction of tension, and it is approacimately
at right angles to the direction of pressure, as in the case of slate
rocks, that the lamination of glacier ice is developed.
    Under ordinary circumstances, therefore, the lamination near
the sides of the glacier would, in accordance with the theory of
compression, be oblique to the sides, which it actually                                                              is.    It

the following passage:—“It will be understood that I do not now
 suppose that there is any parallelism between the phaenomenon
 of rocky cleavage and the ribboned structure of the ice.” This
reads like the giving up of a previously held opinion; the term
 now being printed in italics by Professor Forbes himself.                The
 adoption of the viscous theory appears to have carried the renun
 ciation of this idea in its train.
    Later still, and from a source wholly independent of the former,
 we have received additional testimony on the point in question.
 The following quotation is from a letter, dated 16th November,
 1856, received by one of us from Professor Clausius of Zurich,
 so well known in this country through his important memoirs
 on the Mechanical Theory of Heat:-" must now,” writes M.             I
 Clausius, “describe to you another singular coincidence.                  had                        I
 read your paper upon the cleavage of rocks.                 and it occurred...
 to me at the time that the blue veins of glaciers, which indeed                                              I
 had not seen, but which had been the subject of repeated con
 versations between Professor Studer of Berne, Professor Escher
 von der Linth, and myself, might be explained in the same man
 ner. When, therefore,                        I
                                  reached the Rhone glacier for the first
 time, I walked along it for a considerable extent, and directed
my attention particularly to the structure.                repeated this on I
the other     glaciers   which      visited       I
                                             during   my  excursion.       did                        I
 not indeed pursue the subject so far into detail as to be able in
of all         deduce the blue veins from the existing conditions
     cases    to

the case   in  the glacier        the Rhone, where

most    distinctly,   and where also their       position  harmonized with
the pressure endured                      by

   On the evening                    of   the 24th     of       July       he   walked           up   the    hill   of

Charmoz to a height of about 1000 feet above the level of the
glacier, and favoured by the peculiar light of the hour, observed
“a series of nearly hyperbolic brownish bands on the glacier,
the curves pointing downwards, and the two branches mingling
indiscriminately with the moraines.” The cause of these bands
was the next point to be considered, and his examination of them
satisfied him “that the particles of earth and sand and disinte
grated rock, which the winds and avalanches and water-runs
spread over the entire breadth of the ice, formed a lodgement in
those portions of the glacier where the ice was most porous, and
that, consequently, the “dirt-bands’ were merely indices of a pe
culiarly porous veined structure traversing the mass of the glacier
in these directions.”
    Professor Forbes was afterwards led to regard these intervals
as the marks of the annual growth of the glacier; he called the
dirt-bands “annual rings%,” and calculated, from their distance
apart, the yearly rate of movement.               In fine, the conclusion
which he deduces from the dirt-bands                that glacier throughis,        a

which appeared to be an exact miniature of those exhibited by
the glacier. On fig. 10 is a sketch of the bands observed upon
the surface of the mud, which, however, falls short of the beauty
and symmetry of the original.       These experiments have been
varied in  many  ways, with the same general result.
    In conclusion we would remark, that our joint observations
upon the glaciers of Switzerland extended over a period of a few
days only.    Guided by the experience of our predecessors, much
was seen even in this brief period; but many points of interest
first suggested themselves during the subsequent experimental
investigation. While, therefore, expressing our trust that the
substance of the foregoing memoir will be found in accordance
with future observation,          we would also express our belief in the
necessity   of such        observation.  Indeed the very introduction of
the principle of regelation, without which it may be doubted
whether the existence of a glacier would be at                        all
                                                           possible, opens,
in  itself, a new field      investigation.
                               of               This and other questions
introduced      inthe  foregoing   pages,   must,   however,      discussed be

methyle.

the more emergetic phosphide of sodium.      After many unsuccessful
experiments, however, we were compelled to abandon this plan,
which is quite uncertain, unproductive, and highly dangerous.
   The question then resolved itself into the discovery of a method
which would yield us the desired substances conveniently, without
danger, in considerable quantity, and in a state of absolute purity.
    It appeared that the action of terchloride of phosphorus on
zinc-methyle, zinc-ethyle, &c., the remarkable substances discovered
by Dr. Frankland some years ago, would enable us to attain the con
templated result.   Experiment has fully confirmed this anticipation.
   The bases Mes P and Es P, the products of this reaction, which
we propose to call respectively trimethylphosphine and triethyl
phosphine, remain united with chloride of zinc, and a simple                                                                          di

ceding abstract, a comparison of these substances with the corre
sponding terms of the nitrogen-, arsenic-, and antimony-series
is unavoidably forced upon us. Whether we consider the compo
sition, or whether we review the properties of these groups, the
most striking analogies, indeed an almost perfect parallelism, cannot
be mistaken; similar formulae, similar modes of combination, similar
decompositions.
   This analogy is particularly manifest in the compounds belonging
to the ammonium-type.            In these remarkable bodies, nitrogen,
phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony appear to play absolutely the
same part.     It is more especially in the oxides of these compound
metals that the analogy of composition induces a perfect identity of
properties, and, indeed, of very salient properties, which may be
traced in almost every direction.                                         If

  The phosphorus-compounds accordingly hold a position inter
mediate between the mitrogen-compounds on the one hand, and the
arsenic- and antimony-series on the other. It cannot, however,
be denied that the phosphorus-bodies exhibit rather a tendency
towards the arsenic- and antimony-series, than towards the nitrogen
group.
   This cannot surprise us, when we consider the close analogies
which phosphorus and arsenic present in many other directions.
Both phosphorus and arsenic form well-characterized polybasic
acids; the acids of antimony are not yet sufficiently investigated,
but the acids of nitrogen, which are better examined, are      found                                 all
to    bemonobasic.    The equivalent numbers, too,      phosphorus,                       of
arsenic, and antimony, present remarkable connexion, the difference

    The original instructions of Prof. Piazzi Smyth had been purely
astronomical, and were to ascertain how much telescopic vision could
be improved by eliminating the lower third of the atmosphere.             In
furtherance of this view, he erected the Sheepshanks equatorial of
the Edinburgh Observatory on Mount Guajara in Teneriffe at a
height of 8903 feet, and found the space-penetrating power ex
tended from mag. 10 to mag. 14, and so great an improvement in
definition, that a magnifying power of 240 could be used with more
satisfaction on the mountain, than one of 60 in Edinburgh. After
a month's experience of this station, he ascended to a higher one—
the Alta Vista—at a height of 10,702 feet on the eastern slope of
the Peak, and there erected the large equatorial of Cooke, lent for
the occasion by Mr. Pattinson of Newcastle. The definition was here
admirable, and the telescope equal, if not superior, to             the test         all
objects it   was turned upon.          comparative hypsometric estimate
                                             A

    The reason of this difference between the effect of the ground glass

     Mr.       J.    Phillips on the Gold-field of Ballaarat, Victoria.                                        401
rests on the older drifts; and at Tower Hill, near Warnambool, ma
rine or estuary beds of probably the same age are overlaid by vol
canic ashes.   A third and still more recent gold-drift is found on
the surface, overlying indifferently any of the older deposits.
   The gold is found at the base of these drifts or gravels, which are
the result of the immediate waste, by atmospheric and fluviatile
action, of older masses, and have not been far transported.       The
largest amount of gold is found in the drifts when near the Silurian
schists.  The author believes that there is every probability of gold
deposits existing under the greater portion of the lava-plains of the
region to the westward.
  Mr. Selwyn also described a cave which he had discovered in the
basaltic lava of Mount Macedon, a few miles north of Melbourne,
and in which he had found bones of many living species of mam
mals, including the “devil” of Tasmania, and the Dingo or native
dog.    The cave is about 1000 feet above the sea-level, and thirty
miles inland.

 the old river-courses that formed the gully-drifts, and caused the
 drainage water of the region to be accumulated in lakes.
    The next deposit is a coarse ochreous quartzose drift, considered
by the author to be the effect of some sweeping deluge; and this is
 also overlaid by a third bed of trap-rock, with the charred remains
 of a forest intervening.    This trap is covered by a mottled clay of
 pure quality, also regarded as lacustrine.
    A fourth trap succeeds, covered by a superficial quartzose drift (of
 diluvial origin, according to the author), and lying on one side of
 the schistose hills, which are clearly denuded on the other.
    In the basin of the Yarrowee, which is covered chiefly with this
 gravel, the author traces the run of the “gold-leads” or old gullies,
which have only an approximative resemblance to the ramifications
of the present river. These ancient gullies or leads had a very uni
form fall, which, from the smallness of the contents of the gullies,
must have been as rapid as 16 in 1000, while the fall of the present
Yarrowee has only a fall of 8 in 1000.
    Mr. Phillips urges that                           all
                                the basin between the gold-leads may

   At Ballaarat, Mr. Redaway observed, in a pit on Sevastopol
Hill, two layers of bluestone (the second bed about 80 feet thick)
above the gold-drift or “wash-dirt,” together with stiff clays and
quartzose gravels.    Here the author traced some gold-runs—the
“Frenchman's    Lead,”  “White Horse Lead,” and “Terrible Lead,”
running parallel to each other in a direction transverse to that of
the present gully, and from hill to hill.     Like all other “ leads,”
these rise generally in the neighbourhood of a quartz-vein (or
“quartz-reef"), are shallow at first, 2 or 3 feet in depth, and gra
dually get deeper.
   4. “Notes on some Outline-drawings and Photographs of the
Skull of Zygomaturus trilobus, Macleay, from Australia.” By Prof.
Owen, F.R.S., F.G.S.
   About a month since Prof. Owen received from Sir R. Murchison
seven photographs, three of which are stereoscopic, of perhaps the
most extraordinary Mammalian fossil yet discovered in Australia.
   These photographs, with a brief printed notice of their subject by
William Sharp Macleay, Esq., F.L.S., and some MS. notes by J. D.
Macdonald, M.D., R.N., had been transmitted to Sir R. Murchison
by His Excellency Governor Sir W. Denison, from Sydney, New
South Wales; and by desire of Sir Roderick the Professor brought
the subject under the notice of the Geological Society of London, to
whom      Sir Roderick desires to present the photographs on the part
of His Excellency Sir W. Denison.
   Professor Owen had some weeks previously received from George
Bennett, Esq., F.L.S., of Sydney, outlines of the same fossil skull,
made by him on the reception of the specimen by the authorities of
the Australian Museum at that town; and the Professor had penned

low cylinder with an even top, like the flame of an Argand burner;

beautifully serrated above, and resolves itself into a series of vertical
columns of flame with narrow dark intervals between, thus marking
in a very striking way the intermitting nature of the explosive com

 around the centre.

      NOTE ON THE MODE IN WHICH THE PHOSPHATES                   PASS  INTO
                          PLANTS.      BY M. P. THENARD.
      Phosphate of lime is soluble in aérated water, but the phosphates
 of iron and alumina are insoluble in that fluid. When 50 grammes
 of one of the soils examined by the author (soils produced by the
  decomposition of jurassic rocks) are placed in a Seltzer water-bottle
  and filled up with acrated water saturated with phosphate of lime,
 corked and shaken, if the water be filtered in three or four days, the
 lime is found under the form of carbonate, but not the smallest trace
 of phosphate.         With artificially prepared alumina or oxide of iron in
 place of the natural soil, the result is identical.       In all the soils ex
  amined      by  the  author,    the  phosphates  always  had a sesquioxide
  (alumina or iron) for their           base, and never a  protoxide  (lime or
  magnesia).        And when phosphate of lime was mixed with the soils,
  the action of the rains and a few weeks of contact were sufficient to
  cause the complete disappearance of the phosphate added.
       In the list of natural elements to which agricultural chemists have
  directed their attention, there is not one which dissolves the sesqui
  phosphates; so that we might logically conclude that, as the sesqui
  oxides are only contained in plants in infinitesimal quantities, the
  plants ought to be almost completely destitute of phosphoric acid.
  There must consequently be some special arrangement for the intro
  duction into plants of the considerable amount of phosphoric acid
  found in their ashes.
       In studying    the silicates, the author was led to think that certain
   silicates of lime must be far more soluble than was generally sup
  posed; on treating a great excess of chloride of calcium dissolved in
   a large quantity of water, with a silicate of soda as neutral as pos
   sible, the silicate of lime formed had the power of dissolving freely
   in water in the proportion of 6 decigrims. per litre.
       Reflecting on the insolubility of the silicates of alumina and iron
   and of phosphate of lime in water, and the solubility of the latter in
   aérated water, the author was led to suspect that it might be by

406                  Intelligence and Miscellaneous            Articles.
means of silicate of lime and other soluble silicates that phosphoric
acid is set free from its compounds with iron and alumina, and this
view was confirmed by the following experiments:—
    A solution of silicate of lime, mixed with phosphate of alumina,
pure or containing an excess of alumina, is put into one of the
common apparatus for preparing acrated water.        The liquid is then
saturated, in the ordinary manner, with carbonic acid, and the
whole is left to digest for twenty-four hours, shaking it from time to
time.    If the liquid be then removed and filtered, the ordinary reac
tions demonstrate the presence of a considerable quantity of phos
phate of lime.
    In operating upon a soil instead of phosphate of alumina, taking
the precaution to boil it for fourteen or fifteen hours with an excess
of silicate of lime, the same result is obtained.
    This experiment cannot furnish a means of determining the
amount of phosphates in a soil; it is qualitative, and by no means
quantitative; it is simply a moment of passage, but it is of this
moment that plants appear to take advantage in order to appropriate
the phosphates they require.         Fortunately this moment is pro
longed as long as there are silicates in solution, and as this is the
case in all soils in which plants grow, the latter are always fur
nished with a larger or smaller quantity of protophosphates.       It is
a sort of change effected at the expense of the silicates, whilst the
iron and alumina fix the unappropriated phosphoric acid, and retain
it in the soil for the benefit of future generations of plants.
    After instancing some districts in France in which the presence or
absence of phosphates or silicates in the soil directly influences the
selection of manures, the author states that it is especially to the
silicate of lime that he attributes the property of decomposing the
sesquiphosphates.      The silicate of magnesia would probably have
                                        --
the same action; the silicates of soda and potash act upon the com
pounds formed by stable manure in the soil, so as to complicate the
phaenomenon  and render conclusions                     more    doubtful.         —   Comptes

    it has  already  been shown that such   affinity  may  be expressed in
    units of heat (calories).
       The determination of the mechanical equivalent of heat was one
    of the consequences flowing from an investigation of the kind just
    described, inasmuch as I have succeeded in expressing in kilogram
    metres the work done (travail moteur) by molecular attraction (che
    mical affinity), in the same manner as the work done by universal
    gravitation (weight) had already been expressed.
       Thus, as announced in my last memoir, I have checked by inverse
    experiments the results I had obtained, and on which I reposed con
    fidence.
       In fact, I raised 426 kilogrammes 1 metre by means of 1000
    heat-units furnished by affinity and put into activity by the replace
    ment of hydrogen by zinc in hydrated sulphuric acid.       I have now
    shown how much heat is caused by the expenditure of work due to
    the motive force of a previously raised weight, and I can substitute
    the action of weight for that of chemical affinity.
       The experiments which I am about to describe present consider
    able analogy with those published by Mr. Joule, and which led him
    to numerical results not very different from those since obtained
    experimentally by other physicists.
       In my new researches, the work done by the fall of a weight is
    expended upon a break, enclosed in a mercurial calorimeter (thermo
    metre à calories).   In none of the experiments were less than 300
    heat-units produced, this corresponds to a length of about 75 milli
    metres of the calorimetric tube.
                                                                ---     -
       The arrangement of the apparatus is as follows:–
       The capacity of the calorimeter is about 5 litres. The break is
    placed in a box 12 centimetres in length and breadth, and 18 centims.
    deep.   It is fastened by means of three milled-headed screws, by
    which it may be raised or depressed at pleasure. This break, skil
    fully made by M. Santi of Marseilles, is 11 centims. wide and 16
    centims. deep. It consists essentially of two vertical uprights, car
    rying in their sockets a steel axle. This axle carries a cylindrical
    drum throughout its whole length, which is divided in the middle by
    a disc, thus forming two reels, upon each of which a separate catgut
    cord is wound.     These cords are wrapped in opposite directions,
       A weight of 10.268 kilogrammes, hung at the extremity of one of
    these cords, in addition to the permanent weight of 2 kilogrammes,
    unwinds the cord to which it is applied, and at the same time winds
    up the other cord, overcoming the tension in      caused          it,
                                                                  another                  by

 LII.   On the Optical Properties developed in Transparent Bodies
           by the Action of Magnetism.           By M. VERDET*.

 A".             having determined the laws according to which the
          optical properties developed by magnetism in transparent
 bodies vary with the magnitude and direction of the magnetic
 forces,   I   undertook to investigate how these phaenomena are
 influenced by the nature of the transparent body. This have            I
 done by measuring the rotation of the plane of polarization,
 effected by bodies of very different nature, when placed under
 analogous circumstances, between the poles of an electro-mag
 net.    Former labours of physicists have afforded me very scanty
 information on this subject. Previous to my undertaking this
 investigation, the only data which science possessed, consisted
 in a small number of numerical determinations contained in the
 memoirs of MM. Bertin, Edmond Becquerel and Wiedemann,
 and in the much more numerous and varied experiments of
 Prof. Faraday, which latter, however, were intended to show the
 general nature of the phaenomena without attempting their mea
 surement. From so small a number of facts, it was impossible

to deduce any general law with certainty; and shall show that,
in reality, those laws which have been sought to be established
are inexact.

    In order to study the question, have merely had to apply
to a sufficient number of substances the methods which                   I  de

scribed   in my first memoir, adopting, however, certain modi
fications, the effect of which has been to cause either an increase
in the magnitude of the phaenomena to be observed, or a dimi
nution in the duration of the experiment, without in the least
impairing the exactness of measurement.            In place of the great
armatures made use of in my former researches, I have employed
much smaller ones, consisting of iron plates 8 millims, thick,
in the form of regular hexagons whose sides are 13 millims. long*.
The effect of this has been,                          all
                                     other conditions being the same,
to  increase considerably both the magnetic and optical actions;
and even when these two actions have not been constant through
out the whole thickness         the substance placed between the ar

matures, yet such variation has not been attended              any incon
venience.     For when    any   two   transparent   bodies      the same
thickness have been placed successively              the same position     in
between the armatures          the electro-magnet, the several corre

                      both have been subjected           equal magnetic            to
actions, and have therefore exercised optical actions proportional
to  the specific optical actions         the two bodies.    ofHence

clear that the sums        these       of
                                   elementary   optical actions,   that
the total observed rotations, bear the same proportion                 one                             to

   The azimuth of the plane of polarization was always deter
mined by observing the passage-tint (teinte de passage). When
the body under examination is colourless or faintly coloured, it
is known that the passage-tint indicates the plane of polariza
tion of the middle yellow rays; but the case is quite different
with a strongly coloured body, and grave errors are incurred                                                   if,

           Transparent Bodies by the Action                          of Magnetism.                          413
by examining the passage-tint from distilled water, through a
thickness of the coloured substance under investigation, equa
to that afterwards employed in acting on the light. The lumi
mous pencil which fell upon the analyzer had thus the same
composition as in the case of the coloured substance.     The
passage-tint in both experiments corresponded therefore to the
plane of polarization of the same colour of the spectrum, and the
relation of the deviations of this tint gave the relation between
the optical actions.
   Finally, the particular nature of the substances which           ex                                  I
amined, rendered another correction necessary.          In order that
my experiments might be confined to perfectly definite bodies
and such as may be obtained in a state of perfect purity,         have                              I
only examined liquids*; and these of course had to be introduced
into cases closed at their ends with transparent plates. If care
be taken to choose plates of glass free from flaws, and to close
the cases in such a manner that the pressure upon the plates is
sufficiently small and uniformly distributed upon their whole
circumference, then the plates, in their ordinary state, have no
action upon polarized light; but under the influence of mag
netism they exercise a sensible action, which assists the action
of the liquid, and which must therefore be taken into account.
For this purpose, before employing a case in my experiments, I
examined        it,
              successively, empty and full      distilled water,     of                                   so    as

   In his Traité de l’Electricité, M. De la Rive, after having de
scribed the principal experiments bearing on the magnetic rota
tions of the plane of polarization, and having developed certain
theoretical ideas, makes use of the following words*:—
   “Thus the magnetic force only acts upon the aether by the
intervention of particles, and when the aether has a certain den
sity due to the action exerted upon it by the particles between
which it is placed; the magnetic action being more intense ac
cording as the density of the aether is greater.     Now, inasmuch
as the density of the aether does not depend exclusively upon that
of the body, that              is,
                       upon the approximation      the particles com     of
posing    it,
            but also upon   the nature     these particles,
                                                          of   follows                    it
that it    not always the denser body which
          is                                      the most refrang       is
ent, and which therefore shows the greatest magneto-rotary
                                                                                                     of on
polarization. Experiment completely confirms this view; and
glancing      the Table (still very incomplete)
               at                                  the coefficients      of
magnetic polarization, we are struck with the fact that the sub
stances    this Table follow almost the same order as
          in                                                the Table                  in
of  their refractive powers.     New investigations are requisite                                    to
establish fully the analogy which        have just pointed out, and
                                                     I
especially      to

ather experiences under the influence   magnetism.”            of
   This remark             of Rive attracted my notice during my

cation, because they have the advantage of reminding us of the
direction of rotation.     Water, sulphide of carbon, glass and
other bodies whose magneto-rotary power is positive, turn the
plane of polarization in the direction in which the positive cur
rent of electricity traverses the conducting wire of the electro
magnet: protosalts of iron and analogous bodies turn the plane
of polarization in the direction in which the negative current
passes through the same wire.      It is scarcely necessary to men
tion, that in the numerical Tables these two kinds of rotary
powers are denoted by + and —.
    However concentrated the solutions were of the protosalts of
      I
iron, only observed a greater or less diminution in the rotation
 of the plane of polarization: a solution of the protochloride,
concentrated to the crystallizing point, showed a magneto-rotary
power absolutely nothing; but I have not succeeded in effecting
an entire reversion of the rotation.       I
                                           had hopes of succeeding
in  this, and of thus   directly demonstrating   the negative rotary
powers of protosalts of iron, in seeking for some solid compound
rich in the protoxide of iron, and either uncrystallized or be
longing to the cubic system of crystallization.         Red garnet,
 which may contain as much as 30 per cent. of protoxide of iron,
 appeared suitable for the verification of this conjecture; but
 among numerous pieces examined, not one was found sufficiently
 free from flaws for experiment.
    The magneto-rotary power of salts of the peroxide of iron,
 like that of the protoxide salts, is negative; but it is much
 greater and more easily shown than that of the protosalts.
Perchloride of iron especially gives very remarkable results. A
very dilute aqueous solution of this salt has a magneto-rotary
power less than that of water.        According as the solution is
concentrated the rotary power diminishes, becomes nothing, and
finally changes sign: after the change of sign the power                   in
creases up to the maximum of concentration.         Thus, a solution
near the maximum, containing 40 per cent. of perchloride,
exerts an action on polarized light contrary to that of water,
and from six to seven times as great; that                 is,
                                                     nearly equal           to

itself, has scarcely any action on polarized light, and although it
 dissolves a considerable quantity of the perchloride, yet remains
 much more transparent than water, aether or alcohol containing
the same quantity of salt. Thus, on dissolving 55 parts of
the crystallized perchloride in 45 parts of wood-spirit, a liquid
is obtained which, on account of              transparence,       suitable   its                                   is

 424        M. Verdet    on the Optical Properties developed in
 my second memoir”, gave rise to rotations of too feeble a kind:
 with a thickness of 3 or 4 centimetres the solution was not suffi
 ciently transparent for accurate observations.
    Nitrate of the peroxide of iron, subjected to the action of mag
 netism, exerts an action on polarized light in the same direction
 as the perchloride, but of less energy. An aqueous solution of
 this salt has a less magnetic power than water: when the solu
 tion is quite concentrated, the rotary power is almost nothing,
 but there is no change of sign in the rotation.
    The two prussiates of potash, or double cyanides of iron and
 of potassium, seemed to me to be worthy of a special study. In
fact, we know from the experiments of Faradayt and Plückert,
 that the yellow prussiate is diamagnetic, and the red prussiate
 magnetic.      I have found that the magneto-rotary power of the
yellow prussiate is positive and moderate, while that of the red
prussiate is negative and very great. 15 parts of the red prus
 siate dissolved in 85 parts of water, give a liquid whose magneto
 rotary power is negative, and in absolute value nearly double
that of water.      Inasmuch as it will be seen in the sequel that
there are diamagnetic compounds of magnetic metals whose
magneto-rotary power is negative, it is probable that the posi
tive power of the yellow prussiate is not owing to the diamag
netism of this compound, but to the fact that the physical pro
perties of the iron it contains are as completely masked as the
chemical ones.
    Nothing is easier than to prepare an aqueous solution of per
chloride of iron or red prussiate of potash, suitable for showing,
even on the lecture-table, the negative action of iron salts on
polarized light. Nevertheless it would be advantageous for this
purpose, and interesting for other reasons, to possess solid trans
parent bodies having the same properties as solutions.                I must
confess that my search for such bodies has hitherto been fruit
less.    Some very transparent crystals of iron-alum, 1 centim. in
thickness, given me by M. Deville, showed so high a degree of
                               I
lamellar polarization, that could make no use of them. Several
fragments of iron-glass which       I  tried, were either not sufficiently
transparent, or not sufficiently free from flaws.           I   hoped to be
more fortunate with the glasses of phosphate of lime, which M.
Margueritte has recently shown to be capable of taking up the
most varied metallic oxides.        M. Margueritte was kind enough
to have several    pieces  made for me, containing from 5 to 20 per
cent. of peroxide of iron.       But none of these pieces, even after
a  very  prolonged    re-annealing,  were found sufficiently free from
flaws for    experimenting     on.    It is probable that among the

 426             M. Verdet           on the Optical Properties developed in
 of manganese          potassium, K*Mn” Cy", which gave me a
                               and
 remarkable result. This salt, when dissolved in water, so dimi
 nishes its rotary power, that the salt itself must be regarded as
 having a negative rotary power.    Is the same the case with the
 other salts of the sesquioxide of manganese? I am not prepared
 to answer this question decisively, but the excess of negative
 power of persalts of iron over protosalts inclines me to answer
 in the affirmative.   However this may be, and remaining strictly
 within experimental limits, we see that manganese occupies in
 one respect an intermediate place between iron on one side, and
 nickel and cobalt on the other. That which is the rule with iron
  salts appears to be the exception                             with those of manganese,                                          and
  vice versd.
   The interesting property of the double cyanide of manganese
 and of potassium induced me to examine the double cyanide of
 cobalt and potassium in the hope of meeting an analogous be
 haviour; but it was found to have a positive magneto-rotary
 power of rather feeble amount. This double cyanide is even
  diamagnetic.
     Chromium.—The salts of the protoxide of chromium are so
 difficult to prepare, and especially to keep pure, that I did not
 subject them to experiment. The salts of the sesquioxide have
 so great a colouring power, that it is impossible to form an
 aqueous or alcoholic solution containing a few per cent. without
 destroying            all
                 transparence.  But chromic acid and the chro
 mates are adapted for exact experiments.        Neutral chromate                                                                      of

     Thus the two chromates of potash and chromic acid have a
 negative magneto-rotary power, and the absolute value of this
 power increases with the quantity of chromic acid. The nega
 tive power of the neutral chromate is feeble, but quite unmis
 takeable; that of the bichromate is considerably stronger, while
 that of chromic acid is comparable with the power of the proto
 salts of iron.
     The experiment with the neutral chromate of potash is espe
 cially worthy of attention. We know, in fact, that while chromic
 acid and the bichromate of potash are magnetic, the neutral
 chromate is diamagnetic”, and it is rather surprising that the
 magneto-rotary power of a diamagnetic body should be negative.
 We shall meet with other analogous examples in the sequel.
     The five metals whose compounds               have just considered have I
 long been considered as magnetic by                 physicists.    This not     all                                   is
 the case with those which follow, which have only been recog

very little upon any chemical analogies which may subsist among
the several bodies.       Chemists generally consider titanium            the                                  as

 magnetic action, and both in aqueous solution evinced a nega
 tive magneto-rotary power.       The sulphate gave a tolerably
 transparent reddish solution, whose action on polarized light
 was markedly less than that of water.       However, as     did not          I
 analyze this solution,         I
                         am only able to regard the negative cha
 racter of the action which              I
                               attribute to it on polarized light as
 simply probable. With the chloride no doubt can exist.           A
 concentrated solution of this salt, placed between the poles of an
 electro-magnet, exerts an action on polarized light almost equal
 in absolute value to that of water, and contrary in direction.
 The perfect limpidity of the solution makes the verification of
these phaenomena very easy.
     Uranium.—Mr. Faraday allows some doubt to rest upon the
position which uranium should occupy among the magnetic or
diamagnetic metals.     He found, in fact, that the protoxide was
slightly magnetic, and the peroxide non-magnetic. The red and
the black oxides of uranium, prepared by heating at a higher or
lower temperature crystals of the nitrate purified by repeated
crystallizations, are magnetic. This experiment is rendered quite
conclusive from the fact that the nitrate of uranium itself is dia
magnetic.     The nitrate of uranium is the only compound of
uranium whose magneto-rotatory power I have determined; and
 the result      I
                obtained is remarkable. An aqueous solution of
 this body, under the influence of magnetism, exerts a less action
on polarized light than the water which it contains, which leads
us to regard the magneto-rotary power of the nitrate as negative.
This conclusion is confirmed by the study of                      its
                                                      solutions, which

                                    I                          lantha        of
nium has not hitherto been examined.             Some perfectly pure

 *   The existence     three diamagnetic compounds whose magneto-rotary
                      of
power  is negative, clearly demonstrates what     before asserted, namely,
                                                       I

430      M. Verdet      on the Optical Properties developed in
that of water.    It is therefore probable that the magneto-rotary
power of the salts of lanthanium is negative; but as I did not
analyze the solution, this is not perfectly certain.
    Molybdenum.—Some metallic molybdenum which was fur
nished me by M. Debray is magnetic; and as this property also
exists in molybdic acid, purified by repeated distillations, it can
not be attributed to the presence of foreign substances. Molyb
 denum, therefore, must be added to the list of magnetic bodies.
 The soluble molybdates which               I
                                     had at my disposal—the mo
 lybdates of soda and ammonia—are diamagnetic. Their mag
 neto-rotary power is positive, but small.
    Aluminium.—M. Deville has placed aluminium among the
 feebly magnetic metals.      The analogy between aluminium and
 iron has caused this result to be regarded as very probable.
 Nevertheless I have not been able to find any compound of this
 metal which was not diamagnetic.        Even alumina, when quite
 pure, is repelled by an electro-magnet. Having in fact obtained
 some perfectly pure and strongly diamagnetic nitrate of alumina
 from the École Normale, I got from                    by
                                             calcination, some anhy

nothing for an intermediate one.      Such might be the case
without a change of sign occurring within the limits of ordinary
magnetic forces; but it is highly probable that under these cir
cumstances, and within the limits of experiment, the salts of
nickel would at least be observed to depart sensibly from the
general law of variation of magneto-rotary powers. In order to
test this,  I
            compared the rotation produced by a solution of sul

magnetic actions; and as I found the proportion between the

the method first pointed out by Won Kobell. A fragment placed
in a solution of sulphate of copper (blue vitriol) in contact with
a strip of zinc will become quickly coated with a deposit of me
tallic copper, a phaenomenon not exhibited in the case of common
coal.     Deducting ash and moisture, true anthracites present, as
a mean, the following composition:-Carbon,92%; Hydrogen, 3};
 Oxygen (with trace of nitrogen), 4. All yield an amount of coke
 equal to or exceeding 89 per cent.            The coke is frequently pul
 verulent, never agglutinated.
     The comportment of anthracite before the blowpipe has not
 hitherto been given in detail.         It is as follows:—per         the assay     se,

 long chiefly        the middle portion

   4. Cannel or Gas Coals.-These coals, at least in normal spe
cimens, do not fuse or “cake” in the fire.         They give off a large
amount of volatile matter, frequently more than half their weight;
hence their popular name of “gas coals.” They soilvery slightly,
or not at all. The coke obtained from them is sometimes fritted,
and partially agglutinated, but never fused into globular, mammil
lated masses, like that obtained from the caking coals.           It varies
in amount from 30 to 60, or, in typical specimens, from 55 to 58
per cent.     Mean composition (normal cannel):—Carbon, 80 to
85; Hydrogen, 5.5; Oxygen (with nitrogen), 9 to 12-5.
   5. Lignites or Brown Coals.-These coals, of tertiary age, differ
greatly from one another in external aspect.            Some of the so
called  jets, passing  into the cannel  coals,  are black,  lustrous, and
non-soiling; whilst other varieties are brown, and of a ligniform
or stratified structure, or, otherwise, earthy and loosely coherent.
All, however, are partially soluble in caustic potash, communica
ting to it a dark brown colour. The coke—usually of a dull
charcoal-like aspect, or in sharp-edged fragments retaining their
original form—varies from 25 to 50 per cent.           Its separate frag
ments are     rarely  agglutinated,   except   in the case of certain
varieties (as the lignites of Cuba, and those from the freshwater
deposits of the Basses Alpes in France) which contain asphaltum.
All the typical varieties of lignite, as pointed out by Cordier,
continue to burn for some time, in the manner of “braise,” or
ignited wood, after the cessation of the flame occasioned by the
combustion of their more volatile constituents; whereas with
ordinary coal, ignition ceases on the flame going out. The mean
composition of lignite may be represented by—Carbon, 67 to 75;
Hydrogen, 5; Oxygen (with nitrogen), 20 to 30.
   All the different kinds of coal enumerated above contain a
variable amount of moisture, and of inorganic matter or “ash.”
The moisture rarely exceeds 3 or 4 per cent, although in some
samples of coal it is as high as 6 or 7, and even reaches 15 or
20 per cent. in certain lignites. The amount of ash is also ne
cessarily a variable element.      In good coals it is under 5, fre
quently indeed under 2 per cent.        On the other hand, it some
times exceeds 8 or      10,  and in bad samples even 15 or 20 per
cent. The ash may be either argillaceous, argillo-ferruginous,
calcareous, or calcareo-ferruginous.      The ferruginous ashes are
always more or less red or tawny in colour, from the presence of
sesquioxide of iron, derived from the iron pyrites (FeS*) originally
present in the coal.      If much pyrites be present, the coal is not
available for furnace operations, gas making, engine use, &c.,
owing to the injurious effects of the disengaged sulphur.             Cal
careous ashes are more common in secondary and tertiary coals
than in those of the palaeozoic age.       For methods of ascertain

                          § 2. Instruments and Appliances.
   The instruments, &c. employed in these examinations are
the following:—a blowpipe, blowpipe-lamp, and small spirit-lamp
of the ordinary construction; together with the usual accessory
instruments and reagents which always accompany the blowpipe.
These require no special description.            The blowpipe may be of
any form; but for the purpose of heating small platinum vessels
in these experiments, it is convenient (although not absolutely
necessary) to add to it an extra jet with an orifice rather larger
than usual. The blowpipe-lamp should also be furnished with a
broad wick-holder of the pattern recommended b                         -
                                                                    Fig. 1.

satisfactory manner. This, however, is really of little conse
quence, as apart from the doubtful character of the experiment
even when conducted on the large scale, the relative heating
powers of different samples of coal may generally be estimated
sufficiently near for practical purposes by a comparison of the
amount of coke, ash, and moisture. The litharge test commonly
resorted to for the determination of the calorific power of coals,
when properly considered, is of very little actual value.    Take,
for example, the respective results furnished by good wood
charcoal and ordinary coke.     These results are closely alike, or
rather in favour of the  charcoal; and yet experience abundantly
proves the stronger heating powers of the coke. It is impossible
to raise the temperature of a furnace with charcoal to anything
like the same degree as that obtainable by the employment of
coke. Besides which, in practice it is not, as a general rule,

balance-case.   The weighing capsule should also be placed in
the centre of a half-sheet of glazed writing-paper, to prevent the
risk of any accidental loss during the transference.     After the
weighing, the operation must always be repeated, to ensure that
no further loss of weight occur. In place of the blowpipe-lamp,
the spirit-lamp may be employed for this operation; but with
the former there is less danger of the heat becoming too high.
By holding a slip of glass for an instant, every now and then,
over the capsule, it will soon be seen when the moisture ceases
to be given off.   It should be remarked, that some anthracites
decrepitate slightly when thus treated, in which case the por
celain capsule must be covered with a small watch-glass.

Prof. Chapman on the Assaying                   of   Coals by the Blowpipe.       443
of the sulphur is     much more troublesome operation. A pro
                           a
cess given by Berthier, in his Traité des Essais par la voie seche,
consists in boiling the ferruginous ash in hydrochloric acid, which
dissolves out the sesquioxide of iron, and then calculating the
sulphur from the loss. One hundred parts, for example, of sesqui
oxideof iron correspond to 70-03 of metallic iron; and hence to
150-24 of iron pyrites, or to 80-21 of sulphur. But this method,
besides requiring a larger quantity of ash than can be conveniently
prepared in these blowpipe examinations, exacts that the other
portion of the ash be not attackable by the acid, a condition
which of course does not obtain in the case of calcareous ashes.
For this reason, the process recommended by Rose and other
chemists is preferable, although somewhat beyond the range of
blowpipe examinations. About 200 milligrammes of the coal
in fine powder are to be intimately mixed with 8 parts of nitrate
of potash, 4 of carbonate of potash, and 16 of common salt, and
the mixture fused in a platinum crucible over the spirit-lamp,
with the wick well pulled up, or, better still, over a double-cur
rent or Berzelius's lamp. The fused mass is then to be dis
solved out in boiling water to which a few drops of hydrochloric
acid have been added, and the sulphuric acid thrown down by
chloride of barium.        By dividing the precipitate thus obtained
(after  filtration,  careful washing, and ignition) by 7-25, we get
the amount of      sulphur.
   As the above process, although simple enough in the perform
ance, is scarcely available when the operator is away from home, I
have attempted to hit upon a more ready method, and one more
properly within the legitimate pale of blowpipe experimentation,
of ascertaining approximatively the amount of sulphur in coal
samples. After various trials,              I
                                      have found the following process

          Eacistence of an  Atmosphere    surrounding the Sun.    445
 near the circumference, tend so strongly to force upon us the
 conviction of the existence of an atmosphere of no inconsiderable
 amount, that it is of some importance to inquire whether the
 motions of the spots, in passing over the disc, present any
 favourable or unfavourable indications.
    The inquiry presents difficulties of two sorts, arising, first,
 from the little suitability of solar spots in general as data in any
 matter of delicacy, from their constant liability to change of
 form; and secondly, from our entire ignorance of the law of
 density, which should be assumed for the supposed atmosphere
 under the peculiar conditions of temperature to which it must
 be subject. The first of these difficulties we must surmount as well
 as we cañ by selection of the spots for discussion: the second,     I
 shall make free to evade on the present occasion by the old
 assumption of homogeneity, proposing only to inquire what sort
 of result will be yielded by that hypothesis, which in the case of
 the earth's atmosphere is well known to afford a close represen
 tation of the observed actual effects on a ray of light.
    Let PAp     be a central section of the sun’s actual photosphere
by a plane passing through E, the centre of the earth. Let
R. Cr be the corresponding section of the atmosphere, supposed
homogeneous.        Let S P=r; S R =r (1 + h); refractive index
= m. If a ray of light from the sun’s actual limb reach the
earth by the path PR E, it will appear to have come from the
limb of a concentric sphere (the apparent photosphere), whose
section is QB q, and whose radius Q S = m.                PS;   since
sin QR S= m. sin PRS. A          spot     p
                                      at on the actual    photosphere
will appear in the direction Er q, or will be seen at q on the
apparent photosphere, under an apparent angle B Sq from the
centre of the disc, instead of A Sp the true. The position-angles
of spots will be unaffected.

differing little from half of those in the first column of our
Table I. ; that their evidence is on the whole in favour of an
atmosphere causing refractions of about half the amount there
tabulated, but is opposed to refractions much exceeding those in
amount.
   As a definitive result, the conclusion will probably be con
sidered as entitled to little weight; yet it is such as would agree
pretty well with the idea that the red protuberances are cloudy
masses of great tenuity held in suspension, as well as with the
absorptive action on light and heat, which has been previously
noticed by observers.
   It is at least satisfactory to find that the motions of the spots.
offer no objections to the admissibility of an atmosphere, such
as common       air of a uniform density increased from 8 to 10
times, and extending to a distance from the surface equal to
one-fourth the radius, but rather favour the assumption of an
equivalent atmosphere, while they suffice to assign quickly a
superior limit to         its
                        amount.

Thºr          gases are known which have the composition C*H*Cl.
         One is prepared by the action of hydrochloric acid on wood
spirit; another was prepared by Bunsen by heating basic per
chloride of kakodyle; and a third was obtained by Kolbe and
Warrentrapp, by the action of light on a mixture of equal volumes
of chlorine and marsh-gas. The first has always been considered
to be true chloride of methyle. Bunsen’s gas, although it has
similar physical properties, was held by Gerhardt to be marsh
gas, C*H*, in which one equivalent of hydrogen was replaced by
chlorine.
   Baeyrº endeavoured to decide this question by determining
the coefficient of absorptiont of the various gases. The gas
from kakodyle had for water, the coefficient of absorption—
                              At 7°     .    .    .           5-304

Below +6° C. the gas forms a solid colourless hydrate, crystal
lizing in rhombic prisms, which has some similarity with hydrate
of chlorine. Chloride of methyle from wood-spirit forms like
wise the same hydrate, and has the same coefficient of absorption;
these two gases are therefore identical.      The hydrate forms a
very convenient means of obtaining the pure gas, as otherwise
it always contains traces of oxide of methyle.
    The absorptiometric determinations of the body from marsh
gas gave not entirely accordant results, which probably arose
from     its
           containing       little hydrogen. The coefficient for 14°

454               M. Wurtz      on Chloride  of Æthylene.
containing a mixture of equal volumes of chlorine and purified
marsh-gas, are exposed to the action of feeble solar light.
When the flasks are opened over mercury, and a little potash
added, they are reduced to one-half.          The residue contains chlo
ride of methyle mixed with marsh-gas and hydrogen.                        The
chloride of    methyle    is separated   by  agitation   with  glacial  acetic
acid, in which it dissolves.         The acid, when boiled and after
wards supersaturated with caustic soda, gives off the gas which
it dissolved; the gas is collected over mercury, and purified by
digestion with a little potash. Berthelot states that it is soluble
in one-fourth its volume of water.
    By acting upon this gas with a mixture of sulphuric acid and
sulphate of silver, sulphomethylic acid is readily formed. The
simultaneous action of both these agents is necessary, as neither
separately has any action at 100° C.           From sulphomethylic acid,
the  sulphomethylate       of baryta,  and from it benzoate of methyle,
oxalate of methyle, or wood-spirit, may be readily prepared.
    The biatomic alcohol glycolº bears the same relation to chlo
ride of aethylene that ordinary alcohol does to chloride of
acthyle:—

    By the action of pentachloride of phosphorus on glycol,
Wurtzt     has obtained chloride of aethylene.          When the two sub
 stances are brought together, a brisk action takes place, hydro
 chloric acid is evolved, and there is obtained a liquid which is a
 mixture of oxychloride of phosphorus and chloride of aethylene.
 By washing with water, drying over chloride of calcium, and
 rectification, the latter body is obtained in a state of purity.
    The reaction is thus:—                         -
        C4H6O4     + 2PCl* = 2HCI+2PO2Cl3 + C4H4CI2.

    Chloride of aethylene is the hydrochloric         aether  of glycol.
    Berthelot found that olefiant gas, by the intervention of
 sulphuric acid, combined with the elements of water to form
 alcohol. This reaction could not, however, be applied to the
 preparation of the higher homologues of alcohol, from the corre

may be prepared.

     Caprylene, C*H*, and aethalene, C*H*, also combine with
 these acids, although the action, especially of the latter sub
 stance, is still slower and less complete.
     Coupert describes two bromine substitution-products of ben
  zole, obtained by bringing bromine vapour into contact with
  boiling benzole.
     Bromobenzole (bromide of phenyle), C*H* Br., boils at 150° C.
  It is a colourless liquid, with an odour resembling benzole. It
  does not solidify at —20° C.         Heated with fuming nitric acid,
  there is formed a crystalline       nitro-substitution  product of the
  formula C*H* (NO") Br, which melts at 90° C., but cannot be
  distilled without decomposition.
      Bromobenzole dissolves in fuming sulphuric acid; the solu
  tion, on standing, deposits crystals of sulphobromobenzolic acid.
  This acid is very deliquescent; it forms with ammonia an almost
  insoluble crystallizable ammonia salt of the composition
                             C12H5 Br2SO3 NH3.
      By the continued action of excess of bromine on bromoben
   zole, hydrobromic acid is evolved, and dibromobenzole, C*H*Br”,
  is formed in crystals, which are purified by recrystallization from
  aether.    It  forms beautiful oblique rhombic prisms, which melt
   at 89° C., and distil without decomposition at 219°C.

456         M, Buff    and    Wöhler on new Silicon Compounds.
of this remarkable body without the aid of the galvanic current,
have described more fully * the series of new silicon compounds,
of which a short notice has already appeared in this Journal.
  Hydrochlorate        of Protochloride of Silicon, Si2Cl3+2HCl.—
This   is prepared   by passing dry hydrochloric acid gas over cry
stallized silicon heated in a glass tube just below redness.     To
the anterior part of the tube a U-shaped tube-receiver is attached,
which is placed in a freezing mixture of ice and salt, and with
which is connected a gas-delivery tube dipping in ice-cold
water.    The tube must not be heated too high, otherwise ordi
nary chloride of silicon would be formed. The hydrochloric acid
is readily decomposed, and inflammable siliciuretted hydrogen
continually bubbles through the condensing water; at the same
time some uncondensed protochloride is carried away in the
stream of gas, which, decomposing with the water, forms a new
oxide of silicon.     In order to prevent the latter from decompo
sing, it is necessary to keep down the temperature of the water.
   After the operation is concluded, the protochloride is found in
the U-tube.      It is turbid, and contains several substances. On
distilling    it,
             it   begins     boil to28°–30°C., and the tempera
                                                  at
ture gradually rises       60°, the greater part passing over
                             to                                 40°                             at
—43°C.          This   is   the new substance.
   The protochloride          of    silicon       is   a   colourless mobile liquid,            of   an
irritating odour, fuming strongly               the air, and covering every
                                                       in
thing with     white incrustation.

                                   as                that        as
                                                               aether, and  of                       it
burns with      a feeble greenish      flame, emitting   vapours      silica and      of
hydrochloric acid. When mixed with excess                  oxygen     of   eudio       in  a
meter, and the electric spark passed through the mixture,                     ex                it
plodes with great violence, covering the inside                the tube withof
silica. The residual gas fumes strongly, and contains chloride
of   silicon and hydrochloric acid. When                    vapour    its passed       is
through     a  red-hot tube,         it decomposed into ordinary chloride
                                           is
of  silicon and hydrochloric acid. With water                 decomposes in
                                                                        it
stantaneously into hydrochloric acid and into                   new oxide    a                       of
silicon, very different         appearance from ordinary silicon.
                                 in                                          The
gaseous protochloride              also
                                   is     readily absorbed        alcohol and    by

                                       the oxide.
    The numbers obtained              the analyses show that the substance
contained some ordinary chloride, from which indeed                           ex           it   is
ceedingly difficult        by free the     protochloride,       their   boiling

alter the relation between the chlorine and the silicon.      But the
deportment of the body to aluminium showed the true state of the
case.   When the vapour of the protochloride is passed over fusing
aluminium, it is decomposed with the greatest ease, a quantity
of hydrogen is liberated, chloride of aluminium sublimes, and the
rest of the aluminium is covered with a crust of black crystalline
silicon.    From the composition of the protochloride as finally
adopted, it is clear why it is not formed when ordinary chloride
of silicon is passed over heated silicon.
   Hydrobromate of Protobromide of Silicon, Siº Brº-H2HBr.—This
is formed under similar circumstances, and has similar proper
ties to the protochloride.
    Hydriodate of Protiodide of Silicon, Si” I*4-2HI is formed in
the same manner as the foregoing compounds.         It is a dark-red
brittle mass, which fumes strongly in the air, is readily fusible,
and solidifies on cooling to a crystalline mass.       Heated more
strongly it boils and distils over. It is only slowly decomposed
by water.      It is soluble in bisulphide of carbon, with a blood
red colour, and may be obtained in dark-red crystals on concen
trating and cooling the solution.
    Hydrated Owide of Silicon, Siº 0°,+2HO.—This is formed by
 decomposing any of the preceding compounds by water, but it is
easiest obtained as a bye product in the preparation of the proto
chloride.
    After filtering off from the water it is washed with a little cold
water, and dried at first by pressing between blotting-paper and
then over sulphuric acid.
    Thus prepared it forms a snow-white, light, amorphous pow
der. It is dissolved by caustic and carbonated alkalies, and even
by ammonia, with violent disengagement of hydrogen.             It can
be heated to 300°C. without       losing  water, and without being
changed, but at a higher temperature it takes fire and burns with
a phosphorescent light, hydrogen being liberated, which inflames
with a violent explosion.
   It burns in oxygen with a brilliant light; it also burns when
heated in a covered crucible, but the residual silica is more or
less brown from amorphous silicon.         In fact, the hydrate when
heated   gives off siliciuretted hydrogen, though unfortunately only
at a temperature     at which the latter is decomposed.    When the
hydrate is heated in a tube, a gas is disengaged which fumes in
the air, but on account of the admixed hydrogen does not sponta
neously inflame. When inflamed, however, it burns, forming silica.
   The hydrate is slightly soluble in water; and the solution of
it, obtained in   the preparation of  the protochloride, being filled
with bubbles   of   hydrogen,      all
                                 has    the appearance  of being     in

state of fermentation.
   The solution   of    the hydrate has  a powerful reducing action,

precipitating metallic gold and palladium from their solutions,
and forming with silver solution silicate of the suboxide of silver.
It also reduces copper salts; and from selenious, telluric, and
sulphurous acids it liberates selenium, tellurium, and sulphur.
   The analyses lead to the formula Si” O°, 2HO; and the sub
stance can have no other composition, if the protochloride have
the formula Siº Cl*, 2HCl. But this is still an open question.
Buff and Wöhler have reason to believe that there is a still lower
chloride and a corresponding oxide, but         their endeavours        all                                   to
decide this point were fruitless.   They hope        resume   when             to                   it

 ofthe new oxide                 of
                     silicon rendered      probable that this residue

tricity; at his desire               I
                         have rewritten the following for this
periodical.
   The apparatus, consisting of the collector and the measurer,
has received a new construction at my hands, for the special
purpose of attaining the greatest possible accuracy of result.
  The essay by Duprez, which obtained the prize awarded by
the Brussels Academy in 1844, convinced me completely that
the collector must be moveable; because a fixed one cannot be
relied upon for sufficient insulation, and because            insulation can       its
never        properly checked.
              be                      The moveable apparatus which                                          I
have constructed may            any time

                                                                                 a

         immediately rendered moveable again.               By       means                its               I
have been enabled               to
                           show that the fixed     apparatuses    are subject
to   two hitherto   neglected    sources       error;   viz. first,

become charged too slowly, inasmuch                   they require      asleast                       at
from 20                  25
                    minutes before they are completely charged;

secondly, that the action          the atmospheric electricity upon the
                                           of

part     of

strument may readily be adjusted by turning round the higher di
vided circle. The glass plate covering the brassjar is surrounded
with leather, so that it can be arrested by means of a screw
passing through the brass case. By slackening this screw the
instrument may also be adjusted, but not so certainly as by turn
ing the higher graduated circle; because by screwing up the
screw, the glass plate may too readily be displaced.     On charging
the measurer, the arm of the balance must rest upon the brass strip
and form a right angle with it; for this to be effected, it must
be turned to 90° and then lowered.       The elevation and depres--
sion of the arm of the balance is effected by turning a screw, w,
which passes through a bracket, w, attached to the upper index
plate.   The end of this screw, formed into a peg, enters the top
of the brass rod upon which the glass thread is fastened, and is

korff's induction apparatus through Geisslar's tubes", and the
influence which magnetism exerts over them, I recall to your
mind that I was the first to point out this influence under a
form different, it is true, but more remarkable, in my opinion,
than that which M. Plücker has made known.                    The note which
the learned philosopher of Bonn has published respecting this
subject induced me to repeat my experiment, and has made me
feel the necessity of adding to                         its

favour of this analogy, the observation which has just been made
by Dr. Robinson (Phil. Mag. April 1858), that the light of the
aurora borealis, like the electrical light, possesses the property of
rendering those substances fluorescent which are capable of being
so, a property which is due to the presence in both lights of the
most refrangible rays.

     P.S. 19th May.—In my letter of the 10th of May, which
contained some details relative to my experiments on the rotation
of the electrical light round the pole of an electro-magnet,                                    I
have omitted a  very  important point which      now point out. Of   I
the vapours which have         I
                          successively introduced into the balloon,
that which has given   me the most  brilliant, and at the same time
the most constant results, is undoubtedly the vapour of sulphuric
aether, at the tension of 10 to 12 millims. of mercury.      Not
only is the rotation very distinct in one direction or the other,
according to the direction of the discharges and the nature of
the magnetic pole, but the experiment may be continued for a
very long time without the phaenomenon being changed in ap
pearance or rendered more difficult of perception, at the end of
a certain time, by the expansion of the jets round the cylinder,
as is the case with the other vapours.   The streams are also very
apparent and more durable.      This difference is probably due to
the vapour of aether in the balloon being in a state of greater
tension and density than the others, and to      being less rapidly  its
decomposed             by   the passage        of   the electrical discharges.

            Boston, United States, may probably not                             be              of

                  constructed by            Mr. Ritchie of       Boston,     U.S.                 467
  The primary wire is No. 9 gauge, the helix 15 inches in
length with three courses, the length about 150 feet; the inte
rior bundle of wires 18 inches long, about 1; inch diameter of
annealed iron wire of No. 16, annealed with great care, having
been a fortnight in cooling.
   The primary wire has a cover of gutta percha Tºoth of an inch
in thickness, passing through the basement to a plate of the
same, to which it is united; over this gutta-percha coating a glass
tube passes.
   The secondary helix is divided into three bundles, each 5 inches
long, wound on cylinders of gutta percha Tºth of an inch thick;
the wire in the upper and lower is of No. 33 gauge, each 25,575
feet; the middle one is of No. 32, 22,500 feet, forming a total
length of 73,650 feet; the stratum of wire is perpendicular to
the length of the helix, and the wire is wound over with silk.
    The condensers are of varnished tissue-paper of three thick
messes between each stratum of foil; there are three condensers,
with surfaces of about 50, 100 and 150 feet; by means of screws
these can be used separately or combined.
    The contact-breaker is raised by means of a ratchet-wheel
turned by the hand, which acts on a spring, so that the platina
 surfaces touch firmly.
    The upper platina has a screw and binding nut; the hammer
has also        its
                screw and binding nut: the hammer must not bear
too   heavily,   and care must         used    be adjust the screws
                                                            to           that                so
the ratchet-wheel works well.

discharge in air will disappear, for there will then not be suffi
cient time between the make and break contact to magnetize the
iron core, on which the intensity of the induced discharge mainly
depends.
    This form of the apparatus also enables the experimentalist to
examine the character of the single discharge, and which, in
respect to the phaenomena of stratification, corroborates the re
sults I have previously obtained and communicated to the Royal
 Society.
    On examining the single discharge, as taken from Ritchie’s
coil by means of Mr. Wheatstone's revolving mirror, I found
the direct spark was elongated but not divided : if a Leyden jar
is introduced in the manner first suggested by Mr. Grove, the
length of the spark is much reduced, but is increased in bril
liancy, becoming intensely bright and dense.         When this dis
charge is examined by Mr. Wheatstone’s apparatus, it is instantly
resolved into two distinct sparks, not elongated as in the direct
discharge, but separated clear and defined.          In my recent
communication to the Royal Society, I have shown that when a
Leyden jar is attached to the inner and outer terminal of the
induction coil, excited by a single cell of the nitric acid battery,
 stratifications are observable in the dark portion of the discharge
 when taken through a vacuum tube, such stratifications being
 concave in opposite directions to those which emanate from the
positive terminal of the coil. The division of the spark by Mr.
Wheatstone's apparatus shows the cause of this appearance to
be due to the double discharge.
   The method adopted by Mr. Ritchie for the winding the wire
on his secondary coils (first, I believe, suggested by Poggendorff),
is the same as used by seamen in coiling ropes on the deck of a
vessel : commencing with the inner circle, the coil gradually
extends to the outer circumference, the next layer is continued
from the outer to the inner, and this is repeated until the reel
is completed.    This method secures the secondary coil from
the risk of disruption; but it becomes liable for the discharge
to pass from the internal terminal of the secondary to the pri
mary, even when protected by a glass cover and thick gutta
percha.    Mr. Ritchie has sent me a piece of a glass cover which
was thus fractured; and having already starred, although not
actually perforated, one of my glass covers,    I    have not incurred
the risk of using the apparatus to    its   highest power.
   The maximum effect that could      be  attained with this apparatus
would,I   conclude,    be
                        about    15  inches,   the total length  of the
three secondary helices.       With five cells   of    the nitric acid
battery, each platina plate    4
                               x  8     inches,
                                            I      obtained 10   inches
spark from two coils, and    5  inches from one.      In  one instance,

a 6-inch spark was obtained, but at the same time strong dis
charges took place from the inner portion of the coil to the
glass cover; and there is little doubt that, had the experiment
been continued, the glass would have been perforated.      With
                   I
three coils have as yet only obtained a spark of 124 inches in
length; but, for the reasons already named,        shall probably                         I
not venture to excite the coil to   greatest intensity.     its

above,  that longitudinal magnetization augmented the resistance.
   The magnetization of the small piece of metal between the poles
of the Ruhmkorff electro-magnet being obviously much more                                                                        in

smaller helix, I recurred to the plan of experiment (§ 175) by
which the effect of transverse magnetization on the little rectangular
piece of nickel was first tested, and I had an equal and similar piece
of iron, and another of brass,          prepared            all

Prof. Thomson            on the    Electro-dynamic Qualities                          of Metals.            471
galvanometer electrode had to be shifted over about 4% inches on the
multiplying branch, towards the end of the testing conductor con
nected with the nickel, that is to say, in such a direction as to indi
cate a diminished  resistance in the nickel.     When the same opera
tions were  gone  through  with the nickel    placed  longitudinally be
 tween the  poles of the electro-magnet,  the  zero-point on the multi
 plying branch was shifted about 6 inches in the direction which
indicated an increased resistance in the nickel.
    The piece of iron similarly tested, gave effects in the same direc
tion in  each case, and the results originally obtained for iron (§§ 146,
155, 161–177) were thus verified.
   No effect whatever could be discovered when the piece of brass
was similarly tried.      It is much to be desired that experiments with
highly increased power, and with a better kind of galvanometer,
should be made, to discover whatever very small influence is really
produced by magnetic force on the comparatively non-magnetic
metals.
   The shifting of the neutral point on the multiplying branch, re
quired to balance the effect produced by the longitudinal magnetiza
tion in the iron, was only from 1% to 2 inches. Three inches were
required to balance the opposite effect of the transverse magneti
zation.
   Hence, with the same magnetic force, the effect of longitudinal
magnetization, in increasing the resistance, is from three to four times
as great in nickel as in iron; but the contrary effect of transverse
magnetization is nearly the same in the two metals with the same
magnetic force.      It may be remarked, in connexion with this com
parison, that nickel was found by Faraday to lose            magnetic induc           its
tive  capacity  much more       rapidly with elevation     temperature,  and      of

loss of accuracy in neglecting so small a difference. Hence the
effect of the transverse magnetization of the nickel was to diminish
its resistance in the ratio of half the length of the testing conductor
diminished by # of an inch, to that of the same increased by the
same, that is to say, in the ratio of 11% to 12:43, or of 383 to 385.
Hence it appears that the resistance of the nickel, when under the
transverse magnetizing force, was less by TH, and similarly, that
the resistance, when under the longitudinal magnetizing force, was
greater by TH, than when freed from magnetic influence; and
that the effects of the transverse and of the longitudinal magneti
zing forces on the iron were to diminish                resistance and        in

   To find whether or not there is any sensible loss of conducting
power on the whole due to the spiral              given to the individual
wires when   spun  into a  strand, it would be well worth while to com
pare very            the resistances of single wires with those of strands
spun from exactly the same stock.          This                I
                                                    have not yet had an
opportunity of doing; but the following results show that any defi
ciency which the strand may present when accurately compared with
solid wire, is nothing in comparison with the differences presented by:
different samples chosen at random from various stocks of solid wire
and strand in the process of preparation for telegraphic purposes.

    “By the aid of machinery, and through the alteration of the mining
regulations granting extended claims, the old ground has been pro
fitably re-worked; and, by the introduction of the frontage-system,
which, according to the difficulties to be overcome, grants extensive
claims on new ground, the present “leads, most of which are N.W.
of the Gravel Pits, under the townships, are advantageously worked.
The amalgamation of three or more claims is also allowed, the miners
having then to put down only one shaft.
    “The engines most in use are stationary, of from 15 to 20 horse
power, with winding and reversing gear.      To the end of the wind

is also taken to drive a puddling machine, which is nothing but the

about 300 feet, of which in some instances there are as much as
200 of basalt to be cut through.

      2. “On the Rock-basins in the Granite of Dartmoor.” By G.
 W.    Ormerod, Esq., M.A., F.G.S.
      The district examined by the author may be regarded as a central
 belt of this granitic district, occupying about one-third of Dartmoor,
  and extending over the parishes of Gidleigh, Chagford, Morton
  Hampstead, North Bovey, Withycombe in the Moor, Manaton,
  Ilington, and Bridford. Mr. Ormerod has examined most of the
 rock-basins occurring in this district himself, and made plans of them
 from measurement.       In describing them, he divided the district into
 plots, by rivers and watersheds; and he gave a slight notice of each
 tor, if it possessed any features of interest.       He also stated the
 measurements of the basins from N. to S. and from E. to W., for
 comparison; as well as their characters, depths, &c., and the direc
 tion of their longest diameter.      Vixen Tor, Mis Tor, Hounter Tor,
 the   Tolmen,   Kestor Rock,    the Puckie Stone, Middleton Hill, the
 Logan Stone, Hell Tor, Ingstone Rock, and Yes Tor were more
 especially described;     and the heights above the sea-level,-the
 presence or absence of basins on the tors—and the relative shapes
 and sizes of the basins were shown by tables.
     After observing that though probably in some cases used by the
 “Druids,” yet the basins were certainly not formed artificially,
 Mr. Ormerod proceeded to explain the differences between the
 “rock-basins” of the tors, and the “potholes” in the granite of the
 bed of the Teign; and to show that atmospheric causes alone had
 caused the formation of the former; and he pointed out the peculiar
 kinds of granite that were liable to be so decomposed as to present
either saucer-shaped, flat-bottomed, or other shaped basins on the
surface.
     3. “On the Kelloways Rock of the Yorkshire Coast.”             By J.
Leckenby, Esq.
     The author traced this interesting deposit from a short distance
to the south of Gristhorpe Bay, where it is a very thin pisolitic
band, to Red Cliff, where it presents upwards of 20 feet of sandstones,
the upper part being fossiliferous.      At other points also, near Scar
borough Pier, at the Castle, and inland at Oliver's Mount, the Kel
loways Rock has been found to yield numerous fossils, a list of
which the author appended, together with descriptions of some new
or little-known species of Ammonites from this deposit.

     1. “On the occurrence of Graphularia Wetherellii in nodules from
the London Clay and the Crag.” By N. T. Wetherell, Esq., M.R.C.S.
     The author, having briefly explained the form and general cha
racters of the Pennatula-like fossil named Graphularia Wetherellii
by MM. Milne-Edwards and Haime, described the circumstances

  Mr. S. Wood     on the Eatraneous Fossils      of the Red Crag.   485
under which he had lately found portions of the stem of this coral
traversing nodules in the London Clay of Highgate.          The nodules
are of different sizes, and vary from a cylindrical to an ovoidal shape.
Mr. Wetherell having also observed unmistakeable fragments of the
same Graphularia holding the same relative position in nodules from
the Red Crag, differing from those of the London Clay only in having
been more rounded and polished by aqueous action, brought the
subject before the Society as a link in the chain of evidence of the
so-called “coprolitic” or “phosphatic” modules of the Red Crag
having been to a great extent derived from the destruction of the
London Clay. The author also offered some observations on the
structure of other nodular bodies in the London Clay and in other
deposits.
    2. “On    the Extraneous    Fossils of the Red Crag.”     By S.  V.
Wood, Esq., F.G.S.
    In pursuing his investigations as to the geologic age of the Crag,
the author found it necessary to decide as to what are the “derivative”
fossils which are mixed with the native fossils in this deposit. This
has been a matter of some difficulty.      Mr. Woodenumerates the fol
lowing genera that may have supplied species or specimens to the
Red Crag :—Chama, Cardita, Astarte, Cyprina, Isocardia, Limopsis,
Turritella, Vermetus, Cancelluria, Terebra, Voluta, and Pyrula; and he
observes that out of 240 species of mollusca found in the Red Crag,
and belonging truly to a modern tertiary period, forty, or perhaps
fifty, might be considered as derivative fossils, though possibly some
of them may have lived on from the period of the Lower to that of the
Upper or Red Crag.       Some few extraneous fossils found in the Red
Crag appear to the author to have been casts of shells from some
freshwater deposit, probably of old tertiary date, but of which no
other trace has been recognized.       Mr. Wood regards the relics of
terrestrial mammals found in the Red Crag as extraneous to that
deposit, as well as the Cetotolites or relics of whales. Remains of two
species of Hyracotherium, originally derived from the London Clay,
have occurred in this Crag; also a tooth said to be of a Corypho
don.    The remains of Ursus, Canis, Vulpes, Felis, Trogontherium,
Mastodon, Rhinoceros, Equus, Sus, and Cervus have been derived
from some Upper Tertiary deposits; but Mr. Wood is uncertain
whether the Crag relics of Hippotherium and Hyaenodon may not have
come from some Middle Tertiary beds. The remains of Balaenodon
certainly were not derived from the London Clay, as has been sug
gested, but, with the Delphinus, have come from some tertiaries of a
later date. Crocodile, Turtle, and Snake remains, fossil wood,
crustaceans, and mollusca have come from the London Clay. Many
of the fish-remains are London Clay fossils; but some have been
washed in from beds similar to those of Bracklesham; and some,
including the teeth of Carcharodon megalodon, have apparently been
derived from Middle Tertiary beds not existing now in this area.
Some Chalk fossils, and several fossils from the Middle Oolites, have
also been collected in the “phosphatic beds.”        Mr. Wood described
the relative proportions in which the different derivative fossils

   occurred, and made some remarks on the general characters of these
   beds. He observes that probably no locality more nearly represents
   the conditions of the Red Crag Sea during the accumulation of the
   materials of                          its
                   bed than the existing Bay      Christchurch, where                                   of

    From the above there appears to be a loss of 22 to 26 per cent. as
compared with the Blaenavon No. 3 iron; and in the next series of
experiments made upon similar mixtures, but with perfectly pure
nickel, the same indications of loss are apparent, but not to the same
extent as in the preceding, as may be seen from the following
results:—

      Taking the mean of these experiments, it will be observed that
 the loss of strength is not so great as in the former, it being about
 17 per cent., or as 100:83.                    In the deflections and the power to
 resist impact, they          are,    however,     inferior to those first experimented
 upon, as may be seen                  by the     numbers,      in the ratio of 465: 280.
 This in some degree neutralizes the measure of strength, by a pro
 portionate diminution of elasticity of the bars employed in the last
 experiments.
      At the commencement of the paper, the author stated that the
 experiments were undertaken for the purpose of ascertaining how far,
 and to what extent, an admixture of nickel would improve cast iron;
 and that that improvement had reference, independent of other
 objects, to increased tenacity in the metal employed for the casting
 of mortars and heavy ordnance.
      During the last two years innumerable tests and experiments have
  been made for that purpose with more or less success; but the ulti
  mate result appeared to be, in the opinion of the author and others,
  that for the casting, or rather the construction, of heavy artil
  lery, there is no metal so well calculated to resist the action of gun
  powder as a perfectly homogeneous mass of the best and purest cast
  iron when freed from sulphur and phosphorus.
       In the discussion which followed the reading of the paper, Mr.
  Calvert said that it was highly probable that nickel caused the                                 in
  creased brittleness of cast iron, just as carbon, phosphorus, and sul
  phur, but that the result with malleable iron might probably be
  very different; and as meteoric iron is malleable, the trial could only
   be complete when soft iron and nickel were united; nevertheless
   these experiments, as far as cast iron is concerned, were decidedly
  new and of great value.

      ON THE          TORPIDITY OF THE MARMOT.                                    BY G. VALENTIN.
      object    this memoir of M. Valentin is to examine the in
THEfluence ofofthe  winter-sleep upon the production of glucose by
the liver.     During an abstinence from food of five or six months,
the sugar is persistent in the liver of the Marmot; from this it fol
lows that there is an essential difference between the true winter
sleep of the Marmot and the torpidity of the Batrachia, or the state
of inanition of waking animals.
   When, as is sometimes the case, the death of the animal is caused
by exhaustion at the end of the winter-sleep, the liver no longer
contains sugar. The same fact is observed in Hedgehogs which
have died during their winter-sleep.         On the contrary, when a
healthy Marmot, killed at the end of         torpidity,         its
                                                           examined,                        is                     it   is
found that the fresh blood       the aorta and the fresh urine will pre

   Some authors have expressed the opinion that the liquid secreted
by   the stomach     absorbed, and that after passing through the vena
                            is
porta,     produces sugar
          it                           in
                              the liver.  M. Valentin opposes this view,
and cites several facts which speak against                                   it.
   The author has observed        striking difference between the sugar

490                  MM. Bunsen           and Schischkoff’s Chemical
be formed instead  of carbonic acid and nitrogen.     And since,
with the exception of unimportant   traces of hydrogen  and sul
phuretted hydrogen, carbonic acid, carbonic oxide, nitrogen, and
nitric oxide alone occur in the gases from powder, 331 cubic
centims. must be considered to be the greatest volume of gas
which can in any case be formed from 1 grm. of powder of
the normal composition. But the experiments of Gay-Lussac,
and of most of the recent observers, give for powder exploded at
the ordinary pressure, a much larger volume than could, in any
case, have been obtained in accordance with these considerations.
From this contradiction alone, we see how uncertain and faulty
the methods and observations must have been which form the
basis of most of the preceding investigations on this subject.
   We have therefore endeavoured to obtain, in a manner less
uncertain than that hitherto followed, an experimental founda
tion for a chemical theory of gunpowder.
   The questions which presented themselves were the following:
   1. What is the composition of the solid residue remaining
after the explosion of powder ?
   2. Of what does the smoke consist                        Ž
   3.      What is the composition of the gases formed in the explo
sion      of powder ?            -
   4. How much residue and smoke on the one hand, and how
much gas on the other, are formed by a given quantity of powder?
   5. How great is the heat of combustion of powder, and how
high the temperature of       flame?      its
     6.How great     the pressure
                           is           the gases   the powder ex

                     is                           powder   capable              is
of accomplishing?
   Unfortunately the brief time which was appropriated          our                       to
researches, has not allowed                 us
                                    consider these questions for more

than one kind             of
                     powder, and  only for the combustion under the
ordinary atmospheric pressure. We therefore offer the following
                          complete work, but rather                             an

     In order to ascertain the qualitative composition of the solid
as well as the gaseous products of the explosion of powder, we
used the small apparatus, Plate                                III.

250 millims.  long and 2 millims. wide,  fitting air-tight into the
cork b, and in which the finely pulverized gunpowder is pressed
down. This tube a, as soon as the powder is inflamed and issues
from the open extremity with uniform hissing flame, is fixed air
tight in the wide glass tube d, by means of the cork b. The tube
d is thereby heated so rapidly that it readily cracks at the place
at which the flame touches         To prevent this, sieve-shaped,

cap   of the glass tube c, which is about 1 metre long and 2-5
millims. wide.    The cap b contains a stop having a small circular
orifice with a sharp edge, through which the grains of powder fall
in a fine stream like that of an hour-glass, when the vulcanized
tube is brought into the position represented in fig. 2. The
tube a, therefore, in being fitted on b, is held downwards in order
to prevent the powder from prematurely falling into the glass
bulb d. This glass bulb d, which is gently heated externally
by means of a lamp, serves for the combustion of the powder,
which takes place regularly in the form of a rhythmical flame if
the stream of powder is fine, and falls continuously. Occasional
interruptions, which are easily remedied by gentle motion of the
india-rubber, are not injurious to the experiment.

the entire absence of ammonia.
   7. Determination of Nitre.—The liquid containing 1 grm.
residue in which no ammonia was found, was feebly acidified
with pure sulphuric acid, and treated with pure sheet zinc of the
thickness of tinfoil. The liquid was kept in cold water, and sul
phuric acid gradually added during several hours, so that the
zinc dissolved up with the feeblest evolution of gas.  When the
solution of the  zinc, and therewith the conversion of nitric acid
into ammonia, was complete, the liquid was mixed with more
potash than was necessary to redissolve the precipitated oxide of
zinc, and the ammonia formed determined in the manner just
described.

KOHO,     and hence 0.0159 Mn”0° corresponds to 2:239 per
cent. of hydrate of potash.
   Now since sulphide of potassium in the determination with
oxide of copper passes into hydrate of potash, the quantity of
hydrate of potash equivalent to the sulphide of potassium, which
according to experiment (2) amounts to 1:077 per cent., must be
subtracted from this 2:239 per cent.    Hence there remains for
the hydrate  of potash contained in the mixture 1202 per cent.,
which is  equivalent to 1-0596 potash, or 2274.1 nitre.
   10.  Determination of the Potash contained in the whole     of
                                                               the
constituents.-One    measure of the liquid containing 1 grim. of
residue, gave, when evaporated with sulphuric acid and strongly
ignited, 1-0447 sulphate of potash, which corresponds to 56-497
per cent. of potash.
   Collating the results of these experiments, we get the follow
ing as the composition of the residue :—

   The quantity of potash contained in 100 parts of the residue
amounts therefore, according to the analysis, to 56.88 per cent.
By direct experiment 56.50 per cent. was obtained, which differs
therefore only by 0.38 from the number calculated from the
analysis.
   It   will be    from this analysis, that the residue consists
                   seen
chiefly of carbonate and sulphate of potash, and not, as is
assumed in the best artillery and technical works, of sulphide
of potassium, the quantity of which indeed scarcely exceeds 1
per cent.
   In order   to answer the second question as to the composition
of the smoke, we collected and analysed the gray, porous, am
moniacal deposit formed towards the open end of the long tube
eel, which consists of condensed smoke.    As this cannot be.
removed from the tube without attracting moisture, it was im
mediately dissolved in water, the suspended charcoal filtered       off
and washed, and the filtrate well mixed and divided into eleven

                         Theory of Gunpowder.                  497
equal volumes, one of which was used to each for the following
determinations:—
    1. Charcoal.—The charcoal contained in the whole liquid
weighed 0-08536 grim., and was free from sulphur.            Hence
0:00775 grim. corresponds to one part of the liquid.
    2. Sulphide of Potassium.—The solution did not blacken lead
paper, and contained therefore no sulphide of potassium.
    3. Hyposulphite of Potash.-One volume of the liquid required
 11 degrees of the standard solution, corresponding therefore to
0.02045 grm. hyposulphite of potash.
   4. Sulphate of Potash.—One part of the liquid gave 0.3650
grm. sulphate of baryta, which corresponds to 0.2726 grim. sul
phate of potash.
    5. Sulphocyanide of Potassium.—One volume of the liquid
required 47 degrees of the standard solution, corresponding to
0.0023 sulphocyanide of potassium.
    6. Ammonia.-Two parts of liquid gave the 27-0, t = 23:9,
&=005612, which corresponds to 0-0004373 sesquicarbonate
of ammonia, or to 0.0002445 carbonic acid for one volume of
liquid.
    7. Nitrate   of Potash.—One      part of liquid gave t, -27-0,
t=25.2, a =005612, which corresponds to 0:010374 mitre.
    8. Carbonate of Potash.--Two parts of liquid gave 0.0629
carbonic acid, which after subtracting the carbonic acid of the
carbonate of ammonia in experiment (6), corresponds to 0.09803
 grm. carbonate of potash.
    9. Hydrate of Potash.—Two parts of liquid gave 0.1169 grn.
manganoso-manganic oxide, which corresponds to 0.05845 for
one part liquid.     Subtracting therefrom the quantity of Mn” O*
 (0.05466), equivalent to the carbonic acid of experiment (8),
there remains 0-00379 grim. Mm"O", which corresponds to
0-00556 hydrate of potash.                         -

    As   a check,   a measure of the liquid was evaporated with
 sulphuric acid, and determined as neutral sulphate of potash.
 The mass obtained weighed 0.4286 grim. From the analysis,
 one measure ought to have given 0.4345 grim. salt.       The agree
 ment could not be expected to have been closer, and it may be
 regarded as a guarantee for the accuracy of the analysis.
    From a comparison of this analysis (II.) with that of the
 residue (I.), the conclusion may be drawn that the smoke has
 essentially the composition of the residue; that in the former
 the sulphur and nitre of the powder are somewhat more com
 pletely burned to carbonate and nitrate of potash; and instead
of minute quantities of sulphide of potassium, considerable traces
of carbonate of ammonia are found.
    In  order to settle the third question, respecting the nature of
the   gases,  we collected them for analysis by means of the appa
ratus   previously  described, fig. 2.
    If the gases produced by the regular combustion of the gra
nular powder, and issuing from the tube eel, be drawn through
the tubes    ff  by the mouth, a taste of almost pure carbonic acid
is perceived.     If they be allowed to escape through the nose,
there is not the least smell of cyanogen, sulphurous acid, or
binoxide of nitrogen, and scarcely perceptible traces of sulphur
etted hydrogen.        Mixed with air, no visible red vapours are
produced.      Now as a few tenths per cent. of cyanogen, or bin
oxide of nitrogen, or sulphurous acid, may be thus detected, it
may be assumed that these three constituents are not present in
the gas under investigation. Of the gaseous products which,
besides these, could result from the combustion of powder, there
remain therefore only carbonic acid, sulphuretted hydrogen, and
traces of oxygen, carbonic oxide, hydrogen, nitrogen, and prot
oxide of nitrogen. The carbonic acid and sulphuretted hydrogen
are first determined in the absorption-tube by potash, and the

transferred into a eudiometer, exploded with excess of hydrogen
and electrolytic detonating gas, and the oxygen remaining after

 how much residue and smoke on the one hand, and how much
 gas on the other, are produced by the explosion of a determinate
 weight of powder ?
    To decide this, we collected together and analysed the residue
 and smoke formed in the combustion of the powder which yielded
 the gases just investigated.
    For greater convenience in the analysis, an undetermined
 quantity of the substance was again dissolved in so much water
 that the volume of the whole liquid amounted to 500 cubic cen
 tims. To each determination 45'474 cubic centims. were taken,
 which were measured out in a graduated cylinder.        The con
 stants used in calculating the experiments are, where they are
 not specially stated, the same as in the analysis of the residue.
    1. Charcoal and Sulphur.—500 cubic centims. gave 0:2141
 grim. charcoal, sulphur, and incombustible residue.        0-1758
 grim. of this mass, oxidized with nitric acid, gave 0.1749 grim.
 sulphate of baryta, which for 0:2141 grim., the total amount of
the mass, corresponds to 0.0292 grim. sulphur.     The mass which
had been treated with nitric acid, and the residue not so treated,
gave, when ignited together in an open crucible, 0.0248 grim.
incombustible residue. For one measure, or 45-475 cubic cen
tims. of the liquid used in the subsequent experiments, there
 correspond therefore,

    2. Sulphide of Potassium.—The whole liquid (500 cubic cen
tims.), treated as before with oxide of copper, gave 0-9902 grim.
sulphate of baryta, which is equivalent to 0.46787 sulphide of
potassium, or 0.1358 sulphur; and for 45-475 cubic centims.
corresponds to 0.04255 grim. sulphide of potassium.
    3. Hyposulphite of Potash.-One measure gave 35:1 burette
degrees, which corresponds to 0-06525 hyposulphite of potash.
    4. Sulphate of Potash.-One measure gave l'131 grim. sul
phate of baryta, which corresponds to 0-84463 grim, sulphate of
potash.
    5. Sulphocyanide of Potassium.—One measure gave 12-5 bu
rette degrees, which corresponds to 0-006105 sulphocyanide of
potassium.
    6. Ammonia.-One measure gave a = 0.06688, ti -46-6,
t=17:3. This corresponds to 0.01645 ammonia, or to 0.05709
2NH4O, 3CO2.
    7. Nitrate of Potash.-One measure was taken. The ammonia
was determined in a quantity of potash equal to that used in
the experiment; it gave a =005612, ti -27, and t = 26-4,
which corresponds to a quantity of ammonia equivalent to

                                                                                         -

0.0034578 mitre, and which must therefore be subtracted from
the quantity of nitrate of potash found in one measure of
the liquid. One measure gave a =005612, ti -46-6, t-23:3,
which corresponds to 0.077808 grim., or after subtracting the
above quantity, to 0-07435 grm. nitre.
   8. Carbonate of Potash and Hydrate of Potash.-One measure
gave 0.1124 grim. CO", and 0.2240 grim. Mn” O*.     After sub
tracting the quantity of carbonate of potash equivalent to the
carbonate of ammonia (6), this 0.1124, CO corresponds to
0.3531 grim. carbonate of potash, which is equivalent to
0-19539 grim. Mn4O4. This 0.19539 grim., subtracted from the
0.2240 grim., leaves 0.02860 grim. Mn"O", which is equivalent
to 0.03515 KO. But since the quantity of potash equivalent
to the sulphide of potassium amounts to 0-03635 grim., it may
 be assumed that no hydrate of potash is present.
    Hence there are contained in one measure,

   Since the whole of the potassium of the powder remains in
the solid products of combustion, the quantity of solid residue
obtained by the combustion of 1 grm. powder may be calculated
from the analyses A and B. According to analysis A, 1 grim.
of powder contains 0-3055 potassium; the quantity of residue of
the composition B which contains so much potassium, amounts
to 0-6806 grm.
   Calculating the nitrogen present in this 0-6806 grim. residue,
and subtracting it from the nitrogen present in 1 grm. of powder,
we obtain the quantity of nitrogen contained in the gases arising
from a gramme of powder. The volume of gas, which, according
to analysis C, corresponds to the nitrogen thus calculated, weighs
0.3138 grm.     Hence a gramme of the powder examined decom
poses, in burning, into 0-6806 grm. residue of the composition
B, and into 0-3138 grim. gases of the composition C.
   The transformation which gunpowder experiences in burning
may be exhibited by the following scheme:–

this check is inapplicable, as the quantity of residue was not
weighed. But, on the other hand, we have an equally certain
verification in the fact that the quantities of K, N, S, C, O con
tained in l grim, powder must be found in almost unchanged
quantity in the products of combustion.         Such a comparison
gives for our analysis,

The agreement in the quantities of potash and nitrogen, from
which the equations for the calculation of the above scheme are
taken, serve as proof of the accuracy of the calculation; the
agreement of the three quantities of sulphur, charcoal, and oxygen,
as so many proofs of the accuracy of the experiments.
   It follows from this equation that 1 grim. of powder in ex
ploding yields 1931 cubic centims. of gas. The quantity which,
according to the previous theory, ought to be found, amounts to
330-9 cubic centims., or above one-third more.

the combustion of gunpowder, we only need a determination of

                                18547
Hence the temperature of the flame of powder whose gases are
formed in a closed space and cannot freely expand is 3340°C.
   Ifthe flame consisted only of ignited gaseous substances,
whose capacity for heat, as has been shown by Regnault’s ex
periments and Clausius's theoretical considerations, does not
change with the temperature, the value of
                                                   f   might be deter
mined with great accuracy.    But since the specific heat of solid
bodies increases with the  temperature, the numbers 2993° and
3340° can only be accepted as approximate values, which cannot,
however, from what we know of the magnitude of the increase
with the temperature, be very far from the truth.     Since s                in
creases with the temperature,                           great; and
                                   # would be found too
since, in fact, the temperature of the flame is continually lowered
by radiation and conduction, we may assume that the tempera
tures 3340° and 2993° represent limits to which the temperature
of the flame more or less approximates, but which it can never
fully reach or exceed. From this fact an important conclusion
may be drawn as to the amount of pressure exerted by the powder
in the space which it gravimetrically fills.
   It has been hitherto generally assumed, that during the com
bustion of powder the residue assumes the vaporous condition,
and by  its  tension materially helps the mechanical effects     the    of

510                MM. Bunsen             and Schischkoff’s Chemical
may be shown from the calculation of the temperature of flame,
that the tension caused by such a volatilization cannot amount to
one atmosphere.    The temperature of the flame of hydrogen
burning in air is 325.9°C.”    A bead of powder residue melted
on a thin platinum wire volatilized gradually in a jet of hydrogen
burning in air, but it never reached ebullition, and hence the
tension of         its
                vapour could never have reached           atmosphere.                       an

By substituting them in the formula, we obtain for po the value

                                                   4373-6.
Calculating the pressure with the assumption of the specific gra
vity of the residue at ordinary temperatures (2:35), we obtain
for po the value 3414:6.     Hence about 1000 of the 4374 atmo
spheres are due to the expansion caused by the heating of the
powder residue.
    A powder of the composition of that investigated by us, which
explodes in a gun behind the projectile, can never exert a press
ure of 4500 atmospheres, in consequence of the unavoidable
loss of heat in the combustion. Whether essential changes in
the decomposition of powder occur if it explodes freely, or at
high pressure in the gun, might be easily ascertained from the
composition of the residue deposited in the gun, or from the
composition of the gases.      If it be shown that under these cir
cumstances the decomposition is essentially the same, many
previous assumptions as to the pressure exerted in guns must
depend on very faulty premises, for the best artillery works give
this pressure at from 50,000 to 100,000 atmospheres”.
    These experiments give us at the same time the means of de
termining the maximum mechanical effect of powder, that         the                                     is,

 On      the lines observed by                    M. Victor      v. Lang on the faces           of cry
                                                  stals    of quartz.
    Itis an important advantage of Neumann's graphic method
of indicating the positions of the faces of a crystal, that it super
sedes the  employment    of troublesome constructions, in the solu
tion of problems relating either to the dihedral angles of crystals,
or to the plane angles which the edges of the faces make with
each other.   The determination of the crystallographic import
of the lines observed by v. Lang on the faces of the six-sided
pyramid, in certain crystals of quartz, affords a good example of
the superiority of this method over other methods commonly
used.
   According to the observations of W. Lang (Sitzungsberichte
der Mathem.-naturw. Classe der kais. Akademie der Wissenschaf
ten, vol. xx. p. 392.), these lines occur in groups of threes, the
angles which two of the lines of each group make with the
edges in which the faces of the six-sided pyramid meet the faces
of the six-sided prism, being 52° 5' and 84° 40', measured in
opposite directions. It is not pos
                                                                                                 c

  The faces            and the faces parallel to them, constitute
                   c, d, e,
the hemihedral form with parallel faces ºr 15 6.
    The form 1 56 was observed by Haidinger in a group of
                                                                cry
stals of quartz from Chamonix in Mr. Allan's cabinet, now in
the possession of Mr. Greg. The faces of this form are marked
d in fig. 147, plate 27, of the second volume of Haidinger's
translation of Mohs.       In the figure of this crystal the faces d
are represented as occurring on the alternate
                                                  angles only of the
 six-sided prism; an arrangement which does not accord with
 the laws of symmetry that prevail in crystals of the rhombohe
 dral system.      By the kindness of Mr. Greg,            I
                                                      have been per
 mitted to examine this group of crystals, and have ascertained
 that a pair of faces d exists on each of two adjacent edges, in one
 of the crystals of the group, but the faces are so narrow as to be
 scarcely perceptible.      By using for the bright signal a large
 aperture in a screen through which sunlight was reflected from
 a plane mirror, the positions of these faces were determined with
  sufficient accuracy for the purpose of identification.

 Classe der kais. Akademie der Wissenschaften, vol. xiv.
 vol. xvii. p. 187, and by M. Casamajor in Silliman's Journal for
 Sept. 1857, are highly useful in determining the forms of cry
 stals when better instrumental means are not at command. The
 following description of a substitute for the reflective goniometer,
 which   I  have occasionally used and exhibited in my lectures, is
 offered in the hope that it also may be found serviceable under
 similar circumstances.       It resembles the last-mentioned con
 trivance, but allows the crystal to be adjusted more readily,
  without being more difficult to construct.          It
                                                    consists of a rect

this theorem as   a practical truth admitting of large and useful
application, and the still higher difficulty of generalizing it with
a view to the integration of corresponding classes of partial dif
ferential equations in any number of independent variables, and
the simultaneous determination of their singular solutions, seem
to have arisen in a great measure from the unsymmetrical form
in which this theorem happens to have been presented.
   Stated in a symmetrical manner, the differential equation with
which Clairaut was concerned assumes the shape
                          *a-y;-F(; #) -=0,          ( du

where  F, is any homogeneous function of the first order in the
quantities included within the brackets.                  -
  At a glance we perceive that the general solution, u-0, of
any differential equation of this type is
                     aw #8y–F,(2, 8)=0,
where 2 and 8 are any arbitrary constants, and that the singular
solution is due to the elimination of a, S between this general
solution and the system of equations

    4. As regards partial differential equations of the second order,
it  may  be said that, either in the way of theory or illustration,
little or nothing has as yet been done; the field may be regarded,
not merely as unexplored, but as almost wholly unknown. The
contributions to the subject which have been made by Poisson
are scanty, and too much of a tentative character, whether they
be regarded as illustrative of this interesting department of science,
or suggestive of the means for                its
                                       development and improvement.

                         y=ap-ºp-f(p), p-ap),
         p'- #, and has
                    2
where                              pointed out that this equation admits
of  asingular solution derived from the elimination                         of
                                                                            p     between
this equation and

pillars and cylinders of vulcanized india-rubber.                        Heat is evolved
by compression, and absorbed on removing the compressing force

   “Experimental Researches on the Influence of Efforts of Inspira
tion on the Movements of the Heart.” By E. Brown-Séquard, M.D.
   A very interesting fact, of which many circumstances have been
carefully investigated by Professor Donders and Dr. S. W. Mitchell,
has received a wrong explanation from those physiologists.                    This
fact consists in a diminution of either the strength or the frequency
of the beatings of the heart, when an energetic effort at breathing
is made and maintained for half a minute or a little more. Pro
fessor Donders thinks that this influence of inspiration on the
heart is due to a mechanical agency of the dilated lungs on this
organ.                                                                    -
   They admit that the state of the lungs has a great influence on
the heart, but the principal cause of the diminution in the move
ments of this organ is very different from what has been supposed
by Professor Donders, by Professors                                 J.
                                                   Müller, and others. It is
known that when the medulla oblongata, or the par vagum are ex
cited (either by galvanism, as the Brothers Weber have discovered,
or by other means, such as a mere compression, or a sudden wound,
as    I
      have found), the heart's beatings diminish or cease entirely.
Whether this stoppage be due to the cause                   have attributed it to   I
or not, is indifferent to my present object. What is important
is, that       in
             these cases        irritationan     the origin        on

temperature, I find that, at each effort it makes to inspire, the
heart either almost suddenly stops, or beats much less quickly.
   I   have frequently seen the heart completely arrested for five or
ten seconds, and twice for twenty or twenty-five seconds, in cases
where there was only one respiration in two minutes. This stoppage
of the heart's movements was the more remarkable, as they were at
the rate of more than two hundred in a minute when the effort at
inspiration took place.    To decide that it was in consequence of an
influence of the par vagum that this occurred,           I
                                                       divided this nerve
in the neck, and then found that there was no more influence of the
 inspiration on the heart, or if there was, it consisted in an augment
 ation of the frequency of the movements of this organ—an augment
 ation due to the shaking of the heart when the chest dilated
    Sometimes, when the heart was very irritable, and when the efforts
 at inspiration were still frequent and not emergetic (the par vagum
being undivided), these efforts were accompanied, or rather imme
 diately followed by an increase in the strength of the heart's move
ments, probably caused by the shaking.           But always when the
inspiratory efforts were energetic and rare, they coexisted with a
diminution or a momentary cessation of the heart’s contractions;
and always in these cases the section of the par vagum has destroyed
the diminishing influence of the respiratory efforts on the heart.
It would be easy to show that the influence of the inspiratory effort
on the central organ of circulation is comparable to the change
taking place in the pupil when the globe of the eye is drawn inwards:
it is an associated action.
                    I
    From the facts have found in the case of newly-born animals and
birds, and from the facts observed in man by Professors        J. Müller,
Donders, and others, it results that, during efforts at inspiration, a
nervous influence passes along the par vagum from the medulla
oblongata to the heart, diminishing the movements of this organ.
And as by an action of our will we may inspire with energy, it
follows that we can by an influence of our will diminish the action
of our heart, just as we can contract our pupil by drawing our eyes
inwards.
   “On the Influence of Oxygen on the vital properties of the Spinal
Cord, Nerves, and Muscles.”       By E. Brown-Séquard, M.D.
   The influence of oxygen and carbonic acid on the living tissues,
has been very little investigated, either by physiologists or practi
tioners of medicine.          I
                           have made a great many experiments on
this subject, but will relate here merely a few of them, which are
sufficient to show that oxidation of the spinal cord and nerves, as
well as that of muscles, increases their vital properties, sometimes
in a high degree.
   After the opening of the spinal canal, the dura mater being laid
bare, we find that an evident hyperaesthesia appears after a short
time in the parts of the body which are behind the opening, and
also on the same level with           andit, little above
                                                a            it.   Ithink
this increase  of sensibility depends          on
                                           the absorption      ofoxygen,

luminous objects, upon a membrane in special relation with the
brain, but involve many adjuvant structures; and thus it happens
that they reveal to us a number of adventitious phenomena—
spectres as we may call them, whether caused by light at the
parts that cover the eyeballs, or within them, or by any stimulus
whatever affecting the special nervous tract. These must be elimi
nated, if we would avoid the risk of ascribing effects begotten
by subordinate parts to more integral portions of the apparatus.
Finally, they may be rendered serviceable for the solution of certain
important points of ocular structure and function.               Under the im
pression that so diversified a subject has not yet received all the
elucidation of which it is susceptible, another methodical attempt to
investigate it will be made in this memoir.
   When light is an agent in the production of the spectral pheno
mena, they arise from certain rays being blocked from their course,
at some obstacle they encounter, or turned aside by refraction, reflex
ion or inflection.      And to make precise observations upon them, we
must use fine pencils of rays which do not return to foci upon the
retina.   In order to estimate the relative and actual sizes, localities,
and  characters,  of corpuscles whose shadows or images are projected
upon the retina, pencils of light which are first convergent, and
therefrom, by passing through foci, divergent (such as may be
conveniently obtained from a small disc of light at a sufficient
distance from the eye, when viewed through a lens of an inch focal
length), are mainly employed, the foci being carried from before the
                                                                                or we

  lying behind the focus would travel in the opposite, the rate of
 movement being in both instances greater for objects nearer the focus.
  Also, whether with a couple of pencils or a single one in movement,
  for a given difference in ocular depth between two objects, the
  difference in parallactic deviation is greater as the two objects are
  nearer the foci or focus.          Besides, generally, the picture of the
  contents of the eye, as shown by the convergent portion, is inverted
  in the divergent.
     The above proportions are turned into equations which indicate, as
  the terms alter their values, every observed variation in the sizes of
  the shadows, parallactic deviations, inversions of figure, place, and
  movements whether of the ocular bodies with respect to the pencils,
  or of the foci and axes of the pencils with respect to them. Thus,
  in many modes, which are explained, we may at pleasure by mere
  inspection observe the structural and relative positions of the bodies
  in question, and can so manage to evade the effects of ocular refrac
  tions, as to render the proportions above stated available for calcu
  lating the sizes of the bodies, and their distances from the cornea,
  iris, faces of the crystalline lens, retina, or from any one of themselves
  —or can even measure their depths in the eye, almost without cal
  culation, and free from any that involve the consideration of the
  optical qualities of the organ.
      Inflective phenomena are alike in the convergent and divergent
  rays, but refractive differ, and afford us a useful means of detecting
  the nature of an object.        Inflective coloration is too subordinate to
  the ocular chromatic dispersion to deserve particular notice. Dr. T.
  Young explains how marrow straight objects, viewed through a
   puncture, are by the influence of ocular refractions made to appear
   curved, unless they are seen as diameters of the projected image of
   the pupillary opening.        It is appended, that if they are made to
   encroach, in a like way, laterally upon a divergent pencil, they appear
  not, as in the case mentioned, concave, but convex towards the
   centre of the pupil’s image.
      Diagrams and other drawings accompany these and other parts of
  the essay.       The foregoing principles are henceforth applied to the
   actual  exploration    contemplated, in order, as follows:—

      These phenomena are treated with an effort at greater pre
  cision than in previously existing accounts of them.               Little bars
  of fluid along the margins of the lids are shown to occasion the long
  beams of light, which issue from flames regarded “with winking
  eyes,” by their annulling the refractions of the cornea. These beams
         i.

hyaloid membrane outwards from the eye's centre, deeper as they
approach the punctum aureum.       They may be called into view by
any pencil of rays that is in the act of sweeping over the retina.
In the well-known experiment of Purkinje, of waving a candle
flame before the eye, the radiating point is the image of the flame
at the back of the eye.     In this experiment the vessels display a
remarkable parallactic gliding over the visual field, first observed by
Gudden, in 1849; but it was left for H. Müller, a few years after,
to point out the cause of the phenomenon, and to calculate from
entoptical observations the distance of the vessels from the “per
ceiving membrane” lying without them, required to account for the
parallax.   This essay adopts his hypothesis, but supports it by in
dependent observations, and substitutes another mode of calculating
                                                            -
the said distance.
   The flame is made to pause successively, on opposite sides of the
vessel to be observed, in an ocular meridional plane, or that of some
great circle, so that the shadow may be seen to deviate equally, twice
in one plane, from the retinal radius that passes through      and this                               it,

    “On a Fossil Fruit found in the Upper Wealden deposits in the
Isle of Purbeck.” By Prof. J. Phillips, M.A., Pres. G.S. &c.
    In one of the Upper Wealden shales in the northern cliffs of
Swanage Bay, the author found a small imperfect spherical pyritous
seed-vessel, about half an inch in length, which presented evidence
of having had eight meridional ridges, and an apparently fibrous
surface.     After a careful comparison of numerous forms of seeds of
monocotyledonous,      gymnospermous, and dicotyledonous plants, the
author considered that the specimen presented some analogies with
dicotyledons of several groups, especially Euphorbiaceae and Juglan
dacea.

     The following communications were read:—
     1. “On some Fossil Plants from Madeira.” By C. J. F. Bunbury,
 Esq., F.R.S., F.G.S.                                                    -
     The vegetable remains described in this memoir were procured by
 Sir C. Lyell and M. Hartung from a leaf-bed discovered by them, in
 January 1854, in the ravine of S. Jorge in the Island of Madeira
 (Journ. Geol. Soc. vol. x. p. 326). They consist of detached leaves
 and fragments of leaves, mostly in a very imperfect state,      a large
 proportion of them, indeed, too imperfect to be even described. Di
 cotyledonous leaves predominate, but remains of Ferns are also
 numerous; always, however, in a very fragmentary condition. Mo
 nocotyledons are rare.       No distinct remains of fruits have been
 found.
     Mr. Bunbury described 23 different forms (8 Ferns,    1 Monocoty
  ledon, and 14 Dicotyledons), which he has been able to discriminate
  among these remains; and added a list of those described by Pro
  fessor Heer, in his memoir on the same subject.     Each list contains
  several that are wanting in the other: M. Heer has 13 which are not
 found in the collection examined by Mr. Bunbury; and the latter
  collection contains 12 that do not seem to be noticed by the Swiss
  Professor.    The total number of distinguishable forms in the two
  collections amounts to 37, the greater part of which must be con
  sidered as very imperfectly known.     They gave occasion to the fol
  lowing remarks    :-
      1. The most abundant of the Dicotyledonous leaves and the most
   abundant of the Ferns are with great probability identified with
   species now existing in the island; namely, Laurus Canariensis,
   Oreodaphne fetens, and Pteris aquilina.   The Pteris is a plant which
  has a wide geographical range, and accommodates itself to a variety
   of conditions; but the two Laurels appear to be confined to the three
   Atlantic groups of islands, the Madeiras, Canaries, and Azores.
   Four other of the fossils appear to be very probably referable to

552                             Geological Society.
species now inhabiting Madeira; namely, Vaccinium Maderense,
Erica arborea, Woodwardia radicans, and Davallia Canariensis. Of
these, the Vaccinium is at present restricted to the island of Madeira;
the others have a wider range. These facts may perhaps justify us
in inferring (though certainly not with confidence) that the condi
tions of climate of the island in the time of the S. Jorge deposit
 were not very widely different from those now existing.
    2. Certain other forms in the list (about four or five) are distinctly
 different from any now known, at least in Madeira or the neigh
bouring islands, and appear to belong to extinct species.
    3. None of the fossils can be said to belong distinctly and posi
 tively to tropical families.
    4. Those forms, among the fossils, which are different from the
present vegetation of Madeira, do not show any marked analogy to
the American or any other existing Flora.
    5. The fossil leaves from S. Jorge show, on the whole, a decided
analogy to the recent vegetation of the Madeira forests, inasmuch
as there is among them a predominance of undivided and entire
edged leaves, with smooth (not wrinkled) and glossy surface.
    6. The intermixture of abundant remains of Ferns with those of
Dicotyledons is a characteristic of this leaf-bed, in which it shows
a complete agreement with the existing state of things in the Ma
deira forests. Such an intermixture is not usual in the plant-bear
ing deposits of the palaeozoic, secondary, or tertiary periods.
    7. The very small number of Monocotyledons hitherto found is
remarkable, but may be owing to accidental causes.
    8. On the whole, the author is disposed to conclude that the vege
tation of Madeira at the time when the S. Jorge leaf-bed was formed
was, though not absolutely identical with that now existing, yet not
very different from       it.
                          But all such conclusions must     received                  be
with great caution.

Monance the strata are singularly contorted; and an important
fault runs nearly parallel with the coast, causing much confusion.
Beyond St. Monance the section becomes clear, and, passing through
the Mountain-limestone down to the level of the Burdiehouse beds,
as at Burntisland,    exhibits a magnificent series of the Lower Car
boniferous rocks, consisting of freshwater or estuarine shales and
sandstones, with a few bands of limestone, one of which latter is of
marine origin. Sphenopteris affinis characterizes the upper portion
of this inferior group; and Cyclopteris,      lower portion. The Burits
diehouse limestone    belongs     the upper  portion;

 ANALYSIS     OF THE PEROWSEITE       OF SCHELINGEN.      BY F. SENECA.
     This mineral was first discovered by Butzengeiger in the granular
 limestone    of Vogtsburg on the Kaiserstuhl, and described by
 Walchner in 1825. The latter regarded it as titanic acid, with a
 very small amount of iron, and considered it to be a peculiar species.
 The same crystals were subsequently described by Quenstedt and
 Volger as Perowskite.       These crystals have been investigated by
  Seneca in Weltzien's laboratory.
      The crystals are cubes. Their cleavage is very distinctly parallel
  to the faces of the cube.         The individual crystals are always
 aggregates of smaller cubes, between which delicate films of cal
 careous spar are sometimes inserted, as may be easily ascertained
 by treatment with acids. Spec. grav. =4-02.          Hardness between
  apatite and felspar. The mineral possesses an iron-black colour and
  a brilliant, metallic, glassy lustre; iridescence is only exhibited
  during weathering, as in other minerals containing protoxide of
  iron, the latter becoming converted into hydrated peroxide. Analysis
