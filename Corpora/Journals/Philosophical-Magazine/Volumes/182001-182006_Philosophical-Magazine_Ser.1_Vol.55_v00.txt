                               To   Mr.   Tilloch.
Sir, — In    allowing in your valuable miscellany [The Philosophi
cal Magazine] immediate publicity to the following remarks on
Damp Decks, &c. you will, in all probability, particularly in such
humid weather as the present, render an essential service to that
useful class of men for whose benefit they are solely intended.
              I have the honour to be, sir,
                    Your most obedient and very humble servant,
Portsmouth,   Dec. 22, 1819.                         A Naval SORGEON.
                  »
                           Damp Decks,         &c.
     " Theship, in the first place, by frequent drying and ventilation, is pre
served from damp and foul air."— Dr. Parr's London Medical Dictionary,
art. Scorb.
   A ship in the midst of the deep, having by far its greater part
immersed beneath the surface, is a circumstance that suggests to
us the natural formation and collection of vapour in          and like
                                                                     it,
wise the difficulty of its extrication, on the additional considera
tions of the nature of the one and of the form and structure of
 the other.
   Besides, water insinuates itself more or less into the holds of
all ships, which, with the water in casks, &c. must in          greater    a
or less degree be productive of vapour.      If to this be added the
great portion of steam which arises at the meals, &c. and the
great quantity of exspirated vapour thrown out byseveral hundreds
of men so closely situated, the quantity of vapour thus collected,
is so great as to need an incessant extrication of             it,
                                                          particularly
when we consider its intermixture with what           implied
                                                          is        the        by
foul air of ships; namely, air consisting of      redundancy of car

 the partial renovation of its consumption ; and likewise, in a cer
 tain degree, noxious gases, arising from animal effluvia, especially
that contained in unaired bedding, unwashed clothes, &c. and
 the putrefaction, however slow, of provisions ; all which render
it the more noxious.
    Reflections on this invariable tendency to moisture, and on the
abovementioned particulars, point out the extreme necessity
of keeping the decks and cabins of ships as dry, yet clean, as
possible.      Experience and science grant, that the internal clean
liness of ships is not only conducive to health, but absolutely es
sential to the prevention of disease.
    The mode of effecting cleanliness      is,   however, often extremely
injudicious,     or  betrays   incousideration,   or something like igno
rance. What honest candour extorts, surely will not be ascribed
to presumption.         How many instances have there been of wash
ing decks, and barely swabbing them after, when the entire at
mosphere has teemed with fogs and moisture, without                  breath
                                                                      a
of wind, when stoves have been deemed unnecessary, or not so
much as thought of     !       To say the truth, under such peculiarities
of the atmosphere, common stoves can be of very little use; for
the. rarefaction produced      by     their use tends but little, from its
slowness, to the extrication of moist air, when wind-sails can be
of little. or no use.  It     causes an ascent not entirely to the hatch
ways, but in part to the beams and planks overhead, where the
air thus partially rarefied insinuates itself, or attracted and on
                                                       is             ;
becoming somewhat condensed, accumulates, until its dispersion
by change of weather or alteration of temperature.              Hence     it   is
that decks washed in damp weather are often not dry for two,
three, four, and even sometimes seven days after. In such states
of the air, aii exact scrape and clean dry sweep               perhaps the
                                                                 is
only   mode    necessary   to  be  adopted.
    In frosty weather, or when the temperature              very low, some
                                                            is
estimate    can   be made    of  the  surrounding vapour   from  its collec
tion and condensation every morning overhead, on the planks
and beams of the lower decks and confined cabins.
    In the navy, the system of washing or scrubbing hammocks or
decks   is,   like every other system of         it,rigid in the extreme.
Clothes, as shirts, stockings, &c. are generally washed or scrub
bed twice a-week,     by    which changes of the same are as often af
forded, and are as conducive to comfort as absolutely essential
to health.       Hammocks, as far as my experience authorizes me
to say, are also scrubbed twice, or, at least, once a-week all the
year round.        In my humble opinion, once a-week in summer or
fortnight   in  winter,  and relatively
                                      in     hot or dry, and cold or moist
climates, if    not carelessly left   about  the decks, isadequate to the
purposes of cleanliness.     Is      the frequency beyond this indispen
                                                                     sable     ?

sable   ?   or,       does      it arise from   a mere ostentatious       principle of
useless   refinement in bleached hammocks, which, through self-
conceit and contrast, glut the eyes of such as virtually have the
superintendence of them?
   The quarter and main decks are washed every morning at four
o'clock, or at day-break, by those who slept-in during the mid
dle watch, or from twelve until the same hour ; and the lower
decks of frigates, and orlop decks of line-of-battle ships, are
washed twice, or, at least, once a-week throughout the year.
   I will not presume to determine how often, or precisely when
the decks of ships should be wetted ; but, by the way, simply ob
serve that the time should be regulated by intervening circum
stances ; and the less the necessity, and the drier the ship, the
healthier it is for ships' companies.
   In ships of-the-line, the ceconoiny of the sick-bay rests with
the surgeon.      But as it is comparatively small for the number on
an average sick, the patients who have not room to sleep in                           it,
must lie between decks, with the regulation of which he has no
thing to* do. In frigates the sick are also under the necessity of
sleeping on the main deck, unscreened from the strong partial
draughts, as well as unprotected from the rude jostle of the
thoughtless.      These are very sensible of the great alteration of
temperature     from  the early opening of the ports and wetting or
washing of the decks.        This sudden alteration of temperature                    is
frequently as much or more than ten degrees.          Those who per
chance are partially uncovered, instantaneously awake, from the
sensations induced       the change, or, they do not, they are likely
                                  by                     if

inflammation.
    In detached services, and in long cruizes and voyages, while
such    asystem of washing and slopping prevails, and to which
every  sacrifice    made, need the dreadful consequences be pointed

genious moral writer, in his inimitable essays, succinctly points
out, with his usual discrimination, the dangers arising from the
fallacy of such notions.
    There are many on board ships variously affected, who yet do
not apply to the surgeon for relief, through the fear of being stig
 matized as sculkers, or the greater fear of having their allowance
of wine or spirits withheld. Such have their hectic exacerbations,
and have to turn out of their hammocks, as the phrase        on these     is,
occasions, and strut about the decks for two hours or more, in
cold water half way up their legs, handing or dashing        along        it          by
buckets full      ;  which the perspiration becomes suddenly sup-

  the predisposed or susceptible to tubercles, and those diseases
  by which it is generated.

 use vulgar language, not vehicles of cold ; therefore it is that

the use of fumigations, which, in my humble opinion, rather
tend to conceal than to decompose or dispel it.
 I    cannot have done with this subject without introducing the
following strange remarks, from the recent work of an excellent
writer on that grand portion of the earth                      :
                    "                                corusco
                         Semper soli rubens et torrida semper ab igni        j"
nor can      refrain from offering
               I                    doctrine different from his,
                                                a
after the liberty which he has expressly and courteously given                         in
the Sabine strain, viz.
                    it             Si quid novisti rectius istis,
                         Candidus imperti: si non, his utere mecum."

gales of wind during the winter when the decks were floated with
water for weeks together, without the possibility of drying them.
 I have listened night after night to these torrents rushing and
roaring from one side of the lower deck to the other, as the ship
rolled, while five or six hundred men in hammocks were sus
pended nightly over the moving current, in the most advantageous
manner possible for feeling its influence. And what was the con
sequence ? Why, that there was not a man on the sick list."
  "   But the scene changes; — the gales subside — the wind veers
round to the eastward — we regain our station off the coast of
France, where the sea is smooth, the air keen, and the decks per
fectly dry.    And what is the result ? Why, that half the ship's
company is laid up with pneumonias."
   Taking the truth of both these remarks and replies for granted,
-—though I cannot but candidly confess they bear to my mind the
easy implication of a certain figure of speech — might not this gen
tleman, with his usual sound reasoning, ascribe the former, should
it actuallv happen, to that certain capability of resistance, for a
limited time, in the powers of the healthy constitution to the
prejudicial influence of wet and confinement? and the latter,
should it actually follow, to that state of susceptibility induced
by this circumstance? thereby particularly admitting the subse
quent agencies implied in the changes of the scene, when the or
thodox doctrine of the ingenious and learned Dr. Brown can be
so easily referred to.
    Here it is very plainly intimated, that off the coast of France,
in winter, an easterly wind, though not strong, has alone been
productive of pneumonia, although the previous circumstances of
living for weeks together between wet decks, of blowing and wet
weather, and of a change of wind and weather, are at the same
time admitted.      The east wind is notorious for its dispersion of
moisture ;   and  moisture  followed by a wind which disperses it,
has a particular influence on temperature.        It is thus that the
human constitution is acted upon by an easterly wind, and that
the brute creation feels its influence.    According to the laws of
 the animal ceconomy, the system, from its reaction to the agencies
 implied in these antecedent circumstances, becomes predisposed,
so as to be particularly susceptible of the subsequent agency of
 the keen easterly wind and of the change of temperature.           A
 sharp easterly wind that has lasted any time, abstractedly consi
 dered, without any reference to the weather preceding         it,
                                                                 or to
 the change itself, implies a comparative regularity of a low tem
 perature, which, though      itmay from its arid qualities aggravate,
cannot, in my humble opinion,       be solely productive   of pneumo-

    For my own part, warm dogmas or positive assertions cannot
 produce in my mind any conviction, without, at least, some train
of reasoning, or axiom of common experience by way of proof ;
 and I cannot but subscribe my mite to exonerate " some naval
 surgeons," who have admitted the mischievous consequences of
wet or damp decks, from the unjustifiable imputation of embar
rassment, and the unbecoming implication of ignorance ; since,
in addition to what I have just explained, there is no one, either
in civilized life, or in the least acquainted with the internal state
 of a ship, so inexperienced or void of sense, as not to know the
very different effects arising from sleeping or remaining in a damp
 laundry and a dry comfortable apartment, or between damp decks
or in a wet galley or manger, and the commodious and ventilated
cabin of a commissioned officer or captain, independently of thfe
 occurrences of contagion in discipline or drunkenness.         Resides,
it is observable that laundresses, however accustomed to damp
ness, are still susceptible of its influence.      They are seldom long
livers ; for,  in  general, they  die of premature old age, either af
fected with chronic rheumatism, or affections of the pleura or
lungs, produced and repeatedly aggravated by it ; nor are their
husbands, children, or inmates in winter, scarcely ever entirely
free from the same complaints, in consequence of washed clothes
being hung up to dry in the rooms in which they sleep or sit.
II.   Report from the Select Committee appointed to consider the

establishment at Malta.       To be infected by the plague, contact
or very near approach to the person under the disease is sup

disease of the atmosphere.        Considers insulation by the means
of quarantine, the most effectual step for preventing it. Knows
one instance of the plague having been communicated at sea^
some French gun-boats were taken by the Theseus man-of-war,
in the year 1800, they were ordered alongside, and while lying
there, the person ordered on board to issue provisions, &c. re
ceived the infection of the plague.       Supposing, as is the case in
England, the quarantine regulations should have been established,
and in force for 12 or 14 years, with care, would not the conta

  10         Report   from the Select Committee appointed   to consider
   how the first patient caught it ; but it was discovered that the
   plague existed then in Rosetta where hospitals were situate.
   The hospital in which the first cases of plague appeared, viz. that
   of the 88th regiment, was situate in Rosetta, and the plague was
   there at. the time.     Believes the plague to be contagious by con
   tact ; should have some doubts of a very close atmosphere, but
   has no direct evidence of that; could often trace it to contact.
  Should think most cases are by actual contact.             Means actual
  contact both with the body, and with clothes infected with mi
  asmata.       Gives as his reason for considering it contagious, his
  having     traced  it clearly from one subject to another, on the first
  appearance of the disease in Egypt in 1801.           As before stated,
  there were about 165 men affected in the army; immediately
  after the discovery of the plague, all the cases of it were sent to
  a pest house; the suspicious cases, those with symptoms of fe
  ver, were "placed in observation rooms; and then the whole of
  the remainder of the 165 men were, without loss of time, re
  moved to another hospital prepared for them.           Before any man
 was removed to the new hospital, the strictest precautions were
  used ; his hair being cut off, he was put into a bath, and the
  whole of his clothing left outside the hospital and destroyed ;
 each man was then provided with new and fresh clothing. The
 consequence of these precautions having been rigidly enforced
 was, that after entering the new hospital, no new case of the dis
 ease appeared. < Has known instances where contact with plague
 patients has taken place, but no disorder has occurred ; on the
 first appearance of the disease in the months of September, Oc
 tober, November, and December, when the disease was virulent,
 knew of very few cases where the disease did not follow contact;
 but afterwards, when the most rigid precautions were taken, and
 towards the end of the season, and when the disease was in a
mild form, people went sometimes together with impunity; a case
 of plague has been detected, and people in the same tent have
 not had it.      Of those afflicted with the plague soon after the first
 part   of  the  season, none recovered; indeed the subjects of the
 first part of the season were mostly native troops, the Sepoys ;
 and many unfavourable circumstances along with the virulence of
the disease attended.          The Indian army consisted of 7,886 ; of
those 8,759 were Europeans, and 4,127 natives of India.            There
died of the plague, of Europeans 38, and of natives of India 127.
The inhabitants of Egypt have an idea that the plague generally
ceases on St. John's day, the summer solstice.          The general be
lief   is,that the extremes of heat and cold arrest the plague.       It
subsides gradually; from perhaps February or March till June.
It        pretty general opinion that the disease          never entirely
     is

    the Validity    of the Doctrine of Contagion in       the Plague.      1 1
which we are perhaps not very well acquainted with. Thinks it
probable that the circumstance of no plague occurring in Eng
 land may be owing to none having ever been imported ; but
 there are many circumstances to be weighed, between the present
 and the time the plague prevailed in England ; improvements in
 the structures of the houses and towns ; cleanliness, ventilation,
 and police regulations, are enforced in a degree unknown in the
  17th century.     Medical science stands now on different grounds ;
 and we have acquired a knowledge of the disease, its treatment,
 and prevention.      In Egypt, as well as in Turkey, many existing
  circumstances tend to the propagation of contagion, and render
 ing it more virulent. Were typhus fever to appear in those coun
 tries, it is difficult to conceive how it ever could be eradicated.
  From the nature of fomites, considers the risk would be increased
 from having no quarantine.         The risk in this country would be
 less, compared with a country where the intercourse was short and
 by land, with the country where the plague raged.
     Dr. James Curry, Senior Physician to Guy's Hospital. — Con
 siders plague as contagious, to a certainty; and for this reason,
 that all persons who are apprized of its contagious nature, may,
 by keeping apart from those persons who labour under the dis
 ease, or are suspected of labouring under the disease, be perfectly
 free from   it, even at a very short distance from them        ;   and pro
 bably, if  they  were  to keep to  the  windward    of  them,   they  might
even almost touch them with impunity.              Thinks the plague at
 tends, and    is usually incidental to, a particular state of what
 called by Sydenham and others, constitution               of atmosphere
                                                                           ; is
 and the various changes which take place            in the air at different
 times, appear to be produced       by an interchange of electricity be
tween the earth and atmosphere, which occasions that particular
 state of the human constitution which renders            itliable to some
one   certain species  of disorder,  for the  time  itexerts  its influence,
 and not to others.      For instance, the small-pox will prevail un
 der one state of atmosphere      ;   the measles under another, and
 scarlatina under   a  third; and we scarcely ever find that two of
 those disorders prevail at the same time       :   each has    a  particular
 or appropriate state of atmosphere which especially favours it.

                                                 ;                   in itself

a   highly malignant fever, arising from a peculiar and very viru
lent morbid poison, generated            bythe bodies of the sick whilst

of exciting the same kind of fever in them the spread and dif

of malaria — malaria produced

     12       Report from Ike Select Committee appointed                  to consider
      atmosphere operating upon each other : hence, at one time it
       may be particularly rife and violent, and at another time it may
      not appear at all. Malaria is the Italian word for a morbific
     vapour arising from the earth, under the influence of the sun's
     heat, and of the electric interchange already alluded to ; it is
     found every season all along the coasts of the Mediterranean, but
      in a much greater degree in some places than in others : the es
      sential cause of the plague is double; first, the specific poison,
      which is generated or multiplied in the bodies of those who la
     bour under the disease, without which it cannot exist ; and se
     condly, a state or condition of the atmosphere, which gives a
     strong tendency to support the disease among the people at large;
     it is virtually occasioned by a state of the atmosphere, and it is
     communicated by the infection, either in clothes, wearing ap
     parel, or bed linen : animal matter, such as feathers, silk, or wool,
     will preserve it much more readily than any thing else.               The
     contagious principle of the plague cannot be communicated the
     same way as that of small-pox, that               is,      by
                                                         inoculation        the:   if

     similar. Has never understood that there         any difference between

     another afflicted            by   it,
                                 and that which afflicts those who receive
    it  from the odour or vapour arising from a person who             so dis is
     eased.    The same remark may be made with regard to the small
     pox  ;  the contagion of the small-pox           communicated in two

                    is    the palpable    mode  of inoculation,   or contact            ;

    to plague; but, for instance, measles, with all the experiments
     that have been made on the subject, never have been palpably
    communicated             by
                           inoculation.     Each poison may be supposed to

    have  a   peculiar  mode   of  existence, and     peculiar mode of pro
                                                           a
    pagation.      The same case occurs with regard to the hooping-
    cough.      The hooping-cough has never yet been communicated,
    except     bythe breath, or              by
                                      coming near the person infected with
    it. Doubts whether a person removed from the place where he
    was taken ill of a fever, either in England or Ireland, and carried
    even to    ashort distance, would communicate          to anybody, even
                                                                    it
    under the very worst state that he could have that fever.           Gives
    the following reason for thinking so         At one time
                                                  :               was    great

    the Validity   of the Doctrine of    Contagion in the Plague.    13
not a single example took place of their communicating the dis
ease to other persons.        Considers the plague much less conta
gious  from   goods    than  from   persons ; because the clothes of a
person affected with the plague become saturated with the poison
in the person, and are much more liable to communicate the dis
order than goods.        Besides, it is scarcely to be supposed that
bales of goods, coming from a country affected with the plague,
would have been handled by persons who had the plague, be
cause persons so affected would be incapacitated from labour.
Believes, as to goods which have been imported from a country
that is infected with the plague, that if they communicated it at
all, (which he doubts) it would be from those goods having been
extremely confined.        It does not meet with a suitable soil or
sun here.     Is of opinion that the plague whifti prevailed in Lon
don in the year 1665 was more probably generated here, than
imported.      Is disposed to believe that every plague, even in the
Levant, is oftener generated, than propagated by contagion.
Thinks, if the plague were imported into England, it would affect
but few ; and the cases would be so insulated, that it would be
very soon cut off.     From the circumstance of Holland never hav
ing been  at all  affected with the plague, although admitting goods
from the Levant without difficulty, concludes it would be the same
with regard to this country, and with an equal immunity.           Hol
land admits goods from the Levant, even without quarantine.
    Being asked, Is there not some beneficial consequence arising
from touching terra firma ; is there no electrical effect '—an
swers,  "  Nothing but that which would occur equally on board
of ship. The question, taken in its general bearing, would make
rather against the supposition inferred by your question.       Several
years  ago,  when    I was  lecturing on  the subject of contagion  and
fever, and the influence of malaria arising from the land, the late
Captain Pelly happened to be present at the lecture ; and I was
mentioning the fact, that in the West Indies, cceteris paribus,
the inhabitants to the windward of the islands have not the fever
so much as those persons who reside on the leeward side ; be
cause those persons who reside on the leeward side of the islands
are necessarily exposed to the fever arising from the land which
intervened between the windward side and the leeward side.           In
corroboration of that, he mentioned a very curious circumstance,
which had been repeatedly observed by himself, and by many
other officers who were in the Channel fleet, that as soon as they
got out of sight of land, and had an entire sea breeze, the men
and boys might go to sleep in the tops, and wake after an hour
or two without any injury; but as soon as they come up the
Channel, so as to receive the influence of a land wind from the
English or French coast, they always wake with a cold upon them

if they have been so to sleep, or have a cold a short time after

labouring under the disorder. The vapour arising from the bodies
of persons infected, would produce the disorder readily and vio
lently; but in all epidemics they arise in such             great manya
points   at  once,  that    would
                               it    be almost  impossible to say that
they   were   produced          by
                            contact   with infected  individuals.    In a
conversation about four years ago, with          very intelligent Spa

Sweden, he mentioned a very curious fact, with respect to the
town of Medina Sidonia, which           about twelve miles from Cadiz.

    Dr. Robert Tainsh. — Was Surgeon of the Theseus, when in
the Mediterranean, at the siege of Acre. Had five cases of plague
on board, three Englishmen and two Frenchmen.                  They all re
covered, and there was no communication of the plague to any
other persons on board the Theseus.
    Mr. Edward Hayes. — Was born at Smyrna, and resided there
nearly all his life.      Has seen very frequent occurrences of the
plague.    The merchants always avoid              by shutting themselves

up from communication with the town, and only communicating
through purveyors, who are generally people who have had the
plague themselves.        Has often known instances of persons hav
ing communication        with    persons who were afflicted with the
plague, without catching the infection themselves.                Considers
the plague to be absolutely contagious, that             to say, the atmo

But when the natives die      of the  plague,  the  clothes are sold again;
that      until lately. They now discover their folly, and begin to
          is,
take the same precautions that they do with respect to Europeans'
clothes; at least with regard to the higher order of Turks, but                        it
is   byno means a general custom. The greatest part of the Turks

 16    Report  from the Select Committee appointed      to consider
August, when the great heats destroy it. The virulence of the
disorder is almost invariably over by August. It begins in March
or April.   Goods are shipped promiscuously, whether the plague
rages  or not,   to all parts of Europe. Thinks that goods shipped
during  the  time   the plague is raging, convey the contagion ; and
that every country that receives those goods, receives in a degree
the contagion of the plague. Has repeatedly known cases to occur,
from which he is satisfied in his own mind that the plague was in
troduced solely by goods, without contact.
    Sir Robert Wilson, M.P. — While in Egypt with the army,
saw many cases of plague, and gives the following as the result of
his observations. The army that invaded Egypt was divided into
two corps. One was stationed at Alexandria, and the other moved
on against Cairo ; a part of the army which remained stationary
at Alexandria had a detachment at Aboukir, where the preceding
year many thousand Turks had been put to death in consequence
of a defeat in an action with the French, (and where several hun
dred British and French had recently been interred ;) every pre
caution was taken to prevent the introduction of plague into that
part of the army which blockaded Alexandria and was stationed
 at Aboukir, and from particular local circumstances all commu
nication with the country was successfully intercepted, except
under authorized regulations; notwithstanding         which precau
tions, plague broke out three distinct times, beginning amongst
 the troops occupying Aboukir, and extending to those stationed
before Alexandria. That part of the army, Turkish and British,
which moved against Cairo, passed through the country where
 numerous villages were infected with the plague ; and during the
inarch the soldiers had constant communication with the inhabi
 tants of those infected villages.     At Menoof, where the plague
had raged with the greatest violence, a bakery was necessarily
established for the use of the army; but none of the persons who
attended that bakery were infected with the plague.       At Rahma-
nich there was a lazarette or plague hospital ; several men were
lying infected with the plague, and many were brought out already
dead; others were dying in the environs of the town of the same
disorder.    The Turks stript the bodies of all, indiscriminately, of
their clothing, and there was no restraint whatsoever in the com
munication with the inhabitants, who had also free access to the
camps; yet no plague was communicated to the troops. The city
of Cairo had lost a great many inhabitants the same year, by the
plague.    When the army arrived at Cairo and united with the
 Gyand Vizier's army, many of the graves in which the inhabitants
had been buried who had died of the plague, were opened, and the
bodies stripped of their clothing, with which the Turks covered
themselves, and yet no soldier of either the British or Turkish
                                                               armies

   the Validity of the Doctrine of Contagion in the Plague.       17
armies was infected with the plague.      The disorder ceased be
tween the 17th and 24th of June, at the precise time when its
cessation had been anticipated and assured by the inhabitants,
except at Aboukir, where it continued to exist some time longer.
It was also affirmed to us by the French officers, that although the
plague had raged in Cairo that year with very great violence, and
carried off some of the French army, yet notwithstanding a con
stant communication was held between the garrison stationed in
the citadel and the inhabitants of the town, the soldiers in the
citadel were not affected, in any one instance, with the, disorder.
Many thousands of the inhabitants of Lower Egypt had died that
year of the plague.     The Indian army, passing through Upper
Egypt, had traversed a country in which about sixty thousand in
habitants were said to have perished ; whole villages having been
destroyed ; but yet the troops of that army brought no infection
with them, nor were any precautions adopted to prevent conta
gion on their junction with the British European army. To these
circumstances Sir R. W. was an eye-witness.          Wishes also to
state, that as they moved through the country, the inhabitants
pointed out to them particular villages that were infected with
plague, and which plague did not extend out of those particular
villages to any of the contiguous villages, although there was no
precaution whatever used as to the communication with the inha
bitants of the infected villages. Conversing with Dr. Desgenettes,
the chief physician of the French army, and M. Assilini, the head
surgeon of the French army, they assured Sir R. W,, that when
ever a battalion infected with the plague had been marched out
of the infected place, the soldiers recovered, and never con
veyed the infection to other garrisons ; and that troops marching
into that infected garrison which had been vacated, did not be
come themselves infected, unless they remained there longer than
eight or ten days. And M. Assilini further assured Sir R. that seve
ral French officers and soldiers, who had the plague, having re
moved themselves, or been removed when sick of the plague, into
other places, they had almost always recovered.         But he said,
his great difficulty was in persuading people to make the exertion
of movement ; for they were generally so enervated that they pre
ferred to remain where they were and meet their fate.         Thinks
 the plague is a fever originating in a particular state of the at
mosphere, produced from local causes and confined to their in
fluence.    Should suppose it must arise from a putrid state of the
 atmosphere ; because those villages, which were infected, were
stated by the inhabitants to be generally those where the mud
 had been left longest, and the moisture only, after considerable
stagnation, had been absorbed.      The Nile annually overflows all
 the inhabited land with a body of water four or five feet in depth,

state, is carried off the land by canals, which at a prescribed sea
son are opened for that purpose.      As the sun gains power, the
moisture of the mud which has been left is absorbed, until the mud
becomes quite dry and brittle ; the absorption is so great that the
ground is over all its surface broken by large fissures, sometimes
three or four feet in depth, and which render the passage for
horses extremely dangerous.
    CharlesDalstonNevinson, M.D. — Is of opinion that the plague
of 1665 did not originate in this country, and that no degree of
cleanliness would prevent its being extended to the individuals' of
the country, if they were sufficiently exposed to the contagion.
Considers all regulations which prevent the communication of
persons infected with the plague with others, as useful, of what
ever kind, whether performing,quarantine on ship board ; in float
ing lazarettos, or in lazarettos on shore. The plague not appear
ing in the lazarettos is no more a proof that it is not contagious,
than that typhus is not contagious because it does not extend in
the hospitals in this metropolis, where every precaution' is used
by ventilation and cleanliness to prevent its propagation.     In St.
George's hospital he never knew an instance of its communica
tion for nearly twenty-six years, and has certainly seen some of
the worst states of typhus in that hospital.
    Richard Powell, M.D. — Thinks the plague is contagious.
Deduces this opinion from the recorded facts upon the subject^,
which establish it to his mind as strongly as any fact with which"
we are acquainted.
    Edward Ash, M.D.— Has travelled a gOod deal, and en
deavoured to collect all the information he could upon the subject
of the plague in travelling on the continent.     Is of opinion, that
the'plague is decidedly contagious ; that it is propagated from
body to body ; and from infected articles of merchandize, goods
 or clothes, to human bodies.    This opinion is formed, upon seve
 ral facts. One was the immunity from plague which was pre
 served in the Foundling House at Moscow, which was free from
 the disease while the population of the town was perishing around^
 by drawing a cordon of troops around the building, which was
 completely insulated, and making the most strict quarantine re
 gulations ; by means of which none of the inmates of the hospi
 tal perished.   Another principal fact was, the effect of shutting
 up or wholly insulating the Frank quarter, during the prevalence
 of the plague in Constantinople, Aleppo, Smyrna, and all the
 other towns which are exposed to ravages of the disease ; a mea
 sure the success of which in preventing the spread of plague, ren
 ders it impossible to suppose that the plague should be commu

    James Frank, M.D. — Has been in countries where the plague
existed,     Thinks it is highly contagious.      Was upon the expe
dition with Sir Ralph Abercrombie in the year 1800, and had the
first establishment of the plague hospital at Aboukir.        The army
landed in the month of March, and was perfectly free from the
disease till about the middle of May; when a person, from the
commissariat depot at Aboukir was reported to be ill, and it was
said that he had the plague ; he was removed from thence to the
hospital, which might be the distance pf about a mile, and con
fined in a tent by himself ; he had been ill about four-and -twenty
hours before at the depot, and it was supposed that he was in
toxicated, and that his disease arose from excess ; he died.         On
the second or third day, two more persons, from the same depot,
in a day or two afterwards, were reported to be sick in the same
manner, and they were sent to the same place.           It was doubtful
whether it was the disease ; and then it became a question how it
 had got to the depot. There were two reports ; one, that it was
imported by a Greek boat from Cyprus with Cyprus wine; and the
other,that it was brought fromRhamanehby theArabs,where it was
known the plague had been raging.          It was afterwards said that
 a man had died on board this Greek boat. The impression upon
 Dr. F.'« mind     is,thatit  was brought        this Greek boat; the
                                                 by
 disease had been at Cyprus and upon the coast of Syria             and
                                                                    ;
 Brigadier General Koehler, and the detachment of artillery under
 his command, had fallen victims to the disease, and died at Jaffa
 three months previous. As before stated, he had the superinten-
 dance of the plague hospital at Aboukir, and consequently the
arrangement for the accommodation of the plague patients, though
 not the immediate charge of the sick; for         had spread from the
                                                  it
 attendants, who had caught the disease from those persons above
 mentioned who had died, to the sick of the hospital. His whole
 arrangements were made, upon the principle            of
                                                       its being conta
 gious, to prevent its spreading to the army, which was in the
 lines before Alexandria, at   a distance of ten or twelve miles from
 the depot.     The hospital at that time consisted of the wounded
 men after the actions of the 8th, the 13th, and the 21st of March.
There were very few sick, who were placed in some rude huts,
 which the French had built for there was no house whatever at
                               ;
 Aboukir, the village having been destroyed; and among those
 sick the plague patients were sent,        having appeared that the
                                            it
 disease had been communicated to them            by
                                                  the attendants upon,
 the first plague patients;  and as    was impossible to say who had
                                       it
 got the plague or who had not, Dr. F. recommended that the,
 whole should be guarded       sentinels, and that the whole should be
                              by

20     Report  from the Select Committee appointed to consider
 thrown into quarantine: this was effected. The disease increased
 in the huts at Aboukir ; and the medical officers, and the ser
vants attending upon those patients, were almost all seized with
 the disease, and several of them died ; three or four hospital mates
 died.    From these facts deduces his opinion that it is a conta
 gious disease ; for had it not been so, there would have been an
equal number of patients, or probably more, among the wounded
 than there w,ere in the huts ; the wounded men, who were in
 tents and in temporary buildings, being separated from the huts
at least half a mile, or probably nearer a mile. These precautions
 having been taken, of throwing the whole of the plague patients,
 as soon as circumstances would admit, under quarantine, kept,
he thinks, the army upon the lines before Alexandria very free
from the disease ; believes there were very few, if any, cases of
 plague sent from thence to Aboukir. The plague was almost en
 tirely confined to Aboukir ; there could have been but very few,
if any, of the army before Alexandria who bad the plague, during
the whole of the time that the plague hospital was at Aboukir.
 If a person infected with the plague on board any vessel in the
Mediterranean, was coming to Great Britain, should suppose
that he would either die or be cured upon the passage, if the
voyage was very long; if he lived, he would probably arrive
without the seeds of the disease about him.         Considers that it
would not be possible to introduce a person from the Mediter
ranean,. infected with the plague, into our quarantine establish
ments, after a long voyage.         Thinks it probable that infected
goods    will retain the infection,  unless exposed to the air ; and
therefore whenever they are exposed to the air, the persons han
dling them are liable to infection if certain circumstances are fa
vourable to bringing out the contagion.        Believes the plague in
the year 1665 was the true Levant plague.
     Richard Harrison, M.D. — Was at Naples in 1816 and 181/ :
during part of that time the plague raged severely at Noja, a
town situated about 150 miles from that place.          Saw, also, at
Naples, in the spring and summer of 1817, several persons la
bouring under a contagious disease, which corresponded with
the descriptions generally given of the plague ; but will not assert
it to have been that disorder. Supposes the cause of the plague
to be contagion.      Considers the quarantine establishments as
very   useful j but should conceive, from what he has seen in the
quarantine establishments here, at Venice, Naples, Malta, and
other ports of the Mediterranean, that considerable modifications
might take place.

he would attribute the freedom of England from the plague, — an
                                                               swers,

   the Validity of the Doctrine of Contagion in the Plague.       21
swers, "The diseases of a place are in their nature, even although
they go under the same name, as subject to variations, a3 are
the manners, customs, and circumstances of its inhabitants.       At
one time in this country we had well-marked agueish and asthenic
or inflammatory complaints ; now we have few instances, at least
in London, of pure agues, and our inflammatory complaints de
generate into asthenic congestions or defluxions.     We have had
a change from nervous to bilious ailments, and this not founded
on the caprice of medical systems, but in the nature of the com
plaints themselves.    In Sydenham's time, whose works are full
of the descriptions of the epidemic fevers of London, dependent
on particular constitutions of the atmosphere in various years, it
was computed that 66,000 out of the 100,000 died in London
of fevers.   This large proportion of fevers is now supplanted by
other diseases ; and even our fevers are not of the same com
plexion they were in those days, for we are strangers to the sym
ptoms in them denoting their former pestilential or malignant
quality. But certainly, if any causes could have contributed to
the immunity we enjoy from the plague and bad fevers, they are
to be found in the greater cleanliness and less crowded state of
the inhabitants, with the widening of the streets, arid the better
and more general construction of common sewers and drains ; to
which may be added the profusion of water now distributed
through the metropolis.     There is a passage in Assalini, en emi
nent surgeon, who accompanied the French in their expedition
     Egypt, and who has published the result of his investigations
on the plague, very much in point. After stating that the present
visitations of the plague in Egypt were unknown in the days of
its ancient grandeur ; and that the ruins of entire cities destroyed
and overwhelmed, with the majestic remains of monuments, in
part submerged and surrounded by water, afforded sufficient evi
dence of the revolutions and changes which the whole surface of
Lower Egypt had undergone ; he proceeds thus : { At this day,
the lakes, the marshes, and the filthiness which one finds in the
cities of Lower Egypt, are the principal causes of the frequent
diseases to vvhich they are subject, and which can never be era
dicated until we have found means to purify the atmosphere of
their environs.   This important advantage may be obtained, by
draining off the Waters of the lakes and filling them up ; by keep
ing the cities clean, paving them ; and giving a free exit to the
rain water, which stagnating in different parts of these cities, be
comes corrupted, and, conjoined with filths, infects the atmo
sphere.    By similar operations, several cities and provinces in
Europe, America, and the Indies, have been rendered healthy.
 I have no doubt that the salubrity which we enjoy at this day in
France and Italy, is the result of the amelioration of agriculture

on the plague, although he never saw it, has mainly contributed,
by his authority, to establish the quarantine regulations of this
country,) speaks in a particular manner of Grand Cairo, stating
it to be quite a seminary for the plague ; begs leave to solicit at
tention to the state of that, city, as illustrative of the causes of
plague.     The streets are narrow anil, winding, amid a multitude
of houses which crowd one another ; and it is so exceedingly po
pulous, (several families residing in one house, and a number of
people in each room,) that Savary informs us, two hundred per
sons live within a compass that would accommodate but thirty
in Paris. A great canal, besides, passes through             into which all    it,
manner of filth and carrion           thrown, causing an intolerable
                                            is
stench. Notwithstanding all this, however,                remarkable that
                                                                     it   is
the plague, as well in this city as in others of the same part of
the globe, has its chief seasons         for     breaks out or becomes
                                                 ;        it
epidemic only     when  the hot  sultry winds   from   the south, blowing
across the sandy plains and deserts of Arabia and Africa, begin
to set in. The blasts of these winds are most pernicious to ani
mal life according as they are described
        ;                                                           by
                                                     travellers, under the
names of the Simoon, the Sarnie], the Kampsin, and the Scirocco.
It  would seem that they contained           large portion of hydrogen
                                                      a
or inflammable gas, and that in their full force (for the greater
levity of this gas,       probable, causes them to rush
                         it   is                                 currents,)           in
they extinguish every principle of irritability          the living fibrein                        :
persons killed      by
                    them, speedily become black and spotted, from
extravasated blood.       But to return             fact, that so soon as
                                                      :   it   is   a
these winds cease to prevail, (and         may  here itbe mentioned that
the same winds have been with justice considered,                 the most            by
early writers, the    chief causes of epidemic diseases, particularly
 by  Hippocrates and Pliny       who say, that the pestilence travels
                                       ;
with them from the southern to the western parts of the world,)
 the disease abates.      When, again, the winds from the north
eastern quarters, called               by
                                  Hippocrates the Etesian, or annual
gales,  set in, the season   of health  returns. Conformable to these
facts, Assalini states,          constantly observed, that whenever
                                   '
                                   I
the winds from the south and south-west prevailed, the num
ber of sick and of deaths was always increased.               The contrary
happened    in  fine weather, and when the wind came from the
north.'      As the rising of the Nile happens about the same time
 fchese healthy winds begin to blow, covering the muddy and
slimy surface of its banks, and washing away all the filth which
had been accumulated in the stagnant waters and canals, with
which  it communicates, the cessation of the plague in many places
 of Egypt,      calculated almost to a day.
               is                                  Now,        to the filthy    if
and dirty state      the cities in Egypt and the Levant, the pesti-r

                                                                                             lential

  the   Validity   of the Doctrine of Contagion in   the Plague.    23
le,ntial effects of the regular returns of these enervating winds may
fee attributed, it is very easy to comprehend how London, as Sy
denham gives us to understand, in a like crowded and narrow
and dirty state of the streets without drains, such as it was pre
vious to the great fire, should now and then have been subject,
in particular constitutions of the atmosphere, to visitations of the
plague. Is inclined to think the plague is of an analogous nature
to fever, and dependent on the same general causes, only that the
causes are influenced by the climate and atmosphere of the place,
and by the manners and circumstances of its inhabitants.          It is
the conclusion of a very sensible writer on the plague, who ap
pears to have well studied his subject, that the miasmata, which
in Germany and England produced tertians, in Hungary pesti
lential fevers, in Italy remittents, in Syria and Egypt seem to
occasion the plague. Does not believe the'plague is a contagious
disease, nor fevers in general.
   Being asked to furnish the Committee with some of the early
accounts as to the plague — answers, " The first I shall beg leave
to mention is given by Alexander Benedictus, who tells us, that
in consequence of shaking a feather-bed, which had been thrown
aside in the corner of a house seven years before, a plague was
raised at Wrateslaw, which carried off 5,900 people4in twelve weeks.
The same author gives an instance, of the effects of the pestilen
tial contagion, which had been shut up in a rag fAr fourteen
years.      Hieronymus Fracastorius and Porestus say, that about
 1511, when the Germans were at Verona, twenty-five soldiers
died, one after another, from putting on an old leathern coat;
and that, ere the cause was discovered, 10,000 persons perished.
The coat was then, very prudently, burnt. Another author,
Victor Trincavellius, relates, that at Justinoples, in Italy, some
cords which had been made use of in burying the dead of a
former plague, twenty years before, infected the person who
found them behind a box, and caused the death of 10,000
people.      Our countryman, Dr. Mead, relates, on the authority
of Sir Theodore Mayerne, that some clothes, fouled with blood
and matter from plague sores, being lodged between matting and
the walls of a house in Paris, gave the plague, several years after,
to a workman who took them out, which presently spread through
the city.     The same author discovered that the plague of Lon
don, 1665, was carried to Poole, in Dorsetshire, in a pedlar's
pack, and to Eham, in the Peak of Derbyshire, by a tailor's box ;
but he leaves us in the dark as to the manner by which it was
conveyed to other places in England, over a great part of which
he says it spread.      Ingram, who writes on the plague, gives an
historical account of   it,   respect to foreign countries, from 1346
                              in
to 1665.    t   would only, however, beg leave to give the history
                                   B4                               of

24   Report from the Select Committee appointed        to consider
of its invasions, for the first three years of this period   when, ob
                                                             ;
 serving a direction from about south-east to north-west, it tra
 velled through China, India, Syria, Turkey, Greece, Egypt,
 Africa, Sicily, Italy, Pisa, Genoa, Savov, Provence, Catalonia,
 Castile, Germany, Hungary, Flanders, Denmark and England.
 The bare recital of this carries with it the impossibility of ac
  counting for the introduction of this scourge into so many places
 of the habitable globe, on any other principles than those of at
 mospheric influence.     Even the notion of flights of birds trans
 porting the contagion in their plumage, would obtain less credit,
 than a similar one, that its introduction into the houses of the
 Franks during their seclusion, may be caused by some importu
 nate cat escaping from the cage where she had been confined,
 bringing it back in her tail.
    Dr. Russell states, that it first appeared in England in the sea
 port towns of Dorsetshire ; thence passed into Devonshire and
 Somersetshire as far as Bristol ; and though the Gloucestershire
 people cut off all communication with that city, yet at length it
 reached Gloucester, Oxford and London. This was the great
plague which happened in Edward the Third's time ; and we
 have it from history, that whilst Edward, and his rival Philip of
 France, were thinning the inhabitants of either country by their
 sanguinary conflicts, pestilence carried off one-fourth of the in
habitants of the western world.        London, as might be expected
in those days, suffered the full force of its raging violence, for
in one year there were above 50,000 buried in Charter- house
 churchyard.     There is not a shadow of proof of the importation
of the plague into London in 1665, as is said, from Holland, where
it is stated to have been brought by a bale of cotton from Turkey.
 It seems a bare assertion of Dr. Hodges. This same Dr. Hodges
tells us, that the first instances of it occurred in Westminster,
where about the end of December 1664 two or three people died
suddenly in one family.      Other accounts state its first appearance
to have been in like crowded and unhealthy places, viz. St. Giles
and Clare-market ; all of which, I may observe, are places re
mote from the Custom-house or quays, near which, on the sup
position of its importation, it should rather have broken out.         If,
however,    itdid appear in December 1664,       it must have slept a
good deal for
            ;         by
                     the bills of mortality only four died of    it,
                                                                  from
its very first appearance till the second week of May 1665.            It
was in June       began to spread, sometimes being in one part of
                 it
the town, and sometimes in another.         It  reached its height in
September, and in December      it   very  suddenly subsided.    As to
that of Marseilles again, the king's physicians, sent expressly to
investigate the cause of the plague there, broadly deny that           it
came   by  Chataud's vessel.    But the accounts themselves of this .
                                                                 vessel

   the Validity   of the Doctrine of       Contagion in the Plague. 25
vessel  bringing  it,carry on their face strong marks of improbabi
lity.   In the first place, there was a clean bill of health from the
place the ship took in her cargo.       She left Sidon, on the coast
of Syria, the 31st January 1720, and did not arrive at Marseilles
till the 25th of May, making a long voyage of four months.         In
the second place, admitting the plague was on board of this ship,
how happened      it,  that after three of her crew died at Leghorn,
none of the rest should have fallen sick till two days after her
arrival at Marseilles, when one of the sailors died        ?  And  it   here
                                                                        is
proper to observe, that although she put into Leghorn, where
these men died, she did not carry the disease there on the con ;
trary, the physician and surgeon of the lazaretto there, after in
spection, granted a certificate that these men died of             a malig
nant fever, the consequence of bad provisions,       a   circumstance very
 likely to occur from the length and badness of the voyage.               In
the third place, how happened        it,that  a  cabin boy, who must ail
 along have been with the ship, did not die till some time after             a
quarantine officer, who had been put on board on her arrival at
 Marseilles, died?       The quarantine officer died on the 12th of
June, and the cabin boy on the 23d. But besides this ship of
 Chataud's, the contagionists of those days were obliged to have
 recourse to other ships for bringing the contagion            ;viz.a  Cap
 tain Gabriel's arriving on the 13th of June, and a Captain Ail-
  land's arriving on the 23d from Sidon.          Both these ships, how
  ever, having brought foul bills, were placed under strict quaran
  tine.   Last of all, they are obliged to give countenance to an
  idea, that the crews of all the different vessels smuggled small
  parcels of their goods, in order to account for the disease ap
  pearing in different quarters of the city, particularly in the Rue
  de l'Escale,a  filthy part of Marseilles, like our St. Giles.       There
  chances, however, to be   a   gratuitous admission on the part of the
  medical attendants of the lazaretto, that       a     bad fever had been
  previously   prevailing;  and  Monsieur    Didier,   the  physician, gives
  some cases which occurred even before the arrival of Chataud's
  vessel, bearing every resemblance to the plague, inasmuch as
  parotids and carbuncles were amongst the symptoms.
     Asked whether authors on the plague specify any period after
   exposure or contact, that the disease seizes— anwers," We have
   some wonderful accounts of the subtlety and instantaneous effects
   of the plague contagion. Thus Boccacio,            in  his description of
   the plague at Florence     in  1348,   relates  that   he saw, with his
   own eyes, two hogs instantly fall into convulsions, and die in less
   than two hours, after snuffling about with their snouts, and gnaw
   ing some pieces of bread that had been thrown out of the house
   of poor man dead of the plague.
    a                                        Forestus tells us of young
                                                                    a
   man seized with the disease, only        by thrusting his hand into an
                                                                          old

 26    Report   from   the Select Committee appointed to consider
 old trunk, wherein was a spider's web, which in an instant raised
 a plague sore.      There is a like story in Van Swieten, of an apo
 thecary   who   was  seized with a blister and carbuncle on the leg,
only from kicking up some straw in which his servant, ill of the
 plague, had lain eight months before.        The carbuncle took a long
 time to heal, but he received no other injury with respect to his
 health.    Another person was seized with the plague, only from
holding a bit of thread.       A woman of Zealand removed into Al-
meria in Germany, having exposed some clothes to the sun, some
 children playing on them, received the infection, and all died.
 A man dropped down dead of the plague, by standing on a Tur
key carpet.       A lady, by smelling at a Turkey handkerchief, died
of the plague on the spot.        It is needless to observe, that such
 stories (and a long string more of them might be added) are by
 no means consonant with the general laws of the animal oeco-
nomy.      But they receive a direct contradiction from Russell him
self.    Amongst the many thousands he saw ill of piague, he says
he never met with an instance where the person was sensible of
 the stroke of contagion at the time.        He thinks he has seen ex
 amples   after  some  hours, as  well as after two, three or more days.
He does not think       he met   with  any longer than ten.     As there
 are like traditions about people struck down and dying in open
ing bales of goods in the lazarettos, I would beg leave to give
 Assalini's report thereon. . { It has often been said, that in
breaking open a letter, or on opening a bale of cotton, containing
the germ of the plague, men have been struck down and killed
by the pestilential vapours.       I have never been able to meet with
a single eye-witness of this fact, notwithstanding the inquiries
which I have made in the lazarettos of Marseilles, of Toulon, of
 Genoa, Spezia, Livournia, Malta, and in the Levant ; all agree
in repeating that they have heard of such an occurrence, but
that they have never seen it happen.         Among those whom I have
interrogated about this fact, I may name Citizen Martin, captain
of the lazaretto of Marseilles, who for thirty years past has held
that situation.      This brave and respectable man told me, that
during that time he had seen opened and emptied some millions
of bales of cotton, silk, fur, feathers, and other goods, coming
from several places where the plague raged, without having ever
seen a single accident of the kind.'
    Charles MacLean, M.D. again examined. — To the reasons
which he has before assigned, for considering epidemic and pes
tilential diseases as never depending upon contagion ; begs to
add the following: 1. Generally, because the laws of epidemic
and those of contagious diseases are not only different, but in
compatible; and because pestilences observe exclusively the laws
of epidemics, of which they ar,e but the higher degrees. 2. Be
                                                                  cause

  the Validity   of tlie Doctrine of   Contagion   in the Plague.   27
cause no adequate proof has ever, in any single instance, been
adduced of the existence of contagion in pestilence.            From its
first promulgation to the present day, the doctrine has been no
thing more than a series of gratuitous assumptions.          3. Because
had pestilential diseases been contagious, consequences must have
followed, which have not taken place.         Being capable of affecting
the same persons repeatedly, they would never cease, where no
precautions are employed (and in such casejio precautions could
avail,) until communities were extinguished : Turkey would long
ago have been a desert.       4. Because phenomena now take place,
which, if pestilence were contagious, could not happen.          Instead
of the laws of epidemic, they would observe only those of conta
gious diseases.       5. Because a superabundance of irrefragable
proof has been adduced, showing that pestilence never arises
from contagion; and because the assumption resorted to, in or
der to elude this proof, that ' to the effect of contagion, a parti
cular state of the atmosphere is necessary to produce the disease,'
is only, in other words, an acknowledgement that a particular
state of the atmosphere is its real cause.         6. Because, for cen
turies before any intercourse, direct or indirect, was established
between this country and the Levant, or rather as far back as
history extends, pestilence was at least as frequent in England, as
in the 16th and 17th centuries, when our commercial intercourse
with Turkey was considerable.         7. Because, when the free states
of Italy traded both with the Levant, and with the north of Eu
rope ; when they were the carriers, not only of the merchandise,
but of the troops of the principal powers of Christendom en
gaged in the crusades ; and when they possessed Smyrna, Cy
prus, Candia, Scio, Cephalonia, Caffa, and even Pera, a suburb
of Constantinople, no apprehension was then entertained, under
a constant intercourse, of pestilence being propagated by infec
tion, nor any precautions adopted by any nation for the preven
tion of such a calamity.        8. Because, during the century and a
half which has elapsed since 1665, and in which there has been
no plague in England, our commerce and intercourse with the
Levant have been more extensive, and more rapid than at any
former period. 9. Because there is no reason to believe, that in
modern times, pestilences have undergone any revolution, in re
spect either to their nature or to other causes, further than may
depend upon the advancement or retrogradation of countries re
spectively, in cultivation, civilization, and the arts of life; or upon
an alteration in the seasons.       10. Because, as contagion, where it
 does exist, is sufficiently palpable, (it did not require the evidence
 of inoculation to show that small-pox depends always upon
 that source, and never upon any other,)      if   it  were the cause of
 pestilence,   its existence  could  not, for  thousands  of years, have
                                                               remained

  28     Report from the Select Committee appointed             to consider
  remained concealed.          It must have been discovered, and demon
  strated to the  satisfaction    of the world, by the ancient physicians ;
   and could not now have been a subject of controversy among
  their successors.      1 1 . Because no person has        at any period of
  history   been known    to    arrive  in  England,   from   the Levant, la
  bouring    under pestilence.       12.   Because  no   person employed in
  purifying goods   in  the   lazarettos   of England   or of Malta, has ever
  been known to be affected with pestilence, which could not have
  happened if contagion had existed in the goods ; and because
  such goods could not be uniformly exempt from contagion in
  particular countries, if that were the cause of plague.           If in other
  countries, expurgators of goods in lazarettos have been known to
  be affected, it must have been from other causes.              13. Because,
  after three hundred thousand deaths from plague have happened
  in one season, in Grand Cairo, two hundred thousand in Constan
  tinople, and one hundred thousand in Smyrna, as we are told has
  repeatedly occurred in those places, and the clothes of the dead
  have been worn by their surviving relatives, or sold in the bazaars,
  and worn by the purchasers, the disease, instead of spreading
  wider and wider, as would inevitably have happened, if contagion
  were its cause, (since in that case it could not fail to be carried
  in the clothes,) has, on the contrary, regularly declined and ceased
  at the usual periods.        14. Because, in those countries in which
  the plague is supposed to be introduced by means of contagion,
  conveyed by travellers or goods, as Egypt, Asia Minor and Syria,
 it never occurs epidemically, but at particular seasons ; although
 in the other seasons, travellers and goods from places in which
 the disease prevails, continue equally to arrive.           And because in
 other countries, as Persia, which maintain a similar uninterrupted
 intercourse with places liable to frequent attacks of plague, that
 disease never occurs.

       Sir,                                      The Hague, April 3, 1819.
     In compliance with Lord Castlereagh's desire, communicated
 to me in your letter of the 16th ult. I have made inquiry respect
 ing the quarantine regulations established in the United Nether
lands, and find that the following is the system now practised in
this regard :
     No vessels whatever of any nation arriving in these ports are
subjected to quarantine, excepting such alone as come from the
coast of Barbary. These latter are immediately visited, and care

     I have obtained from the minister of marine printed copies of
the several laws and ordinances of the kingdom, relating to this

language (they being not extant in any other), I have taken mea
sures to get translations thereof, which I shall transmit to the
Foreign Office.         This, however, cannot be immediately effected,
as they are rather voluminous.
     The minister of marine has likewise informed me, that a com
mission has been appointed by the king of the Netherlands, to
inquire into the subject of the quarantine laws, to report thereon,
and to suggest any further regulations that may be considered
necessary.        I have, &c.

          of. Inquiry, on an Order of the Select Committee of the Ho
          nourable House of Commons respecting the Contagion of
          the Plague.
       Rochester. — The books and records at this port do not go
   further back than the year 1716.           A proclamation relative to
   quarantine appears to have been issued on the 25th August 1720,-
   and the first regular quarantine establishment appointed at that
                                                                     time,

  time, although in a letter in 1722 allusion is made to the former
  quarantine iu 1709, when sheds were erected for airing goods at
  Hoo Fort. In the year 1721, permission was granted to air goods
  on the decks of the importing ships, or in hired craft ; and this
  practice seems to have continued until the year 1755, when the
  first floating lazaretto was established at Standgate Creek.
      There is not any record of a case of absolute plague in any la
  zaretto at this port having occurred, from the earliest period that
  can be traced to the present time ; but the following cases of
- strong suspicion, as to the cargoes of the ships being contagious,
  appear to have occurred :
                              —
      In 1721,   the ships "Turkey Merchant," and" Bristol," with
  their cargoes,   were  taken from Standgate Creek out to sea, and
  burnt,in pursuanceofan order in council, datedthe28thJulyl72l.
      In 1792, a chest of goods burnt, imported in the " St. George,"
  from Zante.
      In 1800, the ships « Aurora," " Mentor," and " Lark," from
  Mogadore, were destroyed, with their cargoes, pursuant to an
  order in council of the 7th January 1800 (grounded upon a re
  presentation of the Committee, consisting of His Majesty's physi
  cian and others), great suspicion being entertained of the same
  being infected with the plague.     The master of the " Lark" died
  at Mogadore, where the disease was raging at the time the ves
  sels sailed ; and it was reported that nearly all the persons who
  assisted in loading the ships, also died of the plague.
      In August 1814, a large quantity of hare skins, imported in the
  a Lucy," from Smyrna, were burnt by order of Dr. Pym, upon
  a report made to the Lords of the Privy Council, from the Con
  sul at Smyrna, that the persons who were employed in removing
  and packing the said skins, had died of the plague.
      Portsmouth. — It cannot be ascertained, that any case of ab
  solute plague has ever occurred at this port, on board any laza
  retto.    No regular lazaretto was appointed until the year 1805,
  previous to which time it was the usage to hire vessels for the
  airing of goods.
      Falmouth. — The officers at this port are not aware that any
  case of what is usually called plague, has occurred ; but have
  stated, that a disease, highly contagious, has frequently occurred
  there, and been arrested by precautionary means.
      Milford. — No case of absolute plague has occurred at this
  port. The first lazaretto established here, was in the year 1806;
  previous to which it was the practice to hire vessels to air goods
  on board, subject to quarantine.
      Bristol. — No instance is on record of any case of absolute
  plague having occurred at this port', from 1619 to the present
  time.     Lazarettos were first established, pursuant to the act of
                                                                  the

the 26th Geo. II. cap. 6 ; prior to the passing of whch act, no
information can be obtained as to what regulations were adopted
for the due performance of quarantine.
    Liverpool. — The officers at this port have not any know
ledge of the plague having had existence in any lazaretto, or
other vessel there. The first regular lazaretto was appointed in
the year 1815; and previous to that time, and for about forty
years before, it was the practice to hire vessels to air enumerated
goods on board, and prior to that period, such goods were aired
on board the importing vessels.
    Hull. —The officers at this port cannot find recorded in their
books, a case of absolute plague in any lazaretto, during the last
200 years.
    Hired lazarettos were first employed at this port in the year
 1774 ; before which time it was the usage to employ labourers on
board the vessels placed under quarantine, in airing their cargoes.
IV. On     the Third Edition of Professor Jameson's System
                                                                             of
                  Mineralogy.      By P.J. Brown, Esq.
                               To  Mr. Tilloch.
           H aving derived much         pleasure from the study of mi
neralogy, I looked forward with some anxiety for the promised
third edition of Professor Jameson's System ; indulging the
                                                                         hope
that five years experience since the publication of the second,
would have weaned him, in some degree, from his implicit at
tachment to the external system of Werner ; and that
                                                                  reflection,
aided by the extensive opportunities of study which he cannot
fail to possess, would have produced a work worthy of the science
and of himself.
   On receiving the third edition my expectations were
                                                                        high,
when I saw it stated in the title page that the minerals were ar
                             "
ranged according to the Natural History method." — As nothing
can be less natural than attending altogether to the external
                                                                           ap
pearances of minerals, without any reference to the nature of
their constituent parts, (considering how many adventitious cir
cumstances may and do give rise to considerable variations in
their exterior aspects,) I could not but suppose that the "natural
history method" consisted in assigning to each individual a place
in that situation where its relation to the neighbouring species
entitled it to a claim*.
   * This principle is the foundation of the natural
                                                     methods in zoology and
botany ; and Sir James Smith most sensibly observes , that it is by the test of
Jussieu's arrangement that the validity of any genus in the latter science
must be proved. It is true that for the purposes of general stuay,
                                                                         more
particularly with tho3e who have not opportunity of entering very deeply
                                                                           into

 32                    On the Third Edition         of
     Let us now ask, What is the most evidently natural mode of
 arranging the subjects of the mineral kingdom ? Is it in forming
 orders from the various combinations of the most obviously di
 stinct substances ? or, Does it consist in collecting from various
  quarters, those minerils which possess an agreement in some ex
  ternal characters, however they may differ from each other in
  more material points ; separating them without remorse from
 species which nature has established as their nearest kindred ?
 According to the first method, what can be more natural than
 forming an order from each particular metal, commencing with
 it in its pure state, and following it through its several combina
 tions with oxygen, sulphur, and the different acids, in every one of
 which the metal will still form the most characteristic ingredient?
 — What can be more unnatural than the second plan of huddling
  together a most heterogeneous collection of species, merely because
  they have the same colour, the same kind of lustre, or are nearly
 of the same weight; without ever inquiring of what they consist ?
     Since the earliest attempts to reduce the mineral kingdom into
 order, it has almost invariably been the practice to divide it into
 four principal sections, or classes; viz. the earthy, metallic, sa
 line, and inflammable bodies : the two latter being very few, it
 follows that nearly the whole science is divided between the two
 former; which might be expected to have some obvious and con
 siderable distinctive characters.         How are they separated by
 Professor Jameson ?
     Class 1st. Earthy minerals, tasteless ; specific gravity above 1 '8.
     Class 3d. Metalliferous minerals, tasteless; sp. grav. above T8.
     What a wonderfully scientific division !
     Following the external system, Jameson arranges under his
 class of earthy minerals, above 50 kinds which had hitherto been
 considered as metallic ores ; and of which above 40 do not ap
 pear to have one particle of any kind of earth in their composT-
 tion ! — Can this be scientific ? and of the few which yielded a
 portion of earth, on analysis, several did not contain 4 per cent,
 which most probably was accidentally derived from the matrix.
     We will state as an example the copper ores as arranged in
 the second edition of the Professor's system ; and show how they
 are distributed in the third, in order to judge whether the science
 advances or retrogrades under his direction : premising that the
 coppers are selected as being one of the most numerous, and not
by any means in consequence of their having been more parti
 cularly disjointed.
 into the investigation of botany, the sexual system of Linnaeus affords faci
lities which could not be derived from any other extant ; but it is invariably
distinguished by the appellation of the
                                        " artificial system," in consequence of
its occasioning the separation of many genera naturally very nearly allied.

     Now, in the name of common           sense, what business      can these
latter have amongst the earths P What business can the sulphate,
molybdate, chromate, phosphate, carbonate, muriate, and arse-
niate of lead ; together with the carbonates of zinc, manganese,
 and iron, have amongst the earths jumbled into an order with
 the combinations of barytes and strontian, and the tungstate of
 lime ? while other combinations of the same metals are trans
ferred to the various divisions of ores, pyrites, glance, blendes,
l&c. — We used formerly to hear a great deal about the dismem
 berment of Turkey : but I trust no plan of dismemberment was
 ever actually carried into execution with such a vengeance as
 this.
     However inconsistent the book may be with nature and rea
 son, we might at least expect it to be consistent with itself.          Is
        —
 it so ? The essential characters     of the order  "  Spar,"   and  with
 out which I should presume nothing could be a spar, are " no
 metallic or adamantine lustre — streak white — hardness 3*5             e.   (i.
 half-way between calcareous spar and fluor) to           7   <?. equal to

 amorphous."        Independently  of  the  inimitable  improvement      of
 introducing negative    characters into natural  history,  are  the above
 requisites complied with     ?   Have we not in the order " Spar,"
 bionzite, Schiller spar, hypersthene and anthopfiyllite with                       a
 metallic-pearly lustre— common hornblende, hornblende slate,
 schiller spar and hypersthene with greenish-gray streaks — rock
cork, amianthus, common asbestus, and rock wood, very soft —
 rock cork with a specific gravity of 0*679 to 0-991, and mealy
zeolite " sometimes so light as nearly to swim on water?"                       Is
not the latter, with its low specific gravity, " massive, reniform,-
 coralloidal, sometimes forming       acrust over the other subspecies
 of zeolite, and sometimes disposed in delicate fibrous concre
 tions?" And are these amongst the scientific forms which exempt
a mineral from being considered amorphous                 Have we not,
 tlirust into the middle of the order " Spar,"
                                                         ?

&c. not possessing the essential characters        ? with an admission
 that they have no real business there; but that "on account of
their affinity with some members ot the felspar genus," they are
as well there as any where else
                                        known " from all other earthy

includes in the very order of which heavy spar forms                 apart,
eleven of his earthy minerals, whose specific gravities far exceed
that of the substance in question, many of them being above half
as high again; and            the other neiv earthy orders will be

    these from their dearest friends on such trifling grounds. Why
    not, most worthy sir? You have felt no such compunction on
«   other occasions : and givg me leave to add, that if you establish
    characters to which you do not adhere, they are good for nothing*.
    We are told, in       the preface, that the arrangement                "   is totally in
    dependent, of any aid from chemistry;" and again, that " the
    chemical characters and composition of simple minerals are not
    employed in arranging and determining the species." Yet, at the
    close of many of the articles we have, under the head of " Ob
    servations," some of the most valuable information contained in'
    the work; consisting in a great measure of 'such discriminating
    characters as will enable us to distinguish the preceding species
    from those to which it bears the most perfect resemblance : these
    differences are in many cases external, but very frequently de
    pend on the effect of the blow-pipe — sometimes on the action of
    acids : thus, this perfectly independent system, although it will
    not suffer chemical phaenomena to make part of the essential
    characters of a mineral, resorts indirectly to chemistry for light,
    where its own vague and indeterminate language would only lead
    you into a labyrinth, and leave you in the dark.            One great ob
    jection   to the  external  system      that, is,            by
                                                       allowing the characters
    of each individual to occupy nearly        or   quite a page, and       in              by
     troducing shadowy distinctions, which, so far from being un
     derstood from mere description, can scarcely be comprehended
     when pointed out          by
                              an instructor,      banishes all hope of being

     able to carry any useful degree of information in the memory;
     and leaves the determination of species to instinct, or tact. On
     reference to the book, the mind becomes bewildered with the in
     definite definitions. — Look at fibrous brown zinc blende there               :              is
     nota   character but what       included in the more diffuse account
                                             is

     we are told that, the former differs from          " principally its re

     also " nearly resembles bismuth glance in its external characters,

                                                                  ;     doubt      a

observing what are its associates ! I presume, when the Professor
adopted this mode of instruction, he bore in mind the old adage j
" Tell me your company, and I'll tell you what you are."
    Should this " natural history method" gain a footing in other
branches of science, what a scene of confusion would ensue ! We
must no longer seek for the zebra in the genus Equus, but ex
pect to find him associated with a striped tom-cat.         What a
glorious field for ingenuity would be afforded by the particoloured
tribe of parrots ! The derangement of the single genus Psittacus
would open the gates of the temple of immortality.         Pursuing
the plan of beginning at the wrong end, I shall not despair of
seeing some aspiring naturalist reject the teeth, and form an ar
rangement of the Mammalia according to their tails. We should
 then have animals with bushy tails — with tufted tails — with sleek
tails — with curly tails — with stumpy tails — with no tails.   How
 admirable ! to clap a Chinese pig and a Dutch pug cheek by
jowl, just like sulphate of lead and carbonate of barytes. Poor
failen man ! he being the most tail-less of all animals, must then
be contented with the lowest place in the new system of external
 zoology, and become the connecting link between the higher and
 lower orders of animated beings.     Imagine the Lord of the Crea
 tion extending his arms, not for the godlike purpose of succour
 ing the distressed, but to connect the tail of a tadpole with the
 tentaculum of a polype.
    On the whole, I must consider the publication of Professor
Jameson's third edition, as having thrown a greater impediment
 in the way of the progress of mineralogy as a science, than would
 have arisen from the absolute loss of every thing which had been
 written on the subject. We should then have been left to find
 the way by our own ingenuity, without the risk of being misled
 through the guidance of a defective hand-post.       And I feel no
 hesitation ir. expressing my full persuasion that a novice would
 become a more really scientific mineralogist, by a little attention
 to Aikin's Manual, which he may carry in his pocket, than he
 would by a laborious study of the three large volumes of which
 I have been speaking.
    Every publication of this kind makes me more sensible of the
 value of Mr. Chenevix's excellent reflections on some minera-
 logical systems, which appeared in two of your former volumes.
 It would be of much service if those reflections were now pub
 lished in a separate form, and the perusal strongly recommended
 to the public. The purchasers of Professor Jameson's third edi
 tion should be more particularly urged to give them a serious
 consideration ; as they would then, on imbibing the poison, be at
 least in poitession of the antidote.

                                To   Mr. Tilloch.
Sir, — The        occasion of my troubling you with the following
remarks has arisen from the perusal of a most extraordinary fact-
perverting paper, which found a place amongst the highly inter
esting pages of the Quarterly Journal for July last.       The paper
I allude to is styled " A few Facts relating to Gas Illumination."
If by this title the writer meant it to be understood, that the
facts were very few in number, which he intended his paper
should contain ; then it will on all hands be allowed to be well
chosen.    But     if,
                     seriously, the writer of believed, and intended
                                                  it
to make the scientific world believe, that the assertions        sets       it
out with are " facts that are true,"           appears to me, that

 vestigation and consequent improvement.            But alas ! how crest
 fallen must the science and enterprise of this country appear in
 the eyes of other nations, upon reading the succeeding para
 graph ; which, if altogether true, we might fairly call the death-
 warrant of coal gas ! for it says that ** important as this disco
 very was, many defects and inconveniencies have arisen on its
 adoption : coals contain a large proportion of sulphur, which is
 volatilized with the gas, and it has hitherto been found impossi
 ble to purify it sufficiently for lighting close rooms.       The suffo
 cating   smell and  the property  it has  of tarnishing every thing me
 tallic,  exclude its  use from   dwelling-houses, on account of the
 injury it wonld do to our health, our furniture, books, pictures,
 plate, paint, &c." Bravo ! bravo ! Why, Mr. Editor, after this,
 what must our foreign relations think of our granting Acts of
 Parliament to almost all eur large towns, to allow corporate bodies
 to vend this aeriform pandemonium, to the detriment of not
only our health, but our unoffending furniture ! What can they
think, I say, but that through the medium of this said coal gas
we have discovered a method of reducing our overgrown popula
tion, infinitely superior to any of the bright thoughts of Malthus
or his followers ! But to be serious; — for a charge like this, against
not only the " science and enterprise," but the philanthropy and
genius of this country, demands our most serious attention;— and
the question still presents itself, " Is it true ?"
    Fortunately, Mr. Editor, I have not far to wander for a con
futation the most satisfactory.          At this moment, my nose and
eyes have as conclusive an evidence before them as any Argand
lamp can produce, or man the most fastidious could desire, that
it is by no means " impossible to purify coal gas sufficiently for
lighting close rooms !" Not to insult the understandings of your
readers by any endeavours to persuade them that either our
health or our furniture are as yet uninjured ; I will briefly stale,
that since the commencement of this year we have been enjoy
ing the many advantages resulting from coal gas illumination ;
not only in our brewery, offices, and stables; but in our dwelling-
house, consisting of entrance- hall, library, sitting-rooms, dining-
room, laboratory, &c: even our bed-rooms partake of the com
fort it affords. The light by which I am now writing is fur
nished from a chandelier suspended from the centre of the ceil
ing by four chains, two of which partly screen the two tubes by
which the gas is conveyed, the one leading to a ring of 16 jets
which rise between heraldic leaves not unlike a coronet ; and the
other to an Argand of the largest size in the centre, which, for
the sake of our eyes, is guarded by a sphere of ground glass.

from the gas, How can there be ? For when it tests
part of sulphuretted hydrogen, the lime for purifying is changed.
That this          test is very possible as well as very easy,    let me refer
your readers to the evidence borne by Dr. Henry in his late va
luable     "Experiments on the Gas from Coal."               When speaking
of the method of purifying by lime, adopted by his friend Mr.
Lee : " After the second purification," says he, " the gas produces
no change whatever in the test, which preserves its perfect white^
ness, thereby demonstrating the complete removal of sulphuretted
hydrogen.        In this state of purity its odour (even prior to com
bustion) also is so much diminished as scarcely to be at all of
fensive.     Besides, can we for a moment believe that Mr. Lee
would be at the trouble of conveying it in portable gasometers
for   " supplying his house, two miles from the manufactory," if
it was so fraught with this health-and-furniture-spoiling pro
perty? Again: the ceilings of our rooms, too, are just as white as
before the introduction of the gas ; and the slight, though equally
diffused, heat arising from                     it,
                                         considered an acquisition, rather

ready answer to the latter clause of the paragraph we have been

40            Remarks on an              Article entitled   " A few      Facts
 betrays the object of the whole paper, and the secret spring from
 which its objectionable passages have arisen ; that we have only
 to quote the author's own words, to inform us, that, being him
 self either an interested or an enthusiastic admirer of oil gas, he
 is determined to add fictitious brilliancy to its brightness from
 the shorn beams of poor coal gas.            " The employing," he says,
"   of coal instead of oil for the purpose of illumination, has an
injurious effect on one of the most important branches of trade
 a maritime country can possess ; and in proportion as coal gas
is used, our fisheries are injured."            We may truly call this a
 far-fetched objection to bear down the merits of coal gas. How
ever, let us examine the validity of the objection as it is intended
 to apply to us as a maritime nation.              What reduction in the
 price  of  either  oil or  candles   lias taken  place, in consequence of
 the present introduction of coal gas ? Scarcely any, notwith
standing the almost unexampled imports of foreign tallow: and
we have certainly yet to learn, that the perilous Greenland fish
eries are to be compared, as a nursery for our fleets, with our
Newcastle coal-trade, our coasting trade, and the Newfoundland
fisheries.    The fact             is,
                               that where the Greenland fisheries rear
one sailor, the Newcastle coal trade,' the coasting trade, and the
 Newfoundland fisheries rear fifty.
    Let us now proceed to his statement of " the oeconomy of
light from various sources." — This however we shall find            rather      is
difficult to understand, owing to the extraordinary discrepancies
that it  presents, and to the prime cost of oil not being mentioned
even.     We are merely told that one gallon of whale oil " will
yield 90 cubic feet of gas." Mr. De Ville, we are told,            inclined is
to average     itat SO  cubic   feet.    But  for even  reckoning we will
suppose that a gallon (which with us, from               very large dealer,
                                                               a
costs three shillings,) produces 100 cubic feet.            Three shillings
then      the price of one hundred cubic feet
         is                                             oil gas, exclusive
                                                              of
of the fire under the retort.
    Now, what        the cost price with us of its equivalent in coal
                    is
gas  ?   One    ton   of excellent soft coal, which answers to Dr.
Thomson's cherry coal, costs, when laid down in our yard, nine
shillings; but the small coal or cobbles answer very well, and cost
only five shillings       aton*. This         am aware
                                                  I          very cheap in
                                                                    is

the tar converted into gas) 200 cubic feet of excellent coal gas,,
and perfectly equivalent, if purified by dry lime, on the principle
of the Exeter patent*, to 100 cubic feet of oil gas. By this me
thod, which is very cleanly and simple in its application, " all the
costly and offensive operation of purifying is turned into profit !"         f
But we have yet another product from this half-hundred weight
of coal, (which, though " costly," we consider not offensive,) that
of one bushel of excellent coke, which we can readily sell for four-
pence, i. e. for a penny more than the original cost of the coal !
This source of profit is not peculiar to ourselves ; several large
gas concerns are now obtaining it.       The thing is now put in a
tangible shape ; and from     the  data  given, any one may form a
ratio of the comparative values of coal gas and oil gas, let their
prime cost differ in whatever degree.
   As to the next sentence, it contains an assertion so unqualified,
and yet so circumstantially told, that a person unacquainted with
the subject would immediately be led to believe it. But that we
may not lose one word of this precious sentence, we will refer to
the author's own words.      They are these :
                                                 " The oil gas has a
material advantage over coal gas from its peculiar richness in de
fiant gas, which renders so small a volume necessary, that one
cubic foot of oil gas will be found to go as far as four of coal
gas.    This circumstance is of great importance, as it reduces in
the same proportion the size of the gasometers which are neces
sary to contain it ; this is not only a great saving of expense in
 the construction, but is a material convenience where room is
limited."
   * This    method of purifying is very superior to any method I have yet
 seen. More lime is certainly required.        But after it has served this pur
 pose it is in a useable state to lay upon land ; and being saturated with the
 very principles of manure, (ammonia, sulphuretted hydrogen and carbon,)
 it is evidently worth more to the agriculturist, than when in its simple
 state of quick-lime.
    ¦    It
          seems as if the legislature were determined to make all public gas
   -f-
 establishments adopt this method of purifying.        The clause now generally
 introduced into the Act of Parliament, preventing the carrying of anv
 sough or drain or washings into the brook or stream which carries off the
 filth and nuisances of the whole town, through which          itruns,  isno less
 fatal to the method of purifying by lime mud, than  it   issevere upon the esta
 blishment, and prejudicial to the public. — Mark the inconsistency. By a
 prior clause they (the Gas Establishment) are allowed to make as many
 sewers, tanks, and drains as they please    ;    and yet are not allowed to let
'these drains run into the general drain or brook of the place What must be
                                                                    !

   what a most extraordinary point of view must the writer of the
   above have been contemplating his favourite oil gas ! However,
  we must look to him for the proof, as well as to explain the fol
   lowing discrepance, That

  made many important experiments upon oil gas illumination,
  compares oil gas to coal gas as 9 to 5 — not as 4 to 1, as just
  stated ; and that, as a proof, a 10-holed Argand burner will con
  sume 2$ cubic feet of oil gas per hour: yet at page 314 we are
  told that     If  is sufficient ! Now an 18-holed Argand of coal gas
  is never allowed more than five, and often only four, cubic feet
  per hour, which is very near Mr. De Ville's proportion ! To sa
  tisfy ourselves that this last statement is much nearer the truth,
   and that the random proportion of 4 to 1 is a something given
  upon hearsay, and not the result of either theory or practice,
  we have only to consider the two gases theoretically.
       Query?      What would be the proportion of light given off
  during the combustion of 100 measures of oil gas and* 100 of
  coal gas, supposing the former to be all defiant gas, and the
  latter all light carburetted hydrogen ?                 Professor Brande says
  that    "  the fitness of gas for illumination will be directly as its
  specific gravity."        Dr. Henry, in his late experiments to ascer
  tain the degrees of combustibility of the gases, recommends " the
"
  finding experimentally the proportion of oxygen gas required for
  their saturation, and of carbonic acid formed."
      The following table will therefore show at one view, that by

                                                                      experiments,
  the coal gas being in each instance the average of the first seven hours*
  product.     It would have been desirable had Dr. H. given mere particulars
  as to the species and character of the Clifton coal, whether hard or soft ; for
  with us we have but lrttle hard coal that is at all suited to the purpose of
  illumination.    He merely calls it " common coal of fair average qnality."
  But however fair the average may be with respect to Manchester, it appears
                                                                                 to

     Let us now, from the supposed constitution of oil gas and coal
 gas, take a view of their actual composition ; and we shall find
 that, instead of their relative values being as 4 to 1, in reality
 they will seldom be even as 2 to 1 *. And for this evident reason,
that oil gas is seldom or ever (as we have been presuming) free
from light carburetted hydrogen, and likewise that the gas from
coal is never free from defiant gas.             In proportion, therefore, as
these two gases are made, by a good or bad method, to approxi
mate, in the same proportion will their relative values approxi
mate. It is therefore evident, that those individuals or towns that
shall be led by this mis-statement to erect gas-holders, or to lav
pipes for oil gas in the reduced ratio to those of coal gas of 1
to 4, will to their inevitable disappointment soon discover the
error ; and it will be found that the proportion      '
                                                             stated as Mr. De
Ville's, of 5 to 9, is the nearest the truth.            -
     With regard to the composition of oil gas, Dr. Henry states in
his paper lately read before the Manchester Society, that in his
experiments upon the decomposition of oil, he always obtained a
mixture of the two gases; but that M. Berthollet had succeeded in
obtaining from oil [query, animal or vegetable] pure olefiant,gas.
From this it is evident, that on the same fortuitous circumstances
of temperature, pressure, and extent of heated surfaces, as mainly
depends the generating of defiant gas from oil as from coal.                 If
further proof were wanting as to the scientific principle, as well
as to the benefit resulting from the passing of crude gas (either
to be far short of being so in comparison with ours. For he says that
" 3500 cubic feet of gas was collected from 1 120 pounds of cannel coal ; and
3000 cubic feet from the same quantity of the Clifton coal." Either of these
products is far, very far short of Brande's experiments (or of the every day's
practice about us). In some experiments at the Royal Institution he obtained
26 cubic feet from four pounds of coal. This shows how much depends on
the method of carbonization, and leads one to suspect, that the gas on
which Dr. H. made his experiments was not generated on the now gene
rally adopted principle, of applying the coal in thin strata, in either semi
circular or elliptical retorts, (to say nothing of the still further improve
ment of the heated medium before condensation,) and that the retorts be
charged every four or five hours, as recommended by Mr. Peckston in his
excellent book upon Gas Lighting ; and not every twelve hours, as seems to
have been the case in Dr. Henry's experiments. We, in our small esta
blishment, greatly prefer four hours charges ; finding thereby we have more
light and less tar from a given weight of coal. Though our coal is rich in
bitumen, the tar produced seldom exceeds one-fourth of the condensible
fluids.
    * See Brande's Manual of Chemistry, page 156. We are there informed
(speaking of oil gas) that
                                " from two to three cubic feet may be regarded
as equivalent  to five   or six  of coal gas." This was published in April; yet
in July we are gravely informed that one of oil gas is equivalent to four of
coal gas  '. !     •   .

44          Remarks on an      Article entitled    " A Jew     Facts
oil or coal) through the healed medium before condensation *,
certainly we have that proof now before us in the essay in ques
tion, which admits the very existence of oil gas to depend upou it.
    The following paragraph your readers will no doubt think with
me is very objectionable, in as much as it does not agree with the
venerable proverb of" Honour to whom honour, merit to whom
merit is due."        It states that " about two years since it occurred
to Messrs. John and Philip Taylor, that it might- be practicable
to construct an apparatus capable of converting oil into gas."
" In theory the project appeared easy," &c. I am sure the in
genious Messrs. Taylors, who move in the highest circle of civil-
engineering, would have been more ingenuous and civil, than to
have thus passed by the prior labours of Dr. Henry, who, not only
iiuo years ago, but, fourteen years ago, laid before the public his
t( Experiments on the Gases obtained by the destructive Distillation
of Wood, Peat, Pit-coal, Oil, Wax, &c. with a view to the Theory
of their Combustion, when employed as Sources of artificial
Light." The first memoir appeared in Nicholson's Journal for
June 1805. The second in the Transactions of the Royal So
ciety for 1808! !          In reply to this I shall only quote Nelson's
motto,     "   Palmam     qui meruit fefat;" and say, that though fifty
    •  I certainly feel no small degree of pleasure to think that the pages of
The Philosophical Magazine for April and November 1818 should bear the
 prior record of this my favourite system, which for two years I have been
making almost numberless experiments upon ; and indeed, the more I sec of
its action, both on the large and small scale, the more I am convinced that
it  must prevail and become general.       Those who still doubt that by it a
much greater per centage of olefiant gas as well as carburetted hydrogen
 is produced from a given quantity of coal, will do well to visit the gas esta
 blishments at either Bath or Cheltenham, the brilliancy and purity of the
gas at which places are becoming quite proverbial. Mr. Manby of the Horse-
ley Iron Works was, 1 believe, the engineer employed in each of the above-
 mentioned towns, and with whom the idea of the heated medium occurred at
 much about the same time as with Mr. Parker of Liverpool and myself.
 Mr. M. informs me that at Bath, eight retorts with the heated medium elicit
 more and better gas, than twelve retorts did prior to its adoption, the re
 torts in each instance being charged alike! I mention this, in order to show
that it must have been from the want of heated surfaces, that Dr. Thomson
 in his truly valuable " Experiments to determine the composition of the
 different species of pit-coal," did not succeed in obtaining good gas from
 coal tar.   He says that the gas obtained " yielded too little light to make
 it  worth  while to prosecute such experiments further."       Whereas in my
 own apparatus we daily decompose the tar, and produce a light from it
 equal in brilliancy fo any oil gas ! To the truth of this many scientific
 friends can bear witness, the retort being so constructed as to serve for the
 decomposition of either coal, coal-tar, oil, tallow, or kitchen grease ; on the
 former of which numbers of analytical experiments enable me to 9tate, that
 there are yet many curious phenomena to be developed, besides those
 which I published in No. 252 of The Philosophical Magazine.
                                                                        patents

                     relating      to   Gas Illumination."                                        45
patents should be taken out for oil gas apparatus, yet is Dr. Henry
the prior inventor both of the theory and practice*.
    This is much of a piece with the preceding attempt to make
the world believe that there is no such thing as a coal gas ap
paratus upon a small scale for private individuals, and that all
public companies are monopolists.        He says, in fact, that coal
gas is " confined to public companies or large establishments,
thereby materially limiting its utility, and producing an injurious
monopoly." What !           like the town of Derby, the company,
                            if,

their Act of Parliament to 10 per cent, profit       Let them make  !
 use of oil instead of coal, and    am sure that they need not pray
                                        I
 Parliament for any such restriction.
    One other statement allow me to reply to, and then will re                        I
lease your readers from these futile objections against coal gas.
 We are told that " the light of an Argand burner of coal gas,
compared with one of spermaceti oil, may be estimated as          to                           2£

 Sir, — There         are,  I am inclined to  think, among your readers,
 a considerable number of persons, not professed astronomers, to
 whom the appearance of a comet is an object of considerable in
 terest : and I must confess my surprise that no one among them
 has favoured you with his observations on the beautiful one by
 which we were lately visited.
     This circumstance must plead my excuse for troubling you with
 the following particulars: and I shall be most highly gratified if
 my humble attempts should incite some one possessed of superior
 abilities and means to enter further into the subject.
     It was formerly a practice with the editors of scientific miscel
 lanies, to publish representations of the kind now submitted to
 your notice ; and as the path of the late comet is remarkable for
 its deviation from a great circle, 1 have thought it a favourable
 opportunity for recurring to this custom. — (See Plate I.)
     The accompanying sketch was originally made from the joint
 observations of myself and a friend ; and on comparing it with
 those from Greenwich, and with nearly fifty* made at the Parisian
 Observatory, I have the satisfaction to find that it does not re
 quire any sensible correction.
     The region traversed by the comet is perhaps as barren as
 could have occurred, there being not a single star greater than
 the fifth magnitude, if we except two of the fourth, in the fore
 foot of UrsaMajor, one of which is seen to the left of the plate.
 The stars are laid down in it from Bode's large catalogue, brought

                                            August, and recently published in
  Conn, des Terns for 1822.    Among my memoranda, I find an extract from
 the Public Ledger of July 28th, containing an observation said to have
  been made at the Observatory Gosport, July 21, at llh59,n15s, on the me

 VI.     Particulars      of  the Sword of Meteoric Iron presented              ly
       Mr. Sowerby          to the Emperor Alexander of Russia.
 In    June 1814 Mr. Sowerby had a sword-blade hammered at a
 low red heat, out of a slice of the nicoliferous iron from the South
 of Africa, and supposed to be of the same meteoric origin as
 those stony masses* which have so frequently been seen to fall
 through the atmosphere.               This blade was welded into a steel
 haft, and mounted in steel ; it was intended to present it to the
 Emperor of Russia while His Imperial Majesty was in England;
 but various circumstances united to frustrate that design, and it
 was forwarded to the Minister of the Interior at St. Petersburgh.
 Here a fresh delay was experienced, in consequence of the dis
 turbed slate of Europe which kept the Emperor from that city.
 At length, however, it has been received ; and a letter, part of
 which is copied below, was sent to Mr. Sowerby by the Minister
 of the Interior :
    " Sir,                     Several    circumstances have hindered for
 some time the presentation of your letter and sword to the Em*
 peror."
        Now, I have the honour to inform you, sir, that His Im
perial Majesty has been pleased to read your letter, and to accept
 your sword with particular benevolence ; and, as a mark of his
satisfaction, to make you a present of a ring adorned with dia
 monds and a large precious stonef in the middle of them,"
    " As Dr. Creighton, Physician to His Imperial Majesty, is
going now to England, and is so good as to take upon him the
 delivery of this my letter and of the said ring to you, I send it
herewith by him.           I feel at this moment a double satisfaction,
both for your zeal towards my gracious Sovereign, and for the re
 ward you have so worthily merited by it," &c.

Yorkshire,   and is now preserved with many others in Mr. Sowerby's museum
of the natural productions of Great Britain. The fullest account of this
stone is published in the second volume of British Mineralogy, with a figure.
It was the sight of this stone that changed Mr. Cavendish's opinion, who
had previously considered that the story of falling stones was ill founded.

another which fell in Normandy, are all of them (at least such
specimens as have been seen here) so full of earthy matter, py
rites, or flaws, as to render them totally unfit for hammering into
any instrument, even of small dimensions. The only attempt of
the kind on record was made in 1620, when Jehangire, Em
peror of the Moguls, had four blades formed from the iron of
lightning, as it was called ; but the workmen found it necessary

      That meteoric stones were revered by the ancients, we have
many authorities for believing; and it is understood that the
Psalmist alluded to them, when he said, ' The Highest gave his
voice, hailstones and coals of fire.* And it is also understood that
the first wonder of the world, the Temple of the Ephesians, de
dicated to Diana, was built in reverence to one of them. And in
the Acts the town clerk appears to mean a similar thing when he
observes, • What man is there that knoweth not how that the city
of the Ephesians is a worshipper of that which fell down from
Jupjter ?' A stone which fell at Ensisheim was preserved in the
church in the Emperor Maximilian's time. In short, every part of
the globe has been visited by such phenomena at some period,
and particularly Russia and Europe lately, where hundreds have
witnessed their fiery descent.                     .              .    •
    "In   1805, Mr. Sowerby received part of the large mass of
iron found upon the surface of the ground about 200 miles within
the Cape of Good Hope by Captain Barrow.              Another piece
sent to Holland, is all that was brought away. The remainder was
removed as far as the Table Mountain ; but its situation is now
unknown. It has been examined bySmithson Tennant, Esq. who
found in it about 10 per cent, of nickel, which adds to its tough
ness, gives it a silvery lustre, and proves its analogy to the small
grains of iron dispersed through the stones and the masses of iron
which have been showered clown from meteors in Russia, Great
Britain, Benares, Normandy, &c. which is distinguished from
all other iron of this globe, by its containing a portion of nickel
 alloyed with it.
    " The blade has been hammered at a red heat, without admix
 ture, out of a single piece of this iron, an inch thick, ground and
polished. Its spring was given it by hammering when cold. The
haft was lengthened by welding on a small piece of steel. It was
found to work very pleasantry, the whole operation taking about

     The length of this sword is two feet: it is slightly curved,
pointed, and sharpened at both edges to eight inches from the
point: its width is 1 inch and 3-8ths. The part that is blunt
at the back is nearly rilled on one side with engraving : beneath
the imperial crown is a wreath of laurel and palm inclosing the
word " Mercy:" under this is the Russian spread eagle, and then
the following inscription :        " This iron having fallen from the
 heavens, was, upon his visit to England, presented to His Ma
jesty Alexander Emperor of all the Russias, who has successfully
joined in battle to spread the blessings of peace through Europe,

    The surface is not quite free from blemish, in consequence ef
the spreading of some minute flaws in the material; but they are
only superficial, and will serve to distinguish this blade from any
imitation that might be made of it. It possesses an excellent
spring, much hardness, considering it is not steel, that is, equal
to an old Highland broad sword, and a whiter colour with a
more silver-like lustre than other iron.
    It is highly probable that the foliated structure of most of the
other meteoric irons* will render them unfit for hammering out
 to such a length as is necessary for a sword blade, if they will
bear hammering at all. Thus the blade above described is not
 likely soon to have a rival : it was fitted up in a black scabbard
mounted with steel, — a material by no means generally used in

    The      ancient chemists contented themselves with repeating, that
     the action of sulphuric acid concentrated on vegetable substances
     does no more than carbonize them.              Among the moderns, M.
    Berthollet was of opinion that the hydrogen of the vegetable sub
    stance united itself to the oxygen of the sulphuric acid, and that,
    in thus forming of it water and sulphurous acid, the carbonous
    principle was separated and precipitated.           Messrs. Fourcroy and
    Vauquelin endeavoured afterwards to throw some light on this
    phenomenon. They imagined that it did not disengage itself
   from the sulphurous acid ; and they devised an ingenious theory
    to this effect, but which seems to me to rest on very slender
   grounds.
       In examining the remarkable changes which organic com
   pounds experience from the action of sulphuric acid, I have been
   led to results very different from those obtained by these illus
   trious chemists ; and I natter myself that the important facts
   which I have to present will contribute to cast a new light on
  many phenomena of vegetation,, and may be usefully applied to
   the arts.
                Action of Sulphuric Acid on Elm Saw-dust.
      Twenty grammes (308' 9 gr.) of elm saw-dust well dried, were
  moistened with cold sulphuric acid of commerce of the «pe-
  cific gravity 1*827, and the mixture stirred with a glass tube.
  It became very hot; and, according to the theory of M.Berthollet,
 the sulphurous acid gas disengaged itself with impetuosity ; the
 ashes became black, and appeared to be in the state of charcoal
                                                                               •

 dried and thrown into the fire, burned with flame.                 It did not
sensibly colour cold water; but it communicated to boiling water,
 and to alkaline solutions it gave a deep brown colour.                It was
 nearly    in the  same   state which    the  saw  dust would  have   been  by
exposure      for  some   years to  air  and   humidity.   The    acid liquor,
which was almost as colourless as water after having been satu
rated with carbonate of lime, yielded, on evaporation, a yellowish
gummy matter, with a solution of which the subacetate of lead
formed an abundant white magma. This gummy matter, treated

saturated with chalk, and then evaporated, yielded 10 grammes
(lo4*5 gr.) of       gummy substance of a reddish-brown
                         a                                        colour.

I   thought that this disengagement of sulphurous acid must at

 tions as proper to be followed, in order to obtain the purest pro
 ducts    for, whatever the process adopted may be, no sulphurous

          disengaged, nor    there the least indication of matter of
                                     is
 a  carbonous appearance.     This mucilaginous mass dissolved en
 tirely in water, with the exception of an amylaceous matter which
  weighed when dry 2*5 gram. (38*6), and which was nothing but
 a  part of the cloth which had not been sufficiently acted upon by

  Gum, Sugar, and an Acid, by means       of SulphuricAcid, &c.  55
the sulphuric acid.    The mucilaginous mass thus diluted in wa
ter was saturated with chalk, and, being filtered through a linen
cloth, became clear, and had only a very slight amber colour.
After washing the filter well, and pressing strongly the sulphate
of lime, I united the liquors together, and evaporated them to
the consistency of a syrup, which was less coloured than that of*
capillaire. A small quantity of sulphate of lime was separated on
cooling. I continued the evaporation carefully until the mass
was quite dry, and I obtained a transparent gum, slightly co
loured ; it weighed 26-2 grammes (404*6 gr.) and was produced
from 21*5 grammes (332 gr.) of cloth, deducting the one gramme
of water, and the 2-5 grammes (38*6 gr.) of amylaceous ligneous
matter.     I must not omit to mention that the sulphate of lime
resulting from the saturation, although well washed, still re
tained vegetable matter ; for on being exposed to the fire it took
a brownish colour, and gave out an odour of sulphurous acid.
In order to ascertain whether this remarkable increase of weight
might not be owing to a fixation of the elements of water or sul
phuric acid, five grammes (77*2 gr.) of this artificial gum were
dissolved in water ; I added to the solution some oxalic acid, in
order to precipitate the lime which it held in combination, and
which might also be precipitated from it by sulphuric acid. The
precipitate of oxalate of lime, collected and strongly heated, gave
()'2S grammes (4 -3 gr.) of lime.
    The gummy solution thus precipitated was evaporated to dry
ness, and the residue treated with boiling nitric acid, and diluted
with water; some nitrate of barytes was added, which produced a
precipitate, that when heated red weighed 1*6 gramme (24*7 gr.)
 which contained 0-54 gramme (8*34 gr.) of sulphuric acid. As
there was therefore no aeriform fluid disengaged during the ac
tion of the sulphuric acid on the cloth, the 26-2 grammes
(404'6 gr.) of gummy matter which we obtained may be sup
posed to be formed thus :

    It will be remarked that the manner in which we have viewed
 the action of sulphuric acid concentrated on the cloth is very
 opposite to that of Messrs. Fourcroy and Vauquelin, since these
 chemists admit that the vegetable matter is decomposed, and di-

vides itself into charcoal and water, which by uniting itself to the
acid produces the heat which is developed ; but this heat appears
rather to be owing to the actual fixation of the elements of the
sulphuric acid and the water in the undecomposed vegetable sub
stance.
   Being desirous of knowing whether the sulphuric acid diluted
with half its weight of water, could convert the ligneous mat
ter into gum ; I moistened some cloth with this acid thus
reduced, but I did not obtain any mucilaginous mass.         Exposed
to a gentle heat and agitated continually, it resolved into a very
homogeneous paste, which mixed with water gave a white sub
stance resembling boiled starch ; further diluted it appeared like
an emulsion.     On holding it up to the light, we remarked that
the white matter held in suspension was formed of a multitude
of brilliant spangles of extreme tenuity, nearly similar to what
may be observed in a solution of soap.        This sort of emulsion
on being allowed to stand deposited, though very slowly, a sub
stance which we took at first sight for starch, but which has
none of its properties ; it represented almost the whole of the
cloth employed. The liquor separated in this manner gave, after
being saturated with chalk, a small quantity of almost colourless
gummy matter, which appeared to me to contain but few traces
of sulphuric acid.
    If the cloth be moistened with nitric acid, it may also be con
verted into a white starchy matter.         No apparent alteration is
manifested at an ordinary temperature ; but by exposing the
mixture to a hot water bath until nitrous gas begins to be formed,
it is converted into a white and uniform paste, exactly similar
to that obtained by the sulphuric acid. Well washed and dried,
this matter had a slight satin appearance, especially when reduced
to powder ; if moistened, a slight hissing was heard, and it be
 came converted into a paste much divided.          In potash it does
not undergo any sensible solution.      It appears to be the ligneous
matter of the cloth very slightly altered, being nearly analogous
 to what results from the putrefaction of rags for the preparation
 of paper. It might be curious to inquire, whether during this
 sort of fermentation gum and a little sugar are not formed, as
 happens in respect of putrefied starch, according to the recent
observation of M. de Saussure.

This      is a second edition of a work, which should be perused by
medical practitioners, illustrated with many new and striking
cases.      The following extract presents a perspicuous view of the
theory of Electricity advocated by the author.
     " Among the illustrious names who have formed theories on
the electric principle — Franklin and Watson, Du Faye and
Symner, deserve chiefly to be reckoned.         These learned philo
sophers and mathematicians        have entertained different opinions
in accounting for the electrical phenomena.            Some of tlmse
maintained the doctrine of the unity of Electricity in distinct
states ; and others, not without reasons to support their hypo
thesis, contended for two distinct fluids in the electrical princi
ple.     The belief, however, of modern Electricians in one fluid,
mi generis, possessing attraction and repulsion, and other qua
lities on which the system is chiefly founded, may be comprised
 in the following summary.
     " 1st. — That all substances in nature, whether solids or fluids,
 animate or inanimate, have inherent in them a certain portion of
 the electric principle, and which in their proper state is the quan
 tum sufficit of their natural capacity — the just proportion of this
 elementary matter exactly preserving the balance — so that its
 mutual attraction and repulsion should maintain the equilibrium
 of their being —preserve their characteristic differences, and pre
 vent disorganization and decay.
      " 2nd. — A redundancy of this elementary principle compressed
 into a limited capacity, either by a chemical or mechanical agency,
 constitutes that state which is denominated positive or plus Elec
  tricity, while a deficiency of this ethereal principle is designated
  negative or minus Electricity.      These opposite conditions, each
  of which is disorder, exist   as  an accidental effect of some pro
 ducing cause or causes, and exhibit the different appearances
  which result from the action of the electric fluid.
      " 3rd. — The efforts of the electrical principle to maintain its
  natural state in all bodies, not only appear to prove the correct
  ness of this theory, but show that its positive and negative, or
  attracting and repelling powers are only the directions which it
  takes to restore the balance of its disturbed repose. Thus a body
 positively electrified, imparts its superabundant Electricity to one
                                                            negatively

  58                  Notices respecting New Books.
  negatively electrified, or in a natural state, to euable it to bear
  the burden of an accumulated load. In a machine it will be ob
  served, that the rubber and glass disturb the equilibrium of elec
  trical quiet.   The chain and cushion, from the air and earth,
 supply the loss of the electric fluid, imparted by the cylinder to
 the positive conductor, which rushing thence to surrounding
  atoms, returns to the source whence it came.
     " To illustrate these remarks, observe by way of comparative
 analogy, the operations of a common pump. The water is forced
 up from the well by the handle and hand, and passing through the
 spout falls by the power of gravity instantly to the earth. A re
 servoir may, for a season, contaiu a part; but when a vessel is
 over-filled, the superabundant water passes from the inside to the
 outside, and then returns again to its native depositary. But when
 a vessel is not over-filled, the water will be retained in it for some
 time, till it is evaporated ; and then descends again in fruitful
 showers on the parched ground.        So it is with the Leyden jar,
 when charged with the electric fluid ; but it acts with this diffe
 rence, that its outside is in a deficient or attractive state, while
 its inside is overloaded with a propelling fluid, and the whole of
 its contents are discharged at once.
     " Gravity can make but humble claims on the electrical prin
 ciple, and even these are granted rather as a boon than a right,
 for the equilibrium of nature is its grand business and end. The
 Frankliuian theory, therefore, has been found so agreeable to the
 analogy of nature, that it has been generally adopted.       Like the
Newtonian system, the simplicity of the principle gives dignity
to the doctrine j while it supplies the best key to many dark and
otherwise inexplicable points in philosophy, physiology, and pa
                                                                 • .
 thology.
     " The theory of two distinct fluids originated with Du Faye, an
eminent French philosopher contemporary with Franklin, which
he deduced from his practical researches into the different pro
perties of vitreous and resinous electrics excited by friction. As
he found the electricity developed by the positive and negative
electrics was dissimilar in its states, he concluded they were di
stinct fluids, though possessing the same nature and residing to
gether in all bodies.     From their being separated in conductors,
as well as from their reciprocal efforts to unite again, it was sup
posed the truth of this theory was made apparent.         This opinion
was strongly supported by Symner,       who  had  philosophized so in
geniously on the subject, that, though it was contrary to the known
laws of electricity, he gave to the error an air of plausibility.
    "  This opinion, however, is now as much exploded as the as
tronomical systems of Ptolemy or Tycho Brahe.             The double
current of these electricians imposed as much labour on the elec
                                                                     tric

a sound theory, founded on experimental results, is justly due to
 Drs. Franklin and Watson — names which will live in the records
of history, and he handed down with honour to the remotest
posterity."

      The invention to which this pamphlet alludes is the subject of
   a patent in France, and patents have also been granted for it in
   this country.     Its title explains in few words the nature of the
   invention — cc moveable conveniences;" but the moveable part may
   be described rather as the receptacle than the whole apparatus.
   In fact, it consists of two casks so contrived and adapted to the
   seat, that they may be removed from time to time, and others sub
   stituted in their place ; and all so well fitted that no effluvia can
   possibly escape.      In cities circumstanced like Paris, where the
   convenience of water-closets,       as in use in London, is but little
   known, this invention offers many inducements for its adoption.
   The invention however offers other inducements, which, in a na
    tional point of view, as promising an incalculable increase in our
    agricultural products, render it highly deserving of public at
                                                                 tention.

      tention.    We   have often been surprised to think what an im
      mense value   is every year washed into the Thames from the wa
     ter-closets, &c. in London, through the common sewers ; but the
     difficulty of obviating this loss, without great sacrifices in clean
     liness, comfort and health — blessings above all price in a large
     community — always struck us so forcibly, that till we perused the
     pamphlet before us, we never thought of the possibility of pre
     serving, nay, improving these, and at the same time preserving
     separately, both the soil and the urine for the purposes of agri
     culture.    The object is so highly valuable as to be worthy of
    Legislative interference ; and we recommend the subject to the
    most serious consideration of all who take an interest in the wel
    fare of mankind.

                                               Aug. 27, 1819.— At sea.
   After    passing the southern   part  of  Greenland,    named Cape
Farewell,  we  met with much  ice ; but   as it did not lie thick, little
difficulty was experienced in forcing   a  way through    it, nor did  it
prove so great an impediment as the contrary winds which still
               * From Blackwood's Bdjnburgh Magazine.

 continued to thwart us.     Near the Greenland coast the streams
 or fields of ice consisted  of  a collection of loose and compara
 tively flat pieces, more or less densely compacted together, ac
 cording to the state of the weather; but on approaching the shores
 of Labrador, we fell in with many icebergs, or large floating fields
 of ice. The variety of forms assumed by these masses afforded
 us amusement, but occasionally we saw some of such an enormous
 size, that every other feeling gave place to astonishment.        One
 of these larger bergs we estimated to be 200 feet high above the
 water, and above half a mile in length.       Its surface was broken
 by  mountains   of no mean  size, with  deep  valleys between. Enor
 mous   as these dimensions  must  appear, you will be more surprised
 when I inform you, that the part of an iceberg which projects
 above water, amounts only to a ninth part of the whole mass, that
being the proportion of ice which floats above salt water.          Ar*
 thur's Seat clothed in snow would have formed only one pinnacle
 to this berg. When these bodies became familiar to us from their
frequency, we derived much pleasure from the various shades and
gradations of colour they exhibited.        The more compact parts
 were generally of a bright verdigris blue ; towards the base a
fine sea green prevailed ; here and there a tint of red was seen,
and the summits alone were snow-white.          As the part of the ice
which is covered by the sea decays more i»|idly than that which
is in the air, it often happens that one oftT iese islands becomes
top-heavy and tumbles over.        We never saw one in the act of
making this revolution, but most of them bore evident marks of
having been overturned twice or thrice ; the old water lines, in
tersecting each other in various directions, being still deeply en
graved on their surfaces.
    " We first beheld the land (Resolution island) during a fog,
which soon became so thick that we could not see the length of
the ship.     In consequence of this, we got involved in a field of
ice : then, to add to our distress, it fell calm j and although we
could . perceive that we were carried along by a violent current,
yet the fog deprived us of ascertaining its direction, and the depth
                                                                        '
of water was too great to admit of our anchoring. After remaining
in this situation for two or three hours, receiving occasionally
some heavy blows from the ice, an alarm was given that we were
close on the rocks.     We all ran upon deck, and beheld a tremen
dous cliff frowning directly over the mast heads of the ship.
It was perfectly perpendicular, covered in many places by sheets
of ice; and its summit was so high, and shrouded in so thick
a fog, that it could not be traced from the deck.              We had
scarcely time   to make  any useful  exertions ; for  in a few minutes
the ship fell broadside against the cliff, along the face of which

                      Arctic Land Expedition.                      63
she was violentfy hurried by the current, towards a ridge of broken
rocks, which in a short time would have torn the stoutest vessel
to pieces. The heavy swell which prevailed caused the ship in
her passage to beat against various rocky ledges which projected
under water.      One of the blows she thus sustained, drove the rud
der out of its place; but it fortunately hung suspended by tackling
which had been employed to secure it on coming amongst the
ice. At this instant, when all human exertions seemed perfectly
fruitless, the current eddied off shore, the land-breeze sprang up,
a boat that we had put overboard succeeded in taking us in tow,
and — What appeared almost miraculous — one of the last thumps
the ship received caused the rudder to fall back into its place. By
this combination of favourable circumstances, we succeeded in
getting round the poirft we so much dreaded ; and, setting all
sail, we steered from the land.      Upon the first alarm of danger,
the women and children, of whom we had a large number on
board, going to Lord Selkirk's colony, rushed upon the deck
much terrified.     The officers, hower, succeeded in calming their
fears, and prevailed on them to go below out of the way of the
sailors : but scarcely had this been effected, when the current
carried us against a large iceberg which had grounded upon a
ridge of sunken rocks that lay at some distance from the shore.
The crash of the masts and yards, together with the grinding of
the ship's side against the ice, terrified them more than ever ;
but we speedily got clear of the second danger without receiving
further damage.      Our troubles, however, were not at an end ;
 the ship had received so much damage whilst on the rocks, that,
on examination, a great deal of water was found in the hold. All
 hands were instantly set to the pumps ; but, to our mortification,
we found that the water rushed in faster than we could, with
 every exertion, discharge it. Affairs now wore a gloomy aspect ;
 the water in the hold increased to upwards of five feet, and the
 men were getting tired at the pumps, when fortunately the
 weather cleared up a little, and we saw the Eddyslone, one of
 the vessels that accompanied us, at no great distance: we bore
 down, and informed them of our situation. Every assistance in
 their power was promptly supplied ; they sent 20 men and two
 carpenters.    The services of the latter were invaluable, as our
 own carpenter had died in the earlier part of the voyage. With
 this fresh accession of strength, we kept the leak from gaining
 upon us ; and after some time the carpenters succeeded in disco
 vering and patching up the broken parts so as sensibly to dimi*
 nish the influx of water.     Their operations were however slow,
 and  it was not till  the  evening of the second dav that we suc
 ceeded in getting all the water out of the ship. During the whole

   64                   Arctic Land Expedition.
   of this time, not only the officers and men worked hard, btrt even
   many of the women, recovering, their spirits, proved eminently
   useful at the pumps. As the water decreased, the carpenters were
   enabled the more readily to repair the damage that had been sus
   tained : and they ultimately succeeded so well, that one pump
   proved sufficient to discharge the water as fast as it leaked in.
   In this state we have continued ever since.
      " In these straits the Hudson's-bay vessels are generally visited
  by a tribe of Esquimaux, who frequent the shores during sum
  mer, and come off to the ships for the purpose of bartering their
  whole wealth,\vhich consists in whale- and sea-blubber, for iron,
  which has become an article of the first consequence to them.
  Accordingly, one day when we were above 20 miles from the
  shore, these poor creatures ventured off in their skin canoes, pull
  ing with the utmost anxiety to reach the vessels.        It sometimes
  happens,    when  the ships have  a fair wind, that they run past the
  Esquimaux     haunts  without  stopping   : in the present instance,
  however, we were detained by light contrary winds, which en
 abled them to overtake us; and when they did so, they expressed
 so much joy and exultation, that it was easy to conceive how
 great their disappointment must have been when they missed us.
  In a short time we were surrounded by 30 or 40 canoes, each
  carrying one man, with his small cargo of merchandize, which,
  to their great satisfaction, they speedily exchanged for pieces of
  iron, hoops, knives, saws, hatchets, and harpoons, and tin-pots.
 The wind continuing contrary during the remainder of the day,
 we stood in towards the land, and gave the women of the tribe
 an opportunity to come off, which they did in five large canoes
 framed like the large one of skins, but open, and each capable of
 carrying from 20 to 30 people. The oars were pulled by women,
 but there was an old man in each boat to direct them. As they
brought off a great many children, I suppose we saw the whole
 tribe, amounting to nearly 200 souls.
    " The features of the Esquimaux are not the most regular in the
 world: but it was pleasing to see their flat, fat, greasy faces.
 When they had disposed of their articles of trade, we presented
the women and children with a few needles, beads, and other
trinkets, and sent them away highly delighted.         Since that time
we have been contending against contrary winds ; but by perse
verance have succeeded in getting within a few days' sail of York
factory, at which place I shall conclude and despatch.

     Sig. Carlo di Gimbernat has discovered a peculiar substance
 in the thermal waters of Baden and of Ischia, of which he gives
 the following description in the Giornale di Fisica : — "This
 substance covers, like an integument, many rocks in the valleys of
 Senagalla and Negroponte at the foot of the celebrated Epomeo,
 beneath which mountain the poets confine Typhon.              It is re
 markable that in this very place should be found a substance very
 similar to skin and human flesh. One portion of this mountain
 that was found covered with this substance, measured 45 feet in
 length by 24 in height) It yielded, by distillation, an empyreumatic
 oil ; and, by boiling, a gelatine, which would have sized paper. I
 obtained the same results at Baden.         It may therefore be con
 sidered as confirmed that an animal principal is present in these
 thermal springs, which being evaporated becomes condensed in
 their neighbourhood.        To this principle I have given the name
 of " Zoogene."
     The Editors of the Giorn. Fis. state that they have seen the
 substance obtained by M. Gimbernat, and that externally it has
 the appearance of real flesh covered with skin.

                                HISTORY.
     M.  Barthelemy Faujas Saint Fond, Professor of Geology, and
 one of the Administrators of the Royal Museum of Natural His
 tory, died last summer at Paris.     This gentleman was well known
by his various interesting memoirs on geology and other branches
 of science, and by his travels through Scotland.        His passionate
attachment to science induced him to expend           an  ample fortune
in forming a geological museum, and by his numerous travels
and unceasing efforts he succeeded in obtaining a most interest
ing collection, which was sold by public auction at his house ad
joining the Jardin des Plantes, in the last month (December).
M. Faujas is well known to have devoted a considerable share of

attention to the study of volcanoes and volcanic products, and
his collection was particularly rich in specimens from the ancient
volcanoes of Fiance, and other parts of Europe.               These were
purchased by     M.  Beudant   for the private  collection   of the King
of France.     M. Faujas    was  also one  of the  first  geologists who
saw the high importance of the study of fossils          to elucidate the
former revolutions of the globe; and his collection was celebrated
for the numerous and well characterized fossil remains which it
contained, particularly of the class of vertebrated animals.
     M. Faujas possessed the most perfect tooth of the gigantic
Tapir that has yet been discovered. Of these very rare teeth
not more than three or four have at present been found in any
part of the world. The one belonging to M. Faujas was the
hindermost grinder,and is the tooth drawn and described in Cu-
 vier's Recherclies sur les Ossetnens Fossiles, Supplement to the
 article Tapir. PI. II. fig. 7.     This tooth was purchased by Mr.
 Bakewell, who was then at Paris, together with a tooth of the
 Mastodon from the South of France, and another species from
 the Cordilleras, and teeth of the fossil Hippopotamus and fossil
 Rhinoceros. Several magnificent specimens of fossil fish were
 in this collection, particularly one of nearly three feet in length
 from Montebolia in the Veronnais,           the Bluchius longirostris
 (Volta). Among various selections of fossil shells was one series
 from Plaisantin, particularly rich in species of which the greater
 part have their analogies living in the present ocean, as was
 proved by M. Menard de Lagroil, in a memoir published in the
 Annales du Museum d'Histoire Naturelle. The simple minerals,
 in this museum were not very numerous, but there were some
 extremely rare and valuable specimens.
                             BORACIC ACID.
     In our last,  we noticed  the boracic acid found in solution in
  certain lakes in Tuscany.      M. Lucas, in a letter to M. Arago,
 mentions that this acid is found also in the crater of Vulcano.         It
 is met with on the most heated parts of the surface, where va
 pours are continually rising, in a white light state, though some
  times soiled and sometimes mixed with sulphur.            The incrusta
  tions are generally about three-fourths       of an inch thick, and
  sometimes of more than a foot in extent.       It is met with in scales,
  and sometimes fibrous.      The nature of these incrustations was
  ascertained by D. Gioacchino Arrosto of Messina.
                  PHOSPHORIC ACID IN VEGETABLES.

                         NEW VEGETABLE ALKALI.
    MM. Pelletier and Caventon have announced the discovery
of this alkali in the seeds of the Verairum Saladilla. In ex
amining among other vegetable substances which have a marked
action on the animal system, they found, in the Ciradille, a erys-
tallizable alkaline matter extremely acrimonious ; but they have
not yet become perfectly acquainted with its nature.
                       RECTIFICATION OF ALCOHOL.
    A  correspondent of the Giornale de Fisica reports an experi
ment which may be applied with advantage to this purpose.                   It
is a well known fact, that water passes with facility through
 bladder, while alcohol is almost perfectly retained by it.              If a
bottle of wine be closed by a piece of bladder, instead of a cork,
a portion of the water will be found to have evaporated and passed
off through the membrane, and the wine left will be found pro
portionally stronger.        If a bladder half filled with alcohol of the
specific gravity   of   867, and having its orifice closed, be exposed
to the sun, the air, or the heat of a stove, in a short time the al
cohol will be found rectified to 817 spec. gr. and in this manner
all the water may be evaporated. If the same bladder with iU
contents be then exposed to a humid atmosphere, (as in a damp
cellar,) it will imbibe water, and return to 867 spec. grav. which
 water may again be separated by hanging it in a dry place. In
one word, the bladder is a filter, which suffers water to pass through

    MM. Colin and Taillefort have observed, that if any of the
 Wtte or green carbonates of copper are heated to the temperature

of 212° Fahr. they       lose their water and become    Iroivn.   In this
anhydrous state they form a body          of such good colour as to pro
mise to be useful as a pigment.
     But painters have been more at a loss for a durable purple thaH
 for browns, and this desideratum seems at length to be supplied.
 His Excellency the Count le Maistre of St. Petersburgh, in a
 letter to Dr. Creighton (published by Dr. Thomson) describes a
process for obtaining this unchangeable colour. The Count first
 notices the tendency of the muriate of gold to form purple coloured
 compounds — with the oxide of tin; with gelatine and starch, when
 mixed and boiled with them ; and with the earths, if precipitated
 with them and heated : and then gives the following process for
preparing the new colour : — One part of dry muriate of alumina,
 one of sulphate of magnesia, four parts of muriate of barytes, and
five of carbonate of soda, are each pulverised separately.            They
 are then mixed in a glass mortar, and a little water is added,
 merely enough to moisten the mixture.           Then a diluted solution
 of gold is added, by little and little, pounding the matter all the
 time in the mortar, till the whole has acquired a light sulphur-
 yellow tint, and the consistence of cream. The pounding is con
 tinued a long time, to produce the decomposition of the salts with
as little water as possible.      When no more effervescence is per
 ceptible, and when the salts cease to crack under the pestle, a
sufficient quantity of water is to be added for their complete so
lution. This tedious process is essential to unite the oxide of gold
with the earths ; and the whole success of the operation (which
is pretty capricious) depends on it. The precipitate is to be left
 24 hours in the mortar, stirring it from time to time with a glass
rod. It is then to be poured into a saucer, or a similar vessel, and
left till the powder subsides. The supernatant liquid is then drawn
off with a syphon, and the deposit is dried in the shade, without
washing it.       The precipitate when dry is yellowish white.         The
muffle in which it is to be baked, ought to be red hot. The powder
is put (of the thickness of one or two lines) upon a silver or porce
lain plate; and it must be withdrawn from the fire the instant that
it. acquires its purple colour.      If too long exposed to heat acit
quires     aviolet tinge. This  is occasioned    by the salts
                                                            it  still con
tains; for, after   it has been washed,   itmay be kept red hot without
losing any of its colour, which indeed acquires greater lustre.
These trials were made on a small scale, and, the Count observes,
may be improved. The colour appears to want intensity, but the
mixture of oils or gums renders sufficiently deep. For oil-paint
                                     it

mercury at one of its sides, and having at the end of 24 hours
fused it with an equal weight of tin, obtained an alloy fusible in
boiling resin.     This alloy, triturated with caustic ammonia in          a

    Amulree, (Scotland.) Dec.           4 —About half an hour past seven
 o'clock this evening, there was felt here a smart shock of an
earthquake, similar to that felt at Comrie a few days ago : it
 lasted two or three seconds ; its direction was by the Grampian
 Hills eastward. The houses and furniture shook, and the whole
 went away with a noise like the slow passing of carts.
     Mittenwald, (Bavaria,) Dec. 29. — On the 20th inst. at 55
 minutes after seven in the morning, the shock of an earthquake
 was felt around this place.          It lasted about seven or eight se
 conds, and took a direction from south to north.             The motion it
 produced    was  quite  as  strong    as that  on  the  10th  of April last
 year.    The  wind,   from    the  south,   was very  still.  The thermo
 meter of Reaumur stood,         in  the  shade,  four degrees above zero,
 and the barometer two degrees above changeable weather. On
 the 21st, the thermometer rose seven, and the barometer six de
 grees, with a powerful south wind.
     India. Mirzapore. Letters from Chunar and Mirzapore
 mention, that about eight o'clock in the evening of the 16th June,
  1819, the shock of an earthquake was experienced at these
 places.     The same effect, in a slight degree, was remarked
  about the same time at Calcutta. At Chunar, the motion was
  accompanied by a noise in the atmosphere, which resembled
  that occasioned by the rapid flight of birds.

usually heard on sut h occasions, and which I have hitherto ima

was felt at this station last night, at seventeen minutes past eight,
which lasted some time, and occasioned very considerable alarm.

 1st battalion 19th regiment, in which the officers were at dinner

          BENEFICIAL USE OF SALT IN FEEDING STOCK*..
   In the year 1817, eight tons of salt only were granted undei
the then existing act, for the use of cattle ; five tons of which
were imported for the use of the Schoose farm. In the last year,
ten tons were obtained for the like purpose; but from the facili
ties afforded of transferring    it,
                                 above thirty persons were supplied
from the stock; and all of those with whom Mr. Curwen has
had the pleasure of conversing, concur in the benefit which -has
been derived    by the addition of salt to the food of their cattle
 and horses.
   . The practice of daily giving salt to cattle, in the proportion of
 four ounces per head, commenced at the Schoose farm, in Oc
 tober 1817, with the feeding on steamed food, consisting of chaff,
i.   e. cut straw, or the husks of grain, and continued during the
 succeeding seven months; after which, and during the five sum
 mer months, while the cattle were fed on clover and grass, the
 daily quantity was reduced to three ounces per head, mixed with
 a little bran. Calves and one and two years old stock were given
 fron#two to three ounces each every day.        The least thriving of
 the   calves  were observed to  be the fondest  of salt.
  . In a    very early stageit  was discovered, that salt thus given,
 removed the unpleasant flavour from the milk, while milch cows
 fed not only on the bulb but the tops of turnips.        What may be
 the operation of salt, Mr. Curwen does not presume to decide          :
 the fact, however, valuable as        it   is,

 the crop, may now, with the addition of salt, be safely given to
 milch cows, though previously to the use of salt, these were never
 so applied.
     A general opinion prevails that inflammatory disorders have
 been less frequent since salt has been used.       It appears to pro
 mote digestion, increase the quantity of milk, and dispose the
 animal to fatten : it also makes an evident improvement in the
 handling and the appearance of the skin.
     Though the allowance of salt to cattle has hitherto been re
 stricted to four ounces daily, yet little doubt is entertained that
it might beneficially be increased : but experiments have not
 been made to ascertain the extent to which it might advantage
 ously be given.
     The allowances to horses last year was four ounces each per
 day ; this year it has been increased to six, during the autumn
 and winter months, mixed witli steamed potatoes ; in the sum
mer with their corn : their general health and spirits are consi
dered to be improved, the gloss on their coats remarkably fine ;
 fewer instances of grease have occurred, and the general opinion
 is, that with moderate care, the use of salt would diminish the
 liability to the disease, if it should not prove an actual preven
 tive to the complaint. An experiment was made with two horses,
which had been many years in the coal works, and, from the
grease, were rendered nearly unserviceable.          During the first
 month, they had each eight ounces      of  salt per day ; the second
 ten ; and now they have twelve ounces.          The first perceptible
 effect was to prevent the very offensive smell of their dung — their
 coats improved — the discharge from their legs decreased, and
 has ceased — the swelling, in some degree, has subsided — the
 pain appears to be less violent, the stiffness of the limbs is not
 so great, and they are able to perform moderate work.           They
 have been observed to drink somewhat more water.          Whether a
 complete cure can be effected in so advanced a stage of the dis
order, is yet doubtful, though the beneficial effects of the salt
 seem to be confirmed by the experiment.
    /The importance of salt in preserving the health and soundness
 of sheep is decisive. Two ounces per head has been given weekly
 to the flock. To those feeding on turnips or rape, three ounces.
 One hundred sheep have been slaughtered in the course of the
last six months, without the least appearance of unsoundness
 being perceptible : — in former years, and before salt was made
use of, the ewes were scarcely ever untainted.
     Since it has been discovered that rock salt is capable of being
 ground, much labour and expense have been saved.

 extensive source of trade, and giving employment to thousands.

 ample, the general consumption at this rate would reach,      was        it

 a beneficial measure.

  falls of sandy land, mixed with the seed wheat — this at the rate
 of 26 bushels per Scotch, or about 20 bushels per English acre.
  The crop was reaped on the 27th of August 1819, and the part
 salted produced at the rate of about three bushels per acre more
 than the rest of the field.     The whole crop was much injured by
 the rust, otherwise called blight or mildew, excepting the part
 that was sailed; which though not altogether free from it, yet
 the injury was very inconsiderable, and perhaps would have been

                 ACORNS   A SUBSTITUTE FOR COFFEE.
   Dr. Maex, a German physician of some eminence, ascribes
great medical virtues to an infusion of acorns used in the same
manner as coffee.       In 1703 he published some experiments on
this subject, and gave the following directions for preparing and
using the acorns :
   Take sound and ripe acorns, peel off the shell or husk, divide
the kernels, dry them gradually, and then roast them in a close
vessel or roaster, keeping them constantly stirring ; in doing which
especial care must be taken that they be not burnt or over-roast
ed, either of which would be hurtful.        The Doctor recommends
half an  ounce   of these roasted  acorns,  ground and prepared like
coffee, to be taken morning      and  evening, either alone or mixed
with coffee and sweetened with sugar, either with or without milk.
    The author says that acorns have been always esteemed a
wholesome nutriment for men, and that by their medical quali
ties they have been found to cure slimy obstructions in the vis
cera, and to remove nervous complaints.

tongue of the man or animal bitten by a rabid animal, and be
 coming rabid, pusitules of a whitish hue make their appearance,
which open spontaneously about the 13th day after the bite; and
at this time, they say, the first symptoms of true hydrophobia
make their appearance. Their method of cure consists in open
ing these pustules with a suitable instrument, and making the
patient spit out the ichor and fluid which run from them, often
washing the mouth with salt water.        This operation should be
performed the ninth day after the bite.      The remedy is so effec

since died of their wounds, and a fifth lies in a most deplorable
state with little chance of recovery ; and another man and a boy
are also much bruised.      The accident was occasioned by the ex

Hargreaves and two other gentlemen are now sinking for coals.
The boiler weighs about four tons, and was carried, it is tup-
posed, about fifty yards high, and fell sixty-five yards from the
place where it was working.       It was seen in its transit by many
persons at a considerable distance.      One piece of iron of a ton
weight was thrown fifty yards, and several stones and slates were
found at a hundred yards from the place they had occupied. The
building which contained the engine was left with scarcely one
stone upon another.     One of the unfortunate sufferers was carried
by the violence of the explosion to a distance of eighty yards,
and lived several hours after he was taken up.

               SIR WILLIAM CONGREVE'S CONICAL BALLS.
                        To Mr. Tilloch. .
Sir, — In      of your late numbers, it appears, a patent has
               some
been taken by Sir William Congreve for a conical ball. Below
are extracts so far back as 1808, on the same subject, which I
beg you will insert in the Philosophical Magazine : — The Essay
ist has been dead several years.    Your obedient,
   Glasgow, 17th Jan. 1820.                         JaMES BoaZ.

     Mr. Robertson read     an essay upon the different forms of mus
ket and other balls, exhibited paterns of various shapes; amongst
these, he most approved of the long egg-shaped-ball, having one
end thick, the other tapered small to a point : he maintained
that this, containing as much matter as a spherical ball, will re
ceive much          resistance in passing through the air ; conse
                 less
quently, will not only go further with the same charge of powder,
but hit an object with greater force and precision, as its devia
tion will be less, especially, by making spiral grooves in    to giveit,
it   whirling motion in its progress through the air. — Mr. Ro
     a
bertson   isto go more fully into this subject at next meeting.
                                                        28 Nov. 1808.
     Mr. Robertson read further  an essay upon projectiles, and the
resistance balls receive in passing through the atmosphere, com
pared with what bodies of different kinds receive in passing
through water.     He exhibited some drawings and diagram  a                   il
lustrative of his subject.
                                                                 5   Dec. 1808.
     Mr. Robertson brought to the Society some further models of
balls of an oblong shape, hexagonally fluted in such      manner,a
that in their passage through the air they revolve on their own
axis, while their heavy end goes foremost, being exactly upon the
principle of an arrow shot from       bow.

                           ENORMOUS BIRD.
     Mr. Henderson                                            of a
                        has discovered, in New Siberia, the claws
bird measuring each       yard in length
                          a                and the Yaknts assured
                                            ;
him, that they had frequently in their hunting excursions met
with skeletons and feathers of this bird the quills of which were
                                             ;
large enough to admit        man's arm.
                              a            Captain Cook mentions
having seen an immense bird's nest         New Holland, on

     Mr. George Gibson, near George town, on the Conemough
 river, Westmoreland county, Pennsylvania, in boring for salt water,
  at the depth of 27C feet, obtained seneca oil, which is said to be
 very pure.     According to appearances, one barrel per day may
 easily be procured.                        —
                    ERUPTION OF MOUNT VESUVIUS.

     " On the 1st of January snow fell here, accompanied by much
 thunder.     About the middle of the night the inhabitants were
 awakened by a violent subterraneous noise, and spoil afterwards
 one of the most dreadful eruptions of Vesuvius commenced that
 has been witnessed for 20 years.          The inhabitants of Torre del
 Greco, of l'Aumenziata,         and even of Portici, experienced the
 greatest disquietude, apprehending the fate of Hereulaneum and
 Pompeii.     The lava, however, fortunately divided itself into five
 torrents,  and  flowed to the foot of the mountain for the space of
 a league. The crater is much enlarged, a part of its brink having
 fallen in.   On the 7th the lava still continued to flow."
                                 Al'OPLEXY.
    The following facts,     says The  Journal des Dela/s, cannot fail
 to be interesting to humanity : — A lady about 40 years of age,
 who lived at the corner of one of the streets in Paris, was struck
 early in the month with apoplexy.         Mr. Lavalette, the physician,
was called in, and he restored her instantly to life by bleeding in
a jugular vein, and stimulating the blood to flow abundantly, by
the application of a common needle to the exterior part of the
vein and the adjoining nerves.          It js thus shown, that the me
chanical stimulant       is able  to revive  nervous sensibility, and by
creating a kind of peristaltic motion, to deduce from the arteries
a great quantity of blood. — There is also another instance of the
efficacy of this application in the case of a Mr. Chatelin, a linen
merchant, who has also been restored to existence under similar
circumstances.       It is trusted that this discovery will be generally
beneficial.
                                 STATISTICS.
    During the year 1818, there have been in Paris 6,616 mar
riages, 22,421 deaths, and 23,067 births.             Of the number of
births 8089 children were illegitimate : of these 200.4 have been
acknowledged, and 6094 abandoned: of the deaths, 993 have
been occasioned by the small-pox.

                                    RED RAIN.
    On the 2d of November, in the afternoon, a red or reddish-
coloured rain fell at Blankenburg and Dixmude, in Flanders. In
the following night, the same happened at Schevehingen.                   Such
phaenomena        have   been  frequently     observed, and   to them   may be
attributed the      chronicled    reports    of showers  of  llobd affirmed to
have fallen in different countries.

                          SINGULAR PHENOMENON.
     During the night of Tuesday, 16th Nov. there fell, in the town
 ship of Broughton, North Am. on the south shore, so great a
 quantity of a black powder, as completely to cover the snow which
was then on the ground.                     •
                                 Hartwell,   Tunbridge Wells, Jan. 17th 1820.
 Dear Sir, — I       submit for the Philosophical Magazine, the fol
 lowing short journal of the thermometer and barometer during
 the late extraordinary cold weather.'
     1 8 1 9. Dec. 3 1 . Thermometer       at midnight + 1 0° of Fahrenheit.
                         Lowest during the night         +2° ditto.
    The barometer pretty stationary at 29 40 till night, when it
fell considerably.
                                                                           1S20

                                        Barometer         30- 10.
    Jan. 14. This extraordinary day and night deserve to be
minutely described.     The day became quite clear, and the
thermometer fell between noon and 10 P.M. from +10° to
 —2°.     At midnight it was —3". At 2 A.M. Jan. 15 it was
 —5°. And between that time and sunrise it fell to — 10°, the
lowest by fourteen degrees that I ever remember it. A correspon
dent represents it to have been still lower on the high Kentish
hills. N.B. I use the plus sign 4- for above zero, and the minus
sign — for below zero. The barometer continued falling through
the night, and the following day was warmer.        This severe frost
killed great numbers of small birds, which I found frozen to death
in the garden. Early on the Saturday morning (the 15th) many-
labouring people were forced to leave their work, and several ac
cidents are reported to have happened to wayfaring people during
the night. Near the city of Canterbury, I find the cold was equally
severe, but in other places it was seven or eight degrees less ri
gorous.   If,however, in this warm part of the island, the mercury
descended to 10 degrees below zero, what must have been the
cold on the Scottish hills    This' leads to a question of the local
                                       !
influence of extremes of heat and cold.      Perhaps some of vour

parts  of North Britain.      Yours,   &c.

    P. S. — A table for ascertaining the relative quantity of rain
caught at different heights, is much wanted and would prove of
great use to the meteorologist.            The publication of accurate ob
servations on the quantity of rain which has fallen in various places
 at no great distance from each other, will prove serviceable to
engineers as well as philosophers ; and it will probably be found
that rain for many months will be comparatively local ; for I had
occasion to observe that in Northamptonshire and Leicestershire,
the quantity was not by some inches so great as in the neigh
bourhood of London, within the last six months ; so much so as
to cause an evident defalcation in the supply to mills and inland
navigations in those counties.
    fcf The greater part of my readers must have heard of the
afflicting loss sustained by my much respected friend Mr. Cary
of the Strand, to whom I have been indebted for the monthly
meteorological table ever since the commencement of The Phi
losophical Magazine.           I am sorry to have to announce such a
reason for its absence in the present number.                              A. T.

XI. A    Letter from Dr. Hutton to the Marquis De Laplace,
       on several Astronomical and Philosophical Subjects.
Dr. Hutton      having of late years perceived some illiberal at
tempts made, in his own country, unjustly to deprive him of the
honour of his calculations to determine the density and mass of
the earth; and even a seeming attempt of the same kind else
where ; he deemed it necessary, to address the following letter to
M. De Laplace, on observing a similar recent appearance in the
Connaissance des Terns of the years 1821 and 1822.
                               •-   "   Bedford-Row,   London, April 9, 1819.
   " My   Lord Marquis,— I        have for many years most anxiously
wished to have     the honour  of  paying my respects to you in per
 son ; but as there is no prospect of my being able to make a
journey to France, being now in my S2d year, it only remains
 to address you in writing, and to request that you will accept the
 homage of a sincere lover of those sciences which you have con
 tributed so essentially to advance, with the highest honour to
 yourself, as well as advantage to the scientific world.
    4C
         An opportunity has just offered for conveying this letter to
 Paris, and I avail myself of the same to request your acceptance
 of a copy of my " Tracts on Philosophical and Mathematical
 Subjects," which I beg to present to you as a small but sincere
 token of the high Tespect which I entertain, in common with
 the rest of the world, for your genius and talents.
   "    In these Tracts, I wish particularly to call your attention to
 the leading article in the second volume, " On the Density of
 the Earth;" and to express my wish that you, who have already
 effected such profound investigations of its figure, and the doc
 trine of its tides, would pursue the inquiry respecting its density j
 so as to correct the errors, or confirm the truth, of my labours.
 Indeed it seems to me surprising that similar experiments and
 operations have "not been hitherto made in France, where science
 in every other department has been pursued with the most lau
 dable zeal and the most distinguished success.
     **
        As you must naturally feel an interest in whatever relates to
 this important undertaking, I beg here to state certain circum
 stances which led to   it, with general account of the manner in
                                        a
 which the operations were conducted           and shall conclude

 82         A Letter from Dr.      Hutton   to   M.   Laplace
 which     he himself never claimed, but, on the contrary, always cor
   rected the mistake whenever he heard it mentioned.
      " Some time before the year 1 769, when a transit of the planet
   Venus was expected, the Royal Society contemplated the pro
   priety of sending some skilful astronomers to distant countries, to
   observe that transit.     But as the expense of such a mission was
   above their finances, they represented their difficulty to the King ;
   when His Majesty was graciously pleased to grant a specific
  sum to defray the said expense.         In consequence, two of my
  astronomical friends, MM.       Wales  and Bayly, were in due time
  sent out to Hudson's Bay, where they passed a summer and a
  severe winter; and after returning to England, they gave an ac
  count of their mission.      This was communicated to Government
  by the Royal Society, together with a statement of the expenses
  incurred ; which being less than the sum that had been granted,
  they begged to know the King's pleasure touching the surplus ;
  when His Majesty was graciously pleased to reply, that the Royal
 Society might employ it on any experiment, or to any purpose
 they might think fit.
     "After duly contemplating this subject, the Royal Society came
 to the resolution of employing that surplus in determining, by
 experiment^      the mutual and universal attraction of matter, by-
 observing    the  deviation of a plumb line from the perpendicular,
 by   the attraction of some mountain ; in forming which resolution
 Dr. Maskelyne took a leading part. In consequence, a corre
 spondence was held with many persons in all parts of Great Bri
 tain, to discover a hill or mountain proper for the experiment ;
 which was at length found in the mount Shichallien in the centre
 of Scotland.       The next consideration was, what person was to
 go   to make   the  experiment ?   It was much wished that Dr. Mas
 kelyne    would   go  on  that mission ; but he excused himself, on
 account that he could not be spared from his duty as Astronomer
 Royal. After some delay, it was agreed to send a Mr. Burrow,
 a person who had formerly been Dr. Maskelyne's assistant at the
 Royal Observatory ; who was instructed, first to make an accu
rate survey of the mountain in all its dimensions, in every direc
tion horizontally, and a great number of vertical sections from all
sides ; so that from these a perfect model might be made of      it, or
its magnitude be accurately computed; and then he was to ob
serve the deviation of the pluml line.       After a year or two had
been spent in those measurements, the Royal Society fearing the
work might not be well performed, urged Dr. M. to go down
himself and direct the operations; which, after obtaining the
King's leave, he did accordingly, and brought back Mr. Burrow's
survey and measurements, with his own observations of the devia

          on several Astronomical and Philosophical Subjects.             83
  tion of the plummet made on both sides of the hill. These ope
  rations employed the years 1/74, 1776 and 1776 ; and the me
  thod of performing them was stated by Dr. M. in the Philoso
  phical Transactions for the year 1775.
    ,c
        Thus then the problem was performed, so far as showed expe
  rimentally that there is a mutual ai traction in all matter ; and
  that the sum of the two attractions on both sides of the hill in
  particular, amounted to 1 1-6 seconds. The Society were very
 well pleased with the operations.         They also conferred on what
 further use might be made of these measurements ; and it was per
 ceived that by their means, after due calculations made, the mean
 density of the whole earth might be determined : for there were
 now obtained these data; viz. the mass and attraction of the hill,
 with the magnitude and attraction of the earth, to determine its
 density and mass.        This was of course a grand and most im
 portant object.       But the question was, Who was to perform
 the immense calculation that was requisite ? who would do it ?
 and indeed who could do it ?         There might be one or two per
 sons who were thought capable of undertaking the task ; but
 those and all the other members of the Society stood aghast at
 the prospect of the number and magnitude of the calculations,
 and shrank with dread from the mighty labour. I was then looked
to, and asked by the President and Council to undertake the
task ; to which I was also strongly solicited by Dr. Maskelyne.
 Being then a young member of the Society, and anxious to di
stinguish myself, I undertook the operation and became respon
sible for the result ; which, after the daily labour of nearly two
years, I produced to the Society, with a minute detail of the par
ticulars of the calculations, accompanied with the appropriate
drawings.        The Society were so well pleased with this work that
they awarded me a liberal premium, and printed my memoir in
the Philosophical Transactions for the year 1778, exactly in the
form in which I had delivered it.
    "  It is to be observed, that in this operation, being the first of the
kind that was ever made, all the modes of calculation were to be
devised or invented ; and that, without several plans which I con
trived, it might be doubted whether the labour could ever have
been accurately accomplished.           To the ingenuity of these con
trivances the most honourable testimony has lately been borne
by one of the best mathematicians in this kingdom, Professor
Playfair. The result of that calculation was, that the mean den
sity of the earth is to that of the hill, in the ratio of 9 to 5. What
was the density of the hill, was then not known, and therefore
the density of the earth, as compared to water, could not then
be determined.        But to show the mode of making the compari-

son, I assumed for the sake of example, the smallest density               of
stone, 2§, though this was obviously below the real density                of
                               9     5          9
the rock of the hill ; then   y    X — =        —   =   4 {,   would   be less
than the density of the earth, as the numbers to be adopted till
we could know the real density of the hill.
     "Many years after this, a lithological survey was made of the
same hill by Professor Playfair, who found it to consist of rocks
of a great variety of densities from 2-5 to 3-2, the medium being
about 2{ or 2"8.       Assuming the former number then 2|, as the
density of the hill ; then $ x 2} =       =       or nearly 5, results
for the mean density of the earth.        And this result, instead of
 the former, I substituted in its proper place in my abridged edi-
 tionjof the Philosophical Transactions, from the beginning, to the
 end of 1800, in eighteen large quarto volumes, where it may be
seen.     If we assume 2-8, instead of the 2| above used, then
f   X 2*8. =5*04 comes out for the density of the earth, a little
above 5, as the former was a little below it.     I fixed therefore on
 the number 5, as my result for the mean density of the earth,
determined by my calculation.       The same conclusion is also given
 in my Tracts in the first memoir of the second volume, where the
 whole process is stated at large, as may be seen in the set of those
Tracts now presented along with this letter ; and as they were
 also formerly presented to the Royal Institute.
    " And now, after all these evidences of my being the first, and
only person, who had calculated the mean density of the earth
from the original measurements, and have been considered and
 acknowledged as such for almost half a century, the world must
be astonished to perceive the honour of that determination in
 danger of being transferred to another person who never ex
 pected nor desired   it, unless the accidental mistake or misnomer
in the Connaissance des Terns be acknowledged and corrected.                I
 hope and trust therefore, from the known honour and liberality
of your character, that the mistake will be corrected in the next

XII.    Memoir relative to the Annular Eclipse of the Sun, which
   will   happen on September  7, 1820.  By Francis Baily.
The     solar eclipse which will happen on Thursday, September 7,
 1820, will be the greatest of all those which have happened in
this part of Europe ever since the year 1764 ; and indeed of all
those which will again happen here before the year 1847.        Like
the  two eclipses  above  alluded  to, it will be annular: that   the      is,
disc of the moon will not wholly cover the disc of the sun       but,      ;
in certain parts of the earth, the sun will show the appearance
of an annulus, or ring, round the body of the moon the posi        ;
tion and magnitude of which will depend on the situation of the
spectator. In no part of England, however, will this annular ap
pearance be observed
                           * :but, on the continent, in any part of
that tract  of country which extends nearly in a straight line from
 the north of Westphalia to the south of Italy, the inhabitants will
have an opportunity of beholding this singular phenomenon.
    Annular eclipses do not appear to have been noticed           the      by
ancients, who probably confounded them with partial ones.         In
deed, the only authentic accounts of any well observed annular
eclipses in this part of Europe (besides the one in 1764 above
 mentioned) are those of February 18, 1736-7 and of July 14,
   * The eclipse however will be annular in the Shetland islands and   :   willit
 be of considerable magnitude along the whole eastern coast of Great Britain.

86      Memoir relative to      the Annular Eclipse of tlie Sun,
 1748*; the former of which was observed by the celebrated
Colin Maclaurin at Edinburgh, and the latter by the Earl of
Morton and Mr. Short at Aberdour Castle near the same place,.
 Indeed the annular appearance of the eclipse of 1737 was con
fined principally to Scotland : and the eclipses of 1748 and 1764,
although visible to a great part of Europe, were not so generally,
observed as could be wished on account of the badness of the.
weather ; so that we have not any very considerable degree of
information respecting this kind of solar eclipses.            Moreover at
those periods the lunar tables were so defective that it could not
be predicted, with any degree of accuracy, where the annular
appearance would be visible : so that many valuable observations
were probably lost on that account.             This difficulty however is
in a great measure removed by late improvements not only in
 the lunar tables, but likewise in the analytical investigations re
lative to the calculation of eclipses'; although the computations
are still very laborious and troublesome.
    Prior to the total eclipse, which took place in London in the
year 1715, Dr. Ha"ey published an account of the path of the
moon's shadow across the island of Great Britain ; and called,
on the inhabitants to note down their observations and forward
them to him, in order that he might afterwards compare them,
and thereby correct the elements made use of in the calculation
of eclipses. The good effect of this measure may be seen in the
 Report which that illustrious astronomer afterwards drew up and
sent to the Royal Society, and which is inserted in the Philoso
phical Transactions, No. 343, vol. xxix. page 245. Mr. Mac
laurin, likewise, previous to the annular eclipse in 1737 before
mentioned, wrote to several persons in the country,               " desiring
that they would determine and note down the duration of the
annular appearance as exactly as possible ; in hopes, by com
paring their observations, to have traced more correctly the path
of the centre and limits of the phenomenon." Arid in 1748
Mr. Alexander Munro (Professor of Anatomy of Edinburgh) by
Mr, Short's desire wrote to all his friends in different parts of the
country, to prepare in the best manner they could for the most
exact observation of the annular eclipse which was about to take
place in that year. And he regrets that he did riot make this
                                                    rt
application earlier ; for he remarks that had my request of having
 the duration of the annular appearance measured been made more
public before the eclipse (after Dr. Halley's example in 1715) I
doubt not but I should have been able to have given a rrior'e exact

   notice to astronomers* in order, as he observes, " exciter les cu-
  rieux de l'Europe, qui pourront voir lYelipse annulaire qui doit
  arriver, d'y apporter toute 1'attention possible, et de faire, de

      It is worthy of remark that this eclipse (1748) was the first
  that tlje celebrated Lalande (to whom the astronomical world is
 so much indebted) ever saw.         He was then only 16 years of age :
 and the impression, which it made on him, fixed his future pur
 suits in life, and induced him to become an astronomer.          It in
 deed excited so much attention in Europe that the King of France
 (Louis XV) went purposely to Compiegne in order to observe                              it,
 attended    by  the Abbe" Nollet, and Messrs. De Thury and De La
 Condamine   ;    and furnished with every convenient instrument for
the purpose.        The royal astronomer there made several impor

recent observations that had Deen made           M. Pingre afterwards

no particular notice has been taken of the ensuing eclipse either

88      Memoir relative     to the  Annular Eclipse of the Sun,
in the Connaissance des Terns, or in the Nautical Almanac: but
that it is merely announced there in the usual formal manner,
without a single remark on the occasion.                  It is true that
M. Bode, in his ephemeris published at Berlin, has given (as
usual) a general outline of the eclipse together with a map de
scriptive of the phases: but he has not called on the inhabitants
to look out for this phaenomenon, nor drawn their attention ta
any of the subjects which it is most desirable they should observe.        •
 In order to supply this defect, as far as my humble efforts will
avail, I have drawn up the following memoir, under the hope that
it may induce others, who        have more leisure and are at the same
time more conversant with the subject than myself, to pursue the
inquiry, and suggest further hints to those who may have an op
 portunity of observing this rare phaenomenon.
     M. De L'isle, in his Avertissement above alluded to, respect
 ing the eclipse of 1748, suggested the advantage and propriety
 of some scientific person,in the principal states of Europe through
 which the shadow of the moon's umbra passed, undertaking to
 announce to the inhabitants the several observations which it
 would be proper for them to make ; and afterwards to collect
 and arrange such observations for further investigation, if suffi
 ciently convinced of their accuracy.           A similar plan might be
 adopted    in the present instance   ; and,   from  the more general dif
 fusion  of  science,  would  be  more  likely  to be attended with a be
 neficial effect.     Such collections of observations (when made)
 should be sent by the different collectors to one or more of the
 principal astronomers of Europe, in order that they might be
 finally investigated, and the result laid before the public.
     With that view I would take this opportunity of requesting
  those, into whose hands the present memoir may fall, to circulate
  it as much as possible, on the continent ; and amongst those per
  sons who, from their connection with any foreign literary journal,
  may be likely to diffuse the subject of it amongst the inhabitants
  of that part of Europe and Africa where the annular appearance
  will be observed. Such of our own countrymen likewise, that
  may be travelling in any of the provinces on the continent here
  alluded to, will promote the interest of astronomy if they would
  carefully note down or collect any of the circumstances herein
  after alluded to, or indeed any other remarkable phenomena that
  may happen during this eclipse.         I shall be happy to receive any
  observations of this kind that may be forwarded to me, and will
  preserve the result of them, as above proposed, for a future in
  vestigation.
     The elements of the present eclipse I have computed from
   M. Burckhardt's tables of the moon and M. Delambre's tables
                                                                        of

will take place on September 7, 1820, at

And, at that time,     we shall have the
    True longitude of the luminaries           .. ..      5.14.47.40,7
    True latitude of the moon (north)                              44. 39,4

    From these elements it may be determined that the moon's
shadow first touches the earth's disc at 1 lh. 23' A.M. apparent
time at Greenwich, in N. lat. 59°. 43', W. long. 90°. 50' * ; and
that it finally leaves it at 4h. 39'f P.M. apparent time at Green
wich in N.'lat. 3°. 21', E. long. 20°. 25'. Consequently the
 total duration of the general eclipse to the inhabitants of the
 earth will be about 5h. 17' : but, at no one place in particular
 will the duration be much more than half that time.
    The central path of the moon's shadow across the earth's disc,
 which is the most material circumstance in inquiries of this na
 ture (since it serves to point out those parts of the world where
 the eclipse will be seen annular) may be determined with consi
 derable accuracy from the principles laid down by M. Delambre
 in Lis Truite d' Astronomie (vol. ii. page 384) : and, agreeably to
 the formulae which he has there given, I have carefully computed
 the following table, which shows the several points (expressed by
 positions of latitude and longitude) through which the centre of
  the moon's shadow will pass in its progress across the earth's disc,
  at the several times therein mentioned.          The first column de
  notes the apparent time at Greenwich, at the moment when the
  centre of the moon's shadow passes the given points laid down
  in the second and third columns : and the last column shows the
  corresponding apparent time at those places.

Bear the north pole*, will proceed between the Shetland islands
and the coast of Norway down the north sea, and enter the con
tinent of Europe on the coast of Westphalia, about half way be
tween the Ems and the Weser. It will thence proceed, nearly in
a straight ljne, across Germany and the Tyrol country, and enter
the gulf of Venice about midway between Trieste and Venice.
Traversing that gulf it will cross the heel of Italy; and, after
skirting the coast of the Morea and Candia, will pass directly
over Alexandria in Egypt ; and finally leave the earth in Arabia
near the Persian gulf.
     Jf we set off two other lines on the map, parallel to this cen
tral line, one on each side thereof, and each at the distance of
about 13,0 geographical miles from the central line, the interme
diate space between these two boundary lines will nearly                   f re
present       the path  of the  moon's   umbra;       and   will show  all those
places where the eclipse will be seen annular, or where the whole
body of the moon will appear on the face of the sun.                 Some un
certainty, however, may exist with respect to those towns which
are situated near the borders of the umbra, such as Rotterdam,
Aix la Chapelle, Liege, Treves, Freyburg, Parma, Rome, and
other places on the one side ; and Magdeburg, Leipsic, Ragusa,
Athens, and other places on the other side of the central path:
since the eclipse may or may not be annular in the neighbour
 hood of those towns according to circumstances.                  Nevertheless,
 at all those places, and indeed to the whole of Europe and to a
 great part of Asia and Africa, the eclipse will be visible ; differ
 ing only in magnitude according to the situation of the spec
 tator. But, in no part will it be annular except at thpse places
 which are situated within the limits of the umbra, as above
 mentioned       |.
     Thpse persons, who happen to be situated on the western
 border of the umbra, will, at the time of the middle of the eclipse,
 see the upper limb qf the moon in contact with the upper limb
 of the sun ; and consequently the unobscured portion of the
 sun's disc will be seen round the under part of the moon.                   On
     * It will traverse the supposed polar basin, and the north east coast of
  Greenland, the object of So much laudable curiosity at the present moment:
  so that if the adventurous navigators to those parts should not have returned
 before the date of this eclipse, they will probably observe it in those high
  latitudes.
     + It must be evident to those acquainted with the principles of astronomy
  •
  that the umbra will not be exactly of the same width in any two points of its
  course : but will be constantly varying.    It' will not, however, undergo any
  material alteration in its progress across the continent of Europe.

the contrary, those persons who are on the eastern confines of
the umbra will see the lower limb of the moon in contact with
the lower limb of the sun. Whilst, to those who are stationed
directly in the central path, the centres of the sun and the moon
will appear exactly to coincide ; and an uniform luminous ring,
equal in breadth to about one twenty-ninth part of the sun's dia
meter, will surround the body of the moon*.
    As there are no two points on the face of the globe where the
visible appearances of any solar eclipse are exactly alike, it would
be an endless task to compute the phaenomcna for any consider
able number of places : and the usual mode, amongst astrono
mers, is to give a general outline of the patb of the moon's sha
dow, and to calculate the particular circumstauces of the eclipse
for the metropolis only, or for some known observatory ; which
 calculation may be easily adapted to other parts of the kingdom.
The notices which are given in the various ephemerides, on this
point, are merely for the purpose of informing astronomers to
 look out for, and note down these phaenomcna : and the observa
tions, thus made, are afterwards collected and compared together.
 Under these circumstances the reader must not expect to find
 the exact time and appearances of this eclipse computed for every
 place on the continent.        It will be sufficient for his purpose if
 he knows at what time of the day he ought to look out for its
 commencement ; and at what point of the sun's disc he ought to
 fix his attention in order to observe the first point of contact.
 The following table will show nearly these several particulars for
 the different places therein mentioned ; and will assist the ob
 server in his computations for any other place within the umbra.
 These values are deduced merely from a projection of the eclipse,
 and are consequently given as approximations only, and by no
 means as the exact values.         For, where it is required to have
 the time true     to the nearest second, the observer must calculate
 the phases of the eclipse for the precise spot where he happens
  to be stationed.
     The angles from the vertex are all reckoned on the right hand
 side of the sun ; as the moon always makes the first impression
 on the sun's disc, on that side.
    * The sun will be elevated, on that day, above the horizon about 34 de
 grees, to that pavt of the continent, over which the centre of the moon's
 umbra passes : consequently the increase of the moon's semidiameter will be
 about 71 seconds.

    The whole duration of the eclipse will, at all           these    places, be
rather more than two hours and             three quarters.     But the dura
tion of the annulus will not, in any place, exceed six minutes :
and, in some places (at the confines of the umbra) it will be mo
mentary.       The nearer the spectator happens to be to the centre
of the path of the moon's umbra, the longer will the annular ap
pearance continue.
     Having thus given a general outline of this eclipse, I shall pro
ceed to state the principal phenomena which have been observed
in former eclipses of this kind *, whereby the reader may be aware
of the principal observations to which it will be proper for him
 to attend, and make his preparations accordingly.                     Many of
 these phaenomena have given rise to much discussion, and are far
from being accurately determined, or reduced to general princi
ples. There is also a degree of doubt respecting the existence
 of some of them. Those persons therefore who are furnished
 with convenient instruments, and have a favourable opportunity,
 should carefully attend to, and note down, not merely the phases
 of the eclipse but such other appearances as may present them-
     * Those                     There are but few observations     of the eclipse

we can ultimately arrive at the truth : and an annular eclipse is

Would not discourage those who have not this advantage, from
communicating any circumstances that may occur. For it has been
justly observed by M. De L'isle, that although no great depend-
ance can be placed on 'those observations which are not made with
 a telescope, &c. yet that such observations as are made with the
 naked eye ought not to be entirely neglected ; since it affords us
 an opportunity of judging of the accuracy of those observations
 which were made before telescopes, &c. were invented.
    Those persons, however, who have the proper instruments, and
every conveniency for observing^ will of course note down the
usual circumstances in such case : viz;
    1. The time of the commencement of the eclipse* ;
    2. The time of the formation of the annulus j
   3. The time of the dissolution of the annulus ;           f
   4. The time of the end of the eclipse;
    If there should be any spots on the sun,' it will be proper (pre
vious to the commencement of the eclipse) to make a diagram
of the sun's disc 5 and to note down the times when the body of
the moon comes in contact with the spots, and likewise the times
when they again become visible.      All these may be determined
with sufficient accuracy by the assistance of a telescope magni
fying thirty or forty times ; together with a well regulated clock
or watch that beats seconds ; and which, if possible^ should as
may be (that is> the greater the number of places where they are made), th«
more important will be the consequences to be derived from them. Conse
quently every observation will be material*      Those persons who may observe
the eclipse in the country, should state the distance and position of such
place from the nearest principal town.
    * It is rather difficult to determine the exact time of the commencement of
any solar or lunar eclipse ; since the impression on the disc does not become
visible till some seconds after the eclipse has begun. The field of the tele
scope should take in at least one-half of the circumference of the sun's disc
(taking that portion of     it, which may leave the expected point of contact in
the centre), as the eye can much better judge of any impression made upon
a large, than a small, portion of a circle. In some cases however        a  very
powerful telescope (which takes in only          small portion of the sun's disc)
                                                 a
may be attended with advantage, as in the case of the solar eclipse on Sep
tember   5,1   793, where Sir Wm. Herschel observed that the first impression

lution of the annulus, the observer should take into his telescope that part
only of the disc of the sun which       necessary for the purpose.

this method Mr. Maclaurin, in 1737, was enabled to observe the appearance

I must again repeat however, that the neglect of this precaution
should not deter the observer from noting down the duration of
the several phases above mentioned, and particularly the times
at which the annulus is formed and dissolved: which may be
afterwards compared with more exact observations, and lead to
a correction of the true times f.
    It is presumed that the observer will also, from time to time,
during the progress of the eclipse, observe and note down the
distance and inclination of the cusps in the usual manner J.                   It
may    likewise   be  proper   to  remark    that it will  be  of considerable
importance to ascertain, at the time of the middle of the eclipse,
the magnitude of the annulus on the north and on the south side
of the moon, in order to determine how far distant, at that time,
the centre of the moon is from the centre of the sun§.                 If at the
same moment the observer can determine the diameter of the sun
 and moon, it will add considerably to the importance of the ob
servation ; and tend to determine a much disputed point in prac
tical astronomy j| . These observations however should be made
with a good telescope furnished with an accurate micrometer ;
 and, in making a report thereof, the observer should describe the
kind of telescope made use of, as well as the method employed in
determining the magnitude of the annulus, &c.                  For the sake of
    • In the evening of the same day on which this eclipse takes place there
 will be an eclipse of the first satellite of Jupiter: the immersion will take
place at Greenwich at 8h. 34'. 34'' mean time. Those persons therefore who
are furnished with sufficiently powerful telescopes, may (if the weather prove
favourable) have an opportunity of ascertaining the correctness of their clocks
or watches.
    f M. De L'isle states, that if we observe the situation of the cusps, or only
 their distance, at the time of the middle of the eclipse (when the eclipse is
 not annular, but nearly so), it will serve to determine the apparent route of
 the penumbra and its limits, as exactly as if we had observed the duration
 of the annular eclipse.
    J There are two modes of observing the phases of an eclipse of the sun :
 the one, by looking directly at the sun, with a telescope furnished with a
 micrometer : the other, by receiving the image of the sun, through a tele-
 scope, on a screen, in a dark chamber, or camera obscura.       Each has its ad
 vantages, and may be practised according to circumstances. See Lalande's
 Astronomie, vol. ii. p. 6.09.  M. De L'isle indeed says that " we may deter
 mine, with sufficient exactness, the situation of the. cusps, without making
 use either of the dark chamber or the micrometer, by observing the moment
 of the passage of the cusps and of the limbs of the sun, by means of simple
 wires placed in the focus of the telescope, in any situation whatever; and
 leaving the telescope in a fixed position, during the time that the sun em
 ploys to traverse the field of it."
    § M. De L'isle doubts whether this part of the observation can be made
 with sufficient accuracy in a dark chamber; on account of the indistinctness
 of the image of the moon.            || See pages 97 and 98.

greater accuracy, he should also rrtake a diagram of the appear
ance of the sun and moon, at the time of the middle of the eclipse;
placing a mark against that part of the sun's disc which appears
the most vertical to him.      The point on the circumference of the
sun's disc (relative to its vertical or horizontal diameter) where
the moon leaves it in order to form the annulus, and again where
it touches it at the time of the dissolution of the annulus, should
also, if possible, be distinctly noted.    M. Le Monnier considers
this of considerable importance*.
   It was observed, in the annular eclipse of 1737. that the an
nulus was formed and dissolved very suddenly.         For when the
whole body of the moon had entered on the disc of the sun, the
last portion that entered appeared to adhere to the concave cir
cumference of the sun's disc for some seconds ; and the moon
appeared elongated on that side, till the sun's light suddenly
broke round     it,
                  when the moon reassumed its regular curvature.
In a  similar manner, when the disc of the moon approached the
concave line of the sun's disc on the other side, they seemed to
run together like two contiguous drops of water on table, when a
they touch each other.
   It was also observed, in the eclipse of 1737,           "
                                                     that, as the an
nulus was forming, the light appeared to break in several irre
gular spots near the point of contact: and that the limb of the
moon seemed to be indented there." These irregular parts
seemed likewise to have        kind of motion
                               a                 although there was
                                                     ;
no undulation at the same time in the circumference of the sun.
Such appearances of        atremulous motion, in certain periods of
solar eclipses, are mentioned              by
                                      Hevelius and others.        was    It
noticed also in the eclipse of 1748             f.
   In both these eclipses as well as in that of 1764         was ob it
served that, when the annulus was formed, the moon appeared
much smaller on the sun than         really ought to be
                                       it                 and indeed
                                                                :
much smaller than the calculations seemed to warrant.            But
    * In his paper Sur Vutittfe des eclipses de soleil (wherein he has drawn
many important consequences from the eclipse of 1/48) he remarks, re
specting the method of determining the limits of the umbra, that

whether this phenomenon         arises from an apparent enlargement
of the sun's disc, or from an apparent diminution of the moon's
disc, or from both, does not seem clearly decided.   M. Du Se"-
jour has discussed this subject, with his usual ability, in his Traile
 analytique des mouvemens apparens des corps celestes, vol. i.
page 405, &c: but he has not come to any precise determina
tion thereon.     The observations have not been made with suffi
cient accuracy, nor are they sufficiently numerous to enable us
to determine so nice an element in the calculation of eclipses.
It is hoped therefore that the attention of astronomers will be
more drawn towards this subject in the enduing eclipse *.
   In the eclipse of 1737, Maclaurin observes that about 20 seconds
" before the annulus was complete, a remarkable point or Speck
of pale light appeared near the middle of the part of the moon's
circumference that was not yet come upon the disc of the sun :
and a gleam of light, more faint than that point, seemed to ex
tend from it to each horn."
    In the eclipse of 1748, it was noticed that there was, " about
the middle of the eclipse, a remarkably large spot of light, of an
irregular figure and of a considerable brightness, about 7' or 8'
within the limb of the moon." Mr. Short states that this eclipse
was not quite annular at Aberdour Castle : the cusps seemed to
want about one-seventh of the moon's circumference to be joined,
yet a brown light was plainly observed both by my Lord Morton
and myself to proceed or stretch along the circumference of the
moon, from each of the cusps, about one-third of the whole di
stance of the cusps from each cusp; and there remained about
one-third of the whole distance of the cusps not enlightened by
this brown light." — " I observed at the extremity of this brown
light, which came from the western cusp, a larger quantity of
light than in any other place, which at first surprised me ; but
afterwards I imagined it must have proceeded from some cavity
or valley made by two adjoining mountains on the edge or limb
of the moon.      I had often formerly observed mountains on the
circumference of the moon, more or less every where round               it,
but never saw them so plain as during the time of this eclipse.
The mountainous inequalities on the southern limb of the moon
were particularly remarkable      in some parts mountains and val

My Lord Morton was able to see them very easily through his
small reflector."
   The king of France, who (as already mentioned) went purpose
ly to Compiegne to observe this eclipse, discovered towards the
middle of the eclipse (which was not more than 9f digits) " sur
la surface de la lune, comprise entre les comes du soleil, des
rayons de lumiere rouges, et un filet de lumiere qui sembloit
masquer le disque de la lune, et qui s'etendoit a une distance
des comes*."
    M. De L'isle, in his publication above alluded to, seems to
think that a quick eye, guarded with a sufficiently dark glass,
might in solar eclipses discover the body or limb of the moon
seven or eight minutes before it touched the sun, and also for
the same time after it had left it and was entirely off the sun.
He remarks that the observer should defend himself as much as
possible from the direct light of the sun, and also from the light
of the external air. No person however has hitherto noticed such
an appearance : although many observers attended particularly
to     in the eclipse of 1748, in consequence of M. De L'isle's
     it,
remarks.    Should the moon in such case ever be visible,    would    it
enable us to determine with greater accuracy the commencement
of any solar eclipse         f.
    During the progress of the eclipse    would be desirable to as
                                                    it

tion of the sun's rays for which purpose, preparations should
                                  :
be made beforehand,       order that no time be lost during the pe
                                  in
riod of the eclipse. The variations in the thermometer and ba
rometer may be easily noted down without interrupting the astro
nomical observations.    The rapid change in the temperature of
the air may cause      hurricane of wind, (together with rain or
                            a
snow) as was observed about the middle of the eclipse           Mr.    by
Maclaurin in 1737; and          Le Monnier in 1748. Mr. Short
                                       by
says that (in the eclipse of 1748)
                                    " we did not at all perceive or
feel any greater degree of cold, during the eclipse, than we felt
before    began."
             it      But M. Cassini De Thury, who went with the
king  of France   to Compiegne to observe this eclipse, and where
it  was only 9^ digits, says they experienced      considerable de

mometer however fell only 2\ degrees : and the Abbe Nollet
found that his burning-glass was then as powerful as before the
eclipse began. M. De L'isle, likewise, who observed this eclipse
at the Luxembourg, remarks that the thermometer did not indi
cate any increase of cold caused by the eclipse, although he aud
many other persons experienced it soon after the middle of the
eclipse *.
     In the eclipse of 1737 Maclaurin observed that a burning-
glass .which kindled tinder and burnt cloth towards the end of
the eclipse, had no effect during the existence of the annulus, nor
for some time before and after it.             He likewise remarked that
" during the appearance of the annulus, the direct light of the
sun was still very considerable: and that although some places,
that were .shaded from his light, appeared gloomy, yet that the
day light was not greatly obscured."               He adds that many per
sons, about the middle of the annular appearance, although not
short-sighted, were unable to discover the moon upon the sun
when they looked without a smoked or coloured glass f. Never
theless Venus and some other stars were visible at the same time:
and Venus continued visible even after the annulus was dissolved.
Venus was also seen in the eclipse of 1748, but it does not ap
 pear that any other star was then visible.
      If the diminution of light should be considerable (which there
is not much reason however to suspect J), Mercury, Venus, and
Mars, together with some of the principal fixed stars may be vi
sible to the naked eye. Mercury, if visible, -will be seen about
 18° to westward of the sun, nearly in conjunction with Regulus:
     * In the total eclipse of 1724 the thermometer had fallen only two degrees
 at the time of the middle of the eclipse.      This is the more remarkable as
 the eclipse took place late in the afternoon of the 22d of May, at which time
 we might presume that the atmosphere would be gradually becoming more
 cool. The total darkness took place at 6>l. 48'. P.M.
     f  M. Le Monnier mentions the same thing of himself in the eclipse of
  1748.
     J  In the annular eclipse of 1764 an ignorant country clergyman alarmed
 the people of France by announcing that there would be total darkness du
 ring the existence of the annulus : and the Royal Academy of Sciences at
 Paris thought proper to give this report a formal contradiction.      It is well
 known however that the smallest ray of light from the sun would prevent
 such a phaenomenon ; as I have shown more at length in my paper " On
 the solar eclipse which is said to have been predicted by Thales," inserted
 in the Phil. Trans, for 181 1, part ii. page 220.
     I shall here take the opportunity of correcting a typographical error in
 that paper; where, in page 240, line 22, " three degrees" should be " three
 minutes."     Since the publication of that paper, I find that the Bureau det
  Longitudes in France have printed a Supplement to M. Burgh's Lunar Tables,
  wherein the mean epoch and mean motion of the Supplement of the Node
  are considerably altered ; so as to bring the latitude of the moon within the
  limits which I there suggested.
                                                                          Venus

                which   will   happen on September 7, 1820.              101
 Venus will be about 41° to westward of the sun*: and Mars
 about 35° to eastward of the sun, not far from Spica Virginis.
 The observer should also look out for any comet which may be
visible during this eclipse; and be prepared to measure its di
stance from the sun or a principal fixed star.
    As many persons may be so situated as not to be able to pro
cure any dark coloured glass, for the purpose of viewing the sun,
 I shall conclude this memoir by inserting Dr. Maskelyne's method
of smoking glasses, which he published in the Nautical Almanac
for 1 769, in his Instructions relative to the observation of the
 transit of the planet Venus over the sun's disc in that year.
    " Dark glasses should be used to defend the eye from the in
  tensity of the sun's light. Transparent glasses, smoked over
 the flame of a candle or lamp, will give a more distinct and
 agreeable vision of the disc of the sun than any tinged or coloured
glasses will do.      Provide two pieces of glass of convenient
 length, not too thick (the common crown glass, used for win
dows, will do as well as any), wipe them clean %nd dry.        Wanri
them a little by the fire     the weather be cold) to prevent their
                                    (if
cracking when applied to the flame of the candle then draw     :
 one of them gently, according to its whole length, through the
flame ;   and part of the smoke will adhere to the glass.     Repeat
the same operation, only leaving        little part at one end now
                                                  a
untouched  ;   repeat the operation, leaving      further part at the
                                                      a
same end untouched, and so each time leave a further part of
the same end untouched, till at last you have tinged the glass
with several dyes, increasing gradually in blackness from one end
to the other.     Smoke the other glass in like manner; and apply
                                                                   by
the two glasses, one against the other, only separated          rect
                                                                   a
angular border, cut of brass or card paper, the smoked faces be
ing opposed to each other, and the deepest tinges of both placed
together at the same end. Tie the glasses firmly together with
waxen thread, and they are ready for use.       The tinge at one end
should be the slightest possible, and at the other end so dark that
you cannot see the candle through it. By this contrivance, applied
between your eye and the sun, you will have the advantage not
only of seeing the sun's light white, according to its natural co
lour, and his image more distinct than through common dark
glasses, but also of being able to intercept more or less of hit
light as you please, and as the clearness or thickness of the air
requires  it, by bringing   darker or lighter part of this combined

 XIII.      On certain fraudulent      and poisonous Sophistications.
                     By Mr. Fredrick Accum *.
                           Counterfeit   Pepper.
 Slack       Pepper   is the fruit of a shrubby creeping plant, which
 grows wild in the East Indies, and is cultivated, with much ad
 vantage, for the sake of its berries, in Java and Malabar.           The
 berries are gathered before they are ripe, and are dried in the sun.
 They become black and corrugated on the surface.
     That factitious pepper-corns have of late been detected mixed
 with genuine pepper, is a fact sufficiently known f. Such an
 adulteration may prove,in manyinstances of household ceconomy,
 exceedingly vexatious and prejudicial to those who ignorantly
 make use of the spurious article.        I have examined large pack
 ages    of both black  and  white  pepper, by order of the Excise, and
 have found them to contain about 16 per cent, of this artificial
 compound.       The spurious pepper is made up of oil cakes (the
 residue of lintseed, from which the oil has been pressed), com
  mon clay, and a portion of Cayenne pepper, formed in a mass,
  and granulated by being first passed through a sieve, and then
  rolled in a cask.     The mode of detecting the fraud is easy.         It
 is only necessary to throw a sample of the suspected pepper into
  a bowl of water ; the artificial pepper-corns fall to powder, whilst
  the true pepper remains whole.
      Ground pepper is very often sophisticated by adding to a por
  tion of genuine pepper, a quantity of pepper dust, or the sweep
  ings^ from the pepper warehouses, mixed with a little Cayenne
  pepper.      The sweepings are known, and purchased in the mar
  ket, under the name of P. D. signifying pepper dust. An in-

    The adulteration of pepper, and the making and selling com
modities in imitation of pepper, are prohibited, under a severe
penalty.     The following are the words of the Act* :
    "  And whereas commodities made in imitation of pepper have
of late been sold and found in the possession of various dealers
in pepper, and other persons in Great Britain ; be it therefore
enacted, that from and after the said 5th day of July 1819, if
any commodity or substance shall be prepared by any person in
imitation of pepper, shall be mixed with pepper, or sold or de
livered as and for, or as a substitute for, pepper, or if any such
commodity or substance, alone or mixed, shall be kept for sale,
sold, or delivered, or shall be offered or exposed to sale, or shall
be in the custody or possession of any dealer or seller of pepper,
 the same, together with all pepper with which the same shall be
mixed, shall be forfeited, with the packages containing the same,
and shall and may be seized by any officer of excise ; and the
person preparing, manufacturing, mixing as aforesaid, selling,
exposing to sale, or delivering the same, or having the same in
his, her, or their custody or possession, shall forfeit the sum of
one hundred pounds."
    White Pepper. — The common white pepper is factitious, be
ing prepared from the black pepper in the following manner :—-
The pepper is first steeped in sea water and urine, and then ex
posed to the heat of the sun for several days, till the rind or outer
bark loosens ; it is then taken out of the steep, and, when dry,
it is rubbed with the hand till the rind falls off. The white fruit
is then dried, and the remains of the rind blown away like chaff.
 A great deal of the peculiar flavour and pungent hot taste of the
 pepper is taken off by this process.        White pepper is always in
 ferior in flavour and quality to the black pepper.
    However, there is a sort of native white pepper, produced on a
 species of the pepper plant, which is much better than the facti
 tious, and indeed little inferior to the common black pepper.
     Poisonous Cayenne Pepper. — Cayenne pepper is an indiscri
 minate mixture of the powder of the dried pods of many species
 of capsicum, but especially of the capsicum frutescens, or bird
 pepper, which is the hottest of all.
     This annual plant, a native of South America, is cultivated in
 large quantities in our West-India islands, and even frequently
 in our gardens, for the beauty of its pods, which are long, pointed,
 aod pendulous, at first of a green colour, and, when ripe, of a

bright orange red.     They are filled with a dry loose pulp, and
contain many small, flat, kidney-shaped seeds.             The taste of
capsicum is extremely pungent and acrimonious, setting the
mouth, as it were, on fire.
   The principle on which its pungency depends, is soluble in
water and in -alcohol.
   It is sometimes adulterated with red lead, to prevent it becom
ing bleached on exposure to light. This fraud may be readily
detected by shaking up part of it in a stopped vial containing
water impregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen gas, which will
cause it speedily to assume a dark muddy black colour.          Or the
vegetable matter of the pepper may be destroyed, by throwing
a mixture of one part of the suspected pepper and three of nitrate
of potash (or two of chlorate of potash) into a red hot crucible,
in small quantities at a time.       The mass left behind may then
be digested in weak nitric acid, and the solution assayed for lead
by 'water impregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen.
   Poisonous Pickles. — Vegetable substances, preserved in the
state called pickles, by means of the antiseptic power of vinegar,
whose sale frequently depends greatly upon a fine lively green
colour ; and the consumption of which, by sea-faring people in
particular, is prodigious, are sometimes intentionally coloured by
means of copper.      Gerkins, French beans, samphire, the green
pods of capsicum, and many other pickled vegetable substances,
oftener than is perhaps expected, are met wjth impregnated with
this metal.    Numerous fatal consequences are known to have
ensued from the use of these stimulants of the palate, to which
the fresh and pleasing hue has been imparted according to the
deadly jormulce laid down in some modern cookery books, such
as boiling the pickles with halfpence, or suffering them to stand
for a considerable period in brazen vessels.
   Dr. Percival* has given an account of "a young lady who
amused herself, while her hair was dressing, with eating sam
phire pickles impregnated with copper.             She soon complained
of pain in the stomach ; and, in five days, vomiting commenced,
which was incessant for two days. After this, her stomach became
prodigiously distended ; and, in nine days after eating the pickle,
death relieved her from her suffering."
   Among many recipes which modern authors of cookery books
have given for imparting a green colour to pickles, the following
are particularly deserving of censure ; and it is to be hoped that
they will be suppressed in future editions of the works.

 nerally adulterated with red lead. Other kinds of sweetmeats are
  sometimes rendered poisonous by being coloured with prepara
  tions of copper.    The following account of Mr. Miles* may be
  advanced in proof of this statement:
      " Some time ago, while residing in the house of a confectioner,
  I noticed the colouring of the green fancy sweetmeats being done
 by dissolving sap-green in brandy.         Now sap-green itself, as pre
 pared from the juice of the buckthorn berries, is no doubt a harm
 less substance; but the manufacturers of this colour have for
 many years past produced various tints, some extremely bright,
 which there can be no doubt are effected by adding preparations
 of copper.
     "  The sweetmeats which accompany these lines you will find
 exhibit vestiges of being contaminated with copper. — The prac
 tice of colouring these articles of confectionary should, therefore,
 be banished ; the proprietors of which are not aware of the dele
 terious quality of the substances employed by them."
     The foreign conserves, such as small green limes, citrons, hop-
 tops, plums, angelica roots, &c. imported into this country, and
 usually sold in round chip boxes, are frequently impregnated with
 copper.
     The adulteration of confitures by means of clay, may be de
 tected by simply dissolving the comfits in a large quantity of
 boiling water. The clay, after suffering the mixture to stand un
disturbed for a few days, will fall to the bottom of the vessel ; and
 on decanting the clear fluid, and suffering the sediment to her
come dry gradually, it may be obtained in a separate state.              If
the adulteration has been effected by means of clay, the obtained
precipitate, on exposure to a red heat in the bowl of a common
tobacco-pipe, acquires a brick hardness.
     The presence of copper may be detected by pouring over the
comfits liquid ammonia, which speedily acquires a blue colour, if
this metal be present.     The presence of lead is rendered obvious
by water impregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen, acidulated
with muriatic acid, which assumes a dark brown or black colour,
if lead be present.
     Poisonous Catsup. — This article is very often subjected to one
of the most reprehensible modes of adulteration ever devised.
Quantities are daily to be met with, which, on a chemical exa
mination, are found to abound with copper.              Indeed, this con
diment is often nothing else than the residue left behind after the
process employed for obtaining distilled vinegar, subsequently
diluted with a decoction of the outer green husk of the walnut,
and seasoned with all-spice, Cayenne pepper, pimento, onions^
and common salt.

    The quantity of copper which we have, more than once, de
tected in this sauce, used for seasoning, and which, on account
of its cheapness, is much resorted to by people in the lower walks
of life, has exceeded the proportion of lead to be met with in
other articles employed in domestic ceconomy.
   The following account of Mr. Lewis* on this subject will be
sufficient to cause the public to be on their guard :
   **
       Being in the habit of frequently purchasing large quantities
of pickles and other culinary sauces, for the use of my establish
ment, and also for foreign trade, it fell lately to my lot to pur
chase from a manufacturer of those commodities a quantity of
walnut catsup, apparently of an excellent quality; but, to my
great surprise, I had reason to believe that the article might be
contaminated with some deleterious substance, from circum
stances which happened in my business as a tavern keeper, but
which are unnecessary to be detailed here ; and it was this that
induced me to make inquiry concerning the compounding of the
suspected articles.
    " The catsup being prepared by boiling in a copper, as is
usually practised, the outer green shell of walnuts, after having
been suffered to turn black on exposure to air, in combination
with common salt, with a portion of pimento and pepper-dust,
in common vinegar, strengthened with some vinegar extract
left behind as residue in the still of vinegar manufacturers ; I
therefore suspected that the catsup might be impregnated with
some copper.      To convince myself of this opinion, I boiled down
to dryness a quart of it in a stone pipkin, which yielded to me a
dark brown mass. I put this mass into a crucible, and kept it
in a coal fire, red-hot, till it became reduced to a porous black
charcoal: on urging the heat with a pair of bellows, and stirring
the mass in the crucible with the stem of a tobacco-pipe, it be
came, after two hours' exposure to an intense heat, converted
into a greyish-white ash ; but no metal could be discriminated
amongst it.     I now poured upon it some aqua fortis, which dis
solved nearly the whole of it, with an effervescence ; and pro
duced, after having been suffered to stand, to let the insoluble
portion subside, a bright grass-green solution, of a strong me
tallic taste : after immersing in this solution the blade of a
knife, it became instantly covered with a bright coat of copper.
    " The walnut catsup was therefore evidently strongly impreg
nated with copper.      On informing the manufacturer of this fact,
he assured me, that the same method of preparing the liquor was
generally pursued, and that he had manufactured the article in
a like manner for upwards of twenty years.

will allow it  a place in your Literary Chronicle, it may perhapi
 tend to put the unwary on their guard against the practice of
 preparing this sauce by boiling it in a copper, which certainly
 may contaminate the liquor, and render it poisonous."
    Poisonous Custard. — The leaves of the cherry laurel, primus
lauro-eerasus, a poisonous plant, have a nutty flavour, resembling
that of the kernels of peach-stones, or of bitter almonds, which
to most palates is grateful.     These leaves have for many years
been in use among cooks, to communicate an almond or kernel
like flavour to custards, puddings, creams, blanc-mange, and other
delicacies of the table.
    It has been asserted, that the laurel poison in custards and
other articles of cookery,      on account of its being used
                                 is,                              very          in
small quantities, quite harmless. To refute this assertion, nume
rous instances might be cited; and among them,            recent one, a
in which four children suffered most severely from partaking of
custard flavoured with the leaves of this poisonous plant.
   " Several children at a boarding-school, in the vicinity of Rich
mond, having partaken of some custard flavoured with the leaves
of the cherry laurel, as      frequently practised

                                                        cooks, four of
the poor innocents were taken severely        in consequence. Two

of them,   a girl six years of age, and     boy of five years old, fell
                                                a

discretion of an ignorant cook, in mixing so dangerous an ingre

    Poisonous Anchovy Sauce. — Several samples which we have
examined of this fish sauce, have been found contaminated with
lead.
    The mode of preparation of this fish-sauce, consists in rubbing
down the broken anchovy in a mortar: and this triturated mass,
being of a dark brown colour, receives, without much risk of de
tection, a certain quantity of Venetian red, added for the purpose
of colouring        it,
                    which,        if
                               genuine,    an innocent colouring sub

adulterated with orange lead, which          nothing else than
                                                     is            better              a
kind of minium, or red oxide of lead. The fraud may be de

substitute for this poison the more harmless pigment, called Ar

1 10                Defence  of M. De Prony from
   There is therefore nothing deleterious in the usual practice of
adulterating this commodity of the table. The fraud only tends
to deteriorate the quality and flavour of the genuine article it
self.
XIV.     Defence   of M. de Prony from the Aspersions contained
         in Memoir of Mr. Watt.        By Mr. John Farey.
                           To  Mr. Tilloch.
Sir, —     The    memoirs of the late James Watt, Esq. which you
have printed in your last volume, are highly interesting, and the
writer has done no more than justice to the inventive genius of
that great man in the account of the origin of the improved steam-
engine.
    This memoir charges M. de Prony with committing a flagrant
act of injustice in his History of the improved Steam-engine, in
two volumes in quarto.        It is stated that M. de Prony there
gives the invention of the improved steam-engine to Messrs.
Perriers, never once mentioning the name of Mr. Watt.
    It would indeed have been a most flagrant act of injustice if
 Mr. Prony had done so, and in that case 1 would willingly have
left that gentleman to encounter all the odium which the author
of the memoir throws upon him ; but M. de Prony does state
Mr. Watt to be the inventor, and that the improved engine was
brought from England by Mr. Perrier ; which is the fact.           As
only a few of your readers can have an opportunity of examining
M. de Prony's book, and as all must concur in reprobating his
conduct, whilst this allegation stands uncontroverted ; it will be
only justice in you to print the following extracts from the work
in question.
    It is entitled Nouvelle Architecture Hydraulique, par M. de
Prony, Ingenieur des Fonts et Chausses, in two volumes quarto,
printed at Paris; the first volume in 1790, and the second in
1796.
   In the preface to volume I. p. xii. is a Report on the first
volume of this work to the Academy Royal in 1798.            The re
porter says,
                " Le dernier chapitre contient l'histoire et l'usage
des machines a feu depuis le Marquis de Worcester, jusqu'aux
dernieres decouvertes faites par MM. Watt et Bolton, et dont la
machine a double injection vient d'etre apportee en France, et
presentee a l'Academie par M. de Betancourt."
   Mr. Prony begins his account of steam-engines at page 563,
vol. I. His historj of the successive English inventions by the Mar
quis of Worcester, Captain Savery, Newconien, and Cawley, is
                                                                 very

           the Aspersions contained in Memoir    of Mr. Watt.      Ill
very concise, but correct in every particular ; and at page 568 he
introduces the improved engine thus:          "Un Anglois appelle
M. Watt a imaginé vers l'année 1770 une machine qui est ex
empte d'une grande partie de défauts de celle de Savery, et a
entre autres avantages celui d'opérer la condensation hors du cy
lindre."      Then follows the reference to a figure of Mr. Watt's
original single engine for pumping.
    At page 57 1 he says, " La machine qu'on vient de décrire a
été apportée d'Angleterre en France par MM. Perrier, qui l'ont
fait exécuter à Chaillot depuis quelques années ; et c'étoit ce que
nous connoissions de mieux jusqu'en 1788."
    Next he speaks of Mr.Watt's double rotative engine, first in the
marginal note :
                    " Comment M. le Chevalier de Betancourt a de
viné le principe d'une machine à feu postéri eurement construite
par MM. Watt et Bolton." Then in the text, " En 1788, M. le
Chevalier Betancourt, qui est criargé par le Cour d'Espagne de
faire une collection de recherches et de modèles pour la perfection
de l'hydraulique, étant allé à Londres, eut occasion de visiter les
machines à feu de MM. Watt et Bolton.          Il vit le jeu extérieur
des ces machines ; mais on lui en cacha le mécanisme intérieur,
ainsi qu'on avoit fait à ceux qui avoient eu la môme curiosité
avant lui."
    After mentioning some of M. de Betancourt's observations, he
continues :
    " Il fit plusieurs autres observations dont nous ne pouvons pas
nous occuper à present, mais dont les artistes doivent lui savoir
d'autant plus de gré que ces observations sont difficiles à faire,
lorsqu'on n'a que pea d'instants pour examiner une machine
masquée par les distributions d'un bâtiment qui en isolent les
différentes parties, même extérieurs, et empêchent qu'on ne puisse
en saisir la correspondance l'ensemble et l'effet général.       M. le
 Chevalier de Betancourt conclut néanmoins de ces observations,
que le piston du cylindre devoit être poussé avec le même effort,
soit dans sa descente, soit dans sa montée ; et ce résultat lui fit
découvrir le double effet qui constitue essentiellement la nou
velle perfection ajoutée aux machines à feu par MM. Watt et
Bolton.
    " M.    le Chevalier de Betancourt, de retour à Paris, fit exé
cuter un modèle de machine à feu à double effet, et les expéri
ences faites avec ce modèle ont tout le succès qu'on peut désirer.
   " Le mécanisme intérieur, au moyen du quel la double injection
s'opère, est entièrement de l'invention de M. le Chevalier de
Betancourt ; et quoiqu'il ignore si ses procédés sont les mêmes
que ceux de MM. Watt et Bolton, vu le secret que lui en ont
fait ces derniers, il a tout lieu de croire que les artistes Anglois
n'ont pas atteint un plus grand degré de précision et de simpli
                                                                  cité.

    cité. C'est dans cette confiance que MM. Perrier, excellents juges
    en pareille matièr^, se sont déterminés à faire construire une ma
    chine à feu à double effet, et conforme au modèle de M. le Che
    valier de Betancourt.     Cette machine destinée à faire mouvoir
    des moulins doit être en activité au commencement de l'année
    1790."
       At page 574 he says :
       " Le volant (fly wheel)   a été imaginé par un Anglois fabriquant
   de bierre, qui en a le premier fait usage en 1780."
      Although this is not correct, there is no reason to conclude   that
   Mr. Prony intended to detract from the merit of Mr. Watt.
       The second volume, which was not printed till 179b*, is ex
   pressly devoted to the steam-engine. In introducing the double
  engine at page 35, he refers to his former statement in the first
  volume of Mr. Betancourt's visit to England, and his model, and
   then he continues:
      " M. Perrier l'aîné nous a assuré que quoiqui'il n'ait construit
  des machines à double effet qu'après avoir connu le modèle de
  M. de Betancourt, il avoit eu cependant depuis très long temps
  l'idée de pareilles machines; que son objet étoit de diminuer la
  grosseur du cylindre à vapeur, de supprimer les contrepoids, de
  simplifier tout l'attirail, enfin d'économiser le combustible.      On
  ne sauroit révoquer en doute l'assertion d'un artiste aussi habile
  que digne de foi, il est d'ailleurs très naturel de penser que
 ceux qui ont beaucoup réfléchi sur les divers moyens d'employer
 la vapeur de l'eau comme moteur, aient cherché à transmettre
 son effort d'une manière telle que l'attirail intermédiaire le dimi-
 nuoit le moins possible ; or les machines de Chaillot."
      After describing the parallel motion, Mr. Prony introduces a
 description of an instrument called the Geometrical Pen, by
 Suarts, which he calls " un instrument très ingénieux, avec
 lequel on peut tracer une infinité de courbes par une combinai
 son de mouvements circulaires, et qui a suggéré à M. Watt l'idée
de" produire avec de semblables mouvements une ascension recti-
îigne et verticale.      Quand cette machine ne seroit pas par elle-
même d'une curiosité piquante — elle devroit sur tout intéresser
par le rapport qu'elle a avec l'histoire de l'art" des machines à
feu George Adams, dans un ouvrage intitulé Geometrical and
Graphical Essays, etc. London 1791.
  • "
        Adams dit positivement que ce principe a été appliqué par
MM. Watt et Bolton au mécanisme des machines à feu." -It
has lately been happily introduced into the steam-engine              by
MM. Watt and Bolton. " M. Watt a depuis confirmé verbal
ment la vérité de cette assertion à quelqu'un de notre connais
sance."

XV. On the Geology of Loch Leven, in continuation of Article
    in Phil. Mag. of September 1819. By Mr. Gavin Ingms.
                           To  Mr. Tilloch.
Sir,—           hbn in London in May last,  I mentioned the grounds
I had for believing in the existence of    a stratified galvanic con
nexion and internal communication       extending undeT the districts
of Loch Leven in Kinross-shire, Comrie in Perthshire, Inverness-
shire, and all those parts of the country that have of late years
been so frequently visited with the fearful phaenomena of earth
quakes.     Of this I can no longer entertain a doubt.          These
convulsive throes of nature are undoubtedly the effects of a stra
tified galvanic influence, violent in proportion to the resistance
opposed to the escape of the elastic matter produced in the de
composition of old, and in the formation of new, combinations
resulting from the incessant workings of these stratified galvanic
piles, of Nature's construction.
    To occupy your valuable pages with speculative theories, would
be very foreign to my present purpose; I shall confine myself
alone to facts as they occurred, and to observations deduced from
an attentive inquiry into the present and former geological state
of the lake, undertaken with a view to furnish you with one con
nected account.
     This, however, from want of time, I have never been able to
 accomplish, and must therefore content myself in the present
 instance with some extracts from my notes, that may be of some
 general use to the geologist— to the geology of these districts
 in particular.                                                       ,
     You are already acquainted with the remarks and observations
 of George Braid, the old residenter on the banks of the Leven,
 respecting the muddy waters discharged from the lake in August
  1816, and his declaring   "  that he had never seen the waters in
 such a state before but once, and that was when an earthquake
 happened at Comrie ; and," continued he,
                                                " an earthquake, has
 happened somewhere, be where it may."          Curiosity, as I stated
 in that communication, induced me to trace the troubled waters
 to the lake, and to calculate the time necessary for the waters
 issuing from their outlet to reach the Bleach-field, and found, it
 to   agree as near with the time of -the shock at Inverness, as you
 could well suppose the clocks and watches of the two districts
 to do. But to give a connected detail of the circumstances that
 led me to form this conclusion, I must retrograde, and go back
 to summer 1815, and state, that although there is no record of
  any shock of an earthquake at the period I allude to, so far as I
 remember ; neither have I heard of any tremllement de terre in
     Vol. 55. No. 262. Feb, 182p.                 H          .   these

these districts above referred to ; yet there was a circumstance
connected with the concatenated events that have since been
experienced, that I think will go far to prove the previous work
ings of these hidden piles, and which, though partial in effect, was
marked with characteristic evidence of its being a member of the
same family.
     In summer 1815, there was a discharge (of gas in all proba
 bility) from the depths of the lake, in such quantity, and so very
 deleterious in its effect, that its impregnation of the waters de
 stroyed the fish in such numbers as gave rise to a belief that the
 waters of the lake had been poisoned.       Incredible numbers of its
 finny inhabitants were destroyed mid thrown ashore, chiefly the
 largest of their kinds ; such as frequent the deepest waters.
 Many a monarch of the flood that had reigned perhaps for ages,
 the terror of the smaller fry, now lay along the beach a prey to
 the raven and carrion crow ; and so strongly and implicitly was
 the belief of their having died by poison riveted in the mindt of
 the surrounding population, that no one, however needy, would
 venture to eat them, notwithstanding         the finest fish of their
 species, pike, trout, perch, and eels, might have been col
 lected in cart loads. Pike, upwards of twenty pounds avordupoise,
 and trouts, &c. of the largest size, lay in promiscuous confusion
 along the margin of the lake, all of them (except the eel) pre
 senting one uniform characteristic mark of destruction, the eyes
of every species of the scaly tribe having been driven or started
 with apparent force from their sockets. This undeviating uni
formity in every species except the eel, shows that they had all
died from one cause, and by a similar effect on the vital organs,
The exception of the eel will not at all surprise those acquainted
with the anatomical construction of this animal, whose beautiful
radiant eye  is,  as
                   it  were, hermetically inclosed within its recess,
and protected from all external injury     by  the same skin that en
folds the body of the fish passing      over the eye.    The particular
part that covers the visual organ     is  somewhat thinner and per
fectly transparent so that, however the vitals of the eel may have
                   ;
been affected, the eye, securely bound within its recess, would not
leave its natural position, without bursting this skin, however    si
milar its death might have been in other respects.
    At this time the waters of the lake assumed    a    dark colour re-
sembl'ng an infusion of peat soil,    and partially retained this dusky
hue till August 1816, when the quantity of aluminous soil, thrown
from the botton of the lake   by   the shock which so much alarmed
the (town and neighbourhood of Inverness, had the effect of clari
fying the waters, and restoring them to their accustomed purity.

my opinion of the galvanic connexion of these districts, and made
me resolve to watch the various states and appearance of the
water, and, from the shrewd accuracy fii George Braid's former
remarks, to consult him on all occasions.        What I have now to
state, has confirmed me in the full belief of the existence of this
extended stratification of galvanizing minerals.
    Midsummer 1817, a water-spout fell near the town of Dun
fermline, which, with the consequent rains that fell in the
surrounding country, did considerable damage.           This might or
might not be connected with the shock of the earthquake felt
about the same time in the north.        No rain of any consequence
fell here, nor near Loch Leven : notwithstanding,         that evening
and all the day following a burst of muddy water was driven
from the Loch, bearing all the characteristic marks of August
 1816.    We noted the circumstance, and the result confirmed
our conjectures.
    Again, in November 1818, the water presented a similar ap
pearance with the two preceding years.        We expected accounts
of an earthquake, and were confirmed by the arrival of the post
from the north.      1
    In October last, when I mentioned that the waters from the
lake indicated an internal commotion, but darker in the colour
than usual on former occasions, although no ikock was felt that
has been heard of, still I am perfectly satisfied it was the partial
working of the subsequent shock at Comrie. I did not consider
the circumstance of the eels escaping from the lake as any proof
of an internal agitation, as that was the natural season of their
emigration from the fresh waters to the seaw          But the circum
stance of their all at one time starting, or being driven en masse
from the lake, is an event in their history that the oldest eel-
 fisher on the Leven does not remember.            In three successive
 nights (for they only rui* in the dark; as soon as light of any
 kind appears they burrow in the mud, or under stones, or the
 banks of the river) upwards of twelve thousand eels were taken,
 many of them from eight to ten pounds apiece, but generally weigh
 ing from half a pound to four and five pouuds each. None were got
 after this, except a few straggling dozens that may have burrowed
 deeper in the mud than the rest, or lodged in some of the deep
 pools in the serpentine turnings of the river betwixt the lake and
 the fishing-ground. This must have been connected with the
 earthquake that followed in November last.          On the afternoon
 of the 29th of that month I was standing at the top of the dry
 ing-loft stair, looking into the river, which was quite clean and
 clear at the time, when all of a sudden it came down filled with
 inud,    I turned round to see. if there was any" discharge from En-

hcrll'y Burn, when I observed it coming over the dam-dyke or
weir-head in the same state.       I immediately went down to ex
amine it more closely, sent for my monitor, and we concluded
" that an earthquake had happened somewhere, be where it
might." The first post from Comrie confirmed the fact ; and I
am now without the smallest doubt of what I have stated, of the
whole of that range of country superst rating a natural arrange
ment of galvanizing materials, which are incessantly at work,
and will continue to keep the good people of that part of the
world in remembrance of the instability of all sublunary things
even the earth itself.
    By an attentive examination of the metals, and a skilful geo
logical survey of the strata and primitive formations in these af
fected districts, and in particular a studious application to the cur
rent of galvanic, electric, or magnetic tendency, which I consi
der mere terms or modifications of the same principle, only vari
ously attired, in these peculiar combinations, the poles of this
galvanic range or ranges might be discovered, and the dread of
impending danger lessened, if not altogether averted, by boring,
sinking shafts, or other openings in the stratified drifts, at such
places as were most likely to facilitate the escape of the gases
produced in this great laboratory of nature.      I am drawn to this
conclusion by analogy, from an existing fact.
    The shock which so much alarmed the country in August
 1816 was felt at Leslie, Kirkaldy, and several intervening places
some miles to the east and south-east of Loch Leven ; yet no
shock was felt at -Kinross, nor any village or hamlet in the im
mediate circle round the lake ; and notwithstanding the troubling
of its waters, no subsequent shock has ever been felt for miles
round its bed.     The depth of the lake gives vent to, and allows
the elastic fluids to escape through the stones, gravel, sand, mud,
and water, without affecting the surrounding solid matter. The
stratified formation at the bottom of the lake must be the nega
tive termination of one of these galvanic ranges ; and perhaps
to its regular discharge of hydrogen into the waters of the lake
may be attributed their superior purity and softness, when con
trasted with the numerous and copious springs of peculiarly hard
silicated water that flows from the bottom and sides of the sur
rounding mountains, and fall into the lake round its margin.
    To hydrogen uniting with kindred affinity to the base of this
hard silicated water, may be attributed the copious deposit of si
liceous dust that covers so large a portion of the bottom of the
 lake, and constitutes no inconsiderable proportion of the mud
brought down in these eruptive discharges.

    The terrific effect, however, of these momentous operations
of the mineral kingdom cannot be contemplated even at a di
stance without a sensation of the most chilling description,
mixed with the awful incertitude of human existence, where
immediately exposed to the instantaneous rendings of contend
ing elements ; and the revolutions of nature must bear with no
trifling degree of dread and alarm on the human mind, and make
it shrink with conscious nullity from the workings of superior
power.      Nature recoils and shudders at destruction.
    Much time and labour and efforts of human genius have been
more unworthily spent than by the geological philosopher turning
the bent of his attention to the wonderful agency of galvanizing
nature in all its majesty. — Shakespear says, "All the world's
a stage" — I say the world's a galvanic pile, of grand dimensions,
having the south pole for its positive, and the north pole for its
negative : hence the current of magnetic impetus towards the
north ; thence the electric grandeur of the aurora lorealis : and
from this may be traced the origin of the island of Iceland,
which still continues to be the point of deflagration in the grand
trough of primitive formation, and whose volcanic wonders are
only the super-workings of the major pile.
    The various volcanos now extinct or silent, as well as those
 still in turmoil, scattered over the surface of the globe, are mere
frieze-workings of minor arrangements of the more recent for
 mations, brought into action by what constitutes the base of
 the Neptunian system, which had its origin as in the days of
 Peleg, when the earth was torn asunder; when the conti
 nents of the east and the west were thrown from their bases like
 the explosion of a bomb. The terra australis, or positive, falling
 by its own impetus as well as gravity towards the centre, pre
 vented the recoil of the negative and the collapsation of the lon
 gitudinal hemispheres ; and into this abyss " the rolling seas to

 action the Neptunian deposits of ages, and leaving them to the
 free agency of their own galvanic powers.             Hence all the vol

¦
    Sugar,   and   a  particular Acid, by means of Sulphuric Acid ;
    and on the Conversion of the same ligneous Substance into
    Uimine by Potash. By M. Henri Braconnotv
                           [Concluded from p. 56.]
Examination       of the artificial Gum      produced   by the  Action  of
                         Sulphuric Acid on Linen.
Wb       have seen that this gum, obtained by saturating sulphurie
acid with chalk, contains in combination, lime which may in
fact be separated by oxalic acid.        This, gum may be also purified
by adding    to  a  solution  of it some   of the sub-acetate of lead ;
this produces a very abundant white precipitate, which being de
composed by an excess of sulphuric acid, the liquid is evaporated
to a sufficient degree, the sulphate of lead is separated, and the
gum precipitated by alcohol.         I prefer however in place of chalk
to saturate the sulphuric acid with the oxide of lead heated :
there results from it a liquid of a sugary, smart taste, owing to
the lead held in solution : the latter is separated by passing
through a current of hydrosulphuric gas ; and the filtered liquor
being evaporated, the artificial gum is obtained as pure as possi
ble.    Barytcs may also be used in place of the oxide of lead ; but
as this gum retains harytes in combination, it is necessary to se
parate it by sulphuric acid.
    This gummy matter, such as I have obtained, resembles gum
arabic.     It is transparent, of a slight yellow colour, inodorous,
insipid, though it reddened the tincture of turnsole, and seemed
to act in the manner of acids.          Its fracture is vitreous.   It ad
hered strongly to the vessels in which it was dried, always when
it was prepared with care, and formed on them a very shining
kind of varnish.       It forms a mucilage less tenacious than that of
gum arabic : its cohesive properties are also inferior : but this
does not prevent its being of use in many of the arts. Exposed to
the fire, it consumed, giving out a penetrating odour of sulphurous
acid, owing to the decomposition of the sulphuric acid which it
 contains in a particular state of combination, such as the usual
                                                                  reagents

Gum, Sugar, and an Acid,      ly means of SulpkuricAcid,t$c.     119
 reagents cannot indicate.     The residum shows after incineration
some traces of sulphate of lime.
    When this gum is exposed with potash to the fire to decom
 pose it partially, no sulphurous acid is disengaged.      If the re
siduum is dissolved in water, and nitric acid added, a brown floc-
 culent matter it precipitated, which is known more particularly
 by the name of artificial ulmine.    If nitrate of barytes is added
 to the filtered liquor, it produces a precipitate of sulphate of
 barytes.
    The solution of this gum in water is not disturbed either by
 nitrate of barytes or by acetate of lead ; but the sub-acetate of
 lead produces a very white and abundant magma entirely soluble
in weak acetic acid.       If the lead which the liquor above this
precipitate contains is precipitated by carbonate of ammonia,
and then evaporated to dryness, the residuum is a triple combi
nation of gum, acetic acid, and ammonia.         The hydrochlorate
of the protoxide of tin also precipitates this gum from its dissol
vent. Lime water or barytes in excess produces slight flocculent
 precipitates, which are nothing but combinations of gum with
lime or barvtes.    The red sulphate of iron does not affect in the
least the solution of this gum, while it coagulates abundantly
that of gum arabic.     Treated with sulphuric acid, this gum fur
nishes a large quantity of oxalic acid in fine crystals, but no
 mucous acid.                                       .
                     Sugar from Linen.
  The gtimmy matter the properties of which       we have mentioned,
being boiled for some time with diluted sulphuric acid, experi
ences such a change of equilibrium in the nature of its principles,
that in separating they produce two very remarkable substances:
the one which form9 almost the whole of the matter is crystalli-
zable sugar ; the other contains the elements of the sulphuric
acid which were disseminated in the gummy matter, and consti
tutes a singular enough acid, which I will designate under the
name of the vegeto-sulphwic          acid.   I was led accidentally to
this result, by treating a solution of" the acid mucilaginous mass,
produced by the action of the sulphuric acid on. linen, with the
oxide of lead, subjected to a long continued heat of 100° centi
grade ; but after having passed through the liquor a current of
sulphurated hydrogen gas to precipitate the lead contained in so
                                 it,
lution, and after evaporating    I     was agreeably surprised to see
that the whole of the gummv matter was entirely converted into
an acid sugary mass.    I   digested this mass with very concen
trated alcohol,  by which the vegeto- sulphuric acid was dissolved:
the sugary matter remained   a   little coloured, and of very fresh

sulphuric acid, observing the precautions before indicated ; the
acid mixture, dissolved in a certain quantity of water, precipitated
the ligneous matter a little altered ; when dried it weighed 3 6
grammes (55*5 gr.)         The acid liquor thus diluted with water,
was boiled about ten hours ; after which it was saturated with
carbonate of lime.         This liquor did not precipitate the sub-
acetate of lead ; it no longer contained any gum ; the residue
was evaporated and dried as much as possible until it began to
exhale an odour of calomel.          In this state it weighed 23*3 gram.
(359*8 gr.) which were furnished by 20'4 grammes (315 gr.) of
cloth, deduction being made of what was not reduced : but I
believe that there were some losses ; for the sulphate of lime, al
though Well washed, had a slight coloured teint, different from
what results from the preparation of artificial gum : however, like
the latter, in place of "burning in the fire and disengaging sulphu
ric acid, it became whiter, and did not exhale any very particular
odour.      I made these 23-3 grammes (359-8 gr.) of sugary mat
ter into the consistence of syrup*; at the end of 24 hours it
began to crystallize ; and some days after, the whole was solidi
fied into a single mass of crystallized sugar, which was pressed
strongly between several folds of old cloth ; crystallized a second
time this sugar was passably pure ; but treated with animal char
coal it became of a shining whiteness.                The crystals were in
spherical groupes, which appear to be formed by the union of
small diverging and unequal plates.               They are fusible at the
temperature of boiling water.          This sugar, of a fresh' and agree
able flavour, produced in the mouth a slight sensation of coolness.
It dissolves in hot alcohol, and crystallizes by cooling. Dissolved
in water and mixed with a little yeast, it fermented ; the vinous
liquor which resulted furnished alcohol by distillation. Burnt
with potash, and its charcoal washed with diluted nitric acid, it
yielded a fluid not troubled by nitrate of barytes.             It would be
useless to insist further on the properties of this sugar ; it is evi
dent that it is perfectly identical with the sugar of grapes, or of
starch.
    The conversion of wood into sugar will no doubt appear re
markable ; and when persons not familiarised with chemical spc-
   • This syrup was
                      weakly affected by sulphuric acid, while a concentrated
solution of gum obtained by saturation with chalk was sensibly precipitated
by the same acid which separated it from the sulphate of lime ; from which
there seems reason to presume that in converting this gum into sugar, by
boiling it a long time with weak sulphuric acid, the elements of that acid
which itcontainsdo not entirely reunite to form the vegeto-sulphuric acid ; but
that a part separates from it in the state of free sulphuric acid, and the rest
continues mingled with that which serves to effect the saccharification,
                                                                     eulations

dilations are told that a pound weight of rags can be converted
into more than a pound of sugar, they may regard the statement;
as a piece of pleasantry, though nothing can be more real.
     It appears to me, that from the conversion of wood into gum
and sugar, some important consequences may be deduced, which
may throw light on many obscure points of vegetation. In fact,
since the observation seems to indicate that woods consist of
gum or mucilage with less of oxygen and hydrogen than the pro
portions necessary to make water, we can, by remounting to the
origin of the formation of ligneous matter, appreciate the means
 which nature puts in operation to create it. If we examine it a
 little before its birth, we see that it presents the form of a muci
 lage containing some small white grains which appear to be a
 first germ of wood : this mucositv, on account of the important
 part which it acts in vegetation, has received the name of the
 organizing substance or Cambium de Duhamel. Aided by the
 vital influence, this substance appears to abandon by little and
  little a part of the elements of water, to form first the cortical
 beds, the sap, the parenchyma ; and at last the wood, properly
 so called, which must be extremely variable in the proportion, of
 its principles, according as it is of new or old formation.       This
 manner of viewing the transformation of cambium into wood,
                                                                         '
  appears to be probable enough, when it is considered that we
  can retrograde the latter to its primitive state of mucilage.       It
  is scarcely necessary to remind the reader, that wood often con
  cretes in great abundance in the heart of mucous and sugary mat
  ter, as we see in nuts, in ligneous concretions of pears, &c.       It
  may be further observed, that the death of the vegetable does not
  put an end to this subtraction of oxygen and hydrogen ; it con
  tinues to take place in all the different states through which the
  ligneous matter passes, till it is at length entirely destroyed.
                      Of the  Vegelo- Sulphuric Acid.
      We   have said that after having saturated a solution  of the acid
  mucilage    formed  by  the action of sulphuric acid  upon linen with
   the oxide of lead, exposed to a long continued heat, there was .
  formed sugar, and an acid of a particular nature, which we se
   parated by rectified alcohol in which it was dissolved.      This al
  coholic liquor, however, retains also some sugar. I evaporated it
  to the consistence of a syrup, and agitated it with ether, which
   took a slight straw colour, and left after its evaporation an al
   most colourless acid, very sharp, almost caustic, iuid setting the
  teeth on edge.       This acid is deliquescent, uncrystallizable, and
   attracts the humidity frpm the air.      It gradually became brown
  in the air when above mean temperature.          Put into a capsule
                                                                plunged

  plunged in a sand-bath, it decomposes and becomes black a little
  before the water begins to boil.      When treated in this state with
  a little water, flocculi   of vegetable matter partly carbonized are
  separated ; and when some nitrate of barytes is poured into the
  liquor, an abundance of sulphate of barytes is precipitated. When
  this acid is subjected to a temperature higher than that of boiling
  water, its decomposition is more rapid, and suffocating vapours
  of sulphurous acid are emitted. This acid does not produce any
  change on metallic solutions.       Nitrate of barytes and sub-acetate
  of lead are not in the least affected by it. It makes a strong
 effervescence with carbonates, and appears to dissolve all the me
  tallic oxides, with which it forms salts, uncrystallizable, deliques
  cent, insoluble in acetified alcohol.       These saline and neutral
  combinations, subjected to fire, decompose, emit sulphurous acid,
  and leave sulphates and charcoal. The same acid dissolves iron
  and zinc, liberating abundance of oxygen gas.            It forms with
 oxide of lead and barytes very soluble salts, which have a gummy
 appearance.      It seems to have a strong enough dissolving fa
 culty ; for it even dissolves to a certain degree sulphate of lead.
     This acid is composed of sulphur, carbon, hydrogen and oxy
 gen ; or of a vegetable matter, and the elements of sulphuric
 acid, but in proportions with which I am unacquainted.
                   Action   of Sulphuric Acid    on Silk.
     In treating silk with sulphuric acid, I conceived the hope of
 returning it to its primitive state of silky liquor, such as is ex
 tracted from the bodies of certain caterpillars, and with which,
 according to Reaumur, the Mexicans prepare their admirable
 varnish. I hoped by means of a similar liquor artificially prepared
 with pieces of silk, that it would be easy to fabricate cloth not
 spun.     I have not however obtained this result, though I have
 not abandoned the hope of attaining it. Be this as it may, the
 sulphuric acid can convert the silk into two mucilaginous sub
stances very distinct.                            v
     If some pieces of white silk are slightly moistened with this
 acid, and, after a few minutes have been given to allow it to act,
the mixture is treated with a quantity of water, a very thick
white mucilage is obtained resembling gum tragacanth.              When
a greater quantity of water is added, the whole of the mucilage
is precipitated, and the surnatant liquid, which is as colourless as
pure water, retains only a small quantity of silk in solution. This
mucilage well washed with water is insipid to the taste.              It is
not sensibly affected by cold water ; but a great quantity of        boil
ing water dissolves it : the liquor being evaporated, there remain
some insoluble membranes : an infusion of nut-galls produces a
                                                             precipitate.

Gum, Sugar, and an Acid, by means        of Sulphuric Acid,dc.     123
precipitate.     This mucilaginous matter differs from that which
is found in the caterpillar, inasmuch as it does not dry so ra
 pidly, and is resoftened by water.
     If a greater quantity of sulphuric acid is made to act a longer
time on the silk, different results from those which I have men
tioned are obtained.
    Five grammes (77'2 gr.) of white silk cloth torn into small pieces
 were triturated in a glass mortar, by adding succesively sulphuric
 acid until the whole was reduced to a homogeneous mucilage ;
 there was a production of heat, but no sulphurous acid was dis
 engaged.      Twenty-four hours afterwards the mixture was treated
 with water, which produced an entire solution without precipitat
 ing the least particle of carbon : all that was separated was a
 veflow flocculent matter, which when dried weighed 0* 15 gramme.
 The acid liquor was saturated with carbonate of lime, and part of
 it reduced by evaporation, in order to favour the precipitation of
 the sulphate of lime which it retained. The process was finished
 by evaporating it to perfect dryness. There remained4'2 grammes
 of a residuum reddish and transparent resembling isinglass.
 This residuum dissolved in a small quantity of water did not con
 geal by cooling.      With potash it did not disengage ammonia.
 Distilled it yielded carbonate of ammonia, and left after its inci
 neration sulphate of lime.       The infusion of nut-galls and the
 sub-acetate of lead precipitated it abundantly from its solution,
 but it was only slightly precipitated by the acetate of lead.
     When therefore sulphuric acid falls upon a vestment of silk,
 or linen, or of cotton, it does not burn them, as it is said; but it
 perforates them, and the portion affected is converted into gum
 my matter soluble in water.
           Action  of Sulphuric Acid   upon Gum and Sugar.
     Gum arabic pulverized has been treated with concentrated sul
 phuric acid in quantity sufficient to dissolve it ; but, far from pro
 ducing carbon, as Fourcroy pretends, the mixture was scarcely
  coloured. At the end, however, of twenty-four hours it had con
 tracted a brownish colour : diluted with water, it did not preci
  pitate the least particle of carbon.    The liquor saturated with
  chalk produced a gum, which had exactly the same properties at
  that which we formed by the action of sulphuric acid upon wood.
  Exposed to the fire it burned, exhaling an odour of sulphurous
  acid.    The acetate of lead did not trouble its solution, but the
 ,sub-acetate of lead produced a very abundant white coagulum.
 .    Cane-sugar acted a little differently with sulphuric acid : it
  was coloured almost immediately, and became of a blackish ma
  roon, which deepened in course of time ; but it did not form sul
  phurous acid, and the whole matter was entirely dissolved in
                                                                   water

    We have seen that wood appropriates to itself the elements of
sulphuric acid and water, in order to pass into the state of gum,
and that the latter by a new distribution of its principles can be
transformed almost entirely into sugar and a small quantity of a
particular acid.      We now proceed to show that, by extracting
from wood the proportions of oxygen and hydrogen necessary
for making water, it may be converted into a substance in which
the carbon predominates, and which appears to me to have a great
analogy to ulmine. M. Vauquelin                  is,

    brown liquor is obtained which retains in solution the potash
    combined with ulmine : an acid separates the latter in the form
    of a very abundant brown precipitate, which only requires to be

    It is very easily dissolved in alcohol, and yields a deep brown
liquor which is precipitated by water. If this solution is allowed
to evaporate spontaneously, it forms at its surface pellicles which
have a crystalline contexture j but if the evaporation is forced
more rapidly, a black shining residuum is obtained which resem
bles resin.     Exposed to the flame of a lamp, it swells, and burns
with   a  slight flame. Twenty grammes (31b-10gr.) of artificial
ulmine from old linen were distilled in a glass retort ; a liquid
product was obtained from it of the weight of seven grammes ;
consisting of four grammes of a colourless fluid, and three grammes
of oil,empyreumatic, brown, fluid, and soluble in any proportion
in alcohol in an alkaline ley.
    The colourless liquid contains nothing but acetic acid, and
some traces of oily matter. There remains a charcoal of the ap
pearance of bronze of the weight of 9-8 grammes, which left
after its combustion ()-75 gramme of gray ashes, composed
chiefly of carbonate of lime, phosphate and sulphate of lime,
silex, and oxide of iron.
    The artificial ulmine was treated \\jth six times its weight of
nitric acid at 38° Bautne ; it was reduced almost to the con
sistency of honey ; and being mixed with a little water, it as
sumed a deep brown colour, and left an abundance of matter,
which well washed and dried was of the colour of Spanish to
 bacco. This matter, heated in a glass tube, was consumed with
 out emitting light and without fusing ; it produced an empyreu-
 niatic vapour, which seemed to be slightly nitrous.         Its savour
is bitter without being acid to the taste, although it reddens the
 tincture of turnsole.     It is partly dissolved in boiling water, and
produces a deep brown liquor which does not disturb a solution -
 of isinglass. The brown acid liquid separated by water from this
 pulverulent matter, still regains something of the latter; it pre
cipitates the animal glue, and furnishes by evaporation crystals
 of oxalic acid.
    Such are the properties which I have recognised in this sub
 stance, produced by the action of potash upon wood, and which
 I have compared to the ulmine which exudes from the ulcers
of trees. 1 may observe that the latter is also produced in
analogous sircumstances in diseased trees, the wood of which
in putrefying separates quite from the potash which must con
cur in the formation of the ulmine.         I ought not to neglect to
state that M. Vauquclin had already compared this production

  tain earths, which have been ranked with the extractive, is formed
  of ulmine and ammonia. I have also found ulmine in great abun
 dance in turf as well as in a variety of ligneous earths. It makes,
 doubtless, too, a constituent part of soot ; but I have found it
  impossible to produce ulmine with oil.

 Anatomists          describe the retina as consisting of two portions,
 the medullary expansion of the nerve, and a membranous or vas
 cular layer.       The former externally, next to the choroid coat,
 and the latter internally, next to the vitreous humour J. All
 however, except Albinus and some of his disciples, agree, that
 the nervous layer cannot be separated so as to present the
 appearance of a distinct membrane, though it may be scraped
off, leaving the vascular layer perfect. That the medullary ex
 pansion of the optic nerve is supported by a vascular layer, does
not I think admit of doubt ; but it does not appear that Albinus
was right in supposing that the nervous layer can be separated in
form of a distinct membrane, though shreds of a considerable size

     Exclusive of these two layers, I find that the retina is covered
 on its external surface by a delicate transparent membrane, united
to it by cellular substance and vessels.                This structure, not
hitherto noticed by anatomists, I first observed in the spring of
the last year, and have since so frequently demonstrated, as to
leave no doubt on my mind of its existence as a distinct and per
fect membrane, apparently of the same nature as that which lines
serous cavities.        I cannot describe it better, than by detailing the

procured      a  human    eye,   within  forty-eight   hours   after  death,   a
thread should be passed through the layers of the cornea,, by
which the eye may be secured under water, by attaching it to, a
piece of wax, previously fastened to the bottom of the vessel, the
posterior half of the sclerotic having been first removed. With a
pair of dissecting forceps in each hand, the choroid coat should
be gently torn open and turned down. If the exposed surface be
now carefully examined, an experienced eye may perceive, that
this is not the appearance usually presented by the retina; in
stead of the blue-white reticulated surface of that membrane, a
uniform villous structure, more or less tinged by the black pig
ment, presents itself.         If the extremity of the ivory handle of a
dissecting knife be pushed against this surface, a breach is made
in   it, and      membrane of great delicacy may be separated and
                   a

      The appearance of this part 1 find to vary in the different classes
  of animals, and in man, according to age and other circumstances.
   In the foetus of nine months it is exceedingly delicate, and with
  difficulty displayed.        In youth it is transparent, and scarcely
  tinged by the black' pigment.          In the adult it is firmer, and more
  deeply stained by the pigment, which sometimes adheres to it so
  closely as to colour it almost as deeply as the choroid coat itself;
  and to those who have seen it in this state, it must appear extra
  ordinary that it should not have been before observed. In one
  subject, aged fifty, it possessed so great a degree of strength as
 to allow me to pass a probe under                          it,

130               Account   of a   Membrane       in   ttie   Eye
though small portions are sometimes pulled off with the choroid
coat.     From this fact I think it follows, that the accounts hitherto
given   of the anatomy of these parts are incorrect.     The best ana
tomists* describe the external surface of the retina as being
merely in contact with the choroid coat, as the internal with the
vitreous humour, but both totally unconnected by cellular mem
brane, or vessels, and even having a fluid secreted between them :.
some indeed speak loosely and generally of vessels passing from
 the choroid to the retina; but obviously not from actual observa
 tion, as I believe no one has ever seen vessels passing from the
one membrane to the other.          My observations lead me to con
 clude, that wherever the different parts of the eye are in contact,
 they arc connected to each other by cellular substance, and, con
 sequently, by vessels ; for I consider the failure of injections no
 proof of the want of vascularity in transparent and delicate parts,
 though some anatomists lay it down as a criterion. Undoubtedly
 the connection between these parts is exceedingly delicate, and,
 hence, is destroyed by the common method of examining this
 organ; but I think it is proved in the following way. I have
 before me the eye of a sheep killed this day, the cornea secured
  to a piece of wax fastened under water, and the posterior half of
 the sclerotic coat carefully removed.        I thrust the point of the
 blade of a pair of sharp scissars through the choroid coat into the
 vitreous humour, to the depth of about an eighth of an inch,
 and divide all, so as to insulate a square portion of each mem
 brane, leaving the edges free, and consequently no connection
 except by surface; yet the choroid does not recede from the mem
 brane I describe, the membrane from the retina, nor the retina
  from the vitreous humour.      I take the end of the portion of cho
  roid in the forceps, turn it half down, and pass a pin through the
  edge, the weight of which is insufficient to pull it from its con
  nection.    I separate the membrane in like manner, but the re
  tina I can scarcely detach from the vitreous humour, so strong
  is the connection. The same fact maybe ascertained by making a
  transverse vertical section of the eye, removing the vitreous hu
  mour from the posterior segment, and taking the retina in the
  forceps, pulling it gently from the choroid, when it will appear
  beyond a doubt that there is a connection between them.
     Let us contrast this account of the matter with the common
  one.    The retina, a membrane of such delicacy, is described as
  being extended between the vitreous humour and choroid, froui
  the optic nerve to the ciliary processes, being merely laid between

  them, without any connection, and the medullary fibres in con
  tact with a coloured mucus retained in its situation by its con
  sistence alone.     This account is totally at variance with the ge
  neral laws of the animal oeconomy: in no instance have we parts,
  so dissimilar in nature, in actual contact : wherever contact with
 out Connection exists, each surface is covered by a membrane,
 from which a fluid is secreted; and wherever parts are united, it
 is by the medium of cellular membrane, of which serous mem
 brane may be considered as a modification.           If the retina be
 merely    in  contact  with   the  vitreous humour   and  choroid, we
 argue from analogy, that a cavity lined by serous membrane ex
 ist^ both on its internal       and external surface; but this is not
 the fact.     In the eye a distinction of parts was necessary, but
 to accomplish this a serous membrane was not required ; it is
 only demanded where great precision in the, motion of parts was
 indispensable, as in the head, thorax, and abdomen ; a single
 membrane, with the interposition of cellular substance, answers
 the purpose here.      By this explanation we surmount another dif
ficulty : the unphilosophical idea of the colouring matter being'
 laid on the choroid, and retained in its situation by its viscidity,
 is discarded ; as it follows, if this account be correct, that it i3
secreted into the interstices of fine cellular membrane here, as
 it is upon the ciliary processes, back of the iris, and pecten, Un
 der the conjunctiva,       round the cornea, and in the edge of
the membrana nictitans and sheath of the optic nerve in many
 animals.     Dissections are recorded where fluids have been found
collected between the choroid, and retina, by which the struc
ture of the latter membrane was destroyed : the explanation
here given is as sufficient to account for the existence of this
fluid, as that which attributes it to the increased secretion of a
serous membrane.
     I take this opportunity of describing the method I adopt for
examining and displaying these and other delicate parts, a me
thod which, though simple, will, I expect, prove an important
improvement in the means of scrutinizing the structure of animal
and vegetable bodies.        I procure a hollow sphere of glass from
two to three inches in diameter, about one-fourth of which is cut
off at the part where it is open, and the edges ground down, so
as to fit accurately upon a piece of plate glass, the surface of
which is also ground : the object to be examined is attached to '
a piece of wax fastened upon the. plate of glass and immersed in
a basin of water, with the cut sphere, which is inverted over       it,
of course full of water, and the whole withdrawn from the basin.
The part may thus be examined under the most favourable cir
cumstances;   it    floats in water, the only method   by  which deli
cate parts can be unfolded and displayed         :the globular form of

 attraction : the one by W. Scoresby jun. Esq., and the other by
 Captain Sabine: the latter containing the observations made on
 board H. M. SS. Isabella and Alexander, in their late voyage in
 search of a North-west Passage.                                  •

    The great importance of this error in practical navigation is
 placed in a very conspicuous point of view by Mr. Bain in his
 valuable little treatise on the " Variation of the Compass," and
 the two papers above referred to fully corroborate the statements
 of that author.     It appears indeed from the observations of Cap
 tain Sabine, that in certain high latitudes, the deviation arising
 from this cause becomes immensely great, amounting in some
 cases to at least half a quadrant.                             .   ¦

     Mr. Bain is of the opinion, and few will be disposed to say it
 is ill founded, that many of the distressing losses frequently expe
 rienced at sea are owing to this source of error : he shows in fact,
 that in consequence of local attraction, a vessel in our own lati-

tudea may frequently be steering a point out of her supposed
course ; and it requires but little knowledge of navigation to be
well convinced of the immense importance of such an error,
particularly in the Channel, and in cloudy weather, when the
compass is the seaman's only friend and guide.
     It appears moreover from the memoir of Captain Sabine, and
the same was also pointed out by Captain Flinders and Mr. Bain,
that the error from local attraction is not onlv different with the
ship's head on different points of the compass, but that it varies
also in different latitudes ; the quantity depending upon the in
clination of the dipping needle at the place of observation. Cap
tain Flinders indeed does not appear to have made a correct
estimate of the effect of the dip in changing the quantity of the
deviation ; but he had the honour of being the first to establish
the connexion between them, and thus conferred a lasting obli
gation upon the nautical profession, and has given to his name
 a permanent and perspicuous situation in the annals of that
 science.     An actual deviation caused by the action of the guns
being    thus  rendered obvious by the concurring testimony of so
 many    distinct observers; and the only rule ever yet proposed for
 the correction having been distinctly shown to be inadequate for
 the purpose, by all latter observations ; it became a fair and lau
 dable subject of contest with men of science, to discover some
 formula, or other method, for correcting these anomalies in all
 parts of the world.
      Mostly, however, the attempts were confined to the forma
 tion of certain empirical formula?, from the results of observa
 tions on ship-board ; but these, it is obvious, are at present too
 limited for such a purpose, when we consider that every degree
 of latitude gives rise to a new series of deviations.
      Mr. Barlow pursued a different course. Being placed in a si-,
  tuation where there is perhaps a greater accumulation of manu
  factured iron than in any place in the world, he proposed to
  avail himself of this opportunity, and to undertake a regular
  series of experiments on different masses of iron, fixing his com
  pass at different distances, and in every variety of position ; and
  by this means he has succeeded, not only in discovering an ex
  tremely simple method of correcting the deviation in question,
  but also in developing several magnetic laws which are highly
  curious and interesting.    It is indeed surprising, considering the
  interest which the science of magnetism has for more than a cen
  tury excited, that no course of experiments of this kind has been
  before undertaken, and that instead of examining in all cases the
  action of magnet on magnet, the inquiry had not suggested it
  self, of .determining the laws between plain iron and the cTom-

pass.     Such, however, appears to have beren the case ; and Mr.
Harlow has in consequence the honour of having discovered se
veral important, laws which promise to throw considerable light
upon this mysterious subject.
    After a few minor trials, this gentleman procured from the
Royal arsenal a solid 13-inch ball weighing nearly 300 lbs. ;
and having constructed a proper apparatus, whereby he could
place the compass at any required distance from the centre of the
ball, and in any proposed situation, he commenced his .course
of experiments, and was soon led to the discovery of a very re
markable fact, namely, that if we conceive a plane to pass through
the centre of any iron ball, inclining from the magnetic north to
south, and forming with the horizon an angle of about 20°, a
compass placed any where in that plane will not be affected -by
the iron, but will point duly north and south, the same as if no
iron were in its vicinity. . It occurred to Mr. Barlow afterwards,
that as the dip in this country is at the present time about 70u5,
the inclination of the above plane of no attraction, if examined
a little more particularly, might be found to be exactly the com
plement of the dip; and subsequent experiments, on an improved
 apparatus, and on an excellent dipping needle, confirmed this
conjecture; from which coincidence the author                    led to infer,
                                                                is.
that the same obtains in all latitudes      ;     namely, that the plane of
no attraction    is  every where perpendicular to the natural inclina
tion of the dipping needle.           We have spoken of the plane of no
attraction    as passing through the Centre of the ball in a direction
perpendicular to the inclined needle; but        it   is obviously the same,
it  we suppose the plane to pass through the pivot of the compass,
and the centre of attraction of the iron to be situated in that
plane; which latter conception       is    to be preferred in all cases where
irregular    masses   of  iron  are  employed.
    This very remarkable fact being once well established, Mr.
 Barlow made     it    the ground-work of all his subsequent experi
ments    :  for example, he very naturally conceived            a circle to be
described in this plane concentric with the pivot of the needle;
 and conceiving at the same time an imaginary sphere to be cir
cumscribed about the latter, this circle became to him an
 equator ;    the line joining the extremities of the dipping needle,
the poles    ;  and the circle passing through those poles, and the
east and west points of the horizon, a first or principal meridian;
by means of which every particular situation on the sphere might
 be immediately indicated       by    its latitude and longitude, the same
 a?  on  the  terrestrial   surface.  ...
     A long course of experiments were now undertaken, in order
to discover the law of deviation, as      it    depended upon the position
                                                                           of

 of the ball and compass, the distance between the two being al
 ways the same.      From these it was discovered, that while the
 longitude was zero, the tangents of the angles of deviation were
 proportional to the sine of the double latitude ; and while the
latitude was constant, the tangents were proportional to the co
sine of the longitude : so that in all cases, while the distance
 and mass were constant, the deviation was expressed by the for

    The next object of the author was to ascertain the law as re
spects the distance: and here again he was equally successful                                     :
the results showing       the most unexceptionable manner, that all
                              in
other things being the same, the tangents of deviation were                                   in
versely proportional to the cubes of the distances.              still re      It
mained to determine the law as regards the mass and with this             ;
view, balls of different diameters were employed, from which                                   it
seemed to' follow, that the tangents of deviation were propor
tional to the masses, as to the cubes of the diameters.
    Mr. Barlow appears in the first instance to have adopted this
conclusion, and to have considered his experiments on regular
bodies as completed      when out of mere accident, or curiosity, he
                              ;
made trials with certain shells of iron of the same diameter as his
balls, from which results were obtained as singular as they were
unexpected     ;viz. that the balls and shells of the same diameter
gave the same deviation       so that
                                   ;      appeared that the latter was
                                                 it
independent of the mass, and had only reference to the quantity
of surface. This led to several experiments on iron plates, each
a  foot square, but of various thicknesses       from which ;       made       it    is
manifest, that after the thickness     of  the iron surpasses certain
                                                                                   is a
quantity, (about -j-'jth of an inch) no addition of power         gained

expressing the quantity of deviation becomes

traversing platform, by means of which it could be traversed, or
carried round, in a complete circle.           These experiments con
firmed all his preceding deductions, showing that the plane of
no attraction, and all the laws and circumstances attending re
gular masses of iron, obtained also on those the most irregular;
and consequently that they might be immediately applied to de
termining the local attraction of the guns, &c. on shipboard.
 The comparison is accordingly made between the observed devi-
ations^pn board tlje Isabella, as given by Captain Sabine, off
Shetland, and those computed on the above principles ; and the
Coincidence between them is very striking, considering all the
circumstances of the case ; viz. the change in the dip, the very
irregular distribution of the iron in the ship, the particular situa
tion of the compass, in the vessel in question; and lastly, that
  the laws themselves had been inferred from experiments made in
 one latitude only, and on masses of iron of the most regular figure.
     One very serious objection may however be made to this, as
 well as to any other rule for computing the quantity of deviation
 in different latitudes ; which      is,
                                       that the dip at the place of ob
 servation is   a  necessary datum, and             one that

 obtained.      This induced Mr. Barlow to look for some other me
 thod for determining the error          question, the theory of which
                                          in
 may be explained in few words.
      Sinceit   was rendered obvious from his experiments on the
 24 -pounder, that all the action of the mass might be referred to
 one common centre of attraction;             followed, that so also in
                                                it                                      a
 ship, the whole might be reduced to one centre of four; and since
 the iron and compass will always, during the voyage, preserve the
 same or nearly the same relative situation,                assumed, that a
                                                              it   is
 single   ball of  iron  might be  so pointed    in  the  ship, that its ac
 tion on the needle would be the same as that of the iron                  its     in
 distributed state or, which
                    ;                 still the same, that there

  at a  greater distance, or as the iron in its distributed state.         So
  that, whatever effect the guns, &c. may produce in any situation
  of the vessel, the above ball being placed in its fixed situation,

deviation   caused by the guns is to be determined : this being
 known, a pin     is to be fixed experimentally to the binnacle, in
such a situation, that when a ball or plate of iron is slipped on,
and the binnacle turned about, the deviations arising from the
ball or plate shall be the same as those produced in the like si
 tuations by the guns.
    This being done, the plate (which Mr. B. adopts in preference
to the ball) is fo be laid aside ; then, at any time when it is de
sirable to ascertain the local effects of the guns, &c. the plate is
to be applied in its assigned situation, and it is to be observed
how much it draws the needle out of its prior direction ; and just
so much will the guns have deflected it before the experiment.
 This being ascertained, and the course of the vessel corrected ac
cordingly, the plate is to be again removed, and laid aside till
some new circumstance renders its application again necessary. —
Several experiments are then reported as they were made vvitli
an attached plate and the 24-pounder above mentioned, which
were lepeated before some of the Lords of the Admiralty, and
apparently much to their satisfaction.
    Nothing can be desired more simple than this method of cor
recting the errors arising from local attraction; and we are glad to
find that the Board of Longitude has approved of the principle,
and has recommended its adoption to the Admiralty, who it seems
are about to give it a proper trial in both hemispheres of the globe.
    Having dismissed this subject, Mr. B. turns his attention to
an explanation of the cause of the daily variation of the compass;
a phenomenon which has never yet been explained in a manner
                                                                      "
entirely satisfactory, and which certainly appears to have an in-
timate connexion with the laws and principles discovered in the
early part of the experiments above referred to.      Mr. B., after
enumerating all the known circumstances attending this pheno
menon, observes : <f It appears then, that any hypothesis which
may be advanced to account for the diurnal variation of the
needle ought to be competent to the explanation of the follow
ing facts, viz.
    1 . That the general character of the daily change in the di
rection of the needle shall be westerly in the morning and easterly
in the evening.
   "2. That although the above is the general phenomenon, yet
this is sbbject to certain modifications, indicated by the letters

change than the Roman letters.

the horizon, is very inconsiderable with respect to that which
takes place in the day-time.

 138                   Notices respecting New Books.
      4. That the greatest daily variation takes place either at, or
 j& little before and after, the summer solstice ; and the least at the
  winter solstice.
     5. That the greatest daily variation happens now earlier in the
 day, than it did at the beginning and middle of the last century.
     6. And lastly, that the daily variation is less at the equator
 than in our latitudes.
   . Mr. B. then proceeds to explain that all these peculiarities are
 the necessary consequences of supposing the sun to possess a
 certain degree of magnetic influence, such as that which belongs
 to every mass of plain unmagnetized iron ; and of admitting the
 existence of the plane of no attraction, and the other magnetic
 laws indicated in the preceding part of this article.        He shows,
 for instance, that at one time in the year the sun will, both at
 its rising and setting, be above the plane of no attraction ; that
 at another it will both rise and set below the plane ; while at
 others it will rise above and set below, &c. ; and that this con
 sideration fully explains those modifications in the daily variation
 as denoted above.        He shows, moreover, that the least daily va
 riation ought to happen at the winter solstice, the rectangle (sm
 2 A., cos  /.) being then the least that there ought to be a second
                                      ;
 minimum at the summer solstice, although the rectangle (sin
2   X. cos  /.)   is then much greater than in the former instance        ;
and that    a  little before and after this solstice the daily variation
 ought to be at its maximum.           He proves also, that       14' be
                                                                    if
reckoned the greatest daily variation in our latitude,        ought not

to exceed         3'at the equator; and lastly, that      ought to be

      On any plan of preparing coal gas hitherto adopted, this
result has not been obtained.       The coal having never been com
pletely decomposed,       aconsiderable  quantity of combustible mat
ter has been suffered to escape in the form of tar and ammonia-
cal liquor.    Thus substances not only of little or no value, but
such as were deemed nuisances inseparable from the preparation
 gas, were produced in great abundance.             To obviate these in
conveniences, which have in many instances prevented the intro
 duction of this invaluable discovery,          apply the coal in thin

     The difference in the quantity of gas produced by the two modes of

by a mechanical process, independent of the stoker, a uniformity
of temperature and regularly thin strata are preserved ; and as it
is applied to the machine only once in twelve hours, at which
time also the retorts are cleaned out, there is a eonsiderabls re
duction of labour, and an increased certainty of operation.
    " A greater quantity of gas being obtained by the mode now
described, there will evidently be a considerable saving of expense
in the coal necessary to produce            it,
                                             and in the quantity of fuel
employed.      The  saving  in  the  former   will be proportioned to the
increase   in the quantity  of gas     and
                                       ;   as  that    more than double,

the saving will amount, at least,       to one  half; and as the above-
mentioned quantity of gas can be produced at the heat usually
applied, and in    a  considerably shorter period than       is   now re
quired, there will be      saving also in fuel of more than one half.
                           a
Besides, one chaldron of coal introduced into the retort upon the
proposed plan, produces two chaldrons of coke of excellent qua
lity, which finds ready sale at 25s. per chaldron, when the coal
                   a
is  at 50s.                                                            •' -
    " Another advantage accruing from this mode of operation,           is
a very material saving in the wear and tear of the apparatus.
Every one conversant with gas-works knows, that upon the plans
 in general use, when 10,000 feet of gas are produced, the re
 torts must be renewed at least once in six months.              Upon my
 plan they may be kept in good working order eighteen months.
    " Another very important advantage consists in avoiding the
nuisances hitherto inseparable from the preparation of coal gas.
 The greatest inconveniences attending            have been the produc
                                                  it
 tion  of tar and  ammoniacal     liquor,  and   the  accumulation of the
lime-water used in purifying the gas. The two first are com
pletely obviated     by the proposed process of decomposing the
coals, neither tar nor ammoniacal liquor being produced in the
operation.      The latter inconvenience          prevented by the use of
                                                  is
lime and water    in   asemi-fluid state, which in being discharged
from the machine soon becomes consolidated, and may easily be
removed, and applied to any purposes for which lime         is  required.
    " To produce these advantages, have constructed an appa

 forms a cylindrical dish, nearly of the same diameter as the re
 tort. On the upper part of the retort, and adjoining the door,
 I place a hopper, sufficiently large to contain coal for twelve
 hours' consumption.       The coal is previously screened, and all
 lumps excluded, larger than the required thickness of the strata
 to be laid in the dish.     The lid of the hopper is kept tight by
 means of an hydraulic joint.       To that part of the hopper where
^the  coal  is discharged,  is attached a cone, the difference of the
 diameters of whose ends is in exact proportion to the difference
 of the space described in their revolutions by the parts of the dish
 over which it is placed.      On the surface of this cone, a number
 of thin bars are fixed longitudinally ; each about the depth of
 the stratum of coal to be applied.      The cone is made to revolve
 upon its horizontal axis, at the same time that the dish revolves
 horizontally; and by varying their relative velocities, the thickness
 of the stratum may be varied ad infinitum*.
   "   The products arising from the coal thus introduced, are con
 veyed by a pipe to the condenser, which condenser forms the prin
 cipals for supporting the roof over the retorts. From the condenser
 all the fluids are conveyed back by a pipe to the retort, drop by
 drop, as they are condensed ; and as these drops fall upon the red-
 hot coke as it revokes, they are all completely decomposed f.
    " The lime machine is constructed upon the same principle as
 that described in Accum's last Treatise, but much simplified and
 improved. By using lime and water in a semi-fluid state, a smaller
 quantity of lime is required for absorbing the sulphuretted hydro
 gen gas J, while, at the same time, lime of this consistence is as
 completely free from the obnoxious fluid produced by lime-water,
 as if dry lime had been used.       As the quantity of gas absorbed
 in the process of purifying is proportioned to the bulk of water
 employed, it is obviously more ceconomical to use lime and water
 in a semi-fluid state; to which it may be added, that gas purified
 by this mode possesses higher illuminating power.         In proof of
 these assertions, I refer to a paper in the Philosophical Magazine
 for September 1819, by Dr. Henry, pp. 164-166.
   f   From the lime machine the gas is conveyed to the large
 meter §, where every foot is registered, and finally into the col
 lapsing gas-holder, a machine preferable to any now used, and
 constructed at half the expense       ||.
   * When the stratum of coal    isabout half an inch in thickness the cylin
drical dish makes one revolution in forty minutes, the velocity varying witfe,

    " From, the above statement          it appears that, in addition to a
considerable diminution in the amount of capital sunk, (the first
cost of the new apparatus being much less than that of the old,)
there is in the new plan a saving of three-fourths of the annual
expenditure.     The tar and ammoniacal liquor have in no instance
paid the expense of collecting and casks; I have, therefore, not
noticed them.        I -hope soon to be able to lay before the public
the exact difference, in point of value, of the gas, by the two
modes of operating: suffice it to say, at present, that^vhere the
gas, upon the old plan, sells for 155. per 1000 cubic feet, the;
gas produced upon the new plan is worth 20s. at least, making
a difference in the annual rental, where 50,000 cubic feet are
sold daily, of 4562/. 10*.
    " The    expense of producing an equal quantity of light with
oil gas (taking Messrs. Taylors' own statement,' as given in the
Journal of Sciences and Arts, vol. vi. p. 108,) would amount to
the erwrmous sum of 19,010/. 8s. Ad.               To prevent discussion, I
have allowed, with Messrs. Taylor, that an equal volume of oil
gas will produce double the quantity of light of coal gas.

ferent gases, as well as the quantity of azote, sulphuretted hydro
gen, and carbonic acid, formed, from which the injurious effects
of letting the coal remain so long in the retorts will be seen.
The only correct mode of ascertaining the illuminating power
of different gases, is by the quantity of oxygen condensed by a
given volume of inflammable gas, thit gas having the greatest
illuminating power which condenses the greatest quantity of oxy

dron of coals from 10,000 to 25,000 cubic feet, and at the same

ment that has yet been made since gas was introduced for the

An Introduction to Solid Geometry,         and to the Study of Crys
     tallography, containing    an  Investigation of some of the Pro
    perties belonging to the Platonic Bodies independent of the
    Sphere.     By N. J. Larkin, M. G. S. Teacher of Crystallo
    graphy and Mathematics. Illustrated with four plates from ori
    ginal drawings by the Author. 8vo. pp. 140.
    The work under consideration contains a description of a va
 riety of solids hitherto unnoted, and a number of new and re
 markable properties of those >solfcls that have been long known.
 In tracing the properties of the Platonic bodies, the author shows
 that they naturally divide themselves into two series, each con
 sisting of five solids ; and what is remarkable, that each individual
 solid, in one of the series, is to be found in great abundance
 among crystals, whereas not a single individual in the other se
ries has ever been found among such productions.           The first he
calls the natural; the other, the artificial series. These two se
ries bear a strong resemblance to each other; inasmuch as the
last in each series contains all the foregoing in the same series : the
angular points of the contained solids may be traced out in the
surface of the last solid ; and what perhaps is equally remarkable,
is, that the whole of the solids, composing the natural series, are
commensurable with each other when the first four are contained
in the last, and that they are to each other as the numbers 1, 3, 4,
(5, and 8. There   is  another solid whose extremities may be traced
out in the surface of the last of the natural series which solid
                                                       ;
the author calls   a    cuboctahedron on account of its being inter
mediary between      the  cube and the octahedron: this solid, though
it    commensurable with the rest,
     is                              is  not so simple, being as f^-
                                                                 5     :
consequently  it   is  somewhat less than the fourth, being to    it as
80: 81. The author has combined the solids belonging to the
natural series in pairs, in every possible manner, and given the
ratios of their volumes in two tables he has likewise given the ra
                                     :
tios of a number of remarkable lines in or upon these solids, and
has shown how each may be extracted from the others. The ratios
between the members of the artificial series appear to be incom

 measurable, except in one instance, on which account they make
 a.yery striking contrast with the natural -series, whichare all com
 mensurable. He afterwards describes fiye distinct dodecahedrons,
 which all admit of indefinite variation, and which, with the two,
 before described, make seven ; the whole of which'are shown to-
 be singularly related with the cube.    The descriptive part is fol
 lowed by a series of demonstrations contained in fifty-three theo
 rems, concluding with an Appendix, by Dr. Koget, containing a
demonstration of the relations subsisting between the numbers of
the artificial series, and likewise between their faces and their
 axes.    The whole is illustrated by four plates, engraved in a su
perior manner by Mr. and Miss Lowry ; the third plate is re
markably well executed, and is a flattering specimen of that young
ladies abilities.
     Upon the whole, the work will be found of great service to pre
pare the mind for the study of crystallography;      and at the same
time, highly interesting -to the mathematician.       Indeed it is the
only work in the English language in which the various proper
ties of the geometrical solids are particularly described; on which,
account it cannot fail to be acceptable.

promotion of Astronomy, which promises to be attended with the
most beneficial advantages, and appears highly deserving of public
support. Indeed, considering the patronage which is given to most
 of the Arts and Sciences in this country, it is somewhat singular
that no Institution should hitherto have been formed for the ad
 vancement of this particular branch of Science — the most noble
 of them all. The views and objects of this Society will be best
 seen by the Address which they have published; and which we
hope to give at full length in our next Number ; together with a

                                                 Chatham, Feb. 5, 1820.
Sir, — J. he        Philosophical Magazine, Number 261, contains
some remarks on what are called conical balls ; it may be not
altogether uninteresting to your Glasgow correspondent, to know
that balls of an egg form were used by the Russian guards in
  1811.     The inventor, or perhaps more correctly speaking, the
 person who introduced that form, received from the Emperor the
sum of 5000 rubles as a mark of His Imperial Majesty's appro
 bation.    It is certainly  possible, that the gentleman who claimed
as his invention      that form of shot, did not know that in England
the same shape had been recommended some years before.                  In
the European Magazine for 1804 the above form is strongly re
commended ; I do not recollect by whom, nor am I quite certain
with regard to the date : but doubtless it was long before their
introduction into the Russian army, and also previous to 1808,
the year in which Mr. Robertson read his Essay on that subject.
     I believe it is generally admitted that the rockets used in war
are not so efficient as might be expected, in consequence of the
uncertainty of their striking the intended object.        If any of your
tforrsepondents wijl have the goodness to- inform me whether aa

attempt has ever been made, to give them motion round their

    Query— Could the required motion be given by attaching two
or more narrow slips of thin iron, in a spiral direction, on the
case, similar to the feathers on an arrow, but placed on the con
trary end, or by forming two holes diametrically opposite at the
anterior end, on the same principle as Dr. Barker's mill, or as
fire-works are sometimes exhibited whirling on their axis ? So
far they would differ, that those have only a circular motion, the
rocket should have that combined with its progressive motion :
no doubt some portion of the impelling matter would be diverted;
consequently the range shortened : even with this deduction, the
certainty of the flight might be more than a compensation.

     Sir, — In   my work on the Western Islands of Scotland, I have
 suggested (vol. ii. p. 104) that the sandstone of Caithness was
similar to that of the western coast of Ross and Sutherland, and
 have also questioned whether that of Cromarty and Aberdeen
 shire does not belong to the same species.         Since that book was
 printed I have had an opportunity of examining the districts in
 question; and, that I may not mislead future geologists, I beg
 to say that the last of these .suggestions is unfounded, and that
 1 have not as yet been able to satisfy myself respecting the geo
 logical relations of the sandstone of Caithness.          It is not in my
 power at present to enter into the details necessary for elucidat

                                                                   quantity

 (supposed to be a solid mass of loadstone,) has a sensible effect
on the mariner's compass, is unfounded.          Mr. Charles Rumkeri
in 1818 could not find, at the distance of two or three or four
nautical miles, the declination of his needle affected in the least
by the action of the island.
                         FRENCH ROCK SALT.
    In July last a regular search for    rock-salt was commenced at
Moyenire in the department of La Meurthe.               At the depth of
200 feet they found a bed 1 1 feet thick ; below this the work
men perforated a bed of gypsum and clay of 546 feet, when they
reached another bed of salt eight feet thick.            The salt of the
first bed is very white and transparent, and very pure : the se
cond contains a small portion of gypsum and argillaceous sub
stances, and is brownish like clouded flint.          It contains hardly
any muriate of magnesia or sulphate of lime.             Both present a
cubical fracture.

    M. Peron, the naturalist, has had occasion to observe, that
 men in a savage state are inferior in strength to men civilized;
and he has demonstrated in a very evident manner, that the im

stroy our physical powers.       The following is the result of expe

prompts me to state, that the Nautical Almanac for 1821 has
been out of print nearly three months, and the new edition is
not yet issued from the press. During this period many valuable
ships have sailed on distant voyages ; nine of the East India
Company's ships to my knowledge : six of these from 1200 to
1350 tons burthen, all destined first to India and afterwards to
China : several of these have not been able to procure a Nauti
cal Almanac for 1821 ; and as some of them will be obliged to
proceed from India by an eastern passage to China, they will
have to navigate in the Pacific Ocean early in 1821 destitute of
a Nautical Almanac for that year, if thty do not obtain one prior
to their departure from India, which is very improbable : and it
is possible some of these valuable ships may be compelled to na
vigate afterward from China to England, without possessing that
essential requisite to the safety of navigation.

    Sir, — I perfectly concur with the opinion given in yonr useful
Magazine for November 1S19, page 368, of the advantage arising
from the mathematical periodical publications, and feel confident
that the books there noticed, have conjointly with others, and
particularly the very respectable and well conducted Gentleman's
Mathematical Companion, uniformly afforded a stimulus to ma
thematical inquiries, which could not fail to produce mathema
ticians of the first rank.    But the reason of my troubling you at
present, is to express mv regret at not observing the name of the
Gentleman's Mathematical        Companion,    which commenced in
 1799 and was annually and regularly continued to the present
time, mentioned in an article apparently written for the laudable
purpose of drawing the student's attention to a good collection
of such publications.      As I have been for many years a corre
spondent to various periodical productions, and am in consequence
well acquainted with them, I beg to recommend the above-named
work to the notice of those who may be desirous to possess an
advantageous selection, through the medium of your Philoso

to be an omission in your valuable pages,

than mortieing out of a solid block of elm.
    The pin and cog being riveted with a counter plate in the
sheave, gives it a considerable advantage as to the leverage, to
gether with the pin turning, consequently wearing round, which
adds to the durability, together with the sheave's working on the
ends of the pin, which causes it to rim with equal velocity on the
sides as perpendicular, nor is the cog so likely to wear loose
when the pin is fixed in the cog as otherwise in the common
block which wears the upper part of the pin only, and which
causes a very great friction ; the strength and durability over the

    **
       It is very difficult to ascertain the precise condition of the
weather in in distant ages.       The thermometer was not invented
till 1590 by the celebrated Sanctorio; nor was that valuable in
strument reduced to a correct standard before the year 1724, by
the skill of Fahrenheit.      We have hence no observations of tem
perature which go further back than a century.          Prior to this
period we must glean our information from the loose and scanty
notices which are scattered through the old chronicles relative to
the state of the harvest, the quality of the vintage, or the endu
rance of frost and snow in the winter.        Great allowance, how
ever, should be made for the spirit of exaggeration and the love
of the marvellous, which infect all those rude historical monu
ments. Toaldo and Pilgram have, with incredible industry, pror
secuted this research ; and, from a bulky work of the latter,
printed in the German language at Vienna in 1788, we shall se
lect the most remarkable pastages concerning the state of the
weather for more than a thousand years back, and combine with
them the observations made by Professor Pfaff, of Kiel.          The
following years are noted for the severity of the winter :
     In A. D. 401, the Black Sea was entirely frozen over.
     In 462, the Danube was frozen, so that Theodoiner marched
over the ice to avenge his brother's death in Swabia.
     In 545, the cold was so intense in winter, that the birds al
lowed themselves to be caught by the hand.
     In 763, not only the Black Sea, but the Straits of the Darda
nelles was frozen over. The'snow in some places rose fifty feet
high ; and the ice was so heaped in the cities as to push down
the walls.
     In 800, the winter was Intensely cold.
     In 822, the great rivers of Europe, such as the Danube, the
Elbe, and the Seine, were so hard frozen as to bear heavy wag
gons for a month.
     In 860, the Adriatic was frozen.
     In 874 , the winter was very long and severe. The snow con-r
 tinued to fall from the beginning of November to the end of
 March, and incumbered the ground so much, that the forests
 were i' accessible for the supply of fuel.
     In 991, and again in 893, the vines were killed by the frost,
 and the cattle perished in their stalls.
    .In 991, the winter lasted very long, with extreme severity.
 Everv thing was frozen, the crops totally failed, and famine and
 pestilence closed the year.
     In 1044, great quantities of snow lay on the ground.         The
 vines and fruit-trees were destroyed, and famine ensued.
     In 1067, the cold was so intense, that most of the travellers in
 Germany were frozen to death on the roads.
                                                                    In

   •  In 1124, the winter   was uncommonly     severe, and the snow
 lay very long.
      In 1133, it was extremely cold in Italy; the Po was frozen
 from Cremona to the sea : the heaps of snow rendered the roads
 impassable, the wine-casks were burst, and even the trees split,
 by the action of the frost, with immense noise.
      In 1 179, the snow was eight feet deep in Austria, and lay till
Easter. The crops and vintage failed, and a great murrain con-<
 sumed the cattle.
     The winters of 1209 and 1210 were both of them very severe,
 insomuch that the cattle died for want of fodder.
      In 1216, the Po frozen fifteen ells deep, and wine burst the
 casks.
     In 1234, the Po was again frozen, and loaded waggons crossed
the Adriatic to Venice.       A pine forest was killed by the frost at
 Ravenna.
     In 1 236, the Danube was frozen to the bottom, and remained
long in that state.
     In 1261, the frost was most intense in Scotland, and the
ground bound up.        The Cattegat was frozen between Norway
and Jutland.
     In 1281, such quantities of snow fell in Austria as to bury the
very houses.
                                             -
                                           t
     In 1292, the Rhine was frozen over at Breysach, and bore,
loaded waggons.        One sheet of ice extended between Norway
and Jutland, so that travellers passed with ease ; and, in Ger
many, 600 peasants were employed to clear away the snow, for
the advance of the Austrian army.
     In 1305, the rivers in Germany were frozen ; and much di
stress was occasioned by the scarcity of provisions and forage.
     In 1316, the crops wholly failed in Germany. Wheat, which
some years before sold in England at 6s. a quarter, now rose to 21.
     In 1323, the winter was so severe, that both horse and foot
passengers travelled over the ice from Denmark to Lubec and
Dantzic.
     In 1339,  the crops failed in Scotland ; and such a famine en
sued, that the poorer sort of people were reduced to feed on
grass, and many of them perished miserably in the fields.         Yet,
in England, wheat was at this time sold so low as 3s. 4d. a quar
ter.
     In 1344, it was clear frost from November to March, and all
the rivers in Italy were frozen over.
     In 1392, the vineyards and orchards were destroyed by frost,
and the trees torn to pieces.
     The year 1408 had one of the coldest winters ever remem
bered.      Not only the Danube was frozen over, but the sea be
                                                                tween

tween Gothland and Oeland, and between Norway and Den
mark, so that wolves driven from their- forests came over the ie*
into Jutland.    In France the vineyards and orchards were de
stroyed.
   In 1423, both the North Sea and the Baltic were frozen. Tra
vellers passed on foot from Lubeck to Dantzig.       In France the
frost penetrated into the very cellars. Corn and wine failed, and
men and cattle perished for want of food.
   The successive winters of 1432, 1433, and 1434, were uncom
monly severe.     It snowed forty days without interruption.    All
the rivers of Germany were frozen : and the very birds took shel
ter in the towns.    The price of wheat rose, in England, to 27s.
a quarter, but was reduced to 5s. in the following year.
   In 1460 the Baltic was frozen, and both horse and foot pas
sengers crossed over the ice from Denmark to Sweden.           The
Danube likewise continued frozen two months; and the vineyard*
in Germany were destroyed.
   In 1468, the winter was so    severe in Flanders, that the wine
distributed to the soldiers was cut in pieces with hatchets.
   In 1544, the same thing happened again, the wine being frozen
into solid lumps.
   In 1548, the winter was very cold and protracted.       Between
Denmark and Rostock, sledges drawn by horses or oxen travelled
over the ice.
   In 1564, and again in 1565, the winter was extremely severe
over all Europe. The Scheldt froze so hard as to support loaded
weggons for three months.
   In 1571, the winter was severe and protracted. All the riv«Td
in France were covered with hard and solid ice ; and fruit trees,
even in Languedoc, were killed by the frost.
   In 1594, the weather was so severe, that the Rhine and the
Scheldt were frozen, and even the sea at Venice.
   The year 1 608 was uncommonly cold, and snow lay of im
mense depth even at Padua. Wheat rose, in the Windsor market,
from 36s. to 56s. a quarter.
   In 1621 and 1622, all the rivers of Europe were frozen, and
even the Zuyder Zee.      A sheet of ice covered the Hellespont ;
and the Venetian fleet was choaked up in the lagoons of the
Adriatic.
   In 1655, the winter was very severe, especially in Sweden.
The excessive quantities of snow and rain which fell did great
injury in Scotland.
   The winters of 1658, 1650, and 1660, were intensely cold. —
The rivers in Italy bore heavy carriages ; and so much snow had
not fallen at Rome for several centuries.      It was in 1658 that
Charles X. of Sweden crossed the Little Belt over the ice, from
                                                          Holstein

ffolstdn to Denmark, with his whole army, foot and horse, fol
lowed by the train of baggage and artillery. During these years
the price of grain was nearly doubled in England : a circumstance
which contributed, among other causes, to the Restoration.
     In 1670, the frost was most intense in England and in Den
mark, both the Little and Great Belt being frozen.
     In 1684, the winter was excessively cold. Many forest trees,
and even the oaks in England, were split by the frost.      Most of
the hollies were kilted. Coaches drove along the Thames, which
was covered with ice eleven inches thick. Almost all the birds
perished.
     In 1691, the cold was so excessive, that the famished wolves
entered Vienna, and attacked the cattle, and even men.
     The winter of 1695 was extremely severe and protracted. The
frost in Germany began in October, and continued till April, and
many people were frozen to death.
     The years 1697 and 1699 were nearly as bad. In England,
 the price of wheat, which in preceding years had seldom reached
 to 30i. a quarter, now amounted to 71s.
     In 1709, occurred that famous winter, called, by distinction,
 the cold winter.    All the rivers and lakes were frozen, and even
 the seas, to the distance of several miles from the shore.    The
 frost is said to have penetrated three yards into the ground. —
 Birds and wild beasts were strewed_dead in the fields ; and men
 perished by thousands in their houses. The more tender shrubs
 and vegetables in England were killed ; and wheat rose in price
 from 21. to 4l. a quarter.       In the south of France, the olive
 plantations were almost entirely destroyed : nor have they yet
 recovered that fatal dissaster. The Adriatic sea was quite frozen
 over, and even the coasts of the Mediterranean, about Genoa ;
 and the citron and orange groves suffered extremely in the finest
 parts of Italy.
      In 17 16, the winter was very cold. On the Thames booths
  were erected and fairs held.
      In 1726, the winter was so intense, that people travelled in
  sledges across the Strait, from Copenhagen to the province Sca
  nia in Sweden.
      In 1729, much injury was done by the frost, which lasted from
  October till May.     In Scotland, multitudes of cattle and sheep
 were buried in the snow; and many of the forest-trees in other
  parts of Europe were killed.
      The successive winters of 1731 and 1732 were likewise ex
  tremely cold.
      The' cold of 1740 was scarcely inferior to that of 1709. The
  snow lay eight or ten feet deep in Spain and Portugal. The Zuy-
                                                                  der

der Zee was frozen over, and many thousand persons walked or
skaited on it. At Leyden, the thermometer fell ten degrees be
low the zero of Fahrenheit's scale. AH the lakes in England
froze ; and a whole ox was roasted on the Thames. Many trees
were killed by the frost; and postillions were benumbed in their
saddles.   In both the years 1709 and 1740, the General Assembly
of the Church of Scotland ordained a national fast to be held, on
 account of the dearth which then prevailed.
    In 1744, the winter was again very cold. The Mayne was
 coveted seven weeks with ice; and at Evora in Portugal people
 could hardly creep out of their houses for heaps of snow.
    The winters dining the live successive years, 1745, 1746, 1747,
 1748, and 174.9, were all of them very cold.
    In 1754, and again in 1755, the winters were particularly cold.
 At Paris, Fahrenheit's thermometer sunk to the beginning of the
 scale; and in England, the strongest ale, exposed to the air in
 a glass, was covered, in less than a quarter of .an hour, with ice
 an eighth of an inch thick.
    The winters of 1766, 1767, 1768, were very cold all over Eu
 rope. In Fi ance the thermometer fell six degrees below the zero
 of Fahrenheit's scale. The large rivers and the most copious
 springs in many parts were frozen. The thermometer laid on the
 surface of the snow at Glasgow fell two degrees below zero.
    In 177 1> the snow lay very deep, and the Elbe was frozen to
 the bottom.
     In 1776, much snow fell, and the cold was intense. The Da
 nube bore ice five feet thick below Vienna'.      Wine froze in the
 cellars, both in France and in Holland. Many people were frost
 bitten, and vast multitudes both of the feathered and finny tribes
 perished. Yet the quantity of snow which lay on the ground had
 checked the penetration of the frost.      Van Swindell found in
 Holland,   that the earth was congealed to the depth of twenty-one
 inches, on a spot of a garden which had been kept cleared, but
 only nine inches at another place near  it, which was covered with
 four inches of snow.
    The successive winters of 1784 and 1785 were uncommonly
 severe, insomuch that she Little Belt was frozen over.
     In 1789, the cold was excessive, and again in 1795, when the
 republican armies overran Holland.
     The successive winters of 1799 and 1S00 were both very
 cold.
    In 1809, and again in   1812, the winters were remarkably cold.
  The years which were extremely hot and dry, will be more
easily enumerated.
                                                                 In

   In 763, the summer was      so hot that the springs dried up.
    In 860, the heat was so intense that, near Worms, the reapers
dropt dead in the fields.
    In 993, and again in 994, it was so hot that the corn and fruit
were burnt up.
    The year 1000 was so hot dry, that in Germany the pools of
water disappeared, and the fish, being left to stink in the mud,
bred a pestilence.
    In 1022, the heat was so excessive, that both men and cattle
were struck dead.
    In 1130, the earth yawned with drought.         Springs and rivers
disappeared, and even the Rhine was dried up in Alsace.
    In 1159, not a drop of rain fell in Italy after the month of
May.
    The year    1171 was extreme]} hot in Germany.
    In 1232, the heat    was so great, especially in Germany,    that it
is said   that eggs were roasted in the sands.
     In 1260, many of the Hungarian soldiers died of excessive heat
at the famous battle fought near Bela.
    The consecutive years 1276 and 1277 were so hot and dry as
to occasion a great scarcity of fodder.
     The years 1293 and 1294 were extremely hot, and so were
likewise 1303 and 1304, both the Rhine and Danube having
dried up.
     In 1333, the corn-fields and vineyards were burnt up.
     The years 1393 and 1394 were excessively hot and dry.
     In 1447, the summer was extremely hot.
     In the successive years 1473 and 1474, the whole earth seemed
 on fire. In Hungary one could wade across the Danube.
     The four consecutive years, 1538, 1539, 1540, and 1541, were
 excessively hot, and the rivers dried up.
      In 1556, the drought was so great that the springs failed. In
 England, wheat rose from 8s. so 53s. a quarter.
     The years 1615 and 1616 were very dry over Europe.
      In 1646, it was excessively hot.
      In 1652, the warmth was very great, the summer being the
 driest ever known in Scotland ; yet a total eclipse of the sun had
 happened that year, on Monday the 24th of March, which hence
 received the appellation of Mirl* Monday.
      The summer of 1660 was remarkably hot.          It is related that
 one of the minions of tyranny, who, in that calamitous period
 harassed the poor Presbyterians in Scotland with captious ques
 tions, having asked a shepherd in Fife, whether the killing of the
 notorious Sharp, Archbishop of St. Andrew's, (which had hap
                                                                   pened

pened in May,) was murder ; he replied, that he could not tejl,
but there had been fine weather ever since.
   The first year of the 18th century was very warm, and the two
following years were of the same description.
    It is a singular coincidence, that in 17 18, the distance precisely
of  100 years from the present, the weather was extremely hot and
dry all over Europe.        The air felt so oppressive, that all the
theatres were shut in Paris.      Scarcely any rain fell for the space
of nine months, and the springs and rivers were dried up. The
following year was equally hot. The thermometer at Paris rose
to 98 degrees by Fahrenheit's scale.           The grass and corn were
quite parched.       In some  places   the fruit-trees blossomed two or
three times.
   Both the years 1723 and 1/24 were dry and hot.
   The year 1745 was remarkably warm and dry, but the following
year was still hotter ; insomuch that the grass withered, and the
leaves dropt from the trees. Neither rain nor dew fell for several
months; and on the Continent, prayers were offered up in the
churches to implore the bounty of refreshing showers.
   In 1748,- the summer was again very warm.
   In \7~>4, it was likewise extremely warm.
   The years 1760 and 1761 were both of them remarkably hot ;
and so was the year 1763.
    In 1774, it was excessively hot and dry.
   Both the years 1778 and 1779 were warm and very dry.
   The year 1788 was also very hot and dry; and of the same
character was 1811, famous for its excellent vintage, and distin
guished by the appearance of a brilliant comet.
                MEAN TEMPERATURE OF THE EARTH.
   According to Laplace, any actual diminution of the mean tem
perature of the earth would be detected by a diminution of the
length of the day.      It appears by computation, that one degree
of Fahrenheit's    thermometer    would make an alteration of nearly
one second in the length of a day, and four or five minutes in"
that of ft year.

                             To   Mr. Tilhch.
            I                                     Chatham, March 1, 1820.
              T would doubtless be a waste of time to say any thing
 on the importance to this country, of naval force; consequently
 every attempt (however limited) for the improvement of ships of
  war, whether in their construction or (economy, should at least
  receive a candid examination.
     It is well known that all line-of-battle ships, I mean those of
  74 guns, carry a large quantity of iron as ballast — small class 160,
 large class 185 tons.     Now, could not the greater portion of that
 material be so disposed of as to add to the strength as well as sta
 bility of the ship ? For example : instead of the usual method of
 supporting the beams in the middle by perpendicular pieces of
 timber from the keelson to the orlop-deck beams, would it not
 be much better to make use of cast-iron ? I mean the present
 ballast re-cast into the requisite forms.           The principal pieces
 should be of a parabolic shape, when seen in the longitudinal
 section of the ship, with the terminations somewhat enlarged and
 circular ; at each end there should be a round hole, through
 which a strong pin might pass, for the purpose of connecting
 their adjoining ends ; the same pin should also pass through holes
 in a plate having projections on it for that purpose, placed at a
 proper distance to receive the ends of the parabolic pieces ; those
 plates to be let into, and strongly bolted to, the keelson, and to
 a strong fore and aft piece under the orlop deck beams ; to the
 ends of this piece the stem and stern post should be securely
 united, the parabolic pieces to be placed at the angle of 45°, in
 tersecting each other two or three times.            If judged necessary,
 the whole might form a reticular frame of the length and
 depth of the hold, equally calculated to resist tension or com
 pression.     The lower deck beams, that they may be capable of
 resistance in opposite directions, should be of the form proposed
 for the oMique pieces, if of metal : should timber be preferred,
 the shape should be the same, as near as is compatible with
 the nature of that material. Of whatever material they are made,
they should, if possible, be sufficiently strong to support' the su
perincumbent weight of the ship, &c. I mean without encroach
ing on the stowage.       As it is intended that the longitudinal frame
should be continued without interruption from stem to stern, the
hatchways must be increased in width.            The masts may be made
either to step on, or double at their lower ends so as to pass
down by the sides of the frame.           I cannot suppose that any ob
jection    can be made   to  using    metal    in the above manner in a

chip's hold.    Certainly no change of climate can produce a vari
ation in the temperature of that part, sufficient to effect any ma
terial change in the dimensions of the piece?.              The method at
present is to   make    deck  beams     convex    on  the  upper and con
cave on the under side.        It appears from this form 'df beam, to
be the intention of the constructor to destroy rather than to pre
serve the ship in its original figure.
   The deck and beams of this form may be considered as an
arch of very large radius, incessantly endeavouring to thrust the
sides of the ship to a greater distance, the destructive effects be
ing greatly increased when the ship is but partially supported
in a heavy sea ; or, what is perhaps nearly as bad, strained by
the percussion of the guns in action.              It may be said, and no
doubt it is true, that most of the beams have perpendicular sup
ports in the middle : but this only converts the beam into two
arches ; the evil may be diminished, it is certainly not removed.
    The way in which the beams are connected to the sides ap
pears to me to be equally exceptionable. What but the most in
veterate prejudice could retain the fastenings called knees ? The
present method of building ships is to place the timbers as near
to each other as possible. Would it not be more eligible to increase
the depth of every other timber or frame by the addition of the
intermediate one? Double the number of timbers, as they are at
present disposed, gives double strength ; by doubling the depth
the strength would be quadruple (or as the square of the depth) :
those double timbers should be carried as high as the lower gun
deck, their termination serving as a support for the beams of the
same. This no doubt would diminish the capacity of the hold ;
but let the external width be increased in the proportion of the
 augmentation made to the thickness of the timbers : greater
 breadth is said to be much wanted in most of our ships.
    If you will favour this with a place in your very valuable mis
 cellany, it may fall into the hands of some of your readers much
 more capable of appretiating what has been done, or pointing
 out what should be done, than

ing fruit either from wall-trees or standards, hut more particularly
the latter.   There are few trees of any magnitude, especially ap
ple- and pear-trees, of which all the fruit can be gathered by
hand, even with the assistance of a ladder, and in the attempt
many of the best bearing sprays are necessarily injured or torn
off.   The finest fruit also is that which grows at the ends of the
highest branches, where it has the full advantage of the sun and.
air. But fruit in this situation is precisely that which is the most
difficultly got at in the ordinary way of gathering, and hence
much of the prime produce of a tree is either shaken or beaten
 to the ground, in consequence of which it receives so many bruises
 as to be unfit for market, and incapable of being kept.     The in
 strument which I have the honour of laying before the Society

   The natural history of opium and the manner of collecting and
preparing    it the East Indies and in Persia have been fully de
                  in
tailed  byDr. Samuel Crump, in his Inquiry into the Nature and
Properties of Opium.     He examined the different accounts re
lated  by authors, from Dioscorides, Pliny, Kaempfer, and many
others, till the year 1792, when his very interesting work was
completed.
   The preparation of opium in Britain has long been a deside
ratum.   Premiums have been offered          by
                                        the Society of Arts, and
more recently          by
                  the Caledonian Horticultural Society.   Speci-

                             of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts,

was conferred on Mr. Young for these communications, and specimens of
the instruments are preserved in the Society's Repository.
                                                                        mens

mens of British opium have been produced, and proved to be in
no degree inferior to the best foreign opium ; but it has not yet
been ascertained that this valuable drug can be cultivated in Bri
tain with profit to the grower.
    The few experiments which have been made, were conducted
according to the Eastern mode. But the temperature, winds, and
rain of this climate have hitherto been justly considered as in
superable obstacles.       Of these the temperature may be held as
the least objectionable, for the large white poppy (Papaver som-
mferum of Linnaeus), from which foreign opium is obtained, conies
to maturity in this climate.       But it is further objected, that the
high winds beat down the plants, and the rains wash off the opium,
before it can be collected, when the Eastern mode of gathering it
is practised.     It has therefore been proposed to cultivate the
garden poppy of this country, because it is not so liable to be da
maged by wind as the large white poppy.
    It is the object of this communication to describe a method by
which these obstacles have been completely removed, and to de
monstrate from the result of experiment, that opium, superior in
quality to the best Turkey opium, can be procured in Britain, m
sufficient quantity not only for home consumption, but also for
exportation. It is proposed to cultivate the poppy not only for its
opium, but also for its oil ; and it will appear that a crop of early
potatoes may be raised upon the same space of ground with the
opium and oil by the same culture, and that such a crop will, in
a good season, yield a clear profit of from 50/. to 80/. per acre,
 allowing 60/. for expenses.
    The monopoly of the opium produced from the culture of the
poppy, is the third principal branch of the East India Company's
 territorial revenue in India*.
    In 1773, the contract or exclusive privilege for providing opium
 was granted to Meer Munkeer, in preference (as was stated by
 Government) to any one else, because, being the person employed
 by the gentlemen of Patna in that business, he was the best ac
 quainted with the proper mode of managing        it,   and would account
for any outstanding balances. He was to deliver the Bahar opium
at 320 rupees, and the Oude at 350 rupees per maund.
    Since that time, the East India Company's annual revenue
 upon that article alone, has risen from eight to upwards of eighty
 lacs of rupees, or more than     a   million sterling.      By
                                                              a   Report,-
dated East India House, 29th February 1816, which Was at that
time laid before parliament, the sale of opium in Bengal for the
year 1813-14, amounted to 96 lacs 40,729 current rupees, the
 advances and charges upon which only amounted to 10 lacs
 77,638 current rupees.

    But the opium used in Britain is principally supplied from Tur
 key.    The gross amount of duty upon opium imported into Great
 Britain in the year 1816, was only 2,6511. 13*., while the aver
 age quantity consumed in Britain is 14,400 lb., which is charge
 able with a duty of Ss. Sd. per pound.            There are, besides, from
 250 to 300 chests of opium imported from Turkey, and lodged in
 bond warehouses for exportation, each chest containing from
  150 lb. to 2Q0 lb. of opium.         This statement is from a member
 of the Turkey Company in London.
    As the method of gathering opium, about to be proposed, dif
 fers materially from any other hitherto in use, it may be proper
 to observe, that Mr. Ball, who obtained a premium of fifty gui
 neas from the Society of Arts, collected his opium according to
 the Bengal method, which is accurately described by Mr. Kerr*,
 who was an ocular witness, and by A. W. Davis f, whose accounts
 agree with that given by KaempferJ; respecting the mode of col
 lecting opium in Persia.         The seeds, according to Mr. Kerr, are
 sown in quadrangular areas, the intervals of which are formed
 into aqueducts for conveying water into each area.                 The plants
 are allowed to grow      six. or  eight inches   from  each other, and are
 plentifully supplied with water, till they are six. or eight inches
 high, when a nutrient compost of dung, ashes, and nitrous earth,
 is laid over the areas.        A little before the flowers appear, they
 ore again well watered till the capsules are half grown, when the
 watering is stopped, and they begin to collect the opium.                This
they effect by making, at sunset, two longitudinal incisions from
below upwards, without penetrating the cavity, with an instru
 ment that has two points as fine and sharp as a lancet.                  The
incisions are repeated every evening, until each capsule has re
ceived six or eight wounds, aud they are then allowed to ripen
their seeds. The juice which exudes is collected in the morning,
and being inspissated to a proper consistence, by working it in
an earthen pot in the sun's heat, it is formed into cakes for sale.
    In this manner Mr. Ball collected four ounces of opium from
one fall and twenty-eight square yards of ground, which is at the
rate of 22 lb. 8 oz. per acre. But, in another place, he observes, that
by a calculation which he made, supposing one poppy growing in
one square foot of earth, and producing one grain of opium, more
than 50 lb. will be collected from one statute acre of land.               But
if I take his proposition, and calculate by the rule used by land-
measurers, the produce in that case would only be 5 lb. 11 oz. and
1 dr. per acre.      If Mr. Ball's assertions with respect to the pro
bable produce     had  been correct, there can be no doubt that opium

tent.
    It is probable that Mr. Thomas Jones, who was a candidate
for the premium offered by the Society of Arts, was misled by the
speculations of Mr. Ball.       Mr. Jones only collected 21 lb. 7 oz.
of opium from five acres and upwards of poppies, and obtained
the premium of fifty guineas for the largest specimen.           He col
lected his opium according to the Bengal method ; but some of
 his poppies, he says, became stunted, and others were entirely
destroyed by remarkably dry weather, which continued six weeks
from the beginning of May. This may be considered as the rea
son why he obtained so little from five acres.         In another place
he says, the largest quantity which his man, seven children, and
himself, were able to procure in one morning from 5 to 9 o'clock,
was one pound and a half.         This happened when the dew was
remarkably great,     and  succeeded   one of the wannest days of the
summer.      And as he admits, in another place, that the opium
(which appeared upon the heads in a soft ash-coloured substance),
when first collected,       is,
                           from its union with the dew, much too soft

ratio that they gather opium in the East Indies.           They have no
rain in India during the season of gathering opium, and Mr. Kerr
says, that there one acre of poppies yields 601b. of opium.
    These observations, collected from Mr. Jones's paper to the
Society of Arts, should be kept in view, as they may help to                             il

                                   by
heads, bending them down, and suffering the milk to drop into
a tea-cup; yet he says that he collected more            the Persian way

 the operator,iu which is fixed a wheel set with lancets,which,wheu
 put in motion by drawing the hand along the poppy head, makes
 with great expedition whatever number of perforations are wanted,
e$ph giving out its distinct drop of milk, by which a great sur
 face is afforded both for support and evaporation, and the flow
 ing milk is prevented from running upon the ground, the un
 avoidable consequence of the method formerly in use.            And for
gafheriug    the  opium,  he  employs    a   tin flask, flattened  at the
mouth about half an inch, with which he scrapes off the opium.
By means of these instruments, Dr. Howison obtained a cake of
opium that weighed 8| oz. and which was collected from a field
of poppies measuring about five falls, which is at the rate of 17 lb.
 weight of opium per acre.
    Dr.Howison's puncturing instrument and collecting flask may
 certainly be considered as a material improvement upon the Hin
 doo instruments, and he found that they answered his purpose to
 a certain extent in gathering opium from the garden poppy. But
when the unevenness upon the surface of the capsules of the white
 poppy is considered, it will be found impossible to adapt the
mouth of the flask so as to collect the whole of the juice without
materially injuring the capsule, and much of the juice would still
 remain in the interstices of the ridges, which are for the most
 part found upon the capsules of the white poppy.            Besides, the
juice very soon acquires a ropiness, and adheres to the mouth of
 the flask, which must interrupt the gathering, and there is a
chance of the juice being spilt by having the flask suspended to
 the body of the gatherer.
    Dr. Howison has stated several objections to the cultivation of
 the large white poppy in this country, and has given the prefer
ence to the double red garden poppy and its varieties. He says that
the white poppy, from its large head and very considerable height,
is of all others the most liable to be hurt by winds ; and unless
they be cultivated in a sheltered situation, few will be found
standing when the season for gathering the opium arrives.             But
independent of this, he says, that it never arrives at such perfec
tion in this climate as to yield milk of proper consistence for
making good opium, and that the few that do come to afford
milk, continue in that state only for a, day, and any attempt to
bleed them a little sooner or later would be without success.
    Mr. Kerr*, however, informs us, that the large white poppy
grows in Britain, without care, to be a much statelier plant than
it does in India with the utmost art; and Dr. Alston f, after
commenting upon the controversy, whether opium is got from
the white poppy or from the black, concludes that, as a medicine,

     it is of no consequence whether it be taken from the one or from
     the other.    Dr. Crump also observes that the white variety is to
     be preferred, as affording opium in greater quantity than any of
     the rest, and there can be no doubt that this poppy yields the
     largest and most juicy heads.
         Dr. Howison has stated that 200,000 lb. of opium are made
     annually in Bengal ; and that notwithstanding all the care that
     is taken in collecting      one-third of the crop
                               it,                            lostis but there
                                                                            ;
    is  reason to believe that the waste     is much greater than he sup
     poses.    For in whatever way the incisions are made, the milky
    juice instantly flows in    a wasteful stream, and                by
                                                                running upon
     the ground or upon the leaves, one-third of the crop at least must
     be lost before the gathering commences in the morning.              In this
     climate, he remarks, where the serenest day           often followed
                                                             is                              by
    a  night of deluging rain, the adoption of the Bengal method would
    be worse than trusting our fortune to the chance of a lottery.
        Although Dr. Howison was convinced that the juice of the
     poppy undergoes no change in its properties                 by
                                                             exposure to the
     air, further than acquiring greater consistence from the evapo
                                     a
     ration of its watery part, he states in another place, that in Ben
    gal, where there    isno rain during the opium -gathering season,
     the custom of allowing the milk to thicken, by remaining for
     some time on the capsule,        highly judicious. While, in another
                                     is
     part of his account, he admits that that custom             the only rea
                                                                       is
     son why they lose one-third of their crop.
        Supposing that 200,000 lb. of opium give the East India Com
    pany 100,000Z. sterling annually,        by Dr. Howison's account they
    lose more than 30,000/.          But were the loss only to amount to
    half that sum, sufficient importance,         it  to be supposed, would
                                                       is

                                      which such a saving could be ef
     fected.
         Mr. Kerr states, that there are about 600,0001b. of opium
    annually exported from the Ganges, independent of what                 con         is
     sumed in the interior.    He also states, that         frequently mixed
                                                            it   is

     and with other additions which are kept secret.                    indeed,
                                                                            It   is,
     frequently  so much    adulterated,   that  considerable   quantities are
    burnt at Calcutta     by order of the government.
         In the summer of 1817,      I cultivated     small field of poppies,
                                                       a
     containing about 20,000 plants of the Papaver somniferum of
     Linnani3, out of which    I  selected two beds, measursing one fall
     and fourteen square yards,- for the purpose of ascertaining what
     quantity of opium   it would produce.        Icollected the opium from
     that part selected for the experiment myself, while the rest of
_   the crop was gathered by the people       I   employed.        collected as
                                                                           I

 170 On cultivating in Great     Britain  the Pa paver somniferum,
opium in the space of an hour ; but as my professional avocations
prevented me from regularly superintending the people at work,
they did not gather so much as I expected.        I ascertained, how
ever, that they could gather at the rate of one drachm in the
hour.
  ¦ I had my poppies sown in three different         ways. The first
broad-cast upon beds three feet wide with an alley between, and
 thinned out to the distance of four and five inches, when the
 plants were about two inches high above the ground.          The se
 cond on beds three feet wide, in rows, six rows to a bed, and six
 inches between the plants.       The third on the spaces between
 rows of asparagus, two rows of poppies on each space, eight inches
 between each row, and six inches between the plants ; two feet
 four inches between each double row of poppies being occupied
 by the asparagus.
     The first produced only one capsule, the second two, and the
 third three capsules per plant.
     Having ascertained that the white poppy, when cultivated upon
 the wide drill plan that I have adopted, not only yields more cap
sules, but much larger ones than when cultivated in the broad
cast way, or in close rows ; it is evident there must be a great
saving of labour, for it will take as much time to gather the juice
 from a small head, as it would do to collect three times the quan
 tity of juice from a large head.
    The plants between the asparagus rows having more room to
grow, had not only more capsules, but they were much larger than
those sown broad- coast, or in beds in close rows; and as early
potatoes, cultivated in a piece of ground adjoining my crop, were
sold for a high price before my plants began to flower, I proposed
the following year to have, by this mode of culture, the same
quantity of opium with a crop of early potatoes, as I obtained
from an equal measurement of ground where there was nothing
but poppies.
    Accordingly, in ISIS I selected a piece of ground in the highest
state of cultivation, well manured with horse-dung, in which I
                                                                       "
planted early potatoes, in rows four feet wide.        Furrows were
first drawn ; in these furrows the dung was laid ; then the sets
were dropped on the dung, about nine inches asunder, and co
vered by the hoe.      The potatoes were planted the first week of
February;     and the poppies were sown about the middle of April,
on the middle space between the potatoe rows, two rows of pop
pies on each space, and twelve inches between the rows. When
the poppy plants were about two inches above the ground, they
were at first thinned out by the hoe, and afterwards by the fin
gers, to the distance of eight inches between the plants.
    In this manner I raised a crop of early potatoes equal to thirty-
                                                                   six

                    and  of preparing   Opium   from it.              171
 six bolls per acre.    Although the potatoes will be ready for im
  mediate use before the gathering of opium commences, the whole
  crop will not be entirely ripe for lifting till after the opium is col
 lected.    The early potatoe gives out but a small stem; but where
 the soil is rich, some of them may spread in the areas ; yet they
  can be easily pushed over to one side, so as to allow the opium
 gatherers to walk along the areas without trampling upon them.
     The distance between the poppy plants being wider than last
 year, upon an average they produced four full grown capsules
  each, and some of them produced seven or eight capsules ; and
  1 gathered this season at the rate of two drachms of solid opium
 in one hour, while, by the same method of gathering, I could not
  collect more than one drachm in the same time last year.
     Supposing one acre had been cultivated in the same manner as
 that piece of ground on which my experiment was made, the pro
  duce in that case would have been equal to 57 lb. 9oz. 4 dr. and
 48 gr. of solid opium, which is just twice as much as I collected
  the year before.    But the season of 1818 being so much more
 favourable than the preceding year, will in a great measure ac
 count for the success of this experiment.          Therefore the quan
 tity of opium that may be collected depends greatly upon the sea
 son ; yet the comparative view of the result of the experiment
 made in 1817, although the season was extremely unfavourable,
 is sufficient to prove that my method of extracting and gathering
 opium has a decided advantage over any other that has been re
 commended.
    As my poppies were sown about the middle of April, they were
 ready for bleeding about the middle of July.
    The instrument which I used for making the incisions con
 sisted of two convex-edged scalpels, the blades of which were
 covered with sealing-wax, except about one-sixteenth part of an
 inch of the edge, and being wound round the handles with waxed
thread, the two were fastened together with other thread twisted
round them, and thus held at the distance of about half an inch
between each blade, (PI.      Ill, figs. 6 and 7)-     It is obvious that
the   blades  are covered   with  sealing-wax   for the  purpose of pre
venting the knife from penetrating the cavity of the capsules ; and
it can be easilv removed and applied again, when the knives re-<
quire to be sharpened: or the blades may be mounted with a
meta^ sheath or guard for this purpose.
    With this instrument I make one or more double incisions, "ac
cording to the size of the head, at first longitudinally, and after
wards obliquelv upwards from the stalk, (fig. 10.)
    When the capsule h sufficiently scarified in the manner de
scribed, I then cut off, with a sharp scalpel, the capitellum or
                                                                     btary

   172 On cultivating in Great      Britain the Papaver somniferum,
  star, with a thin slice of the external rind round it (cc, fig. 10);
   and by this last incision I obtain more juice than from a scarifi
  cation upon the side of the head.
      It is my method of gathering the milky juice of the poppy in
  the fluid state, that differs materially from any other that has been
  used, and it is on that account that I have been more successful
  than any other that has tried the experiment.
      In my communication to Dr. Duncan relative to Lactucarium
  or Lettuce-opium, published in the second edition of his Obser
  vations on Pulmonary Consumption,           I proposed to gather the
  opium by means of a sponge.        But when I began to collect opium
  in that way, I soon found that it would not do ; for although the
  sponge removes the juice more effectually than the flask proposed
  by Dr. Howison, it cannot be again entirely expressed, because
  the sponge decomposes or separates the component principles of
  the milky juice, and the resinous part adheres to the sponge, and
  soon clogs its pores.     I therefore adopted the use of a small com
  mon hair-brush used by painters, and known to the trade by the
  name of sashtool (PI. III. fig. 8.), which answers the purpose
  most completely, and with which I gathered the milky juice, even
  though some of the plants were laid by wind and rain, as well as
  if they had been standing erect. I used a camel-hair brush, but
v found the same objection to it as to the sponge.       The common
  sash-tool, rounded a little at the point, without being ground, is
  that which I prefer.
      For the sake of experiment, I exposed myself one morning to
  a  shower  of rain for half an hour, while making the incisions and
  gathering the opium, and succeeded as well as when there was
  no rain, without any other inconvenience than being wet, and
  having an additional quantity of water with the opium.
      When the brush is sufficiently charged with juice, I scrape it
  off upon the slip of tin b, fig. 9, fixed in the mouth of a tin flask,
  fastened to- the breast of the gatherer by straps through the holes
  a a, and capable of holding more than a day's gathering.
     The gatherers follow the bleeders immediately.        One bleeder
  will occupy two gatherers, and if he be very expert at using the
  knife, he may keep three gatherers constantly employed. When
  I performed both operations myself, I held the knife between the
  thumb, fore and middle fingers, and the brush between the ring
  and little fingers of the right hand, while I held the poppy by
  the stalk with the left hand.
      The juice is afterwards formed into cakes or balls by sponta
  neous evaporation in shallow earthen dishes, placed in a close
  room, stirring it occasionally during the evaporation of its watery
  part, to be afterwards kept in bladders.
                                                                    The

                         and  of preparing Opium from it.                      173
     The operation for gathering cannot be repeated with advan
  tage oftener than three times a week, upon the same capsules,
 for no more juice will flow from           one wound than what may be
  collected immediately, and a certain time must elapse before the
 plant forms more juice.           But it is evident a number of hands
 may be kept constantly employed upon a large field, till the plants
 cease to give out juice.
     One acre will keep twelve gatherers and six cutters constantly
 employed for thirty clays.          That number can only gather a third
 part of    an acre   in one  day, and by the time they have gone through
 the crop, the capsules at that place where they began to gather,
 will be ready for the operation being repeated. So that when
 the milky juice ceases to flow, five operations as already described
 will have been made upon each capsule.
     Supposing twelve gatherers to work ten hours in the day, and
 that each gathers two ounces and a half, or as much of the juice
as will make that quantity of solid opium; in thirty days they
will gather fifty-six pounds of opium from one acre.
     One acre of poppies cultivated according to my method, will
yield 10001b. of seed, and this quantity of seed will give by ex
pression 375 lb. of oil.
    Although the produce of such a crop has not yet been clearly
ascertained upon a large scale, the following may be taken as
the estimate of one acre, from what has actually been produced
in my experiment.

     Opium    costs the wholesale druggist in London at this time
(May 18U>) \7s.6d. per pound, whieh, with a duty of 8s. 8d.
per pound, makes it 1/. Qs. 6d,, and they charge the apothecaries
36s. per pound, which is the present London price of the article.
The London price of opium varies so much, that about twelve
years ago it was as high as 84*. per pound, and it seldom falls
so low as 24s.
     If the crop can be got off the ground by the middle of August,
it is proposed to have a second crop of potatoes or turnips, which
will give, it is supposed, about 30/. more.

   ,  Dear Sir, — During the course of last summer I repeatedly vi
 sited your plantation of poppies, for the manufacture of opium,
 in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh.                          •
      I admired very much the method that            was followed for collect
  ing the opium from the plants.          For, by your plan, the very great
  inconvenience, which arises from the unsteadiness of our climate,
  if the Bengal method of collection, recommended by Dr. Howi
  son in the Memoirs of the Caledonian Horticultural Society, be
  adopted, is completely obviated.
      I have lately prescribed your opium to many different patients,
                                                                             '
  both in private and hospital practice, with the best effects.                 I
  have particularly prescribed what you put into my hands to se
  veral patients in the clinical wards of the Royal Infirmary, and,
  as I was inclined to infer from its appearance, I have found it
  remarkably efficacious, in no degree inferior to the best Turkey

 an improvement in the arts, which may be adopted with great
 advantage in Britain.

    Dear Sir, — During the last year I have frequently administered
the opium made by you to patients in the Royal Infirmary, and
it gives me much pleasure to report to you, that I have found it
produce the same effects as the best foreign preparation of the
medicine, and I think that a smaller quantity is necessary than
of the foreign opium.

XXIV.     Memoir of   the late  Gaspard Monge. From Historical
    Essay on his Services and Scientific Works, ly M. C. Dupin,
   a Pupil of Monge, and Member of the French Institute.
G    . Monge  was born at Beaune in 1746.        His progress was such
that they gave hiin the office of Professor of Natural Philosophy
in the college at Lyons, although he had only begun to study it
the year before.     Returning to Beaune in the vacation, he set
about the survey of that town.      As he had not proper instruments
for that purpose, he made some himself.         He dedicated his work
to the administration of his native place, and they recompensed
the young author, as far as the limited finances of the place would
allow.   A lieutenant -colonel of the engineers, who happened to
be at Beaune, obtained for Monge an appointment as draughts
man and pupil in the^Ecole d'Apparailleurs et de Conduct eur s des
Travaux des Fortifications (equivalent to our Drawing School in
the Tower).     As he was an excellent draughtsman, his manual
dexterity was alone considered.       He, however, already knew his
own strength, and saw with great indignation the value that was
exclusively bestowed on his mechanical talents.
                                                     " I was tempted,"
said he, ** a long time afterwards, a thousand times, to tear my
drawings, out of spite for the value set on them, just as if I had
been good for nothing else." The director of the school ordered
him to calculate a particular case of defilement, an operation in
which the relief and ground-work of fortifications are to be com
bined together with the smallest possible charge, but so that the
defenders may be sheltered from the shot of the assailants. Monge
abandoned the method hitherto followed, and discovered the first
general geometrical method that was known for this important
                                                             operation.

  operation. — By applying, at different times, his mathematical ta^
  lents to questions of a similar nature, and always generalizing his
  manner of conceiving and working them, he, at last, formed a
 scientific work on the subject; this was his Descriptive Geometry.
 For more than twenty years he found it impossible to show to the
 corps stationed at Mezieres the application of his geometry to
 carpentry. He was more successful in its application to masonry ;
 he studied with great care the methods hitherto employed, and
 simplifying them, he brought them to perfection by his geometry.
      His scientific works caused him to be appointed Acting Pro
 fessor of the Mathematics and Natural Philosophy, in the room
 of Nollet and Bo?sut ; afterwards he was appointed Honorary
 Professor : he then turned his views toward the study of many
 phenomena of nature ; he made numerous experiments upon
 electricity; he explained the phenomena which arise from capil
 lary attraction; was the creator of an ingenious system of meteo
 rology; he. examined the composition. of water, having made that
 great discovery without having any knowledge of the experiments
 which had just before been made by Lavoisier, Laplace, and Ca
 vendish.     He did not content himself with explaining to his pu
 pils in the theatre of the school the theories of science and their
 application : he loved to conduct his disciples wherever the phe
 nomena of nature, or the works of art, could render these ap
plications apparent and interesting.      He communicated his own
 ardour and enthusiasm to his pupils, and changed those obser
vations and researches into desirable pleasures, which would have
appeared to be a disagreeable study in the confinement of a school,
and clothed only in abstract ideas.
     In order to bring Monge to Paris, he was appointed in 1780
assistant to Bossut, Professor of the Hydrodynamic Course, in
stituted by Turgot.      That he might reconcile the duty of the two
places which he now held, he lived six months at Mezieres, and
six months at Paris. The same year he was admitted into the
Academy of Sciences ; and on the death of Bezout in 17S3, he
was chosen to succeed that celebrated examiner of the naval ser
vice.     The Marquis de Castries invited Monge several times to
write another elementary cotirse of the mathematics for the youths
of the naval service, but Monge always refused to comply. " Be
zout," said he, * has left a widow with no other fortune than her
late husband's works, and I do not wish to take away the bread
from the widow of one who has rendered important services to
science and to his country." The only elementary work which
Monge published was-his Traite de Statique; and, with the ex
ception of a few passages in which greater rigour might be de
sirable, the Statique of Monge is a model of logic, clearness, and
simplicity.
                                                                  At

          \
                 Memoir of the late Gaspard Monge.                 177
    At that period when the public distress called forth all the use
ful talents and courage of the superior classes to the assistance
of their country menaced with invasion, Monge was created Mi
nister of the Marine.      He did every thing he could to keep those
men who were distinguished for their merit or bravery in France.
He even descended to entreaties to procure the continuation of
Borda's services, and he had the happiness to succeed. He was
one of the most active men in those scientific employments which
the preservation of the state required. The construction of the new
grinding-machines erected in the powder-mills at Grenoble was
his, and also the drilling-machines constructed upon the barges
of the Seine. He spent his days in giving instructions and su
perintending the workmen, and his nights in writing his treatise
on the casting of artillery, a work designed for the use of direc
tors of foundries, and for workmen.
     It was in his course at the Normal school that he first gave his
lectures of descriptive geometry, the secrets of which he had not
 been able to reveal sooner.       Another establishment, which had
 been originally conceived before the Normal school, but which,
 having had less attention paid to it by the inventors, followed
 it in the order of execution, realized some part of the hopes
 which had been looked for in vain on the establishment of the
 first Encyclopedic school that had been opened in France. Monge
 brought into it his long experience at Mezieres, and joined to
 this new and profound views ; he drew up the plan of study,
 marked out their succession, and proposed scientific methods of
 execution.      Out of four hundred pupils originally placed in the
 Polytechnic school, fifty of the choicest were collected into a pre
 paratory school.      Monge was almost the only one that taught
 these pupils.      He remained the whole of the day among them,
 giving them, in turn, lectures on geometry and analysis; —ex
 horting them, encouraging them, inflaming them, with that ar
 dour, that kindness, that impetuosity of genius, which made him
 explain to these pupils the truths of science with an irresistible
 force and charm.        In the evening, when these labours were fi
 nished, Monge began others of a different kind ; he wrote the
 sketches which were to serve as a text to his next lectures, and
 the following day he was to be found with his pupils at the very
 nioment of their meeting.         The good nature of Monge was
  neither the cold calculation    of the sage, nor even the effect of
  education ; it was a simple benevolence, which              frohi his
                                                       arose^
 happy organization.       He was born to love and to admire.       His
  admiration was excessive, like his love ; in consequence of which
  he did not always keep within the limits that cold and unfeeling
  reason would have prescribed. —As he was the father of his pupils
  in the school, so he was in camp the father of the soldier.

    In traversing Italy to collect the statues, and pictures, thafe^nd
been ceded to France, Mange was struck with the singular en
 trust between the Grecian monuments of the aits, and $h^»e of
 the, Egyptians, transported by Augustus and his successoraJttjVhe
shore* of the Tiber.      The comparative characters of tl»e, ancient
 monuments were the frequent subject of conversation, between
the, conqueror of Italy and the commissary who collected fqt,J)is
country the most precious fruits of victory. Monge conceived
the idea of extending the domain of history beyond the fabulous
 ages of CTeecey of learning with the certainty of a geometer what
Were the labours of the ancient sages of the East ; of discovering
afresh, by the contemplation of their monuments, what had been
the processes of their arts, the usages of their public life, the order
 and the majesty of their feasts, and of their ceremonies, .
    Monge, charged by the General-in-chief to carry to the Direc
 tory the treaty of Campo Formio, was a short time afterwards
 placed in the first rank of the literary men who composed the
 Commission of sciences and arts which were to accompany the
 expedition to Egypt.       He was the first that was appointed Pre
sident of the Institute  of Egypt formed on the model of the French
 Institute. He visited    the  pyramids twice, he saw the obelisk ami
 the grand ruins of Hcliopou's, he studied the remains of antiquity
 scattered round Cairo and Alexandria.         It was during a tedious
 march in the middle of the Desert that he discovered the cause of
 that wonderful phenomenon known by the name of mirage. At
the time of the revolt of Cairo there vvere in the city only a few de
tachments of the troops. The palace of the Institute was guarded
by the members themselves ; and it was proposed to sally out and
join the main guard ; but Monge and Berthollet, considering that
 the palace contained the books, manuscripts, plans, and anti
 quities,, which were the fruits of the expedition, maintained that
 it wa,s the duty of the members to guard this precious deposit,
 ajjd' that they ought to defend that treasure at the hazard of theip
 lives,
     Monge presided in the Commission of the sciences and thearts
in Egypt; he contributed by his counsels to form that wise plan,
and by arranging and proportioning the various parts, endeavour
ed to execute it in the utmost perfection.
    Monge had an admirable method of exposing the most abstract
truths, and of rendering them plain by the language of action.
Nevertheless it was only by combating with nature that.hejWas
able to become an excellent Professor : he spoke with difficulty,
and almost stammered ; the prosody of hk discourse was vicious,
for he lengthened some syllables falsely, and shortened others.
 His physiognomy, naturally calm^ exhibited tha appearance of
meditation ; but as soon as he spoke, he ap|«*urcd quite another

  T.aE    properties which render ivory so desirable a substance for
  the miniature painter and other artists are, the evenness and fine-
  pras'bf its grain, its allowing all water colours laid on its surface to
  be washed out with a soft wet brush, and the facility with which the
  artist may scrape off the colour from any particular part, by means
  of the point of a knife or other convenient instrument, and thus
 Mighten and add brilliancy to the lights in his painting more ex
  peditiously and efficaciously than can be done in any other way.
   "
     The objections to ivory are, its high priceythe impossibility of
  obtaining plates exceeding very moderate dimensions, and the
 .Coarseness of grain in the larger of these ; its liability, wheri .thin,
   i^owarp      changes of the weather, and its property of turning

   hie of receiving, peculiarly adapts it for the reception of the most
   delicate kind of pencil drawings and outline*:-" - • " f'>5 ojiifj.
      An artist of eminence in miniature painting (not a metaiber of
   the Society) stated, that he has frequently used the ivory paper,
   and finds it to be superior to ivory itself in the whiteness of' the
   surface, in the facility with which it receives colour, and in 'the
  greater brilliancy of the colours when laid on, owing to the su
  perior whiteness of the ground.      Colours on ivory are apt to he
  injured by the transudation of the animal oil, a defect which the
  ivory paper is free from.                                       I     old
      Some highly respectable dealers in drawing materials stated,
  that they have had samples of the ivory paper in their possession
  for a considerable time, and that it does not appear to become
  yellow or discoloured by keeping.               '              \ •• s u-
      The valuable properties of the paper appearing thus to be satis
  factorily established, a day was fixed for the candidate to disclose
  his process, and to prepare a specimen of the paper in presence
 of the Committee.'       Accordingly, at the appointed time, Mr.
  Einsle attended, and exhibited before the committee his method
 of preparing the paper: he also gave in a written account of the
 process; from which, and from the information obtained during
 the sitting of the committee, the following account has been
 drawn up :                                                           'f
     Take a quarter of a pound of clean parchment cuttings, and
 put them into a two-quart pan with nearly as much water as it
 will hold ; boil the mixture gently for four or five hours, adding;
 water from time to time to supply the place of that driven off
 by evaporation; then carefully strain the liquor from the dregs
 through a cloth, and when cold it will form a strong jelly, which
 may be called size (No. I).
     Return the dregs of the preceding process into the pan, fill it
 up with water, and again boil it as before for four or five hourej
 the,n strain off the liquor, and call it size (No. 2).

purpose perfectly well, and being much cheaper, are therefore to
 be preferred), wet them on both sides with a soft sponge dipped
in water, and paste them together with the size (No. 2). While
they are still wet, lay them on a table, and place upon thetif*
smooth slab of writing slate, of a size somewhat smaller than thtt1

Excepting             Prussian blue, which we have not as yet been able
to impart to all cloths, the.pru6siate of copper and oxide of iron,
which give colours rather piore solid than brilliant, all the other
colours used in the art of dyeing are drawn from the organic
(vegetable) kingdom, because they are generally easier applied
than<mineral colours, although more or less alterable in the course
of time. , The yellows are more subject to this sort of change-
ableness ; and if the madder colour with the help of mordants
acquires in the end a certain stability, it is always at the expense
of jts first brilliancy.

phuret of arsenic, or realgar*, which gives also to puintiia.jvei'V <
lively permanent colour, when care is taken not to associate                           it

       Jt,is by dissolving this sulphuret of arsenic in ammonia, that
I have obtained a liquor fit for dyeing; but in order that this
solution may be effected easily, it is necessary that the sulphuret
should be in a certain state of division.                To bring it to this state,,
observe the following process :                                            .  ,      uT
       Mix together one part of sulphur, two parts of white oxide, of
arsenic, and. five parts of the potash of commerce; melt the whole
in a crucible till it is nearly red hot, and a yellow mass will be the
result. Dissolve this mass in warm water; then filter the liquor
to separate it from a sediment formed principally of metallic
arsenic in brilliant spangles, and partly of a small quantity of a.
flocculent matter of a chocolate colour, which appears to be a
sub'Sulphuret of arsenic.              Pour into the filtered liquor a quan
tity      of  water ;  next  add    some    dilute sulphuric acid, which will
cause a flocculent precipitate of a superb yellow colour..- This;
precipitate washed on a cloth dissolves with extreme facility in
ammonia, and yields a yellowish liquor, to which an excess of am
monia is added to render it colourless.                    It is in this liquor that
the wool, silk, cotton, or flax to be dyed is plunged ; and it is
more or less diluted with water, according to the different shades
which it is wished to obtain f.               It is necess-iry carefully to avoid
milking use of metallic utensils. When the stuffs are withdrawn
from this bath, they appear colourless ; but insensibly they as
sume a yellow colour as the ammonia evaporates.                           They are ex
posed        to the   open  air in  such    a  manner      that    the whole    of their

 but though the sulphuret of native ar3eni«, which is often mixed with the*
 oxide of arsenic, may not be exempt from danger, the sulphuret of artificial
 arsenic obtained by precipitation and well washed, does not appear to me to
 have any pernicious influence on the animal ©economy. At least I have ad
 ministered it in considerable doses to dogs or cats without their appearing
 incommoded by it.                 , j, , i v .       .  ¦•     .,

 is poured an excess of lime water,' a white precipitate of arseniate of lime is
 produced. This oxidation seems even to keep going on ; and when a solu
 tion sufficiently concentrated of sulphuret of arsenic in ammonia is left to
  stand for some time, small crystals of arseniate of ammonia are deposited :.
  if an ajfid is added, it produces a precipitate of sulphuret of arsenic,,m»sed
  with sulphuret of the oxide of arsenic of a palish yellow.            It may be proper
  therefore not to dissolve the sulphuret of arsenic     '      'in  ammonia,   except m
  proportion as it may be required.

  at least, only    so much   of them would      be visible as ; reflepted the
 :rays into the eye bv their proper aiigles^ we should see no more
  of the glass than that part of it upon which the image' pf the
 «andle was expressed, the moon would be a speck*, the pTanets
  invisible; and, whenever we turned our backs upon the sun, as
  all his light would be reflected from and not into the eye^ we
 should be enveloped in darkness even at noon day.
      " There is no glass or speculum," says Sir Isaac Newton in
  his Treatise on Optics, ** how well soever polished, but, besides
  the light which it refracts or reflects regularly, scatters every
  way irregularly a faint light, by means of which the polished
  surface, wjien illuminated in a dark room by a beam of the sun's
  light, may be easily seen in all positions of the eye."
      Now, without stopping to examine whether the irregulari
 ties on the moon's and the earth's surfaces would not rather
 exhibit a patchwork of light and darkness than a regular diffu
 sion of light, by means of which all objects would be equally vi
 sible, it is easy to show that there are many situations in which
 light is present, when its appearance cannot be explained by.any
 such hypothesis.         The only opening, for instance, in ^ chamber,
 by which light can be admitted, is a window facing the east, and
 the sun is setting in the west.      This window, moreover, overlooks
 the brow of a steep hill which casts a shadow over all the objects
•within the visible horizon.         Now it is impossible that light, un
der these circumstances, can be reflected into the room, because
 ail the sun's light that would strike upon these objects, and might
 be reflected into the room, is intercepted by the hill ; and there
fore it is to some other principle that we must look for an ex
planation of this phsenomenori.
    dt will probably occur to the reader, that this principle may be
found in the reflection of the particles of which the atmosphere
is composed ; and the idea is not unreasonable, because we cap
only account for the blue colour of the heavens bv supposing that
the rays of blue colour are reflected, irr this manner, into the eye
    *  If two lines are subtended from the moon's centre in an angle of half a
degree, they would just touch the surface of the sun, for that, is about the
angle his diameter measures to an inhabitant of the moon. Now, by the
above principle of reflection, all the direct rays of light from the sun that
passed outside of those lines would be reflected outside of the sun, so that
only the three hundred and sixtieth part of the moon's diameter could throw
back any light into the sun j and these rays, instead of meeting in a focus,
would diverge and spread over the whole of the sun's hemisphere. It follows
therefore that not more than the five or six hundredth part of the moon's
diameter could reflect the sun s light into a focus, at the distance this earth
is from the moon ; and consequently, the moon's diameter, instead of mea
suring an angle of fifteen or sixteen minutes, wouhl hardly measure half
a dozen seconds.                                                     .

 cupy    the whole of space, and then (to say nothing of the absur
 dity   of supposing that such a mass of dust could not be felt) they
 would ho longer be transparent ; the beam at furthest could not
 extend a foot beyond the hole through which it entered. Besides,
 if this dust is light enough to be lifted by the air, it may be blown
 away by a puff of wind, and the experiment is easily tried : 'if'
 we can dissipate this light with a pair of bellows, it is the dust
 that produces it; but if we cannot, it must be owing to some other
 cause.                         1 J
     By admitting this property to be in light— and I cannot con
 ceive how it can be disputed — we have a principle by which we
 can account for a great many of the phaenomena of light, which
 cannot satisfactorily be explained in any other way.             By this
 principle   we  .are able to account for    the following phaenomena,
 without supposing anything but what may be easily conceived,
 and is extremely probable; which cannot be said in favour of any
 other hypothesis.
     1. Why light from objects at a distance is always fainter thaji
 when it proceeds from anything that is near.
    2. 'Why the stars are not visible in the day-time, except from
 a mine, or the bottom of a well.
    3. The tail of a comet.
    4. The zodiacal light.
    5. The twilight; and, I believe,
    (i. The aurora borealis.
    1. No one will dispute this proposition, that the rays of light
grow fainter in proportion to the distance they travel.        An apple
in the moon (or anything else occupying no more space) viewed
through a telescope at a focus where parallel rays meet, ought,
by the laws of refraction, to be as much magnified as an apple
in the hand ; and if the rays coming from it were equally strong,
the colours it gave out would be as fresh, and it would be equally
visible. We can only account for the apple not being visible, by
supposing that the rays coming from it lose a great part of their
substance ; and we cannot account for this loss of substance in a
more philosophical way than in the manner I have supposed : if
the rays lost none of their substance, distance cannot account
for their faintnesE; if they do, the Cause of it is exprained.
     It will perhaps be objected to this principle, that if the rays
of light lost so much of theif substance hi travelling the short
distance between the moon          and our earth, before they arrived at

ter to an inhabitant of the moon would onlymeasure half as much
as it docs to us ; and consequently, the same number of rays from
the sun would only occupy half the space that they do here. What
each individual ray therefore loses in substance may be made up
by additional numbers: the apple in the moon, in consequence,
may give out as vivid a colour as the apple in the hand; but the
light from one has only two or three feet to travel, while the ,
other is emitting rays for the space of two hundred and forty
thousand miles before any part of k can cuter the eye. . If we
suppose the fixed stars to be suns of equal magnitude- with our
own, every *tar must send down so much more light upon the
earth than the sun does, in proportion as its angle (which cannot
be measured) is smaller than the sun's angle : if the stars there
fore did not lose a very great proportion of their light in conse
quence of the great distance from us, the light of the sun would
be lost in the greater splendour of the stars' light, and the light
of a single star entering the eye would be intolerable. .
    2. If the sun's primary rays did not emit secondary rays in the
manner I have described, whenever we turned our eyes towards
those parts of the heavens where he was not, the stars would be
visible, because there could be no light enter the eye but what
came from them. The reason then why we do not see the stars
iu the day-time    is,   because these secondary rays going        all direc

distance,  is    fainter than this light,    cannot be distinguished from

 fainter than the light of the stars the sky,

absence of light, but the contrast between those bodies that re
 flect a gTeat deal, and those that reflect only a small quantity of
 it.' A man, on going out of day-light into a dungeon, fancies
 the darkness is absolute, while the persons residing there are
 capable of distinguishing one another very easily: and again, a
 man, on coming out of a dark dungeon, rinds the glare of day- light
 as painful to his eyes as the direct light of the sun is to any one
 else.     I mention this, because, otherwise it might appear to the
 reader a contradiction to suppose that a black spot could be re
 presented on the retina, every part of which is covered with a
coat of light.
     8. Philosophers have taken a great deal of pains to find out
 what the tail of a comet is, and how it is produced ; but not one
of them, that I have ever heard of, has thought it necessary to
explain in what manner this light is brought down to the eye.
Whether a comet's tail be produced by electricity, or any other
cause (unless it be ignited gas, like the flame of a candle, and
then it Would put on a very different form), it is evidently light
passing across the eye, and not towards                   it,
                                                   and can only be visi

the way              by
                showing that the opinions generally entertained con
cerning a comet's tail are erroneous.
     Sir Isaac Newton supposed that the tail was somehow or other
produced             by
                  the heat of the sun that the reason that
                                            ;                    was           it   al
ways turned from the sun was, because the comet passed through
the; sun's atmosphere; and that this ignited vapour, or whatever
it    is,
        was lifted up by the sun's atmosphere in the same manner
as smoke, vapour and other light substances are               our atmo    by

       which hitherto has been unobserved by Philosophers.           189
   sphere. Now, it appears to me a sufficient argument to show the
   fallacy, of this opinion, that a part of the coma or hair of the
   comet, which is evidently of the same nature with the tail, is
  going directly towards the sun in defiance to this rule ; and even
   if we suppose this fluid, or effluvium, on its first issuing from the
   comet, to be too strong to be turned back by the force of the
   sun's atmosphere, we should see the extremities of this coma,
   waving round on each side of the comet, in the same mannejf that
  water does when two streams, meet, neither of which is strong
  enough to turn back the other.        Besides, as the comet's tail is
  often visible when it is outside the earth's orbit, the sun's atmo
  sphere must therefore extend so far ; and there would be a con-i
  stant resistance opposed to the velocity of the earth's annual and
  diurnal motions, which in time must overcome them.            Sir Isaac
  Newton acknowledged this himself, with respect to the comets ;
 and the laws of nature are general ; for he supposed thai the power
  of the sun's attraction would increase so much upon the comet
  in consequence of this loss of velocity, that in time it would be
  drawn in to the sun and serve to supply him with fresh fuel. Now
  as the sun was not meant to be eternal, it is a great deal more
  likely that he was supplied with a sufficient quantity of light and
  heat to last out his time, than that he should have to look for ic
 in the comets; which by the way, as they are not drawn plump
 into the sun, but approach him very gradually if they do at all,
 all that is combustible in them would most likely be consumed;
 and all they could supply him with would be a mass of ether
 which would not burn.
      Those who suppose the tail of a comet to be an electric fluid,
 are bound to show that electricity may be excited in bodies by
 being simply placed in contact with the sun's rays ; or, at least,
 to show in what manner this electric matter may be excited. And
 after all, for what purpose is this waste of fluid ?     I know it will
be answered, To furnish the planets with a constant supply in re
turn for what they are continually- expending.         But have we any
proof that the planets are continually expending it ? If they are,
why is it not visible in the planets, as well as in the comets ?
The comets, at all events, appear to be expending it much faster ;
and it       more likely that they, who are so prodiga), would be in
want of a is.
              supply, than that they should be able to spare any to
the,,plauets, who know so much better how to husband it.
     Upon the principle that God has made nothing in vain,      I   can
not imagine a sufficient cause for the creation of comets, except
by supposing that, like the planets, they are habitable worlds aud
                                                                 ;
then the phenomenon, of their extraordinary light         is  accounted
foria the necessity theyjiave of .possessing, themselves, mo-

         It will be acknowledged by every one, that although the sun -is
    the source of heat, we are chiefly indebted to the atmosphere for
     all the warmth that we enjoy.          Without an atmosphere, or with
    a very thin one,       we   should  be  insensible to the sun's heat, as
    peopk never feet any warmth from a fire till the air in the room
    is well heated by it.        The denser the atmosphere is, that is, the
    more subs tan ee it contains, the more heat it receives and the
    longer it retains it; or the top of a high mountain would not be
    covered with snow when the foot of it was scorched up with heat ;
    and as the weight of atmosphere above presses the particles he-
     low into a smaller space, the density of the atmosphere is always
    proportioned to its depth or quantity.                         .     ¦      c .
         In whatever part of the system therefore the power of the sun's
    heat may be the greatest, whether in Mercury or Jupiter, and
    one seems as probable as the other*, a greater or a less quantity

        Now, though a greater quantity of atmosphere would give te> a
    distant planet all the heat that a nearer one enjoyed, this rule
    will not answer for the comets; because the same quantity of at
    mosphere which would be necessary to give to their inhabitants
    a sufficient quantity of heat, for the purposes of existence when
    they were furthest from the sun, would destroy them when they
   were near.         The only way I can imagine to remedy this incon
   venience is to give to the comets a moderate heat of their own,
                                                                              with
       *   If the sun be a heated body, like red hot iron or a burning coal, it is
   probable that his greatest heat is immediately upon his surface ; but if he
   be an incombustible body sending out rays of light and heat ; (and if it were
   otherwise, we ought to see symptoms of his decay ;) it is then most likely
   that his greatest heat is at a considerable distance beyond his surface, even,
   though the rays ofheat, like the rays of light, lose a great deal of their sub
   stance, or intensity, before they arrive at that point. If we suppose a person
   to be standing on the surface of the sun, all the rays that could possibly
   strike upon him, would be included within his visible horizon (a circumfe
   rence of not more than twenty miles) : if afterwards he was lifted up till his
   eye took in the whole of the suns hemisphere (a circumference of more than
  two millions of miles), he would have two hundred thousand times more rays
  strike upon him than when he was on the sun's surface ; and therefore the
   rays must be two hundred thousand times less heated here than when they
  first issued from the sun, which is not at all likely, before he could suffer'
  any diminution of their heat. Even beyond that point, every time he doubled
  his distance from tiie sun, and at first this distance would be very short, he
  would have twicethe quantity of rays striking upon him ; and until the sun's
  angle became very fine, that is, until he had a gr<esMrsy ts travel in order

 with a   less quantity of atmosphere; and the consequence would
  be, that the heat of the sun would never overpower them, even
  where it was greatest, for want of a denser atmosphere ; and when
  they were furthest from him, his faint heat added to their own
  would give them a healthy temperature, equal to ours in the win
  ter time.    With respect to light, the effect would be precisely
  the same; for though the atmosphere does not magnify the hea
  venly bodies, it produces a great deal of additional light by
  bringing down to us a number of diverging rays, that would
 .otherwise pass away from us, as well as by compressing them, to
  gether and making them brighter.        Now if the comets had no
  light of their own, their day, when at a distance from the sun,
  would either not equal the brightness of our moonlight ; or else,
•
  when they were near, the light of their day would be intolerable.
  By giving them thus a light of their own, equal perhaps to our
  summer twilight, with a small quantity of atmosphere, the ad-
: dition of the sun's light to their own when they are at a distance,
  may about equal our light in winter; and, when they are close to
  him, may be no more than what we have in summer.            By this
  rule, the comets would never be in perfect darkness, their nights
  would be always equal to our twilight ; with this exception, they
  would have the same light and heat that we have, and perhaps
  every other accommodation, whilst their philosophers, in the
  course of their travels, would have opportunities of making dis-
. coveries that must ever be hid from our eyes^                   >>

  coma, which are rays of light proceeding from the comet in the'
 same manner that the rays do from the sun ; with this difference,
  that as the sim is intended to give light and heat to other worlds,
 his rays proceed in all" directions, and consequently exhibit an
 entire body of light wherever he is beheld (see Plate III. fig. 13),'
  while the comets (see fig. 12), as their light is intended only for
 their own use, and as they do not need so much, send out their
                            • ' •
 light only in radii.
     These rays when they first proceed from the comet are close
  together, and to a certain extent (the length of the coma), iiv
  consequence of being so thick, send down a stronger light into
  the eye than the secondary rays of the sun, and for that reason
  are visible: beyond that point, these rays, by diverging as well as
  diminishing, become as faint or fainter than the sun's ; and con
  sequently their light cannot be distinguished from his, except
 that part of it which is directly behind the comet ; for, as the
 sun's rays are intercepted by the comet, the whole space which
 the tail occupies, comparatively speaking, is in darkness, and
  the tail is visible because there is no other light to drown it.
     If we suppose S (fig. 11) to be the sun, and C a cornet^ all
 the rays from the sun will be intercepted by the comet from the
 space between the lines D D ; and in that space, but for the co
 met's rays, there would be total darkness; from D to T the sun's
 rays are gradually admitted ; and his light gets stronger and
  stronger till' we come to T, where none of them are excluded.
     This figure so entirely corresponds with all the phenomena
 relating to the comet, that I do not see how the principle can be
 disputed : it is natural to expect that that part of the comet's
 light which is contrasted with the greatest darkness, would be
 the most conspicuous ; and accordingly we find that the light of a
 comet's tail is brightest between the lines D D, and fades away
 gradually as it approaches towards T.
     The shape of the comet's tail is marked out by the. figure, and
 its appearance exactly corresponds with the radii I have described
 fig. 12.            ;
     As the primary rays of the comets do not proceed in every di
 rection like those of the sun, but are merely radii, by the time
 they reach the earth they are so separated that not more than one
 ray can enter the eye of the same person*.           It is clear then that
 all the light we see in the body of the comets is derived from the
sun, and this will account for the phases they sometimes exhibit.
    The reason why the comets are not so brilliant as the planets,
    * Even to the inhabitant of the comet these rays will be so SGanty that he
never will be able to distinguish them, even in the night-time, further than
as a faint light overspreading the retina, blended with the secondary rays

is not, I imagine, because there is any thing peculiar either in
themselves or their atmospheres, but because they are either
smaller than the planets; or else, are further removed from us.
Mars is not so bright as Jupiter, although he is much nearer, be
cause, as his bulk is smaller, and the sun's rays in consequence
diverge more from him than from Jupiter, he cannot send down
to us so great (compact) a body of light as Jupiter does. If a
beam of the sun's light be let into a dark room and strike upon
a concave mirror ; another beam upon a plain, and a third upon
a convex, mirror; and the persons in the room so disposed that
none of the direct rays will be reflected from either into their
eyes; although I have never tried the experiment, I am fully per
suaded that the concave mirror will give out the greatest body of
light, because the rays of light there will be more compressed
and close together ; and the convex, bv the same rule, will- give
out less than the plain mirror, because the rays striking upon it
diverge more, and are consequently much thinner.             If in the
place of the plain mirror we substitute a very large convex mirror,
the large mirror will give out a greater body of light from that
part of it on which the rays strike than the small, because its
surface approaches nearer to the plain, and its rays in conse
quence do not diverge so much.         Apply this rule to the heavenly
bodies, and we can easily account for their different degrees of
 brightness. I have never seen any comet whose disk would mea
 sure so great an angle as that of Venus; and therefore they must
 either have been further off, or their bulk must have been smaller;
 and in either case they could not give out so great a body of
light.         _
   There is one other phenomenon in the comet which      notice,   I
because it has excited the curiosity of a great many, although
my principle will not be any way affected whether I rightly ac
count for it or not.    The comet's tail sometimes, though not al
ways, appears    to be a little curved, and the reason for         it,

  more nor less than the sun's secondary rays sending light down
  into the eye.      I have seen it frequently in the East Indies ; and
  the appearance it puts on is exactly what I should have antici
  pated, had I conceived my principle before I saw it.           It resem
  bles very much the stars in the Milky Way, and in the centre
  near the horizon is very nearly as bright; it is broad at the base,
  pointed like a leaf, and fades away imperceptibly at the edges.
  This light always marks the track of the sun, and therefore is
 evidently derived from him ; and that the sun may send his light
  down in this way is proved by the moon, a fainter light, doing
 the same thing. The zodiacal light, the tail of a comet, and
 the stars in the Milky Way are very nearly eclipsed by the
  greater splendour of the moon's light, though to look at either of
 these, we must turn our back towards her; and as her direct
  light in this situation cannot enter the eye, it is impossi
 ble to account for this but by supposing that her secondary rays
cover the retina with as bright a light as these phenomena would
otherwise exhibit.        This phenomenon cannot in any way be ac
 counted for by supposing that it has anything to do with the sun's
 atmosphere, for, if the sun's atmosphere did extend so far, it
 would no longer be the sun's atmosphere : the only reason why
 our own atmosphere, water, stones, and other loose bodies do
 not   fly off into the sun,      because the earth's attraction, which
                                 is
is   close,     stronger than the sun's, which
               is                                      at

 therefore,    ifthe sun's atmosphere did come so near to the eacth,
 the earth's attraction would seize hold of          great part of

                                                                that owing
to the greater density of the atmosphere in our climate, the sun's
rays are refracted and pressed closer together, and consequently
send down       a greater body of light     and this
                                            ;             the reason why
                                                           is
the figure of the twilight        not so perfect as that of the zodiacal
                                  is
light. Although the refraction of the atmosphere will account
for the greater light of the twilight and the flatness of its figure,
we cannot upon that principle account for its light being brought
into the eye because,
                    ;          the primary rays of the sun were still
                               if
refracted into the eye, all the consequence would be, that the sun
would appear to rise higher and be longer in setting; for upon
no principle of refraction can we account for the sun's rays di
verging upward being brought down               refraction into the eye,
                                                 by
without supposing that those that were not directed so high
                                                                          would

  would be refracted down to our feet; and therefore the sun's rays
   could not occupy a greater space upon the retina after sunset thaii
  they did before, and that is no larger than the angle of his dia
  meter — half a degree.
      Those who argue that the sun's diverging rays, after he has
  set, and the atmosphere, inconsequence of increased cold, be
  come denser, are reflected into the eye from all parts of the hea
  vens, by the particles of air, are bound to show in what manner
  the rays of blue colour are brought into the eye ; for, if the blue
  colour of the heavens be owing to the particles of air reflecting
  the blue rays in greater abundance than all the rest, an increased
  quantity of light would only produce a more intense blue ; and
  there is no other way in which the twilight can be produced, but
 in the manner I have supposed.
     In the summer the sun lingers a long while on the horizon
 before he sets, and the twilight is very full; whereas in the win
 ter he sets almost immediately, and the twilight is hardly per
 ceptible; and as the twilight is owing to the density of the at
 mosphere, and this density is increased by cold, it will perhaps
 occur to the reader to demand why the twilight is not stronger
 in winter than in summer. To this I answer, That in the sum
 mer the sun is very far to the northward, and after he has set, his
 light, to come to us, passes in great measure through that part
 of the atmosphere which is densest and refracts light the most;
and accordingly, we find that the twilight is always stronger on
 the north than the west side of him; and while it extends but a
very little way towards the west, it stretches over the whole of
the north part of the horizon.      In winter, on the contrary, the
sun's rays at setting, in order to come to us, must pass through
the torrid zone, where the atmosphere is rarest and refracts light
the least ; and not only this, but immediately after he has set,
his rays, to come to us, must travel a hundred degrees of latitude

     6. I have never had the good fortune to witness any of the
phamomena of the aurora borealis, and the idea my imagination
has formed of it from description may be very different to what it
is in reality. From all accounts however it appears, in the ground
work at least, to bear a very close resemblance to the twilight,
jso much so that it is sometimes called the northern twilight;
 and if I could but satisfactorily account for the crackling noise
that is sometimes heard with     it,

  I    do not know whether any one has ever yet attempted to ex
 plain the cause of the refracting power of the atmosphere but                      ;         it

 Light was supposed                by

 sophers, to partake of the nature of matter, and therefore should
 be subject to the laws of attraction as well as all other matter.
 The power of attraction             always in proportion to the velocity
                                             is

any refracting power in the atmosphere, but because, by dimi"
nishing the velocity of light in a greater degree, it increases the
power of the earth's attraction.                                    . •
    If we admit this hypothesis, and it is the only one that will
account for the refraction of the atmosphere, the crackling of the
aurora borealis is explained in the rays of light forcing their way
against the resistance of the atmosphere, and the crackling of
electricity may be owing to the same cause.                 If it be objected
that, as light is constantly passing through the air, and the air as
constantly resisting               it,
                             this noise ought to be heard at all times                                      ;

  It    was remarked in Captain Ross's voyage to discover the
north-west passage, that the motion of a field of ice very fre
quently produced the strangest optical delusions; that the atmo
sphere, in consequence, becoming suddenly condensed, the sur
rounding objects would in           moment be magnified three or four
                                                   a
times beyond their ordinary size, and, on its going off, would as
suddenly resume their former shape.            Now the very same prin
ciple that will account for this phenomenon will also explain the
motion of the aurora borealis. In consequence of the motion of
an iceberg, the atmosphere may become more condensed and the                           ;
rays of light, which before were too faint to be perceived, will be

XXVIII. An     Account of a Peach Tree produced from the Seed
  of the Almond   Tree; with some Observations on the'Origin of
  the Peach Tree.   By Thomas Andrew Knight, Esq. F.R. S.
  F.L.S. &fc. President*.
X beg   leave to send to the Society a couple of peaches, of a new
variety; not, however, on account of any merits which I suppose
the variety to possess, but solely on account          of the singularity of
its origin, it being the offspring of a sweet          almond and of the
pollen only of a peach.   The tree produced             six peaches besides
those I have sent you ; three of which cleft     open, like almonds,
when nearly ripe, whilst the others retained the form and charac
ter of peaches, and the flesh of all was perfectly soft and melting,
One of these was considerably larger than the largest you receive,
having measured eight inches in circumference ; and as the tree
grew in a pot, which did not contain a square foot of mould, and
the first fruit of every seedling tree has proved, in all my experi
ments, to be of much less size than its subsequent produce, I
 imagine that the future fruit of this variety will a good deal ex
ceed the bulk indicated by the present sample.
    The general character and quality of the fruit I send, and the
diminished size of its stone, comparatively with that of the al
mond, will, I fear, induce the Society to apprehend some error
 in the experiment : but I beg to assure them that none can pos
 sibly have occurred ; and that the result was as unexpected by
me as it would have been by them; for I did not entertain the
 slightest hope that a tree capable of producing a melting peach
could have been, by any means, obtained immediately from an
 almond. I had, however, long before entertained an opinion, that
the common almond and the peach tree constituted only a single
 species, and that the almond might, by proper culture, through
 many successive generations, be ultimately converted into a peach
 or nectarine.
    Many circumstances in the ancient history of the peach con
joined to lead me to this conclusion.     It does not appear to have
 been known in Europe till about the reign of the Emperor Clau
                                                     j by

Yet it could not    have existed in Persia a few centuries previous
 to the period of its appearance in Europe, or the Greeks must
necessarily have known           it,
                                  as much intercourse constantly took
place between the Asiatic Greeks and the Persians, and the kings
of Persia usually entertained Greek physicians, who were botanists,
in their court.    The tuberes of Pliny also appear to have been
southing intermediate between the almond and peach; for he
states the trees which produced this fruit to have been propagated
by   being grafted upon plum stocks, and to have blossomed later
than the apricot       and that the fruit itself was covered thickly
                        ;
with down, like the quince.
    The tuberes must, therefore, conceive, have been swollen

to have been very inconsiderable)          and Du Haniel has given an

   The bitterness in this case,          conclude, can only arise from

constitutions, some explanation appears to be given of the cause
why the peach was reported to possess deleterious qualities, when
it first came from Persia into the Roman empire.
   The fact,   ifever so decisively established, of the specific iden
tity of the peach and almond,           probably of little importance to

      The two peaches alluded to in this paper were of a perfectly
  globular form, the largest exceeding seven inches in circumference.
 The skin, which was covered with a rather thick down, was of a
 delicate yellow, tinted on the sunny side with pale red, and beau
 tifully marbled with a deeper shade of the same colour.           The
Jlesh was of a pleasant pale citron tint, and round the stone of
 a very brilliant carmine red ; it was perfectly melting, sweet, and
 very juicy, though not very high flavoured, but it had suffered in
  this quality by the injury sustained in carriage.      The stone was
  large in proportion to the fruit, nearly round, with a small point
  at the top, very rugged, and had much of the same kind of farina
 on its surface as is usually seen on that of the almond in its fresh
  state; it also separated very clearly from the flesh, some short
  filaments only adhering to it.
  XXIX.      Address  of the Astronomical   Society of London   : esta
                        blished February 8, 1820.
 In     a country like Great Britain,, in which the sciences in general
 are    diligently cultivated, and Astronomy in particular has made
 extensive progress and attracted a large share of attention, it
 must seem strange that no Society should exist peculiarly devoted
 to the cultivation of this science ; and that (while chemistry,
 mineralogy, geology, natural history, and many other important
 departments both of science and of art are promoted by associated
 bodies, which direct, while they stimulate, the highest exertion
 of individual talent) Astronomy, the sublimest branch of human
 knowledge, has remained up to the present time unassisted by that
 most powerful aid ; and has relied for its advancement on the la
 bours of insulated and independent individuals.
      It may be conceived by some, that astronomy stands less in
 need of assistance of this kind than any other of the sciences ;
 and that, in the state of perfection which its physical theory has
 already reached, its ulterior progress may safely be intrusted to
 individual zeal, and to the great national establishment exclusively
 appropriated to celestial observations ; or, at all events, to those
 public institutions and academies in all civilized nations, whose
 object is the general cultivation of the mathematical and physical
 sciences.     It may therefore be necessary to state the useful ob
jects which may bo accomplished, and the impediments which
 may be removed, by the formation of a Society devoted solely to
 the encouragement and promotion of astronomy.
                                                                 Owing

202        Address   of the Astronomical Society of London,
   Owing to the great perfection which the construction of opti»
cal instruments has attained in England, and the taste for sci
entific research universally prevalent, there have arisen in various
parts of the kingdom a number of private and public observa^
tories, in which the celestial phenomena are watched, and re
gistered with assiduity and accuracy, by men whose leisure and
talents peculiarly adapt them for such pursuits : while others,
with a less splendid establishment, but by the sacrifice of more
valuable time, pursue the same end with equal zeal and perse
verance.      Considerable collections of valuable observations have
thus originated 5 by far the greater part of which, however, owing
to the expense and difficulty of publication and various other
causes, must inevitably perish, or at least remain buried in ob
scurity, and be lost to all useful purposes j unless collected and
brought together by the establishment of a common centre of
communication and classification, to which they may respectively
be imparted.
   This great desideratum, it is presumed, will be attained by a
Society founded on the model of other scientific institutions, havT
ing for one of its objects the formation of a collection or deposit
of manuscript observations, &c. open at all times to inspection ;
to which the industrious observer may consign the result of his
labours, with the certainty of their finding a place, among the
materials of knowledge so amassed, exactly proportioned to their
intrinsic value. At the same time it will thus be rendered prac
ticable to form a connected series from a mass of detached and
incomplete fragments ; and the society will render a valuable
service to science, by publishing, from time to time, from this
collection, such communications or digests as seem calculated,
by their nature and accuracy, either to supply deficiencies, or to
afford useful materials to the theoretical astronomer.
   It vvill also be an object worthy of the society, to promote an
examination of the heavens in minute detail ; by parcelling them
put, in portions of a very moderate extent, among those mem
bers who may find leisure and inclination to direct their atten
tion more peculiarly and constantly to such portions (selection
being made as to those which may best accord with the situation
pt their observatories and their own general convenience); there
by to ascertain the places, and if possible the proper motions, of
all the objects, large or minute, which may fall within their re
spective limits ; and to pass them continually in review, so that
110 new celestial body of a cometary or planetary nature, travers
ing their boundaries, may escape detection.        For, amongst the
vast multitude of similar objects which are«cattered over the wide
expanse of the heavens, and which eqaally solicit and distract the

                  established   Felruary 20, 1820.           -         203
attention of the insulated observer, no one of them in particular
 can be expected to undergo any very rigorous examination, unless
distinguished by magnitude or some peculiarity of appearance,
    Tfee Jteiowk'dge of our own peculiar system, and that more ex*>
tended branch of astronomical science to which the name Cos
mology is best adapted, may alike be benefited by this division
of labour, and systematic mode of examination.            In the plane
 tary system, a wide field of investigation has of late been opened
 by the discovery of some links in the chain of connexion which no
 doubt exists between bodies of a eometary and planetary nature.
 And it is possible that some bodies, of a nature altogether new,
 and whose discovery may tend in future to disclose important "se
 crets in the system of the universe, may be concealed under the'
 appearance of minute stars, no way distinguishable from others
 of a less interesting character, but by the test of careful and often
 repeated observations.       Indeed it is worthy of notice, that, of
 the five small bodies lately ascertained to be permanent members
 of our system, four were discovered in the short space of seven
 years, by the partial adoption, on the continent, of this very
 plan of separate examination ; which seems to have been first
 suggested by the late Rev. F. Wollaston.        This diligent astrono
 mer, in a paper published in the Philosophical Transactions for
  1784, thus remarks: " The first idea which occurred to me was
 to make a proposal to astronomers in general, that each should
 undertake a striet examination of a certain district in the heavens;
 and not only by a re- examination of the catalogues hitherto pub
 lished, but by taking the right ascension and declination of every
 star in their several allotments, to frame an exact map of      it,
                                                                   with
 a corresponding catalogue and to communicate their observa
                             ;
 tions to one common centre.         This is what   Ishould be glad to
 see begun.       Every astronomer must wish it, and therefore every
 one should be ready to take his share in it."       In fact, Mr. Wol*
 laston not only proposed the plan, but, as far as an individual
 could do so, put it   in  execution,by   undertaking the examination
 of the circumpolar regions himself.
     Beyond the limits however of our own system, all at present            is
  obscurity.     Some vast and general views on the construction of
 the heavens, and the laws which may regulate the formation and
 motions of sidereal systems, have,       it    true, been struck out
                                               is                           ;
 but,  like  the  theories of the  earth  which  have so long occupied
 the speculations of geologists, they remain to be supported or
 refuted by the slow accumulation of a mass of facts and   :           it   is
  here, as in the science just alluded to, that the advantages of
                                                                       •<
  associated labour will appear more eminently conspicuous.
     One of the first great steps towards an accurate knowledge of
  the construction of the heavens,   is   an acquaintance with the in
                                                                dividual

 204         Address  of the Astronomical    Society  of London,
 dividual objects they present : in other words, the formation of
 a complete catalogue of stars and of other bodies, upon a scale
 infinitely more extensive than any that has yet been undertaken;
 and that shall comprehend the most minute objects visible in
 good astronomical telescopes.        To form such a catalogue, how
 ever, is an undertaking of such overwhelming labour, as to defy
 the utmost exertions of individual industry.        Is is a task which,
 to be accomplished, must be divided among numbers; but so
 divided as to preserve a perfect unity of design, and prevent the
 loss of labour which must result from several observers working
 at once on the same region, while others are left unexamined.
 The idea now understood to be entertained of establishing an
 observatory at the southern extremity of Africa, under the au
  spices of the Admiralty, may serve to show the general sense
 entertained of the importance of this subject, and the necessity
 of giving every possible perfection to our catalogue of the fixed
 stars.     Deeply impressed also with the importance of this task,
  and fully aware of its difficulty, the Astronomical Society might
 call upon the observers of Europe and of the world to lend their
  aid in its prosecution.     Should similar institutions be formed in
 other countries, the Astronomical Society (rejecting all views but
  that of benefiting science) might profess themselves ready and
  desirous to divide at once the labour and the glory of this Her
  culean attempt, and to act in concert together in such manner
  as should be judged most conducive to the end in view.
     Another beneficial result to be expected from this institution
  as the diffusion of a spirit of inquiry in practical astronomy;   and,
  as a necessary consequence, a corresponding diffusion of a general
 knowledge of the mode of performing and computing astrono
  mical and geodesical observations, and of the use of instruments;
  especially such as are likely to be found in the hands of travellers,
'nautical men, and others who may be placed in interesting situ
  ations in remote parts of the world.       Widely scattered as Eng
  lishmen are, over the surface of the globe, the advantages which
  might accrue to science from a more general diffusion of such
  knowledge, are incalculable : yet it is painful to reflect in how
  few cases, comparatively, among the numbers of our countrymen
  whose prospects in life lead them to distant climates, the actual
  use of even the simplest astronomical instruments and tables has
  formed a part of their education or st.udy.        In a national point
  of view, every thing which may tend to diffuse a knowledge of
  practical astronomy is obviously of the utmost importance, on
  account of its application to nautical purposes.        Besides which,
  the difficulty of finding practical observers calculated to fill situ
  ations as assistants in observatories, in expeditions of discovery,

     It is almost unnecessary to enumerate the advantages likely to
 accrue from the encouragement which an Astronomical Society
 may hold out: but among others may be mentioned the perfect
 ing of our knowledge of the latitudes and longitudes of places in
 every region of the globe; the improvement of the lunar theory,
 and that of the figure of the earth, by occultations, appulses, and
 eclipses simultaneonsly observed in different situations ; the ad
 vancement of our knowledge of the laws of atmospherical refrac
 tion in different climates, by corresponding observations of the
 fixed stars ; the means of determining more .correctly the orbits
 of comets by observations made in the most distant parts of the
 world: and in general, the frequent opportunities, afforded to a
 society holding extensive correspondence, of amassing materials
 which (though separately of small importance) may by their union
 become not only interesting at the present time, but also valua
 ble as subjects of reference in future.
     By means of corresponding members, or associates, in distant
 countries, the society may hope to unite the labours of foreign
 observers with their own ; and by thus establishing communica
 tions with eminent astronomers and institutions in all parts of the
 world, to obtain the earliest intelligence of new discoveries or
 improvements; which it may, perhaps, be desirable to circulate
  among such of its members as may profess themselves anxious to
  receive it, without loss of time.                             • •

     The circulation also of notices of remarkable celestial phe
  nomena about to happen, (with the view of drawing the atten
  tion of observers to points which may serve important purposes
  in the determination of elements or coefficients) may form an
  other, and perhaps not the least interesting object of the society.
  To have the same phenomena watched for by many observers, in
  a climate so uncertain as our own, is the only sure way of having
  them observed by some : and moreover, the attention of an as
  tronomer may frequently be aroused by a formal notice, especially
  when accompanied with directions for observing the phenomenon
  in the most effective way, when probably the mere ordinary men
  tion of it in an ephemeris might fail to attract his observation.

        One of the collateral   advantages of a society including many
   practical   astronomers    among its members, (but which will op-
   pear   of no  small  importance to those who possess good instru
   ments) will    be  the   mutual understanding which will be pro
   pagated among amateur astronomers, by frequent meetings and
   discussion, as to the relative merits of their instruments ; and as
   to the talents and ingenuity of the various artists both of our own
   and of foreign nations: not to mention the emulation which this
•  must naturally excite to possess the best instruments ; and the
   consequent tendency of such discussion towards a farther im
    provement in. their construction, or to the discovery of new ones.
    Well-made instruments will thus unavoidably acquire a reputa
   tion, not merely among a few eminently skilful observers in Bri
   tain, but throughout the whole astronomical world : and indivi
    duals, who have at great expense and trouble amassed a collec
    tion of valuable ones, will thus be spared the mortification of
    knowing that they may at some future time be put up to sale and
   ,be disposed of for a half or a third of their value, for want of
   their merits being known j a consideration which probably has
   some weight with those who may be collecting instruments at an
    advanced period of their life.
        As the extent of the funds of the society must depend on the
    number of its members, it is impossible to conjecture at present
  .how far its views respecting their application may extend.        Be
   sides the ordinary expenses attending an institution of this nature,
   the occasional or annual publication of communicated observa
    tions; — the payment of computers employed in the reduction
  .and arrangement of observations, or in computing the orbits of
   new planets, comets, or other interesting bodies ; — the formation
   of an extensive astronomicaHibrary,      not only of manuscript but
   also of printed books ;    — and perhaps, at some future period, the
   proposal of prizes for the encouragement of particular depart
   ments of the science, either theoretical or practical ; or for the
   improvement of astronomical instruments, or tables, may be men
   tioned as worthy objects on which they may be bestowed.
        §uch are the principal considerations which have actuated a
   number of individuals to form themselves into a Society under
   the name of the Astronomical Society of London, and to give
   this publicity to their determination, with a view of inviting others
    to unite in the prosecution of their plans.      They have at their
   very   commencement       met with the most nattering success, which
   induces them to hope that, in a short time, every assiduous cul
    tivator of the science will be found to have added his name to the
    list of members.

  XXX. On       the Method   of extracting Iodine from Kelp.          By
                            M.  Van Mons*.
 Those chemists who have directed their attention tp a method
 for obtaining iodine by the decomposition of the iodate of potash
 existing in kelp, have proposed several methods for the purpose.
  Some recommend to separate from the lye of the kelp all the
  crystallizable salts, and to treat the mother-water with sulphu
 ric acid ; —others advise that the sub-carbonate of soda alone
 should be separated, and the liquid or the remaining salts treated
 with sulphuric acid; — a third class suggest methods more or less
 complicated, among which they cite as advantageous the addition
 of the superoxide of manganese, or the hypo-superoxide of lead;
 —and lastly, it has been prescribed to separate the iodate from
 the other salts, by taking advantage of its solubility in alcohol.
     Each of these processes has its inconveniences.          In adopting
 the first, there is a risk of making the sulphuric acid act on the
 mother water, which often contains no more than one atom of
 salt to furnish the iodine. We have experienced this, and have re
 marked, that from the moment that the greater part of the salts
 became separated by crystallization,        and that the lye began to
 thicken, when it was desired to carry the separation further, the
 salt containing the iodic acid was at the same time carried away^
 Already even more or less of it had passed with the first crystals ;
 so that, when the mother-water contained no more crystallizable
 salts, there ordinarily remained no more iodate,

208         On  the  Method of extracting Iodine from Kelp.
    The second process is attended with the inconvenience of Sub
jecting a large mass of salt to the decomposing action of sulphu
ric acid, before the latter can begin to operate upon the iodate ;
Jbjr it is not till after the other salts, and especially the muriates,
 are decomposed, that an excess of sulphuric acid attacks the
iodate of potash, and separates from it the alkali, which at the
same instant oxygenizes itself at the expense of a portion 6f the
same acid.       If in place of muria'tes the solution contains nitrates,
 the decomposition of the latter suffices to oxygenate the iodic
 Jicid, on account of the facility with which the nitric acid suscep
 tible of suboxygenation gives forth its oxygen.          By extracting
from the lye nothing but the sub-carbonate of soda, we obtain
what is of little or no use; for the different sodas of Normandy
¦with which we have made experiments, do not even contain as
 much of this salt as will produce a change in the tincture of cur
 cuma.      How, besides, can it be conceived that there exists at
 the same time in a lye a free alkali and deliquescent muriates ?
 The express condition that the muriates shall be decomposed
 previous to the iodate, occasions an excessive expenditure of acid,
 besides the inconvenience of prolonging the operation, and al
 lowing much iodine to-escape,- if the precaution is neglected of
 not allowing the matter to get into ebullition before the greater
                                                                        > '*
 part of the muriatic acid is expelled.
     The process in which they mingle the superoxide of manganese
 with the residue is scarcely any better ; it occasions a production
 of chlorine which contains the iodine in combination. The addi
 tion of the superoxide may be more or less permitted, where iodate
 exempt from muriate is made use of ; the superoxide may then
 serve rather to regenerate the sulphuric acid by the oxygenation
  of the sulphurous acid, than to oxygenate the iodic acid. This
  addition, taking care not to add at once all the sulphuric acid,
 may further have the effect of facilitating the separation of the
 muriatic acid, by converting it into chlorine ; but the presence
  of chlorine produces such a disposition to the formation of iodine,
  and the affinity between the two bodies is so manifest, that a
                                                                 '
 very great loss of iodine must be expected.                   »
     We shall not say any thing of the process by which the iodate
  of potash is isolated by means of alcohol : it requires that the
  muriates of lime and magnesia contained in the lye should be
  previously decomposed by the subcarbonate of potash; otherwise
  these muriates, being soluble in alcohol, would become confound-
 •ed with the iodine.      Besides, this process can only be employed
 in demonstrations.
     Our results are infinitely more advantageous.        We reduce the
  rough kelp   into   powder,  and  pass  it through a hair-sieve ; when
  it is not dry enough to be submitted to that pulverization, we
                                                                   . pound

    pound it well in a mortar with water, and make it boil for half
    au hoflr, stirring it continually with an iron spatula ; we then
   filter the mixture and set it to evaporate, taking care to lift up
    with a skimmer the salts, a certain quantity of which the hot lye
   allows to be deposited.           If evaporated till crystalization takes
   place by cooling, the salts become confounded in the crystalliza
   tion, and a great deal of iodate remains adhering to the crystals.
       The crystals, however weak may have been the lye in which
   they are formed, are always impregnated with iodate, which is
  in a state of such strong combination, that these crystals, although
  perfectly dried, redden strongiy with sulphuric acid.                 It is bet
  ter, therefore, to allow the salt to be deposited in the hot lye,
  where the muriates are not much more soluble than in the cold
  lye, where the iodate remains a much longer time in solution.
  The salt on being separated from the lye, and while it is still
  hot, should be spread on a hair-sieve, where it may dry itself.
  When about half of the salt has been dried, it is put aside in or
  der to be afterwards pulverised and washed.                The evaporation is
  continued with the same precaution — that is to say, removing the
  salt in proportion as the crystals are formed, until it ceases to
 form any more. The lye is then united with the drain water, and
 evaporated to dryness.          A single lixiviation will then suffice to
 exhaust the kelp of its salt.
      We would advise that this salt should not be thrown away, as
 there still adheres to it a good deal of iodate, until it has been
 passed through a hot funnel.            As the first crystallizations of this
 salt redden with sulphuric acid as much as the last, they equally
 contain iodate, which it is necessary to separate.                For this pur
 pose   the  salt is well  shaken    in large    glass  funnels  ;  and by little
 and little warm water is passed though               it,

      The residue of the lye evaporated to dryness gets soon damp

moderate, ought      not  to be carried    to that   degree of ebullition that
no more muriatic acid      is  seen to pass,     otherwise    the iodine, which
at that temperature instantly evaporates, may be in part dissolved
by   that acid.
    Vol. 55. No. 263. March 1820.                           O              After

210         On the Method     of extracting Iodine from Kelp.
     After iodine    has ceased to be disengaged, in order to try if the
 residue is exhausted, a new quantity of sulphuric acid is poured
 qpon it while it is still hot ; if at the moment of contact a white
.vapour without any tinge of red arises, it is a proof that the iodine
 is all disengaged. This white vapour is produced by an acid sub
 stance, in which we have recognised the following properties : It
 does not dissolve iodine ; it possesses a flavour similar to that of
 dilute sulphuric acid ; it gives no. precipitate with muriate of ba-
 rytes, but with nitrate of silver and the oxymuriate of mercury it
 does (the latter precipitate of a pale red colour) ; and fills the at
 mosphere with the odour of chlorine. We purpose afterwards to
 examine this product.
      The iodine may be disengaged at the same time with the mu
 riatic acid, and as soon as that acid, by applying at once a boiling
 heat. - The vapours which appear are violet, and the little mu
  riatic acid which passes at the same time is not particularly co
  loured.      It has been said, that at the degree of heat at which
  iodine can be produced, the action of the sulphuric acid tends
  rather to produce this body than to disengage the muriatic acid.
  It is true that the strongest affinity is then in favour of the mu
  riates,, and that the weakest acids, perhaps even sulphurous acid,
  maydecompose the oxygenated iodates. The operation, whatever
   may be the quantity of salt, is finished in an hour at the most.
   The saline residue, in an experiment which had been interrupted
   after the disengagement of iodine, was composed in its liquid
   part, which was decanted warm, of super-sulphate of soda and
   super-sulphate of potash, besides free sulphuric acid ; the re-
  maining'part, concrete when warm, consisted of muriate of potash
   and muriate of soda.        This proves that muriatic acid had con
   curred in the decomposition of the oxygenated iodate of potash.
   It appeared singular that acidulated sulphates and free sulphuric
   a,cid had been able to exist together, and to be heated to ebul
   lition, without being mutually decomposed. After having distin
   guished the different salts, we joined them to the mother-waters,
    and distilled the mixture to dryness. A great deal of muriatic acid
   passed, and there only remained neutral sulphates of potash and
    soda. .
       In a similar experiment, but which was not interrupted after
    the disengagement of the iodine, a great deal of muriatic acid
    passed at the distillation.     This acid was absolutely colourless,
    and almost without odour. However, a good deal of muriate of
    iron was found in the residue, and the acid obtained had enough
    of concentration to fume if it had been otherwise prepared.
       We made the experiment of washing wit,h a little water the
    rough kelp finely pulverised. The solution contained more iodate
    and less of other salts than the lye made in a large quantity of
                                                                  water j

water ; but there remained after this mode of extraction, still too
 much iodate in the residue to make it of advantage to follow it.
   . If the separation of the crystallizable    salts is pushed too far,
 and especially if it is sought to obtain them by the recooling of
 the he, nothing, as we have said before, will be preserved but a
 mother-water exhausted of iodate, and which will not yield the
 least part of iodine. It is from not finding iodine in the mother-
 water of a soda known to contain it, that we have thought of
  seeking for it in the crystallized salt.
     It has been stated that, from Scotch kelp, iodate of soda as
 well as iodate of potash may be extracted.           That kelp cannot
therefore reckon amongst its salts' either the sulphate or muriate
of potash, which would be decomposed by the iodic acid of the
iodate of soda, although there may be folmd in the same lye
the sulphate of soda and the muriate of potash.            It is impossi
ble, however, to admit, as some authors have done, the exist
ence of these different salts with the iodates of magnesia and of
lime.
     The soda with which we have experimented was of the species
 known in commerce under the name of common soda of Fecamp.
 The pieces recently broken presented in their fracture a blueish
gray colour; they were besprinkled with opaque white crystalline
knots ; the parts which had been exposed to the contact of the
air were humid, of a black colour, and contained also knots of
salt. Their lye gave about a fourth of their weight in saline pro
ducts, but no sub-carbonate of soda.         The water of a first cold
washing     contained muriate   of lime, and  the lye obtained by boil
ing contained muriate of magnesia.         The former muriate was no
longer to be found in the lye, having been decomposed by the
sulphate of soda.     Common soda preserved for thirty years, and
which after being damped was completely dried, did not yield less
iodine than kelp newly bought.        In Belgium, where considerable
use is made of kelp for the fabrication of common glass, it is'
found to give a very good frit, and that the salts supply to that'
what it wants of alkali; the solution of its residue after the sepa
ration of the iodine, leaving on the filter a good deal of silex. The
alkali may be considered as being partly in the state of liquid
silicate ; which explains how its lye in the neutral alkali saturates'
a certain quantity of acid.
     We have tried to decompose at the outset the muriatic salts,
by pouring into the lye a quantity of sulphuric acid — at first, be
cause that method accelerated the operation — afterwards, because
we found that in operating with a salt which is not very dry, or
which has got moist in the air, the muriatic acid which passes,
and the expulsion of which demands a greater degree of heat, is
always much coloured with iodine ; but we have in experiments

      In following our process, no more need at first be
                                                              incorporated
  than the, sulphuric acid indispensable for the decomposition 8f
  muriates; and after that decomposition, the remainder of the acid
  may be added by spreading it uniformly over the whole ma89°of
  salt ; but this precaution is not necessary when the proce^'ts
  followed throughout in the way which we have pointed out.',               ,
      The separation of the salts may be also attempted by subject
  ing their mixture in a dry state to a heat capable only of liqui
  fying the iodatc of potash, and the sulphate of soda ; the super
  natant liquid will cover two muriates, and the sulphate of potash
  not melted.
     We expected to have found the means of separating the lo-
  date with the muriatic acid, when we had poured the ammonui-
  cal liquid on the acid, which passed red at the distillation. There
 was not at first any mixture between the two liquids; but oh
 coming in contact they were observed to separate, and "cry
 stallize in irregularly faced pyramids with their base ttirned
 upwards.       The crystals were very numerous.             We expected
 that by agitation they would have fallen to the bottom of the li
 quid, but it made them disappear; some new alkali reproduced
 them, and that until the ammonia was in excess ; — the colour of
 the acid, far from disappearing, became livelier.           We repeat*^
 this experiment several times, and always with the same result/.
 We made the experiment each time with three or four ounces of
 liquid. Thus, in that operation which without contradiction had
 been the simplest and the easiest, our attempt was unfortunately
 abortive.
     We made an experiment on the volatility of iodine in air : five
 grains of crystal of that substance were placed in the morning
 oti'the reverse of a cup ; — towards evening a great part had been
 already dissipated ; and next morning the whole had disappeared.
The temperature of the apartment varied from 8° to 10° R.j'&nd*
the odour of chlorine continued for several days.
    Two grains of iodine placed in the palm of the hand, dissi
pated in less than twelve minutes; the spot remained much
longer.      It was when at another time making the same experi'-'
ment, with the view of ascertaining the identity of the Odour of 1
iodine with thatof chlorine, that we discovered the property which
the former substance has of colouring starch blue.               A napldti
passed through     starch,   with which   we  wiped   our hands,  was1 'Co
vered with large blue spots, which by little and little became'
violet, and ultimately disappeared.          Since then we have em
ployed as a reagent for iodine small strips of cloth steeped in
starch water.

XXXI.           Present     Slate       of   the Ruins   of   Babylon.     By Captain
                              Edward Frederick*.
The         interesting descriptions             given   by   Captain     F. will doubt
less have great future importance in guiding travellers to the site;
of these famous ruins of the East, the way to which he shows
 very accurately. He observes,
                                    " that the ruins of the mounds lie                    i
 on the left,   short distance off the direct road from Hillah; and
                    a
a  traveller merely sees Belus's tower as he rides along, and must
 turn out of his way     he wishes to examine
                             if                                 it,
                                                     which will occupy
a  longer time than the travellers generally have leisure for, as
 appears from their own acknowledgements, not to notice their
 dread of being surprised                 by
                                 the wandering Arabs.
    " As to the other travellers who have visited this celebrated
 spot,    would be carrying complaisance too far to place implicit
           it
 confidence on their relations, as they appear merely to have passed
over, the ground, and sometimes not even to know that they were
amidst the ruins, until their guides told them         was Babel they
                                                                  it
were riding over.     They   of  course  had   no time to examine the
heaps of rubbish.     Other travellers visited only one bank of the
Euphrates, not caring to risk meeting with the Arabs while gra
tifying their curiosity on the other.     From Belus's tower (which
is  four  miles from   Hillah  in    direct  line) there are no more

mounds on the bank of the river for the distance of twelve miles
above the tower, when you are shown a small heap of white and
red furnace-baked bricks, called by the Arabs the hummum or
bath.    I strongly suspect this to be the remains of a modern
building, from the size, colour, and general appearance of the
bricks, which, in my opinion, bear not the slightest resemblance
to those I had previously seen.     This spot, I should imagine, had
not been visited by any traveller, as it lies at a great distance
from the main road from Hillah to Bagdad ; indeed, no one men
tions ever having seen it. . .                                   ¦•
    " These are all the mounds, or ruins, as they are called, of
Babylon, that are genreally shown to travellers under the general
denomination of Babel.        I however discovered, after much in
quiry, that there were some heaps on the right bank, at the di
stance of some miles from Hillah, between the village of Kara-
koolee and the river.     I accordingly rode to them, and perceived
that, for the space of about half a mile square, the country was
covered with fragments of different kinds of bricks ; but none of
them led me to conclude that they were of the same size and
composition as those found either at Belus's tower, or the mound
mentioned to be situated between it and Hillah ; I therefore re
turned, somewhat disappointed..
 -  " Having now gratified my curiosity in examining every mound
or spot described either by Rennell, or pointed out by the natives
as belonging to Babel, I next began to search for the remains of
the ditch and city-wall that had encompassed Babylon, which was
the principal object of my journey, and still remained to be ac
complished.      Neither of these have been seen by any modern
travellers, nor do they give any intimation that they had even
looked for them.      All my inquiries amongst the Arabs on this
 subject completely failed in producing the smallest effect.     De
sirous, however, of verifying the conjectures of Major Rennell, I
 commenced my search, first by riding five miles down the stream,
 and next by following the windings of the river sixteen miles to
 the northward from Hillah, on the eastern side of the river. The
 western I ranged exactly in the same manner, and discovered not
 the least appearance or trace of any deep excavation running in
 a line, or the remains of any rubbish or mounds that could pos
 sibly lead to a conclusion that either a ditch or wall had existed
 within the range of twenty-one miles. On the western bank, in
 returning home, I left the winding of the river, and proceeded
 in a straight line from the village of Karakoolee, fifteen miles to
 the northward and westward of Hillah, to the latter place.      The
 next day I rode in a perpendicular direction from the river at.
 Belus's tower, six miles east and as many west ; so that, within
 a space of twenty-one miles in length, along the banks of the
                                                          Euphrates,

 Euphrates, and twelve              miles across it in breadth, I
                                                        was unable
 to perceive any thing that could admit of my imagining that ei
 ther a wall or ditch had existed within this extensive area. This
 leads, however, only to this conclusion ; — that, if any remains
 do exist, they must have been of greater circumference than is
 allowed by modern geographers.          I may possibly have been de
 ceived, but I spared no pains to prevent it ; 1 never was employ
 ed in riding and walking less than eight hours a-day for six suc
 cessive days, and upwards of twelve on the seventh.
    " That part of the Euphrates which lies between Karakoolee
 and Hillah, a distance of upwards of sixteen miles, winds ex
 tremely, and particularly where it passes Belus's tower a quarter
 of'a mile distant.     Arguing from the well established fact, that
 streams, on so soft a bottom and level a surface, in the course of
 years change their beds, we may, without violating probability,
 presume that the Euphrates had anciently flowed between Belus's
 tower and the other large mound lying about three quarters of a
 mile to the west of       it,

    we admit that the river may have changed its course from what
it if
    held in those ancient times, and that        now flows to the west

 single mound    on the western   bank  to be found,  nor  do the natives

 of this far-famed city with regard to the site of its two principal
 edifices   ;but if   be rejected as improbable, we still remain as
                     it
 much in the dark as ever, when we come to look for the remains
 of the palace.      Ishall however lay no stress upon what          have

    The author having taken his survey in every thing worthy of
 notice, concludes with equally important observations on the pro
 bable dimensions of the Babylonian tower, and the several kinds
 of bricks found and lastly* notices the navigation of the country.

    I paced the circumference, and found the four faces amount to
    nine hundred paces, or 2,250 feet : the slope, as you descend. <be
    face, is gradual, and generally easy.           We might not have mea
    sured it exactly at the same place ; but the difference whkh op-
    pears between us is immaterial, as a lapse of two .centuries way
    in all probability have occasioned -considerable alterations,,, The
    altitude of the south-west angle, which is the loftiest part otilfie
    whole, is' computed at two hundred feet. I had no means of as
    certaining the truth of this, but should imagine it is fully that
    height. Delia Valle mentions two kinds of bricks, furnace-baked
    and sun-dried ; and Beauchamp met only with the former. I saw
    both these, and another sort 6T deep-red, apparently high-baked,
    the colour of an English brick.             This latter is in the greatest
    abundance at Niebuhr's watch-tower, and generally has an in
    scription on   it,   but in     small character.

   carious method of navigation exists in these times,, which is no
  ticed as early as the time of Xenophon. -Merchants in Armenia,
   when embarking on the Tigris, collect a great number of goat
   skins, which, having inflated, they fasten together, forming a kind
    of square raft ; these are from fifty to a hundred in number ; over
   them are placed mats, then the merchandize, and upon the top
 •of all, the owners and passengers.              It is then set adrift, and,
   floating down the stream, it occasionally strikes against islands
   and shallow parts of the river, the bottom of which being of a
   soft nature, seldom destroys the skins.
• r. ¦"•The
                flowing of the tide at Korna is a singular sight : it pre
   vails against the stream of the Euphrates, but finds the current
    of the Tigris too powerful ; and, as you stand at the confluence
    of the two rivers, you see the flood-tide flowing up the Euphrates
    on the one hand, and forced back by the strength of the Tigris
    on the other, forming, by this contrary direction of two currents,
 '
    a violent eddy between them.           The tides of the Persian Gulf arc
    sensibly   felt  in  the  Euphrates twenty miles above Korna, or one
    hundred    and    forty  miles from the mouth of the river.      The depth
    of the river at Hillah, from what I could collect from the natives,
    exceeds forty feet when nearly full : at the time I saw        it,  the sur
    face of the stream was within three feet of the edge of the bank,
    and must,  I     should conceive, have been fully of that depth. >It

               worthy of remark, that after leaving Korna, which is
 situated forty miles above Bussora, at the confluence of the Eu
 phrates and Tigris, no date-trees are to be seen on the banks of
 the latter river ; and that the sides of the former are lined with
 them up to Babylon, and even a very considerable distance above
 it. The date-fruit to the present day constitute so essential a
 part of the food of the inhabitants, that it may, without any im
 propriety of either language or ideas, be esteemed the bread of
the people ; and from it also a fermented liquor is made, into
 which aniseed is put, to give it a flavour.     It is well known that
the ancients were not very delicate with regard to the flavour of
 their wines, and that any fermented liquor passed under that de->
nomination. The Babylonians, however, might have possessed
the art of extracting the sap, and making a liquor of             it,

SIR, —     H aving     now seen both Mr. Meikle's reply and his
continuation of            it,
                        take this opportunity of making
                                I                                 few and      a
final observations on what he has advanced in his defence.                              I
shall take his letters in the order in which they are published.
First then, for his letter of November 2d           had observed that he
                                                              I

misunderstood the term parallax, and in answer to the accusa
tion he has taken the trouble of proving that he does so.             His
exposition of Playfair's definition would certainly have produced
a   smile from the venerable philosopher.          defined parallax to be

* the angular distance between the places of the centre of a ce
lestial body, as seen at the surface and at the centre of the earth
or, which amounts to the same thing, "the angle under which the
earth's semidiameter would appear             viewed from the centre of
                                                         if

                 is     needless    to quote authorities on such     sub           a
ject but the following
     j                       extract   from  Rees's  Cyclopcedia, article

 show how far his notions of parallax agree with those which'
 Mr. M. ascribes to him.        " The parallax affects the position of
a   body only     by
                   depressing         the direction of vertical plane."

 true yet he asserts that Playfair understood parallax in the same
      ;
 sense that he does.
     In the example of correcting the moon's altitude, Mr. Meikle
 says,I   have concealed
                           " great deal of needless labour." On

       220      Final Remarks by Mr. Edward Riddle on finding
       whatever, except that of turning over one leaf in Metidoza Rios's
       tables.   My object was to show that in finding the true altitudb
       of the moon's centre above the sensible horizon, Mr. M,V«Q<e-
       thod was not wrong only because it was not really different.ffbm
       that commonly practised ; and that his method of finding: the
       apparent altitude above the same place was wrong exactly Jay
       what it differed from the method which he was desirous of su
       perseding.    In both these respects I succeeded ; and setting ex
      perience  aside, it would scarcely have been believed that he would
       have asserted that his crude misconceptions on this subject were
       "sanctioned by the authority of Maskelyne, Pond and Brinkley/'
          On the subjeut of the quadrant, I pointed out the principle on
      which Mr. M. proposed that the operation of the instruments
      should be explained ; and I showed that there was nothing vague,
      unsatisfactory, or incorrect in the explanation which is commonly
      given of it; and this was all I proposed to effect.           Mr. M.. is
      right in observing, that " we can never be too simple in our,. ex
      planations;" but though his demonstration of the principle of
      the quadrant is true, it has no very evident pretensions to sirn-
     plicity.                                                      . i    »  A
         .We have   seen   that he does not correctly understand what
     astronomers mean by the term parallax; it appears also that he
     does not know what is meant by the augmentation of the semi
     diameter.     Indeed in his letter of November 2d, his misconcep
     tions on this subject have led him to make statements too absurd
     to be defended ; and he has for once, at least, acknowledged that
    he was in an error.        But the merit of this concession is mate-
    rially lessened by an accompanying circumstance.            He does not
    state the true cause of his falling into the mistake.       He affirmed
    that the augmentation was not the same for every semidiameter,
    and he deduced this curious conclusion very fairly, on the sup
    position that the moon is flat ; this was the true cause of his
    mistake, not that which he thinks proper to assign.
         Mr. Meikle is exceedingly out of temper at the diagram on the.
    subject of parallax, and his anger is easily accounted for,            'That ,
    diagram altogether overturns       his assertion, that the difference     of
   the parallax of any two diametrically opposite limbs         is  the aug
   mentation of the diameter; and he cannot good-humouredly
   look on and see such havoc made among the creations of his
   fancy.      DAF-GBE            in that figure is the augmentation of
   every    semidiameter,    while  the altitude of the object continues
   the same.       But  if  Mr. M.'s statement on this subject and his
*
   interpretation of the term parallax were correct, the diameter
   parallel to the horizon would have no augmentation, as ttie'difr
  Jerence of the parallax of those

all his objections to    the  common method         of finding the distance

 222      Final   Remarks by  Mr. Edward Riddle      on finding
 traction of that semidiameter applied to the distance. This, as
 we shall afterwards see, is only an elaborate way of creating new
 errors." This is the main object of his letter, and he subsequently
 demonstrated a property of the ellipse with which all mathemati
 cal men were very well acquainted, and referred to that property as
 a demonstrative proof that an augmentation ought to be applied,
 not a deduction made from the semidiameter applied to the di
stance. How, in the face of these circumstances, Mr. M. has had
 the courage to lay before the public the assertions contained in
 the above extracts from his letter of December 3, 1 am totally at
a loss to conjecture.
    He says I " cannot produce the appearance" of his not know
 ing that the distance of the centres is the object of the compu
 tation. He. is here again wrong, for the task is very easy,        I
showed that by the method practised by careful computers in cor
recting the semidiameters applied to the observed altitudes and
distance, the true altitude of the centres and their apparent al
titudes and distance would be correctly obtained, and that hence
the true distance of the centres might be computed ; and further,
that the true distance of the centres was what was wanted. What
 Mr. M. knew on this subject may be gathered from what he said.
 Take the following extracts from his letter already referred to in
your July Magazine.
                         " The centre is not necessarily the appa
rent place of the angular point of the triangle." " The centre is
seldom the point from which the apparent distance should be
reckoned." " The mistake has no doubt arisen from the old
established habit of estimating the apparent distance from the
centre." The " appearance" of his not knowing that thexlistanca
of the centres is the object of the computation is therefore pretty
clearly made out.
    How I could insinuate that Mr. M. has " inculcated the ob
servance of such nicety at sea" will appear strange enough to
those who consider that the principal object of his letter was to
show that the application of these corrections, under any circum
stances, was productive of error; and that my object was to de
fend them from this imputation.
   On the subject of " trifles" to which we have seen he has ad
verted, let us take his former estimate of their value.      He has
told us " that in the common method the reduction of the semi
diameter is neglected altogether."     And in page 36, July Ma
gazine,  In  "  the method for correcting the altitude for the dis
tortion of the disk, by a table answering to the diminution of the
vertical semidiameter, what is gained in getting the true altitude
of the centre is lost in departing from the point from which the
           should be taken, and to which the common way of
distance
working often makes a much nearer approach." And further,
                                                              « I do

" I  do not consider an error of seven or eight minutes of longi
tude unworthy of avoiding ; and a much greater error may some
times be produced by neglecting the quantity under considera
tion."    Let these three extracts be compared.                                            '„.

is   mis-statement.

                                I
ror which he imputed to several, and know of no other such er

 roneous table. He was declaring such tables generally to be worse
than useless, and he mentioned           specific error that

exist     one table, and he has in his last letter again referred to
           in
the error in that table.             If
                                he cannot point out other tables, now
in use among mariners, which have the                         "

found in that one, he will find         difficult to show that he has not

  but there i* great leasqn to believe that these desiderata, at least,
 will be speedily supplied.         The public spirit of certain members
 has induced them to open .a Subscription, which already amounts
 to 600/. as tlie basis of a fund applicable to the purchase of new
 cabinets and of the most useful books and maps.                In justice to
      i liberality of the subscribers, and for the information       of those
             ay  wish   to co-operate  with them,   the  Council  thought it
              to state this circumstance to the Annual Meeting, observ-
           ! the same firne, that it is the wish" of the parties with whom
 the subscription originated, that it should be, in the strictest sense
 of the word, voluntary; and that the only invitation to members
 to contribute to the fund in question should be the knowledge
 now communicated to them that such a fund is in existence.

     It is unnecessary to enter into a detail of the advantages to society,
      commerce, and the arts, which have uniformly been derived in
      other places from establishments of this kind ; they are too fa

      and diffusion of the nobler sciences, and the prosecution of what
      ever is likely to be of real benefit or utility to the community and
      the rising generation, they intend to make this institution a focus,
      in which to collect and concentrate, not only the scattered rays
      of the genius and ability of Bristol, but also of all true lovers of
      scientific pursuits ; to confine their patronage to no particular

      Pollock, then Professor of Fortification at the Royal Military Aca
       demy at this place, invented and proposed to the Board of Ord
      nance a new kind of cannon shot called pear-shot, beirig very
      thick at ope end and small at the other, like some kinds of pears,
       and which might as well have been called conical shot, as they
     were very nearly in the shape pf a cone. These sljot, he asserted,
      would always proceed in their flight with the heavy end foremost.
  '
      By order of the Board of Ordnance, experiments with these shots
    vwere performed at Landguard Fort for several weeks; when the
;
     'only result was, that they ranged further than the gtoWrlar or
       round shot, with the same gun, and equal charges of powder;
      which was owing to the circumstance of the former being heavier
      than the latter, and so better overcoming the resistance of the
       air : a property not then known, or not well understood;               It did
       not then appear whether they flew with the heaVy end foremost:

     other long shot a little varied, being like an egg, with a perfora
      tion through from end to end, which by threading the air, as hp
    .expressed himself, would contribute to keep the larger end going
     foremost.      But on the trial, the failure was just the same as the
     former. And no doubt the same effect would attend the Russian
     shot also, if they were properly tried, as well as all other like

     PREPARATION        OF PRUSSIATE OF AMMONIA AND OF IRON^WHBN
'
          EMPLOYED      AS A REAGENT FOR COPPER.               BY M. BRANDEN-
   .    . BURGH.
          The most sensible reagents for copper are without contradic
     tion the prassiates of alkali and of iron, particularly that of am
     monia.      This salt occasions in the nitrate of ammonia an abun
     dant white precipitate, which is of a very beautiful red when ac
     cidentally an atom of copper is found in the solution. To prepare
     this prussiate, I pour into a phial of the capacity of six ounces,
     three ounces of caustic ammonia, upon half an ounce of the finest
     and purest prussian blue reduced to a very fine powder.                     I stop
     up the phial well, and leave the mixture to macerate in the cold
     for several days, taking care to shake it from time to tjme.                     If
  . I then find that the deposited matter is become brown,                      I add
     a new quantity of blue, and repeat this addition until the colour
     ho longer changes.         I filter the matter through paper, and pour
     by little and little on the residuum an ounce of water, in order to
     separate all the salt. The filtered liquor is prussiate of ammonia
   ..and, of iron ; it has a beautiful yellow colour and a particular
   . odour.
       ,1 have observed that this prussiate is also the most sensible
   . reagent for iron ; it is even infinitely preferable to the prussiate
     of potash and of iron. — Ann. Gen. ties Sciences Physiques.

            ways qualified for the undertaking, yet it appeared from the re
             port they gave, there that was every reason to believe a passage
             might be found.
                Mr. Dobbs wrote, desiring to see the journals of the sloops ;
            .but received only a general answer, whence he concluded that
             the company were averse to making any discoveries, though their
             charter was granted for that purpose.     He observed that it was
             very odd that in such a season they had not reached lat. 66. N.
             since the whale fishers every year go as far as lat. 78 and 80 de
             grees west, without obstruction.    Mr. Dobbs on this, thinking
            .Jthat the Company   trifled with him, wrote to Sir Charles Wager,

  May, 1819, one of the people discovered a large fire. We hove-
  to until day-light, when another small low island appeared about
  five miles under our lee ; we passed it close ; it appeared clothed
  with cocoa-nut trees, and doubtless inhabited. It is singular that
  Commodore Byron continued in the same parallel of latitude un
  til within a short distance of the easternmost group (for so at day
  light they had proved to be) and then steered to the northwar^;
  and Capt. Wallis passed about the same distance from the, west
  ernmost.     To the former I gave the name of EHice's GrdujK in
  honour of my friend Ellice, and to the latter my officers and pas
  sengers gave the name of De Pevster's Islands. — Ellice's Group

    JCXXVt. Answer to Mr. Brown on Professor Jameson's                          .
      System of Mineralogy. By A Correspondent.
\                         To   Mr.   Tillock.      ;
         I                                      Cornwall, Feb. 28, 1820.
             •observed in the Number of your Magazine for Ja
nuary, some remarks on the new edition of Professor Jameson's
System of Mineralogy, by Mr. P. J. Brown> which appear to me
to be written in a very uucandid spirit of criticism.
    Mr. Browrt begins with confounding a natural history method
with what lie calls a natural method, which latter, though very
indistinctly stated, seems to be neither more nor less than an.
arrangement according to chemical composition.            He thus takes
occasion to animadvert severely on deviations from an arrange
ment with which Mr. Jameson at once disclaims all connexion.
Though thus severe upon inconsistences which proceed entirely
from his own mistake, Mr. Brown seems quite incapable of ob
serving the beauties, or appreciating the excellencies, of the na
tural history method.      He cannot perceive the high advantage?
of being able at once to place a mineral either in the earthy or
metallic class, from the simple and obvious distinction of specific
gravity.     He looks only at the grievous, arid to him unpardon
able, sin against arrangement according to chemical compo.- ition,:
of placing sulphate and carbonate of lead with sulphate and car
 bonate of barytes.
    1 need not enlarge on the advantages which would accrue from
a method such as that which. Mr. Jameson attempts.              By en
abling any one to recognise a mineral at first. sight, and give it
its proper place in the system, it removes the great deficiency of
 mineralogy/and gives it that facility and precision which have
conferred such superiority on botany and zoology.             To obtain
 this great desideratum, what mineralogist would hesitate to make
 some sacrifices, even in what' may be considered as the just al
 liances of minerals, those derived from their composition ? And
even though he were obliged to place sulphate of lead with sul
 phate of barytes, would he not think this amply compensated by
 the advantages gained ? At least, while there is a propriety                  ift
 admitting the one system, there      is an equal propriety in admit
 ting the other;   each having its peculiar advantages.
    As for the discrepancies which he seems so much to exult over,
 they are so trivial as scarcely to .deserve attention, when         re
 collected that, in giving the general characters of class, a     it itis is   by
 no means supposed that no mineral         is to be included but what
                                             '
 agrees exactly   with every  one  of them.      It  sufficient
                                                       is         ifcor
                                                                      it
responds    in the greater uumber.or    the more important.
    Another thing which Mr. Brown finds fault with,             is,
                                                                 that in
Vol. 55. No. 264.    Jpril   1820.                     Q             the

    242       On Professor Jameson's System     of Mineralogy.
    the observations which are inserted at the close of many of the
   articles, to enable the student to distinguish particular minerals
    from those which they more nearly resemble, the discriminating
   characters given frequently depend on chemical properties, of
   which Mr. Jameson professes his system to be perfectly indepen
   dent j yet Mr. B. might easily perceive that these are not de
   livered as essential characters, but are merely intended to give
   greater facility, and it would be a very absurd adherence to sy
   stem to reject them.     What he says about the vagueness of the
   definitions is applicable to mineralogy in general, not merely to
   Mr. Jameson's system.
       The individual  and minor faults pointed out by Mr. B. may
   be readily admitted without any great diminution of the merit of
   Mr. Jameson's work, when we reflect how arduous the under
   taking is which he has attempted, and has so far accomplished,
   ft is not merely precision in distinguishing    "  fibrous brown zinc
   blende
            " from " fibrous brown iron ore," or    "   antimony ochre
                                                                        "
   from" bismuth glance," without the possibility of any person of
   inferior apprehension making a mistake, that is to constitute
   the excellence of the system; but the laying down such methods,
   founded on the external characters of minerals, as shall afford
   the means of immediately placing the mineral in the class, order
   and species to which it belongs.      In such an undertaking some
;
   imperfections   must no  doubt occur  ; but these, though urged and
   magnified by wit, good    or bad (allowing even to Mr. Brown the
   indulgence of the alternative), will be little regarded by the can
   did inquirer.
 '
       It gives me pleasure, as an old pupil of Mr. Jameson's, to
   have the opportunity of vindicating his labours from unfair and
   groundless objections, and to express the conviction which all
   must entertain who have studied under him, that mineralogy will
   always be improved by his exertions.

    Sir, — An your last Number Mr. Riddle has resumed his fa
   vourite theme of making vague remarks and groundless charges
    on my paper on the Luuar Observations;       I shall therefore take
   this opportunity of replying briefly to some of his very unfair and
                                                               I formerly

          Further Reply                        to   Mr. Riddle             on the -Lunar Observations.                             243
          I   formerly adduced Professor Playfair's definition of parallax,
    .asof the first authority, and of a more-general nature than the
    limited one given in several books* That Mr. Playfair's not
    adopting the latter definition was from a conviction of its imper-
    fection,is evident from his rejection of some definitions in Euclid
    for a like reason. He therefore gave his more general definition.
    Io short, nothing can be more plain than that the limb of the
    moon is- either affected by parallax or it is not.    If it   astro                                                  is,

  three whole days, are to be allowed for the anticipation of the
   moon, at the rate of one day in 304 years. See this explained in
  Mr. Ferguson's Astronomy, art. 387, p. 377j 12th edit. : there

complete lunar period, in which the solar and lunar motions co
incide in the same point of the ecliptic ; and that in this period
the whole system of solar and lunar eclipses is performed.

for the lunar anticipation of the old astronomy, and that such
may be accounted for on other principles than any real anticipa

    by Changes     of Temperature ; with a Suggestion for counter
    acting  these. Effects.     By A Correspondent.
             .        ;        To Mr. Tilloch.
 Sir, —    The     effects of changes in the temperature of the at
mosphere, in expanding and contracting metals in exposed situa
tions — for example, iron bridges — does not seem to have excited
much attention until lately, when some of the effects became too
visible to remain longer unnoticed.           Permit me to offer an idea
 (through your very valuable Magazine) which may be of some
advantage in the construction of those very elegant and econo
mical structures.        As it is impossible to prevent heat and cold
from producing their natural effects, instead of the immense
abutments, that are at present necessary to resist the increase
of thrust or pressure in warm weather with a constant change
of the curvature of the bridge, and necessarily a change in the
points of contact, in the parts forming the arch, I would place
the ribs or segments on blocks or bars of zinc, placed in recesses
formed for that purpose in the abutments (and piers if consisting
of more than one arch) ; those blocks or bars in length shouM
be to the extent of the arch in the ratio that zinc expands to

   Description    of an improved Hydro-pneumatic apparatus.             249
 the metal of which the bridge is composed, taking into considera
 tion their respective situations.         Thus in warm weather, when
 the arch is expanding, the same would take place in the blocks,
 which would raise the arch to a wider part between the abut
 ments; in cold weather the contrary would be the case.                 The
 arch by this means would in all temperatures fit between the
 abutments, obtaining from them that support which is necessary
 to its stability, with a perfect uniformity in its thrust, or lateral
 pressure.

 XL. Description of       an improved Hydro-pneumatic Apparatus.
                       By Mr. John Cuthbkrt*.
           1113,                 St. Martin's-lane, London, April 13, 1819.
               beg leave to offer to the Society for the Encourage
 ment of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce, a combination of the
blow- pipe and pneumatic trough invented by me ; the utility
and simple arrangement of which I hope will meet with their ap
probation.
   It is a well known fact that in chemical analysis the blow-pipe
is indispensably necessary ; and the almost constant application
of the pneumatic trough need not be enlarged upon.                  The ap
paratus I lay before the Society combines these two instruments
in one, and when required for either purpose, can at once, with
out any trouble, be dismounted, and the pieces applied to their
separate uses.
   To a public lecturer, who often at the time of exhibiting the
effects of gas may have occasion for a blast-pipe, this combina
tion is of infinite advantage, by reason of the facility with which
oxygen gas from a bladder may be introduced and passed through
the platina jet, which cannot be fused by the heat required.
   When the apparatus is used as a pneumatic trough, it is only
necessary to remove the mouth-pipe and cover ; which latter,
when taken off, becomes a useful tray for transferring the re
ceivers from the pneumatic trough, the ledge of the cover being
sufficiently deep to contain water for that purpose.
   The water from the bottom vessel may be occasionally forced
up by the mouth, in case of a deficiency when many receivers are
jn use, and is kept up to the height required by means of a
sliding-pipe within the large tube       ff;    and if the contrary effect

XLI.      Facts respecting the increased Volatility and Inflamma
    bility which Fish Oil and its Vapours acquire by continued or
    renewed Exposure to certain high Temperatures ; elicited
    by the Examination of Evidence in a late Trial in the Court
    of Common Pleas (Severn, King and Co. versus Drew, or
    the Imperial Insurance Office) , before the Lord Chief Justice
    Dallas and a Special Jury.
This      case, important in every view, as embracing the practice
 and principles by which fire-insurances are regulated, proved
 not less so to science, on account of the high attainments of many
 of the witnesses, and the curious facts that were elicited by their
 evidence.    We have therefore thought that we should render an
 acceptable   service   to our readers generally, by giving the pro
 ceedings   a  place  in   our pages.     The trial commenced on the
 1 1th of April, and did not close till the 13th.
   ¦
    Mr. Stephen opened the pleadings.
    The Solicitor-general afterwards rose, and stated the plaintiffs'
 case  in an address, embracing a complete view of the whole sub
ject. The present action was brought for a sum of upwards of
 8000/. against the defendants, who are directors of the Imperial
 Insurance Company.           The plaintiffs were very respectable and
 opulent sugar-refiners, residing in Whitechapel. This was a part
only of a very large sum, amounting to about 70,000/. total loss
which had. been sustained by fire in November 1819.           Upon that
point no doubt or difficulty existed, nor was the slightest impu
 tation cast upon the character of the plaintiffs.      The only ques-   >.
tion arising between the parties turned either upon points of law,
 or related to the manner and regularity of effecting the insurance.
 It would be for the jury, after deliberately weighing the evidence
 on both sides, to decide whether the plaintiffs were entitled to
 an indemnification.       With reference to this ultimate question he
might be allowed to mention, in the first place, that they had
paid an enormous premium for their insurance.              It was made
indeed upon an express provision, and not on any of the general
rules by u'hich the office directed its transactions.      The rate of'
insurance in ordinary cases was two shillings per cent., and from
that it graduated to five shillings, which was considered, to use
the language of the insurers themselves, as the rate applicable
 to risks of a double hazard.        It was the premium required where
 tallow or any other matter easily combustible was in daily use,
 or formed a material of manufacture.          But the present case was
 altogether singular,     for  the  premium actually paid was no less
 than 14 shillings, being more than double that required in all
ordinary cases for doubly hazardous insurances.          He mentioned
                                                                    this

this circumstance in order to show that the defendants could not
have conceived that they were insuring an ordinary risk, but one
of a peculiar nature, and from which if they were to sustain loss,
they had no right to complain, as they received a premium com
mensurate to it.      He should now have to draw their attention
to the description of premises over which the insurance had ex
tended, and which comprehended a grinding-house           and stoves,
an engine-house, a filling-house, and a warehouse secured by
iron doors.      (A wooden frame, containing a plan of the entire
building, was here produced in court, and was made use of by
the learned gentleman to illustrate his description.)       This plan
was offered to their attention, in order to assist, if possible, in in
quiring into the circumstances which attended the origin of the
fire.   It was not necessary for him to carry the jury through all
the pleas upon this record. The material one on the side of the
defendants was, that the fire had been occasioned by a cause not
included within the risk insured.        By stating the case in this
manner,     he  hoped to disembarrass     it,and disincumber         of
                                                                    it
whatever might tend to perplex their inquiry.            was pleaded
                                                         It
on the other side, that the plaintiffs had used     a process of heat
ing oil which had increased the risk, and that this process had
been introduced subsequently to the insurance. Now, he should be
able to show that the apparatus in question was separated      by  wall
                                                                   a
and iron doors.  It   might then become a question, whether, what
ever might have been incumbent on the plaintiffs to state to the
insurers at the outset, they ought, upon the adoption of this pro
cess, to have subsequently apprized them of it.        He should con
tend that his clients were not bound to make any communication
on this subject, unless the defendants themselves had thought
proper to inquire in the first instance.   Supposing, therefore, the
risk to be increased   by  this new process commenced upon conti
guous premises, the plaintiffs were under no obligation to dis
 close the circumstance unless the insurers thought proper either
 to inspect the premises, or seek information; in which case, his
 clients were undoubtedly bound to make         a full and unreserved
 disclosure.    His clients were engaged in the business of sugar-
 refining toa   great extent, and the processes     bywhich that ope
 ration was carried on were almost as various as the establishments
 engaged in it. Those, therefore, who insured such manufactories
 were bound to examine the mode in which they were conducted,
if  they had in contemplation to limit their insurance to any given
 risk; and if   they did make such an inquiry,       itwas the duty of
 the other party to leave no circumstance concealed.         When he
 talked of a   variety of processes, he would endeavour to make,
 himself intelligible. The original and simple mode of refining
 sugar was,, to place it  in pan, with fire under it. This, how-.
                            a           a
       '                          ,                                ever,

254              On the Volatility and Inflammability
ever, was found very inconvenient, inasmuch as that part of the
sugar which was nearest the fire was burnt before the rest could
be brought to a proper temperature.                Ingenious and scientific
men contrived to produce the requisite degree of heat by pipes
of boiling water coiled and immersed into the syrup, or sugar*
 But this difficulty arose, that the sugar would not boil at the
same heat as the water, and therefore a high pressure, attended
with much danger, was required.              At Liverpool tallow was in
common use for this purpose ; but           this  was found extremely ofr
fensive, and, to obviate its inconveniencies, Mr. Wilson had in
 vented a process for using fixed oil. This oil was put into a large
retort, and from it a coil of pipes passed into the sugar which
it was intended to bring into a boiling state. The oil required
a temperature of 600 degrees of Fahrenheit for boiling, and sugar
350. This was a degree of temperature below any heat that
could create danger.         The first question therefore would be,
whether by means of this communication there was any increase
of risk; and, secondly, whether the loss was occasioned thereby
— as he understood, instead of being increased, the risk was di
minished, upon a comparison with the former mode.                      One of
the risks attending the former mode          was   that of the sugar boiling
over, in which case the premises must be infallibly destroyed.
By the new.proeess, a thermometer was fixed in the retort, and,
as soon as the oil was heated to the degree of 350, it passed
into pipes which conveyed it through the sugar, till, like the cir
culation of the blood, it reflowed into the retort.              It would be
idle to suppose that, upon a question of this nature, he was not
aware of some of those grounds which would be taken on the
other side.     It would be said, as he apprehended, that the pipes
might burst ; but this was guarded against by the valves being
smaller than the diameter of the pipe.                 But then it might be
urged, that gas must        be  created   ;  and    to  this he would reply,
that gas was not created by fixed oil until it arrived at a tem
perature of between 600 and 700 degrees, long before which the
thermometer would have exploded.                To be brought to such a
temperature,     the   heat  must   be  continued       for a long time in a
state  of almost   incredible  intensity,   for  the   accession  of heat be
came very slow after a certain point.             From    the retort  a small
pipe ascended, for the purpose of carrying off such air as might
remain in the pipes, and in a retort not always full.              If any gas
was created, it must escape through this pipe. Again, it might
be urged, that the air might be driven downwards by a sudden-
draught — a result, certainly, to be looked for in an ordinary room,
but, if admitted into these premises, would have defeated the
whole process which was carrying on.              Every draught was care
fully prevented, and the fire fed by external air admitted from
:                                                                      behind

                                                      "   i'

 behind it.      He understood also, that if any gas should escape
 and mix with the air, it never could so escape in any proportion^
 that by the contact of fire could produce either danger or ex
 plosion.     All this he stated on the authority of persons long fa
 miliar with experiments, and deeply versed in subjects of this na
 ture.     It would perhaps be said that the nature of oil might be
 changed by the renewed application of heat, and that when so
 changed, it would emit gas at 300 degrees.                Thi9, however, he
 had reason to believe          was  utterly false,  and    although the oil
might be rendered thicker, the reapplication of heat would re
 store it to its former state. The fact also was, that it had no
 communication with the external air. The retort had been re
cently taken off and repaired ; and he might undertake to de
 monstrate that the risk was less than by the former method.
 With regard to a pan that was still in use, and to which his
 learned friend had just drawn his attention, it was enough to re
 mark, that it was a mere substitution for one used previously to
 the insurance.        As to the circumstances attending the fire, he
 should but briefly advert to them, as they would appear in evi
 dence, clearly and satisfactorily, before them.             After it was ex
 tinguished,      as it  was   natural   to  imagine   that   some explosion
 might have been the cause,           the   apparatus   was    inspected, and
 the retort found without any rent or fissure in it, and with ,nd
 other mark than that impressed by the superincumbent weight
 which had fallen upon it. A copper boiler was also found melted ;
 but it would be proved that the coals under              it,
                                                            and in     state of
                                                                          a
ignition, gave     a    satisfactory    explanation  of   that  circumstance.
 This was the case which he should now proceed to substantiate
 by evidence   ;    and, having so clone, he was sure the jury would
 feel satisfaction in securing to        a    gentleman who had paid so
  large a premium,        a  full indemnification for the loss which had
  been incurred.                                                              ;
      The Chief Justice asked, whether the process in question was
  peculiar to the plaintiffs' sugar-house         ?
     The Solicitor-general replied in the negative, and added, that
  the same insurance-office had underwritten several warehouse*
  of the same description.                                              .< •

      The Chief Justice remarked that, as he now understood the
  case, five questions would arise: —        1. Did this process fall within
  the  risk  coi.templated    by  the  insurance?   — 2. Was the fire occa
  sioned  by       —
               it? 3. Were       the plaintiffs bound    to give notice when
  they introduced    it?  —   4. Was the insurance void — And, 5. Did

   526             On the Volatility and Inflammability
       On the suggestion of Mr. Scarlett, the conditions of the policy
   were read at length, and the Solicitor-general undertook to show
   that there was a special agreement in this case.
       George Luke was then called, and stated that he was a mill
   wright, and had been three years in the employment of the plain
  tiffs. He left the premises on the 9th of November, the day pre
  ceding the fire, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening. The
   only person whom he left behind him was, to the best of his
   knowledge, the engineer.       The fill-house, where the retort was
   placed, was in the lowest part of the premises, and the warehouse
  'on the next floor immediately above.          When he returned at
   seven o'clock the next day, the fire had broken out, and had been
  -raging for some time.       He was acquainted with the new oil ap
   paratus.    That  part of it which consisted of a pan had been used
   before,  and  the  whole   had  been at work about three months.
   The fire kept under the oil was less than it used to be by the
   former method.       When the oil became heated to a degree of
   between 320 and 350, it was considered to be in a fit state for
   working. The pump was then set on, and, by means of its suc
   tion, the heated liquid was conveyed through pipes. As the su
   gar was cold, the heat of the oil decreased by its communica
   tion, and became just sufficient to cause the sugar to boil.        In
   the warehouse there was always a quantity of sugar lying about
   on the floor : and, being the place where the packing was per
   formed, there was generally a considerable quantity of empty
   hogsheads, paper, and straw likewise. The retort-pipe entered a
   steam- vent, and the air escaped by an opening in the side of the
   chimney.     He had examined the retort a few days before the
   fire ; and, though a drop or two of oil might leak out, it worked
   very well, and without danger.                                   .   .
       This witness, on his cross-examination by Mr. Scarlett, said
   it was not his business to attend to the fire : that was the express
   employment of another man.         The pipe from the retort did not
   go to the top   of the steam-vent, which was 70 feet high.       The
   pipe in question rose about 16 feet from the vessel.     All the fires
   were out when he left the place on the evening of the 9th. There
   was no fire-place, nor any fire generally kept, in the warehouse.
   He did not know whether the same oil was put into the vessel
   after its repair as had been used before; but he admitted that it
   still continued to drop.                                           - »
       In answer to a question from the Bench, witness added that
  no fire had taken place in the premises during the three years be
  fore the new process was adopted, and that this new process had
  been at work only three months.
       Henry May deposed that he was engine-keeper at the time of
   the fire, and had been 24 years in that situation.        He was on
                                                                      the

The last witness was with him some time in the engine-house,
when he was engaged in packing the piston. When he went away,
no one, to his knowledge, was left behind but the watchman; and
all appeared to him to be safe and right.        He returned a few
minutes after three o'clock the next morning, and went ta the
engine-house to get the engine ready. The fire had been lighted
 as usual, before he came.       He, however, proceeded to make it
up, and found nothing wrong at that moment.          In about twenty
 minutes after he went'through the mill-room to the long-house,
 which was on the warehouse floor, and, standing on the steps
 which led down to the fill-house, he" called to know if they were
 ready below.      He received for answer, that they were not quite
 ready; and in consequence of this he went away, but returned
 in the space of ten minutes and inquired again. Understanding
 now that they would be ready immediately, he prepared to start
 his engine, which stood in a yard by itself, and set it to work. In
 a very few minutes lie heard an alarm of fire, and he went again
 through the mill-room, and perceived, by a door opening to the
 left, that the fire was on the warehouse floor. There was a good
 deal of smoke, and he saw no hole in the floor through which
 the fire could have found its way. There were various hogs
 heads, as well as straw and paper, lying about.       The iron doors
 were fast, and the premises were burnt down in about three
  hours.
      Cross-examined. — There was no fire remaining when he left
 the premises the night before.       The steam-engine was used for
  the mill as well as for the oil-pump.     The engine had been put
  on several times before he heard the alarm of fire.      There was
  no great body of fire when he first perceived it in the warehouse.
      Christian Lampe was employed in the warehouse.           It was
  there that hogsheads were emptied on the floor, for the purpose
  of being refined. On the Sth of November several hogsheads were
  packed, and on the following day six or seven were emptied.
  This had perhaps increased the quantity of straw and paper
  usually lying about.    One pan had been charged by him with
  the sugar thus emptied from the hogsheads.       The candles some
  times used in the warehouse were blown out, and left either on
  the floor or on the hogsheads till the next morning ; there was
  no particular place for depositing them.       The hogsheads were
   sometimes left with sugar adhering to their insides, but were
   finally scraped and steamed.     A gas-light was used in the ware
   house.                   '     : f
      Henry Wylling, another workman on the same premises, con
  firmed the evidence of the preceding witnesses in all its essential
   points.    He came about four o'clock on the day of the fire ; and

the fire proceeded ; but, by crawling on his hands and knees,
he reached the place of communication between the long-house
and the warehouse, and perceived light as well as smoke in the
long-house.     He could also see into the fill -house, by means of
the gas and fire above.    The fire appeared to have seized on the
sides of the fill-house, but he saw none in the body of it.       He
had likewise a distinct view of the oil apparatus at this time, and
must have seen the mischief,     if any were*taking place ; but he
saw none.
   George Wick, a sugar-refiner, who lived near the premises,
deposed, that he rose in consequence of an alarm of fire at the
time already specified.    He approached within a yard and a half
of the fill-house in Union-street ; and at twenty minutes past
four he perceived neither smoke nor fire within it.
   Samuel Aubur stated, that he also resided in the same neigh
bourhood; and being awakened by the watchman's rattle at an
early hour on the 10th of November, he proceeded to a spot
where he could see through a window of the warehouse.           The
lower part of this window was on a level with his breast, the fill-
house being considerably below ground.         He then perceived a
quantity of fire and smoke opposite, part of which appeared to
him to descend into the fill-house.
   Mr. Henry Wilson was then called, and stated that he was well
acquainted with the various processes of refining sugar. He had
for some time been conversant with this subject, and with the
application of oil for that purpose.    He had put up apparatus
for the same purpose in two houses at Liverpool, three years ago,
as well as in one or two others in London.       In the present case
it had been put up almost exclusively under his direction.       He
conceived that the ordinary mode of refining sugar was attended
with both inconvenience and danger.         One great danger was
that of the sugar boiling over ; another, of its emitting very in
flammable gases, arising from the combustibility of sugar when
in a desiccated state. At the degree of 344, inflammable gases
were created.     The boiling point was 245.     He visited the pre
mises  in question almost every day, and observed that there was
some leaking, but none that could produce the slightest mischief.
It was impossible that the leaking of oil into the fire below could
cause the fire to communicate with the pil in the vessel.     When
the oil was thus converted into combustible gas, it passed off up
the chimney.      The temperature of the oil in the vessel never
exceeded 360 for the working point.       If it were to go beyond
440, the thermometer would burst.        The boiling point of oil
was about 600 degrees ; and until it attained that degree of heat,
                                                                •' it

it would send out no permanently inflammable      gases.  To bring
about such a degree     of heat would require several hours of hard
firing, and could never take place from negligence alone.      If   a
similar fire were placed under sugar, inflammable gases would
be produced in a much shorter time. If produced in this retort,
they would go up the steam-pipe, a vent which was rendered
necessary for discharging the air within the vessel ; and in oil
there was also a quantity of aqueous matter, which it was ne
cessary to carry off in the same manner: conducted through the
pipe to which he alluded, it all passed out at a lateral aperture
in the chimney.     All draught down the chimney was carefully
guarded against, and the brick-work of the chimney secured
against heat by cast-iron pipes.      He thought there was no dan
ger  from  the gas that might escape mixing with the atmospheric
air, because the proportion necessary to cause explosion must be
one to six or seven, and it was impossible that such a proportion
should be formed even in the fill-house.     This danger was much
greater with the ordinary process.     The vent was quite sufficient
to carry out ten times the quantity of gas which could be pro
duced by this apparatus.      The retort had been repaired a few
days before.    With regard to the oil changing its quality, because
it became thicker by use, he did not think that that increased its
tendency to become inflammable.        He was present at an exami
nation of the apparatus with several surveyors and engineers after
the fire had happened ; there was not the slightest rent or fissure
in the retort, and a four-inch wall on one side of it was as per
pendicular as when originally built. There was a great quantity
of rubbish upon   it, and a  piece of fused brass which had come
from above ;    but he could not discover, from the appearances
around, the slightest indication of an explosion having taken
place. The screws of the aperture were perfect, and the thread
bright and sharp. The pump was much fused, and the copper ves
sel melted — circumstance to be accounted for
             a                                     by the coals kept
under it  for the purpose of cutting off the draught.      The pipes
were of copper, and could not burst from the pumping of the oil,
because the valves were smaller than their diameter in the inside
                                                    :
of the retort there was a quantity of carbonaceous matter, na
turally resulting from the gradual distillation of the oil, and ex
plosion would have caused     adifferent appearance.
   Cross-examined.   —  He had taken out three patents for the pro
cess which he had been describing — one in 1816, one in 1817,
and the third in 1818.     Previous to this invention he had been
engaged in chemical manufactures. His patent had been applied
to four cases; two of them occurred at Liverpool, but in both of
these tallow was used as well as oil.     He had put up his appa
ratus for another house in London about six months ago, but         it

nerally to the manufacture.          There were various modes of car
rying   on  this  manufacture,   and   one or two patents had been ob
tained for carrying it on through the means of steam. After the
retort had l>een repaired, the oil which had been already used
 was put back into     it, with the addition of some fresh. He saw
no vestige of the thermometer on his inspection of the apparatus
after the fire.
    Aaron Msnby deposed that he was an iron manufacturer, and
 had constructed the vessel in which the oil was boiled.             He at
 tended the formation of the vessel, which was quite perfect.               It
 had no flaws or defects           it. The leakage which had been
                                   in
 spoken of occurred     in consequence of the common effect of wear
find tear.     All engines were subject to the same deterioration.
 Such wear     and  tear, and their effects, could not be avoided.
    Mr, James Harris stated, that he was         a  sugar-refiner, at Li
 verpool, and hud carried on the business for         1   4years. His pro
 cess was, at present, the common one.           He formerly was       in  the
 habit of refining sugar      bymeans of oil and tallow; not in      a  close
vessel, like that described in the plan, but         inan open one.        He
found that that method could not succeed, on account of the of
 fensive smell of the oil and tallow.       The process pursued        by  the
 plaintiffs was greatly superior to the old-fashioned process.              By
 the former  a   sugar- refiner could heat the article without incur
ring the danger of the sugar boiling over. Another danger was also
avoided, namely, that of heating the sugar to excess, and totally
 spoiling it. Witness had seen the model notv exhibited, and,
Supposing   it   to be correct, he thought the hazard infinitely less
 than that which was to be apprehended from the ordinary course.
 The plan was less objectionable, and altogether less dangerous,
than that which was more generally adopted. Witness, when he
formerly made use of oil and tallow, had caused an alteration
to be effected in his policy of insurance.       He applied to the office
 to allow him to boil sugar in that way, and         it was admitted.       It
was an existing policy, which, in the first instance, he applied to
have altered, and    if  was in consequence endorsed.            By the en
dorsement, the company allowed him to boil sugar in this way.
The date of the endorsed policy was the 31st of May 1814. •Am
alteration was made in the body of another policy, bearing date
the 22d of July last,         which the new process of boiling sugar
                             by
by  means of heated oil was allowed.         He paid no additional pre
mium when he got the policy endorsed.            >   p ('>'(¦ v<-< '¦¦»¦>.••>;
    Cross-examined.    —  Witness    did not  assure  the    company   when
he applied for the alteration that the risk would be less under
the new system.        His first policy was for tallow the second for

tess he had abandoned, and returned to the old practice.                         He
had no process like that now under consideration                   in operation at
present.       At one time he had three pans, in which the sugar was
boiled by heated oil, but he gave the system up.
     Re-examined. — He abandoned that principle because the smell
of the oil was unpleasant. That defect was now, however, com
pletely cured ; and he had no doubt but that he should abandon
the old plan, and adopt the improved new one.
            ¦-Robinson stated, that he had been a sugar-refiner for
 25 vears, and was well acquainted with the old mode of refining
 sugar, which was attended with considerable dang*.                     It required
 infinite vigilance to prevent the recurrence of danger. The danger
 was likely to arise from the boiiing over of the sugar.                If it boiled
 over, and     came    in  crfhtact    with the   fire,  or if the  sugar fell into
 the ashes, which were exceedingly hot, the danger was most im
 minent.       He conceived that there was much less risk with Mr.
 Wilson's method. While the vessel which contained the oil re
 mained entire, there could be no danger.                  The present plan re
 quired    much   less   vigilance    and attention     to prevent   accident than
 the old one.       Witness did not boil his sugar according to Mr.
  Howard's plan, but according to the ancient method.                      Me knew
 of sugar-houses having been burned                  down,   but had never once
  ascertained the exact cause. The floors of sugar-houses were sa
 turated with sugar, and the timber was necessarily extremely dry,
 in consequence of the intense heat that was obliged to be used.
      William Domford was present, after the fire, when the ruins
 were examined.           The vessel in which the oil had been contained
  appeared to be scarcely injured.            Witness was acquainted with
 the business of sugar-refining ; and, on looking to the model ex
 hibited in court, had no hesitation in stating it as his opinion
  that the new plan for refining sugar was much safer than the
  Old ; first, because much less fire was used ; and, next, because
  the flame was not suffered to come in contact with the vessel.
  Another reason was, because, when mischief was apprehended,
  the supply of heated oil might be immediately stopped.                      In the
  old course there were no such advantages. One of the great dan
  gers of the old plan was, that an inflammable vapour was pro
  duced, which was liable to take fire. Sugar boiled at about 3 44 de
  grees of heat would, he believed, produce a permanent inflammable
  gas;     He did not know what heat would produce a permanent
   inflammable gas from oil;            It would, however, require a much
  greater degree of heat to produce vapour, or inflammable gas, from
  oil than from sugar. . In his opinion it would certainly require
  582 degrees of heat to form gas from oil. Witness did not know
   whether the nature of oH was rendered more inflammable by be-

water, and of course it did not inflame quite so soon as Old oil
which had been frequently heated, and had lost some of those
aqueous particles.      The difference in that respect could not,
however, be considerable.       It was quite clear, from the model
then before them, that if any inflammable gas had been generated
in the machine, it would have escaped through the leaden pipe
which led into the steam-vent.
   Cross-examined. — Experiments had been tried for the pur
pose of ascertaining whether oil changed its properties in conse
quence of constant use. A quantity of old oil was put into one
retort, and an equal quantity of new into another.         Very little
difference was found in heating them to the pitch at which gas
was produced.      In heating oil for refining sugar, he saw no dan
ger  whatever.    The   process of boiling sugar in the old way was
extremely dangerous.
    Mr. Samuel Parkes stated that he was an experimental and
practical chemist. He had attended to the model of the machine,
and to the manner in which the process of refining sugar was
earried on ; and he considered that the old mode of boiling sugar,
for the purpose of refining, was more dangerous than the present.
 He had no hesitation in saying, that it was attended with much
less danger.    The danger arose from the chance of the fire com
ing in contact with the sugar-pan.      Witness attended through
out to Mr. Wilson's examination,      and, with certain exceptions,
agreed in the correctness of what he stated.      He did not, how
ever, agree  with  him in what  he said on the subject of the gas of
old oil.   He had mixed five ounces of sugar with a proper pro
portion of water ; and when he had increased the heat to 230 de
grees, the sugar and water boiled rapidly.       The thermometer
then remained stationary for a time, but it afterwards moved
slowly upwards to 340 degrees.     A species of gas was then pro
duced ; but, when the heat was raised to 370 degrees, the gas
burned with a strong and permanent flame. When a heat of 590
degrees was applied to old oil, it produced an inflammable, but
not a permanent inflammable gas. The lowest temperature at
which inflammable gas was produced from oil was 586; but it
was not permanent inflammable gas.       What he meant by a non-
permanent inflammable gas was, a gas which would light if a
match were applied to   it,but which would go out when the match
was removed.      When the heat was raised to 600 degrees,     a gas
was produced from oil, which,    if touched with   a match, lighted
up, and continued to burn.     That was the lowest temperature at
which permanent inflammable gas was produced from oil. When

 it  was much increased after it had arrived at a certain point. It
 would not be an easy task to raise the heat of oil to 600 degrees in
 an instrument like that alluded to.       It would require a great ef
 fort for several hours.    If the fire were left to work by itself, con
 sidering its size, it was impossible that so great a heat could be
 produced.      Even if gas had been formed, looking to the formation
 of the room from which it might have escaped, he saw no danger of
 its mixing with the atmospheric air, and producing explosion.
     Cross-examined. —There was a vapour from new oil at 586
 degrees, and from old oil there was a slight inflammable va
 pour at 580. At 370 degrees sugar produced a strong gas. New
 oil produced a powerful gas, or vapour, at 608 degrees of
 heat; old oil produced it at 590.         He had not an opportunity
 of minutely examining whether, in proportion to the time during
 which oil was used, it gave out gas or vapour with greater readi
 ness.    He had made no experiment with respect to the weight
 of gases emitted by oil at different degrees of temperature. All
 experience told them that new oil would burn sooner than old.
 He made no experiment to ascertain whether a large mass of oil,
 heated from time to time, would become more inflammable than
 oil which had not been used. The old oil he used was furnished
by    Mr. Wilson.
     Re-examined. — If the oil in the retort were heated to any thing
 like 590 or 600 degrees, it would carbonize the sugar.             Even
400 degrees of heat would produce that effect.            One great ad
vantage of the new apparatus was, that in a moment the sugar
 could be prevented from boiling over.                                 . ,
     Mr. Wilson re-examined. — The oil he sent was whale oil, and
had been heated in a vessel which he had for the purpose, every
day, for a period of about two years.        It was heated lor the pur
pose   of making experiments.
   '
     Mr. W. Brande stated that he had looked           at the apparatus
now before the court, and had maturely considered the subject
with the view of giving evidence here to-day. As he was neces
sitated to come there, he had made a few experiments.              As far
as his experiments, which were on a small scale, went, he must
say that the apparatus appeared to him to be less dangerous than
the old one. He had placed a vessel of oil over the fire, and put
a pan of sugar in it. He then put in a thermometer to mark the
degree of heat.     When the heat rose to 200 or 400 degrees the
sugar burned.      He then applied some lighted paper to the oil,
which it immediately put out.            He therefore concluded, that
sugar gave out gas much sooner than oil.          He could not produce
inflammable gas from oil under a less temperature than 600 de
grees.     If gas were generated in that retort, he did not imagine
that it would produce danger. The gas which he had seen pro
                                                                   duced

264            On the Volatility and Inflammability
duijed from oil was lighter than atmospheric air. The gas which
coiild have been formed in that apparatus, if it had been let
into the fill-house, would not have set it on fire. The gas would-
have escaped by the steam-vent.       In those parts of Mr. Wilson's
evidence on which he could give an opinion, he entirely con
curred. From examining the model, and viewing the premises^
the impression on his mind was, that it was much more likely
that the fire broke out in another place, and was not occasioned
by the oil in the retort.
    Cross-examined. — Supposing the fire, when first observed,
seemed to have broken out in that steam -vent, which appeared
all in a blaze, whjat would you then conceive to be the probable
cause of the fire ?
    Witness. — I do not think, if gas escaped from the retort, that
it could set the place on fire, unless the aperture or pipe which
 communicated with the steam-vent were shut.
    Mr. F. Accum stated, that he-had made experiments to ascertahi
 at what temperature oil would emit inflammable gas.        He could
•distinguish  between   new  and  old   oil, having made  his  experi
 ments with both. He found that new oil emitted permanent in
 flammable gas at a temperature of 600 degrees. It never emitted
 gas of that kind at a lower temperature.       He had seen the mo
 del, and was of opinion that, with the fire which it appeared was
 placed under the boiler, it would take the man in attendance eight
 or ten hours of constant exertion to produce so great a degree of
 heat as would generate inflammable gas, if he were called on to
 do so.    It was impossible to produce such an effect in half an
 hour or twenty minutes.      Old oil, used again and again, would
 give an inflammable, but not a permanent gas, at 580.           If gas
 had been formed in a retort, it could not have been confined
 there, but would have escaped through the pipe.         If gas' were
 formed in that court, it would immediately mount to the cupola,
 where it would remain, unless there happened to be an dpening
 there. In that case it would escape, and the heavier atmospheric
 air would take its place. All inflammable gases were lighter than
 common air. There was not, he believed, any gas of an inflam
 mable nature that was not lighter than common air.           Looking
 at the new plan and the old, he had no doubt that the former
 was less hazardous.     He had placed two vessels, one containing
 a solution of sugar, and the other of oil, in a similar degree of
 heat; and when the temperature arrived at 350, the sugar pro
 duced a species of inflammable gas, which ignited when a lighted
  body approached it.      This could not be done with oil. One
 great advantage    in the new plan was, that the director had a
 complete control over the heat, which was not so in the other
  method.     The danger attending the boiling pver of sugar was
                                                            immense j

immense ; for, of all bodies, sugar produced the greatest quan
tity of inflammable gas. The oil in the retort was so secured,
that it could not have itself taken fire ; and if gas had been formed,
it must have escaped through the pipe. If a certain quantity of
gas could be collected, and suffered to remain in a particular si
tuation, without any means of escape, until it was approached
by a lighted body, it would undoubtedly explode, and, destroy
the whole building.         But this could not be the case here.. As
the house was not air-tight — as there was a regular way by which
the gas could escape, if any had been generated — it was impossi
ble that the fire could be attributable to gas.      If any explosion had
taken place, its effects must have been seen.         The oil- vessel, and
every  thing   in  and  about  the retort, would   have  been destroyed.
   Cross-examined. —The oil with which he made his experi
ments was sent to him by Mr. Wilson.                He hoped that some
unadulterated oil was still to be had.         He could distinguish new
oil from oil that had been used.         The latter was thick and ge
latinous.     He repeated his experiments several times, and found
no difference.      Sugar generated gas at 350 degrees.
    Mr. W. Allen stated that he was a chemist, and had studied
that science for several years.       He had looked at the model, and
his decided opinion was, that the method employed by Mr. Wil
son was by far the safer plan.       The reason of the preference must
be obvious to all who knew what an inflammable body sugar was,
and how easily it became ignited.          If fire were placed under    it,
there was  a   great risk that   it  would boil over, and   in  that case
a  conflagration was inevitable.        By  the   new  method, train oil
was heated and conveyed through pipes,               by which means the
sugar  was   melted    in the  most  commodious as well as the safest
way.     One principal reason which induced him to consider this
method the most safe was, that the sugar might be brought to
boil  by  the application of heat, from which no danger need be
apprehended.        He had made experiments with oil, and observed
that whale-oil would not give out any permanent or elastic             in
flammable gas, unless the heat nearly approached to the tem
perature of 600 degrees of Fahrenheit.          It    would before that
produce    a  little vapour, but that was often nothing else but
aqueous particles which were In the oil. With respect to the
difference between new and old oil, he observed that the latter
began to generate gas at little lower temperature than the for
                             a
mer.    The difference was, however, very trifling, but          afew de
grees  of  Fahrenheit's    scale.   Looking   to the construction of that
model, and particularly to the gas-pipe, he was convinced that
if  any person had left the whole apparatus to its fate, and paid
no attention to it, danger would not have been occasioned, since

the gas, if any were formed, would be gradually carried off by
the tube.      It would require a good deal of time, and much la
bour, to raise the heat to 6 or 700 degrees of Fahrenheit.               Such
heat would decompose the sugar ; and               if,in consequence, gas
were produced,      it would find its way through the steam-vent, and
out of the house.          Ifthe heat were increased even to 400 de
grees, it  would    be at the  risk of decomposing the sugar, and con
verting that article into gas.           Looking to the construction of
the machine and of the house, he did not think that any explo
sion could have taken place              any gas which one apparatus of
                                         by
that kind could have produced.            He conceived that the gas from
the lamps    in  the manufactory was infinitely more dangerous than
any that could have been generated in the retort.                 He visited
and examined the ruins some time ago, to discover whether there
was any trace of an explosion but he could not perceive
                                     ;                              a  fissure
in  any part of the premises, or the least appearance of any. con
cussion having taken place.            Fixed oils, train-oil, linseed-oil,
&c, were so called to distinguished them from the essential or
volatile oils which were produced             bydistillation. The former
required     a great degree of heat before they could be converted
into vapour, while the latter went off in the most rapid manner.
There were no two things in nature more different than fixed and
volatile oils.
  J.   Barry, Esq. stated, that he was practical chemist, and had
                                              a
examined the model before the court.             The new mode of sugar-
refining   was   much  safer  than  that  formerly adopted.      In the first
place,  it  avoided that temperature of heat at which sugar was
liable to boil over or to catch fire in the pan.           Sugar would boil
over at 250 or 260 degrees, whereas oil required 650 or 700 de
grees to accomplish that object.           He had seen       very inflamma
                                                               a
ble gas formed from oil at the temperature of 565, but not              in any
great quantity.       It required more than 600 degrees to produce
any large portion of gas.         Mr. Wilson's method of refining sugar
was    byfar the best, because there was no fire under the pans,
and the heat could be so easily turned off.               inconsequence of

sufficient in quantity to do any mischief.         It would be discharged
into the steam-vent, whence          it would immediately escape-           He
knew    of no   instance  of  inflammable    gas being heavier than     com
mon air.      Sugar would emit       a  light gas at about 330 degrees.
He found oil, after being much boiled, produce gas at rather a
lower temperature than          itdid when new. New oil produced gas
at 585 degrees, old oil at 568.

    Mr. R. Walker, a civil engineer, stated, that he had viewed
the premises after the fire, and gave the same account of the state
of the retort as Mr. Wilson had previously done.
    Mr. C. Sylvester stated, that he had directed his attention to
the apparatus exhibited in court, with a view to give evidence
that day. According to the old mode of boiling sugar much mis
chief was risked.      The new mode he considered to be much less
dangerous.      The  preventing the fire from coming in contact with
the pan must be extremely beneficial.        He heard Mr. Wilson's
evidence, and did not differ from him in any thing.             He was
present at certain experiments that were made on sugar and oil
by Mr. Cooper.       The oil was procured by Mr. Wilson.        He ob
served the alteration of the temperature every five minutes. The
temperature increased much quicker in the early part of the ope
ration than towards the end. The heat was 575 or 580 degrees
before inflammable gas was generated.          The oil that had been
boiled produced gas at a temperature of about 20 degrees less
than that which was new.        He thought it would be exceedingly
difficult to produce such a heat by this apparatus.       It would re
quire two or three hours, with the utmost care, to raise the tem
perature so high.       If gas were formed in the retort, it would
ascend ; and there being several apertures, it must escape.         At
first, it  could  only  accumulate   in very small  quantities.   Con
structed as it was, there could be no combustion in the retort it
self.    Such an event could not be effected by any leaking of oil
into the fire.
    Mr. J. T.ACooper stated, that he was acquainted with this ma
chine and work, and also with the old mode of refining sugar.
He conceived that the new one was much preferable. Elastic
gas could be produced from old oil at the temperature of 570 or
580 in small quantities.      That was the lowest temperature at
which it could be generated : if it were wished to procure it in a
large quantity, the heat must be raised much higher.            He had
never procured permanent inflammable gas under 610 degrees.
 If gas had been formed in the retort, it would have escaped by
different apertures.     It would ascend, and could not have accu
mulated to any dangerous extent.          Considering the apparatus,
there was no likelihood that gas would have been generated ; but
if it had, it would have gone off by the pipe. There was a dif
ference of betwixt 10 and 15 degrees of temperature between the
heat at which old and new oil would produce gas. After the heat
arrived at a certain temperature, it was most difficult to add to
it. In 40 minutes he had raised the heat of oil from 20 to 350
degrees, and to raise it from 350 to 600 or 610 degrees occupl d
nearly two hours and a half more. In the latter minutes he could
 hardly get it up at all.

    Cross-examined. — He did not think that old oil would give
gas at 460.     He did not know whether the oi'tener oil was heated
the more inflammable it became.
    Mr. R. Henley agreed with the last witness as to his experi
ments with oil and sugar, and was of opinion that the new pro
cess was superior to the old.
    H. Goxwell, Esq., secretary to the committee of chemistry in
the Society of Arts, had made experiments on the relative com
bustibility of oil and sugar. He was present at those made by
Mr. Cooper, and agreed altogether in the account the other
scientific gentlemen had given. The new process was, he thought,
infinitely less hazardous than the old one.       He thought there
was no sort of danger in boiling the oil.
    Thomas Gill, Esq., chairman to the committee of mechanism
in the Society of Arts, also witnessed the experiments of Mr.
Cooper, and entirely coincided in opinion with him.
    The Chief Justice here observed, that it was useless to call
any more witnesses to those facts.      They had heard the evidence
of Mr. Accum, Mr. Allen,     Mr.  Cooper, arid several other gentle
men well versed in science and mechanics ; and to call others to
the same points, though it might swell the number of the wit
nesses, would not add to the weight of testimony.
    Mr. Scarlett said, he would show, by a series pf experiments
made by men of the first eminence, that his clients had a good
defence.
    Mr. J. Deville and Mr. Blamer were then called : they both
agreed in the superiority of the new over the old plan, and de
posed to the difficulty with which gas can be produced from oil,
and the comparative ease with which it can be formed from
sugar.
    Henry May was again examined by Mr. Scarlett. — When lie
called to Muller, he did not know whether the gas-lamps were
lighted or not.    He heard Muller speak, but he did not see him.
He had worked 24 years with his master. Muller had been there
about a year and a half.      He did not know whether there was
any other man in the fill-room with Muller.
    This closed the case for the plaintiffs.
    Mr. Scarlett proceeded to   address  the jury for the defendants.
It  was with unfeigned reluctance that he was obliged to occupy
a considerable   portion of their time, after the great attention
which they had yesterday paid to this cause.         He should not,
however, trespass longer on their time than was absolutely neces
sary; for, independently of his desire to consult the convenience
of his lordship and the jury, he was under the necessity of being
as brief as possible, in consequence of his own indisposition, oc
                                                             casioned

 teasioncd by the great professional labour to which he had lately
  been subjected in 'Other places.     This was in itself an important
  cause, and its importance was increased by its being one in con
 sidering which it    was extremely difficult   to divest one's self of
  that natural wish   which every well-constituted mind was likely
  to cherish for the  success of a suffering party.     He agreed with
  his learned friend  the Solicitor-general,   that the plaintiffs were
  gentlemen of great respectability; and it was far from his, inten
  tion to impute to them any fraud, or even blame.        But that cir
  cumstance gave additional importance to a question such as the
. present, because, when a decision was made which was founded
  on the principles of law and justice, in opposition to the natural
  wishes of the heart, it exhibited the triumph of justice over par
  tiality. The defendants also were gentlemen of great respecta
  bility, and had no wish to be exempted from any responsibility
  to which in justice they were liable ; there were claims on them,
  however, as a society, which they were bound by the ties of ho
  nour rigorously to discharge.      It would evidently be futile for
  societies to establish rules respecting insurance against fire, if
  whenever a case occurred these rules were to be opposed as con
  trary to the claims of justice.    He should follow the example of
  his learned friend in endeavouring to disembarrass the question of
  technical forms.     The points for the consideration of the jury
  resolved themselves substantially into three questions; and, how
  ever widely the matter might be scattered over the record, they
  would find that on one or all of these grounds the defendants
  were entitled to their verdict.     The first question related to the
  description of the premises — a point which had hardly been
  touched upon as yet ; and he affirmed that the premises insured
  had not been properly described.         The second question was,
  whether the fire had been caused by the introduction of a new
  process, which required the boiling of oil. And the third was,
  whether this new process increased the risk ; which question,
  though it might be illustrated by the preceding one, was not ne
   cessarily connected with it. On the first of these points, he
  presumed that in this place, and before his evidence, he need
  not state that a description of premises incorporated their con
  nexion with other buildings.      The Solicitor-general had referred
  to the Building Act ; but by that act no communication was al
  lowed between a building of this description and a dwelling-house;
  and to a warehouse a communication was allowed only by an iron
   door.    In every policy effected on buildings of this kind, it was
  unquestionably the duty of the persons executing it to state in
  what manner premises insured communicated with other build
  ings.    The jury would bear in mind that the premises of the
  plaintiffs comprised three houses — the long-house, the grinding-
                                                                  house,

270                  On the Volatility and Inflammability
 house, and the new house.        The insurance in this case was ef
 fected on the grinding-house ; and though the fire did not ori
 ginate in     it,
                the question was, whether they did not all form one
 building  : they were all surrounded          by
                                                common wall

 worked in this, every species of work was done in that, and there
 was  a mill in another they all communicated

                                                                    a
 the house insured.      But the buildings were improperly described,
 because   itappeared they communicated with others which were
 not specified in the policy. He was instructed to say, that the so
 ciety would not have made this objection to the validity of the po
 licy,if   had only omitted to state the communication between the
          it
 grinding-house and the long-house for they had formerly insured
                                         ;
 the long-house           by
                         separate policy, and therefore knew before
                            a
 hand that      was separated from the other
               it                                         by
                                                    an iron door. They
 therefore would have waved this objection, though in point of
 law they were not obliged to carry in their memory the descrip
 tions contained in every policy that they had ever underwritten.
 There had, however, been no former policy describing the con
 nexion between the grinding-house and the new house. The
 learned counsel then read part of the policy executed on the
 grinding-house on the 21st of October last, which was merely,
 he said,  a transcript of former policy, and made no mention of
                                a
 a communication either with the long-house or the new house.
 To the omission of the former they would not have objected, for
 the reason which he had already assigned but he contended;
 that the policy was defective in omitting to state the connexion
 between the grinding-house and the new house, though                ap     it
 peared that they were connected          by
                                           iron doors, and that every
 story of the one communicated with the corresponding story of
 the other.     His learned friend had omitted noticing this circum
 stance in his opening speech, reserving            it,
                                                 no doubt, for the con
 clusion, when the attention of the court and the jury should be
 fatigued      by
               the length of the trial, and when          might perhaps
                                                               it
 have some chance of being glossed over.         In the printed notices
of the society,      was laid down as
                      it                 aregulation, that " extraor
                                      by
 dinary risks must be insured         a  special agreement."       Now,
this notice was given to the public for the express purpose of in
 ducing them to give correct descriptions of the premises to be
 insured   ;and then the society were to be left to judge of the risk.
It  was evident that, as the risk was increased           the number of
                                                               by
 stoves on the premises,       was necessary to state the number of
                                it
these stoves,      order to enable the party insuring to judge of the
                     in
risk.    Whether,       in this case
                           if           acorrect description had been
given, competition would have induced the defendants to take the
insurance with the additional risk, was       consideration with which
                                               a
                                                                     the

 the jury had nothing to do; the only question for them to de
 cide was, whether a correct description of the premises ha
 had not been given.      In his opinion, the communication between
 these buildings was most important : and, if they were of that
opinion also, they could have no hesitation in coming to a deci
 sion on the validity of this policy. With these remarks he should
 dismiss the first of the questions.      He came then to the other
two points, which had already occupied so much time.              Not
withstanding any impression that might have been made on the
minds of the jury by the evidence which they had heard yester
day, he was convinced that the fire was occasioned by the pro
 cess of boiling oil ; and the plaintiffs knew it : they knew it well.
Did the jury observe with what great caution his learned friend
had laid down the doctrine, that parties were not obliged to ac
count for the origin of fires ?      He had said, that this fire might
have arisen from the lighting of a candle, or from various causes
of which no chemist ever dreamed. But why should the jury,
when called on to give a verdict, be left to their own conjectures,
when positive and important evidence, which it was in his learn
ed friend's power to produce, had not been brought forward ?
Where was the man who lighted the fire in the morning ? Where
was the watchman ? His learned friend had first examined Duke,
a millwright, who was to give the whole description and history
of the general mode of conducting the process ; and it turned
out on his (Mr. Scarlett's) cross-examination of him, that he
had never attended for five minutes together, and that he could
not tell whether the machine leaked or not.         Then the engine-
keeper   had  been  called, who   at three o'clock found  the watch
man by whom the fire had been lighted.           Now surely, when a
fire like this had occurred, the plaintiffs were bound to give all
the information on the subject which their servants could com
municate, and the jury were bound to derive evidence from a
witness not called, as well as from those brought forward.         The
evidence of May, the engine-keeper, was of great importance.
He found that the watchman at three o'clock had lighted the
fire.   He asked Muller whether he was ready, and whether the
fire was lighted under the oil ; to which Muller replied, that he
was not quite ready.     He saw no fire, no light, at a quarter after
three o'clock ; but he said there was a lamp lighted in the grind-
ing-house, as usual, all the people having to pass through it. In
a quarter of an hour afterwards he came back, and Muller said
he would be ready in a few minutes ; and then there was no token
of fire or light in the warehouse. But it did not rest here. At
nine o'clock on the preceding night he was the last person who
left the premises without any light ; at three o'clock in the morn
ing there was no light ; at a quarter past three there was no

 light  ; and ten minutes after he heard an alarm of fire.   He went
 back, and saw to his left an appearance of flame or fire on the
 floor.   Now the jury, on examining the plan, would see whether
 a flame from the steam-bin might not easily have been mistaken
 for a fire on the floor, especially as the witness said he saw only
 a glimpse of it.    But where was Muller ? His learned friend in
not bringing him forward had exercised a sound discretion, and
had taken the only course that could give his clients any chance
of success ; but he (Mr. Scarlett) had had too much experience
of juries in that place, to fear that this circumstance would not
have its due weight with the jury whom he now had the honour
 to address.    It was clear that the alarm had been given by Mul
ler, and, by his not being produced, they were called on to be
lieve that the fire did not originate in a place where it was proved
by all the witnesses that a fire had existed for an hour before the
 alarm was given.      In further considering this part of the case,
 he must, in some degree, mix it up with the other question ; but
he would first observe, that Mr. Wicks had a good deal perplexed
the case of the plaintiffs.    He had been roused by the rattle of
the watchman when the alarm was given ; and this watchman
would be examined, and the jury from his evidence would be able
 to judge of the probable cause of the fire.       He would suppose
 that a man in an opposite street saw an immense body of flame
 bursting through a window on the back part of the premises, and
 rising in a column to the opposite houses; was it not probable
 that the fire originated in that part of the building where it was
seen? But, whatever might have been the cause of the fire, the
jury must be convinced that the plaintiffs had not laid before
them all the evidence which they might have produced.             He
should now endeavour to show that the fire did not originate in
the warehouse, but must have proceeded from the apparatus used
in the new process ; and this brought him to the consideration
of the third question — the increase of risk.     He wished to speak
with respect of all the scientific gentlemen who had been examined
yesterday.      He wished, however, that Mr. Brande and Mr.
Parkes had conducted the same train of experiments as his wit
nesses had done, and then he had no doubt they would have stated
very different opinions from those which the jury had heard yes
terday.     It was not by one or two experiments that questions in
chemistry could be decided, for that science underwent continual
fluctuation, and its principles required more patient investigation
than those of any other science.       In his younger days, what was
called the phlogistic theory was very prevalent, in consequence
of Dr. Priestley's writings; and the late celebrated Dr. Milner
certainly gave very brilliant lectures on the subject, which he
(Mr. Scarlett) attended. . He probably should have been also led
  ,                                                             away

 away by this theory, had he not happened to form an intimacy
 with that eminent man, the late Mr. Tennant, of whom he would
 say, if he might be allowed to go out of his way to pay a compli
 ment to departed merit, that he united jn himself more diversity
 of talent and comprehensiveness of genius than any man of this age.
 Mr. Tennant told him not to be led away by this theory, for the
 French were changing the whole nomenclature of the science,
 and all this phlogistic theory would in consequence be soon over
 turned.     On hearing this, he had desisted from the study, and
 the result had verified the prediction of Mr. Tennant. Since that
 time, Sir Humphry Davy had worked another revolution in the
 names of chemical substances, and perhaps the present genera
 tion might be fated to witness another change.        This variety of
 classification and frequent substitution of one defective nomen
 clature for another, arose from the propensity of men to genera
 lize from particular appearances.      It appeared to him that Mr.
 Wilson was meddling with a subject which he did not understand,
when he spoke of the properties of oil.         It turned out, on his
evidence, that he was the only person who ever applied this prin
 ciple to the boiling of sugar.    In London the plaintiffs were the
only persons    who  used it.  Wilson,   indeed, wished to insinuate;
that another house had adopted it; but all they did was, to al
low him to make an experiment, and then they rejected the
plan merely because it was too dangerous.           It was worthy of
notice, that Mr. Harris of Liverpool, who had adopted this pro
cess, thought it necessary to communicate the circumstance to
the insurance-office, although the risk had been proved to be less
than from tallow, which he had formerly used in boiling sugar.
Now, with regard to the risk of this process, it was said tp.be
less than that of the ordinary process, for two reasons : first, that
sugar at 350 degrees of heat emitted gas highly inflammable;
and, secondly, that there was danger of the sugar boiling over.
On that part of the case the plaintiffs had called only Mr. Ro
binson, and Mr. Harris from Liverpool ; but he would defy his
learned friend to produce any sugar-refiner who would say that
he had ever seen a sugar-boiler overflowing.         Sugar boiled for
their purpose at 240, and, if raised to a greater heat, it would
defeat their object.     Whenever, therefore, it rose higher, they
threw water on the fire to damp it ; and besides, while the perr
sonal security of those attending the process required caution,
there would be little danger of >the boiler being allowed to over
flow.     The real risk of a sugar-house arose from the multiplicity
of stoves and fires, by which a greater mass of combustibles than
was collected in almost any other manufactory was exposed to
danger.      He defied his learned friend to produce any instance o.
sugar   ever  having been boiled to a heat of 350 degrees, unles*

   274            On the Volatility and Inflammability
   in the experiments of chemists.          It was alleged that sugar was
    liable to boil over ill an inflammable state, and that, as there was
   no fire into which it could overflow, the danger was diminished
   by thij new process. This statement had at first view an ap
   pearance of plausibility; but on reflection it would be found per
   fectly puerile, for it reduced the whole danger to the overboiling
   of the sugar-pan — an accident which no sugar-boiler ever dreaded.
   On the danger arising from the boiling of oil he was completely at
   issue with his learned friend.       It was important to consider the
  variations   in  the  evidence    on this subject.    Mr. Wilson proved
  roundly that oil of whatever age, and however long used, exhi
  bited no difference in heat.         Mr. Accum stated, that when he
  tried old oil it produced the same effects- at 460 as new oil at
  600 ; and Mr. Parkes found the same effects produced at 586
  that Mr. Wilson found at 600.            He thought the jury would be
  satisfied from the evidence of Mr. Accum, which was clear and
  distinct, that Mr. Wilson's theory of oil was not so perfect as he
  supposed.      All those who were accustomed to work in oil knew,
  that the longer it had been used, and the more frequently it had
 been heated, the more inflammable it became.              The variety was
  endless; at 310 old oil would produce effects of combustion,
  which new oil at 600 would not produce. Those who extracted
 oil from blubber never attained a greater heat than 2 10; because,
 beyond that degree it became uncontrollable.           It was a substance
 which was very reluctant to part with its heat, and in a certain
 state, even some minutes after it had been taken off the fire, it
 produced destructive effects.        The learned counsel then exhibited
 a phial containing a liquid which had been distilled from new oil.
 If he were to take out the cork, and apply a light at a small di
 stance, the vapour would flame ; but if the light were applied
 nearer, it would explode, though without noise.              He refrained
 from making the experiment at present, from the disagreeable
 smell which it would produce in the court ; but the results which
 he had stated would be, mentioned in evidence.            He particularly
 directed the attention of the jury to the fact that the explosion
was not attended with noise.           This distillation had been made
from «ew oil at the heat       of 600 ; but if the oil had been used for
twenty-four days, the same effect would have been produced at
410.       Those who were engaged in extracting gas from oil were
aware of the extreme danger attending the heating of that sub
stance ; and that it required a greater degree of skill and caution
than any other combustible matter.           The company, understand
ing that this    was  the case, employed scientific men to make ex
periments on the subject ; and the results of these experiments
would be submitted to the jury.           They would hear the detaHs of
a series of experiments, continued for twelve successive days, on
                                                                  twenty-

                               of Fish. Oil.                       275
twenty-four gallons of oil, heated to from 300 to 400 degrees.
From the evidence of Mr. Faraday, Dr. Bostock, Mr. Children,
Mr. Garden, and Mr. Martineau, the jury would be informed of
some effects arising from the heating of oil, of which they had not
heard before.      Besides the aqueous vapour of which they had
 heard, the oil produced another vapour, highly inflammable and
of greater specific gravity than atmospheric air. They would
find that in one of the experiments to which he had referred, the
oil, at the heat of 460, had boiled up and rushed to the roof, to
 the height of seven feet.       Now, in the apparatus used by the
 plaiutiffs, the vapour  arising   from the oil was carried off by the
 vent,   which  went  to  the   chimney- top; but if that vapour was
 heavier than the atmosphere, it must descend, and the steam-bin
 being considerably lower than the vent, it might fall into it ; and,
 being highly inflammable, it might set .on fire any combustible
 substance on the floor.      The learned gentleman illustrated this
 supposition by   the  familiar   case of a smoky chimney, and con
 tended that the same causes which produced .the one effect might
 produce the other.      He did not say it had been the case, but it
 was possible that, on the morning in which the fire took place,
 the wind might have been in such a direction as by an eddy to
 have forced the gas down the steam-vent into the bin.              His
 learned friend said the steam-vent had a draught upwards, by
 the working of the steam-engine ; but it was to be remembered
 that the engine was not at work at that time, and that was a most
 important fact in the case ; Muller had not got the engine to
 work when the fire took place, aud that, no doubt, was the rea
 son why he had not been called.           The boiler at first must, on
 account of the coldness of the sugar, be heated to a greater de
 gree than the average heat necessary during the day; and this
 being done while the pump was not at work, the mischief he had
 described was likely to take place. Now, since the fire had taken
 place at the time Muller was heating the oil — since the pump
 was not then work — and since Muller, who was the workman em
 ployed on the occasion, had not been called— he would leave it
  to the jury to judge whether this was not the most likely cause
 of the fire. What he had now said he should substantiate by as
 great a body of evidence as ever was submitted to a jury ; and if
  the jury should be of opinion either that the fire was occasioned
 by the cause which he had assigned, or that the danger and risk
  were increased by the introduction of this new process, or that
  the description of the premises was defective — on either of these
 grounds his clients would be entitled to a verdict.
     Samuel Willoughby, a fellowship-porter, recollected the morn
 ing in which the fire took place.        He lived at No. 10, Charles-
  street, about 100 yards from '     the premises.  A few minutes be*
                                     U 2                            fore

    276             On the Volatility and inflammability
    fore four o'clock he came to the corner of the premises, and in a
   •moment he saw a large body of fire, and the window from which
    it issued flew out. (The witness here identified the window- in
   the model.)      If he had been opposite to the window he should
    never have told any thing about the fire, for the body of fire that
   burst out would have knocked a horse down.        He saw no smoke;
    he gave an alarm immediately.          The flame then ascended the
   wall of the building.   Me saw no light on the floor of the house.
    It was a wet morning when he went out of his house. The first
   person who came to him was Clayton the watchman, who at his
   desire sprung his rattle.   It was in the first long window in tli£
   central part of the building that he saw the fire.
       John Clayton, a watchman, confirmed the testimony of the
   preceding witness.     The only person he saw after springing his
   rattle was Wilson, the private watchman belonging to the house.
   When he was springing his rattle, he saw Wilson at the door of
   the Mulberry-tree public-house, taking down a kind of covering
   he had for shelter.      He could not tell what became of Wilson
  after that. When he looked in at the window, the inside seemed
   to be all a body of fire.   The flame burnt continually, and had
  nothing particular in its appearance.       He heard no explosion.
 -     Cross-examined. — The windo\y from top to bottom was all in
   a blaze.
       Examined by the Court. — Part of the premises lay in his beat.
  He was up at the building at half-past three, and saw no fire or
  smoke at that time issuing from any part of the building.
      John Young, clerk to Mr. Lockey, a surveyor, deposed, that
  his master was employed to make a perspective drawing of the
  premises.      Witness was on the spot within three or four weeks
 of the time at which the fire happened, and was acquainted with
 the premises.       He did not at that time know the connexion be
 tween the several parts of the building, but Mr. Lockey did. The
 grinding-house is near the centre.         He understood that the fire
 broke out in the long sugar-house.          He believed" there was a
 communication between the long sugar-house and the grindingr
 bouse, but he really did not know whether there was any between
 the long sugar- and the new sugar-house. He could not say, from
his own knowledge, whether there was any connexion between
the grinding-house and the new sugar-house.             (As it appeared
that the witness had no precise knowledge of the premises, his
examination was broken off.)          "
     •Samuel Lockey,' a surveyor, was the next witness called. He
 stated that he had been employed by the plaintiffs to make a
drawing of their premises some months ago.          In so doing he had

-projected alteration.      It was a considerable time, certainly above
.twelve months previous to this, that he had examined the pre
 mises on behalf of the Phoenix Company.              When Mr. Bishop
 first mentioned that he was about to introduce a boiler, witness
 did not conceive that any increased hazard would be incurred.
  He did not, in fact, exercise any opinion upon the subject, nor
 had he pointed out any particular spot as best adapted to the
 purpose.     Being employed by the plaintiffs in a private capacity,
 he was in the habit of frequently visiting their premises.       It was
 at some time during the last spring that Mr. Bishop took him to a
 door in the building which was not in the plan, when he observed,
 " I have something to mention between ourselves— I want to put
 something up here for a new process." Witness was then led to
 an upper floor, where he was told that it was in contemplation
  to erect a boiler, and was asked whether in his opinion it could
 stand there.     At first oil was not mentioned, but he understood,
 before he went away, that the projected boiler was for the heating
 of oil. He did not form at that time any judgement with regard
 to the probable risk that might attend it. The only observation
 which he then made was, that a brick trimmer would be neces
 sary under the boiler. He should have thought that equally requi
 site, had the boiler been for water.      To him the subject presented
 itself more as a question of curiosity, than of reflection or calcula
 tion as to the success of the measure.          Had he been employed
 by the Insurance Company to inspect the premises, and found
 that an oil-boiler had been newly introduced, he should doubtles*
 have thought it his duty to communicate that circumstance to
 the office.   He had no recollection of making a report at the
 instance of the Phoenix Office in September 1818.           This might
be owing to the frequency of his visits to the premises in ques
tion.      On the occasion to which he had before alluded he was
privately consulted by Mr. Bishop, and undertook not to reveal
what had been communicated to him.               The morning after the
fire witness met him, and said, he was sorry to find what had
happened, but glad that one part of the building was safe.            On
being    asked for  what   reason,  he  replied,
                                                  " Why,  because  there
you have been trying your new experiments."              Mr. Bishop ex
pressed himself in the negative; and in answer to a question
whether he had concealed the new process from his partners
as well as the office, he said they      '
                                           all knew it as well as him

    The Lord Chief Justice here remarked, that it was now ob
vious why the defendant's counsel had preferred calling Mr.
Lockey's clerk rather than himself.          It arose from a motive of
delicacy, and a reluctance to draw forth a disclosure of what had
been mentioned in confidence.          •                                 ,

 278            On the Volatility and Inflammability
    In answer to a question by a juryman,the witness added, that
he was sure as to the words he addressed to Mr. Bishop,       " Have
 you kept this a secret from your partners as well as from the of
fices ?" He asked this, from a fear that he might be blamed by
his partners had he been making experiments without their know
ledge, and because he concluded, from what had before passed
between them, that Mr. Bishop was desirous of keeping the mat
ter secret from the insurance office.    The object of this secrecy
was, he (witness) believed, to conceal the new process from other
sugar-refiners, and that a thought of the increased risk never en
tered his mind.
    William Christopher, a bricklayer in the employment of Messrs.
Craven and Beaumont, recollected setting up, under Mr. Wil
son's directions, an apparatus for boiling and circulating oil, upon
their premises,     it was set up on a detached place, and, as he
understood, merely as a matter of experiment.      It was tried four
teen different times; and Mr.Wilson was absent not above once or
twice upon these occasions.      The boiler stood upon an arch in
a separate building, about thirty feet from the sugar-house.        It
was twice heated, according to Mr. Wilson's directions, to a tem
perature of 210, before Mr. Wilson arrived.      He himself used to
raise it to 300 or 400, in order to communicate the proper de
gree of heat to the whole mass.      The pumping was then begun,
and on one occasion the pump was stopped, and the heat rose to
500.      The door was then thrown open, and the fire damped.
The pipes were of pewter, and broke once or twice when the
oil was mixed with sugar.        One day, toward the finish, whilst
the oil was at 210, the pan was discharged, and the pump being
stopped, it rose suddenly to 500.     It had not stopped above five
minutes before the pipes burst. Mr.Wilson began again to pump,
and afterwards proceeded to rake outthe fire. The heat, however,
increased till it got as high as 600.    Witness threw several pails
of water upon the fire, but without producing any diminution of
the heat.     Mr. Wilson and two gentlemen with him then re
tired, and witness also, when he found the oil continue to come
out of the boiler.
    Cross-examined. — Mr. Wilson was at this time making ex
periments.     The pipes were not of copper, but pewter. No
thing   like a fire was caused by the accident he had described.
The thermometer was graduated only to 600, and the tempera
ture of the oil rose to that.
   Samuel Wilkinson stated that he was foreman to Messrs. Tay
lor aad Martineau, chemists' and engineers, and had been directed
by the former in February last to make some experiments in oil.
Mr. Martineau, one of the partners, tried a boiler on the 13th
with a small quantity of whale-oil. Witness was directed to add
                                                              a large

                              of Fhli Oil.      .                279
 a large quantity, or about two-thirds more than was at first put
 into the vessel.    The whole quantity amounted to about twentv
or thirty gallons.     The vessel resembled that exhibited in the
 model; it was about three feet long, fifteen inches wide, and
 fifteen. in depth.   It was made of wrought iron connected with
 rivets. This experiment was continued only for a few hours. Mr.
 Taylor wished to ascertain whether common oil mixed with oil
 previously boiled, would jwoduce inflammable vapour at a low
 temperature.      They could not ascertain the temperature till it
 came to 80 degrees.      A vapour, with considerable noise, began
 to rise at about 100 degrees; and at 280 degrees a light was se
veral times applied to the top of the tube. The vapour then took
 fire with sudden gusts, as -with an explosionin the boiler. By ex
 plosion he meant a noise like that of fat boiling: it burnt only
when a light was applied to the tube.      When a candle was held
to the vapour it assumed an appearance like that of lightning.
 The thermometer broke at a temperature of 348 degrees. He be
lieved he broke the stem with his hand, but the ball was also
broken, and this could not have happened in that way. Witness
 afterwards received directions to empty the boiler, to clean it
well out, and charge it with 33 gallons of new whale-oil, which
 had never before been subjected to any experiment.        This was
on the -16th February, and the experiment was continued during
twelve days.      The fire was generally made about six o'clock, and
kept up eleven hours each day.       The boiler was always suffered
to cool during the night-time.      The highest degree to which the
oil was ever heated was 507.       On the first day the highest was
380, and no inflammable vapour was produced.          The tube em
ployed on this occasion was about four feet in height.       On the
second day the temperature was at 375, and at that degree the
air appeared slightly inflammable.        On the third day, at 395,
there were no symptoms of inflammability ; but on the fourth the
lowest temperature at which it was produced was 348.         At 360
the vapour took fire on the application of a light, and witness
then remarked that a difference was created by the slow or brisk
burning of the fire.      At 380, with a slow fire, the vapour was
scarcely inflammable, but with a sharp one was highly so at 360.
On the fifth day inflammability appeared at 365, 360, and 345.
On the sixth day, the vapour was highly inflammable at 345.
The seventh day arrived, and twelve gallons of oil were taken out.
of the boiler, (the oil in their boiler being deeper than in that
indicated by the model,) in order to make the experiment as fair
as possible.    The highest degree to which it was that day heated
was 390, but at 335 it threw out a slightly inflammable vapour.

    Jure abavi 400; but, after the quantity was reduced, he received
    directions to raise it as high as 500.     On the eighth day he ac
    cordingly carried it to that point.    Inflammability took place at
    360, but at 500 he took a rule and measured the vapour, which
    extended seven inches above the tube.          When a light. was ap
    plied   toit,   had
                    it    the  appearance   of  lightning.  The vapour
    took fire on the ninth day at 497, and the heat rose 140 degrees'
    in fifteen minutes.   The fire-place was twenty inches long, ten
    inches wide, and there was       space of ten inches from the bot

    became inflammable at 345 degrees, and spread as before like
    lightning. At one time on the same day           appeared as inflam

        Cross-examined. — The notes to which he had referred were
     written  by   himself at the time of making the experiment.        The
     same oil was used during the whole twelve days, and he did not
     observe that much was wasted at the end.              He could not ac
     count for the inflammability taking place at         much lower tem-

    combustions before         arrived at that degree. The result of his

    experiments was, that the use of           for the purposes of refining

    medium, must be attended with considerable danger. He had
    found, too, that sugar would throw out gases at a temperature of
    240 degrees.      Oil, after distillation, was rendered more volatile
    and inflammable than before, and the vapour would explode fre
    quently without any noise.                                             .
        Mr. Richard Phillips deposed that he had had occasion to
    make chemical experiments on the subject of this inquiry, and
    he found that volatile oil was created from fixed oil

             Bostock, physician, and lecturer on chemistry at Guy's
    Hospital, described an experiment which he had seen in White-

    temperature of the oil was raised in twenty minutes from 360 to
    460,at which point it threw out some highly inflammable vapours,
    as also jets of flame.  He considered the practice of employing
    it ina boiler to be extremely hazardous;          and thought that a
  conflagration produced by it would exhibit appearances similar to
  those which were described to have actually taken place at the
  fire in question.   This judgement he formed on the result of his
  inquiries  on a small scale.
      This evidence was further confirmed by that of Mr. Children.
      Mr. John Taylor, chemist and engineer, was next called, and
 stated, that he had been in' the habit of producing gas from oil.
  With regard to the possibility of a current of air descending
 through a pipe or tube, through which the draught generally
  ascended, it might depend greatly on the state of the wind.            A
 vapour created in the manner referred to would rather coruscate
 like lightning than explode with any noise. He was acquainted
 with the ordinary process of boiling and refining sugar, and did
 not apprehend that there was the slightest danger attending it.
  He was however of opinion that the new process was extremely
  hazardous.
     Mr. John Martineau and Mr. W. Daniel, both sugar-refiners,
 also described the mode in which that operation was carried on
 in ordinary cases, and expressed their conviction that it was not
 attended with any risk of conflagration.
     Mr. Arthur Aikin stated, that he had long made chemical pur
 suits his study, and about four or five years ago was led to make
 some experiments on oil.        The oil he chiefly used was whale-oil,
 which was of a viscid and gelatinous nature, and contained a great
 deal of animal jelly.    This, when exposed to a temperature that
 blackened    it,was decomposed, and produced      a     very volatile and
inflammable oil.     By   distillation   this   inflammabfeojuality    was
greatly increased, and,  if  poured into    the  hand,
                                                    it    would evaporate
like spirits of wine. When      a    viscid fluid like whale-oil was ex
posed to the action of naked fire, its carbonaceous substance was
decomposed, and formed      a   stratum at the bottom. There was an
accumulation of heat in this stratum, much greater than the de
gree indicated      the thermometer placed in the fluid above. He
                    by
thought there must be great danger attending its use, for pur
poses such as those in question; and the result of his own            in
quiries perfectly corresponded with the experiments made         by   pre
ceding witnesses. There was always risk that the boiler would
                                         a
give way under the pressure of the volatile oil.         It   wasa    dan
gerous and unmanageable fluid       ;   and   the  more          it
                                                        frequently     was
subjected to the action of fire, the more volatile and inflammatory
it   became  ;  insomuch that combustion would be produced at
last with a very small degree of heat, and an accident might

 easily happen.     He should conceive, that the moment when an
explosion Was most likely to take place would be that, when,
 after the volatile oil had been detained by the mass standing to
cool all night, the fire was applied on the following
                                                            morning,
 before the pump was set to work.
    Willoughby and Clayton were then again called, and, in an
 swer to a question from the bench, stated, that when they first
 perceived the fire breaking out from the premises of the plaintiffs,
 there was no particular smell, nor did the flame appear of a dif
 ferent colour from that of ordinary fire.
    Here the evidence for the defendants closed.                      .
    The jury afterwards intimated   a wish to have some of the wit
 nesses recalled,  in order to put certain questions to them on the
 same subject.                                                        <
    Mr. Faraday was then recalled, and examined by the foreman
 of the jury.   In his former evidence, he had spoken of an inflam
mable vapour, not of a volatile oil, as arising from the pipe. That
vapour would have burned more or less quietly in proportion to
the quantity of atmospheric air mixed with it.         It required a
proportion of a fourteenth of gas to be explosive.     This was the
vapour of oil at the temperature of 410.        The explosion pro
duced by it would not resemble the explosion of gunpowder.
The explosion of gunpowder was violent in proportion to the
volume of gas produced by the volume of gunpowder, combined
with the rapidity of the inflammation. The explosion of gases
might be generally considered in the same way — that was, the
proportion of the heated gas to the cold gas before it was fired.
The explosion would of course cause a rapid expansion.         When
heated to a white heat, it occupied three or four times more space
than before, and it would expand to that extent in every direction.
All the vapour exploded would have its smell destroyed. The smell
belonged to the vapour, and not to its result or product. The pro
       of the exploded vapour would have other properties, would
       new substances, and enter into new combinations with the,
air into which it exploded.    From the rough experiments he had
made, he thought that inflammable gas would have the same
effect as the oil. The smell, after the explosion, would depend
on the quantity of unconsumed vapour which might get about.
If the proportion of vapour were small, the flame would be blue;
if there was a great quantity of vapour, and more confined, it
would burn brighter.       The common gas-light was an instance
of continuous explosion with the greatest portion of vapour. .,
    Mr. Parkes was next recalled, and asked, by the same juror,
whether he differed from Mr. Faraday, and in what ? He said he
did not concur in all that Mr. Faraday had stated.        He did not
                                                            recollect

                            of Fish Oil.                        283
recollect to have witnessed such explosions as those alluded to.
There might be a smell after an explosion.        The smell caused
by a thunder-storm he considered to proceed from a mixture of
nitrous gas.    There generally was a smell in explosive mixtures.
He thought the smell would be occasioned by part of the gas or
vapour being driven about unconsumed, which would 'retain its
original smell.    He did not believe that any inflammable vapour
would arise from fixed oil at the temperature mentioned.         Ha
thought   it impossible  that any inflammable  gases  could have re-i
mained in the flues at such a heat as was kept up.        They must
have gone into the air as soon as generated.
    If an accumulation of inflammable gas had taken place in the
flues, or in the premises below, where the light was, would it
have exploded like gunpowder, or in what degree ? — I do not
know what experiments others may have made, but 1 think it
impossible that an explosion, as such, could have taken place
without a great noise, which must have been heard in the neigh
bourhood all round.
   Mr. Brande was recalled, and asked, whether he differed, and
in what, from Mr. Parkes; but it appeared from his answers^
that he concurred in Mr. Parkes's opinion.
   Mr. Phillips was next recalled. — In case of an explosion of
vapour from oil in a high state of temperature, he thought there
would be a smell.       He would, by way of illustration, say, that
the common gas, where it escaped without burning, produced a
strong smell, but where it burned there was little or none.        If
there was any accumulation of vapour, it would emit a strong
smell before it exploded.      In explosion it would make a noise,
but that would depend on the quantity of atmospheric air; there
might be no smell after explosion, but he thought there would
be a strong one before it.
    Henry May recalled, and examined by the foreman.         He had
been engine-keeper for twenty-four years.      It was the watchman
who lighted the fire on the morning when the place was burnt.
That man was not here. Witness was usually in the engine-house,
It was about half-past three when the alarm of fire was given.
He had started his own engine before he heard the alarm given.
It might be three-quarters past three when he heard the alarm
given.    When he heard   it, he went to pull up the iron door. The-
fire, when he entered, was on his left. There was not any strong
smell, nor anything in the appearance of the fire different from
others he had seen  ;    he heard no explosion before the fire, nor
after.                                                          ,
   Mr. Lockey was next recalled, hut nothing material was eli
cited from .his re-examination.
                                X   2                          The

2»£            On the Volatility and Inflammability
    The»SAlicitor-general now rose to reply.     The present case he
considered as one of vast importance, not only to his clients, but
to the public at large.     It must indeed be a most grievous dis
appointment     to them,  after all the pains they had taken to pre
serve their property, after having paid a premium for insurance
three times more than was usually given for doubly hazardous
insurance, to have now to pay for that which they imagined they
had so well secured.     But, however grievous the disappointment
and loss might be, if there was any point of law against them,
if there was any just ground why they should not recover the
amount claimed, the jury should give a verdict against them.
This, however, must not be founded on any vague speculation,
nor on conflicting testimony. The grounds of their verdict should
be distinct, and wholly removed from any thing like doubt. Let
the jury now look at the case.      It appeared that before the plain
tiffs had adopted the new process, they had three fires in the
same room, where afterwards they used only one.            They very
naturally conceived (and that such was the fact he would show)
that that diminished the hazard.          Their conduct subsequently
proved that such was their belief; for was it to be supposed that
in an establishment where a capital exceeding 100,000/. had
been invested, and only a part of it insured, that they would
have risked an uninsured property of 30,000/. or 40,000/. by any
plan which they knew to be more hazardous ? His learned friend
had said that the plaiutiffs had not given in the policy a proper
description of the place insured.       To this he answered, that it
was well known to the defendants that only a part of the premises
were insured, and that such part had a communication with other
parts of the building.     But before he came to the other points,
he would say a word as to the necessity of giving a description
of the place near to that insured.       He contended, that even if
 this process was carried on in the part insured, it would not be
necessary to give a description of it, unless the risk was there
by increased.      But how had the defendants themselves thought
 of this increased risk ? Let the jury look to what occurred with
respect to Mr. Harris of Liverpool.        He had applied to the de
fendants for leave to use oil and tallow in his process, and they
endorsed their compliance on the back of the policy without
 charging any additional premium.          Was that the conduct of
men who conceived the hazard increased by the deviation from
 the old process ?     So much for what had been thrown out re
specting the policy.      But it was maintained that this new pro
 cess increased the risk, and caused the fire.    But in order to get
 a verdict on this ground, the fact should be distinctly proved, so
as not to admit of a doubt.       The onus of proof lay upon the de-
k'                                                           fendants.

fetidan'ts.   Now, how did they attempt to prove it ? What was
 the evidence of Mr. Garden — a most intelligent man, and whom
every body knew to be so ?         He considered it a matter of con-         I
jecture (the difference between the two modes) ; but he added,
that, if he Were to form an opinion, he should think the new
process the more dangerous of the two.            Was this the kind of
evidence which should satisfy the minds of the jury that the risk
htid been increased, and that the fire had been caused by it? It            s
was not necessary for him to go in detail through all the parts of
 the evidence.      He would look at the plaintiffs' case only in its'
 principal points.    The first men in Europe and the world in their
 profession had stated that they considered the process adopted
 by the plaintiffs as less dangerous than the former one.          It was
 true that this was met and contradicted on the other side by wit
 nesses highly respectable ; but what had the most respectable
 and intelligent of them said ?        That, only for the experiments,
 made, they would have conceived the new process as less ha
 zardous than the other.      The learned gentleman then proceeded
 to contend that the old plan was attended with more danger than
 the other, and cited as a proof the means which were resorted
to by several to refine sugar without running the risk of its boil
ing over — a risk to which the old plan was constantly exposed.
Mr. Martineau, for this purpose, had recourse to steam, and, in
order to raise the sugar to the required temperature, was obliged
to use the high -pressure steam-engine — an engine which was
confessedly attended with very considerable risk.            It had been
also attempted     to prevent  the  boiling over, by one  of the greatest
chemists of this country, Mr. Howard, who had suggested the
boiling in vacuo ; and at the present moment the defendants were
 proprietors of a patent for preventing this danger.                   >. t
    Mr. Sergeant Blosset here interrupted the Solicitor-general,
and begged to state that he was mistaken ; the defendants had
nothing of the kind; they were not concerned in any sugar-ma
 nufactory.                                                            M
     The Solicitor-general continued.       He had made a mistake;
hut it was one for which the jury would forgive him.              He had
 fallen into it from confounding the present defendants with the
 defendants in another case.       Now, in order to infer the greater
 risk from the use of oil, what had been said ? That oil produced
 an inflammable gas which was extremely dangerous.             What had
 his witnesses said on this point ? That they used common whale-
 oil, and that it produced no gas under a temperature of 500 or
 600.     It was said that he had got gas from oil at a temperature
 of 400, but then that was from oil which had for nineteen months
 been at several times exposed to heat.        Others of the witnesses
                                                                      had

286           On the Volatility and Inflammability
had deposed, that they had got gas from oil at a temperature
aot much above 300 ; but, then, how was this done ? The oik
was got from Mr. Taylor's, and the evidence of Mr. Faraday
showed, that in refining oil some sulphuric acid was used, and this
would cause gas at a lower temperature than if the oil was un->
mixed with any foreign ingredients.    Would not this account for*
the low temperature which was produced ? and would it be ask-,
ing too much,         after having heard Mr. Faraday's evidence, to
suppose     that  some   foreign ingredient was mixed with the oil on
which    the  experiments had been made, and from which gas had
been produced ?          If this were the case, it would reconcile the
apparently conflicting testimony on both sides. According to the
evidence for the plaintiffs, the oil was at a temperature of 34 1 ;
and, when the engine was set in motion, it went down 100, be
 cause it was cooled by passing through the pipes between the
sugar. Was it probable that it would take fire at such a tempera
ture ?    But suppose the oil had gone through several processes,
and been used many times before, what would happen ? Why, it
would have been thick and black, and would have been almost
solid in the cold air : but on examining this oil — and it was taken
out for the purpose six or seven days before — it was found to be
good, only that it was a little blacker.       Was it probable that the
plaintiffs would have used oil of so unmanageable a quality as this
would be in such a case ? Why, it would cool in the pipes at the
extremity, and could not be worked. What, then, was the deduc
tion from this ?       Was it not that the oil used by the plaintiffs
had not gone through such processes as to make it give out gas at
350 ; and that in the oil used in making the experiments there
must have been some foreign ingredients ?         It was stated for the
defendants, that the oil used gave out gas at a temperature of
350, and in some instances as low as 310. Why, this was less
than the temperature at which the oil used by the plaintiffs
was generally kept ; and    if,    as was meant to be inferred on the
other side, the gas was coming down and accumulating day after
day,  it   should have exploded in August or September, and not
in November.        The defendants then, in this instance, proved too
much for,
      ;     if    there was any foundation in the analogy they wished
to show between the oil used in the experiments and that used
by the plaintiffs, it     must have had the effect of causing an ex
plosion long before the time at which the fire took place.         The
only   fair   inference    that  could  be  drawn  from   this  part  of
the evidence was that which he had mentioned — that some
foreign ingredients must have been in the oil which was used in
making the experiments.       It    was not necessary for him to meet
every [part of the defendants' case.      It    would be sufficient, tp

throW a doubt upon it ; for, in order to obtain a verdict, there
should no doubt remain as to the sufficiency of the defence. He
would not, however, rest here : he would show that they really
had no case at all to bear them out.       It was said that a great
quantity of gas escaped daily ; but,      if  this were the case, the
whole of the oil must have gone off.      The evidence of Mr. Aikin
was by no means conclusive ; for he could not say at what tem
perature the volatile oil would be raised.       But it was said, that
the gas went up and came down again. Why, if this were the
case, it must have caused a most noxious vapour, attended with
a most unpleasant smell. Yet neither May nor any of the other
witnesses found any such smell.        Indeed, if it had existed, it
would have discovered itself long before the time the fire hap
 pened.     Mr. Martineau had said, that a current of cold air
 might    have come down the chimney.        This could not have been
 the case ; for the fire was fed by external air, and not from the
 interior of the building. This, therefore, was only a speculation.
 It was true, if a fire was placed in a vent, fed from within, a
 current might come down if the air in the room had become much
 heated ; but this would not be the case if the fire were fed with
 external air.      Let the jury see how the case stood with respect
  to the fire.   There was no appearance, no smell which indicated
  the combustion of inflammable vapour ; and, if any such existed,
  some of it must have scattered about unconsumed, which would
  emit an unpleasant smell. If it were consumed all at once, there
  must have been an explosion, which would have been heard ; but
  no explosion was heard, nor was any one symptom noticed which
  could indicate the presence of inflammable vapour.         If the fire
  had been caused by the vapour, it would have exploded, and set
  fire to the parts about it ; but those who first saw the fire stated
  that it was not in that part of the building where it would ha?e
  first appeared if it had been caused by the combustion of inflam
   mable vapour.      Independently, then, of all speculation on each
   side, and supposing that to be equal, let the jury look at the facts
  sworn to. The place where the fire was seen, the colour, the
   smell — all of these were circumstances against the case attempted
   to be made out on the other side. He would now leave the case
   in the hands of the jury, quite satisfied that their verdict would
   be a just one.
       The Lord Chief-Justice immediately proceeded to address the
  jury, and, after stating to them the various pleas which had been
   put upon this record, recapitulated the whole of the evidence
   which had been adduced from the commencement of the trial.
    Having finished the reading of his notes, he drew their attention
    to those points on which, disentangled from the technicality of
   pleadings, their judgement was to be exercised. The first ques

  288            On the Volatility and Inflammability
  tion would be, whether or not the premises had been accurately
  and sufficiently described ?' It appeared that subsequently to the
  original insurance, and previous to its renewal, a building' called
  the New House, and communicating with that already insured,
  had been erected.       The true way of viewing this question was
  perhaps to consider Whether, had the alteration been made known
  to the Insurance Company, they would have deemed an increase
  of the premium necessary.         It was, however, for them to deter
  mine,  under  all  the  circumstances, whether a more minute and
 extended description was required by any positive agreement, or
 by the printed terms of the insurance.            The next issue which
  they would have to try related to the manner in which, the fire
 had broken out, and to its probable cause.           With regard to this
 subject,  it was   not  extraordinary    to find it involved  in mystery
 and doubt.      Calamities of this nature could      seldom  be traced to
  their actual origin.      They usually took place in the darkness of
 night, and a hidden spark might produce a conflagration.; The
 fire, had taken place within three months after the introduction
 of a process materially different from that which had been used
 before, and no fire had ever taken place before this new process
 was introduced.       But then, again, it was for them to recollect —
 indeed they could not be ignorant — that fires had taken place
 in many other sugar-houses where the old process was still in use.
 He now came to the last and most important question on which
 they would have to deliberate. It was, Did the new process pro
 duce an increased risk of fire ? On this important point they had
heard the evidence, he would not say of the most intelligent, but
 of as intelligent men in chemical and scientific pursuits as were
 to be found in this country or in Europe.           He had himself read
 the works of some of them, had derived pleasure from their la
bours, and entertained the greatest respect for their talents and
information.     But they had, nevertheless, left the Court in a state
 of utter uncertainty ; and the two days during which the results
of their experiments had been brought into comparison, were
days not of triumph but of humiliation to science.              The con
stellation of brightness which had shone upon them left them in
a state of half-knowledge more full of doubt than a state of per
fect ignorance.       Those who walked in the twilight ought to pro
ceed with caution ; and, speaking for himself, he never would
apply the contradictory results of experiment to the real and mo
mentous interests of mankind.           It must be matter of general re
gret to find the respectable witnesses to whom he was alluding
drawn up, not on one side, and for the maintenance of the same
truths, but, as it were, in martial and hostile array against each
other.    Volumes had already been >pqken ; but volumes more
must be written before this subject wau likely to be elucidated.

                            XLII.       New Vegetable Alkalies*.
     The     discovery of morphium having stimulated chemists to
     search for other alkalies among vegetable substances, two new
     ones, brucine and delphine, have been added to their number—
     the first by MM. Pelletier and Caventon, the latter by MM,
     Lassaigne and Feneulle.
                                                 Brucine.
            This alkali
                     was obtained from what the authors call the false
     Angustura    bark (Bruceaanti-dysenierica) by the following pro
     cess : A kilogram (32 ounces troy) of the bark was reduced to
     powder, and treated in the first place with ether, to separaffi a
     fatty matter which it contains : the ether being withdravy'rf, it
     was then treated with alcohol in successive portions, the infu
     sions were put together, and evaporated to dryness.           The dry
     residue was then dissolved in water, subacetate of lead was added,
     which precipitated the greater part of the colouring matter, and
     the excess of lead was separated from the solution by passing
     through it a current of sulphuretted hydrogen gas.       The experi
     menters being in quest of strychnine, the solution thus purified
     was acted on by magnesia : the presence of an alkali was ren
     dered evident; but on washing the magnesia, it passed off in
     solution : — had strychnine been present, it would have remained
     insoluble.    On evaporating the washings, a solid mass, very al
     kaline,  was  obtained : it was a new alkali — brucine.     To purify
      it,  was combined with oxalic acid, which formed with
            it                                                          salt               it   a

                                             ;   it
     was colourless.     The oxalate thus obtained                      in

     disengaged, which, being      dissolved in boiling alcohol, becomes

                      spontaneous evaporation.

    The crystals of brucine        are  in the form of oblique quadrangu
lar, prisms, colourless and transparent ; and some of them several
lines in length.        When, quickly crystallized from a saturated so
lution in boiling water by cooling, it is in bulky plates, somewhat
like boracic acid.
    Brucine dissolves in 500 parts of boiling water, and in 850 of
cold water ; when impure, by some of the colouring matter not,
having been perfectly separated, it is much more soluble. It has
 an exceeding bitter acrid taste, which remains long in the mouth.
When administered in doses of a few grains it proves poisonous,
 but less so than- strychnine.           It does not alter in the air, melts
 at  a temperature       a little above that of boiling water, without de
 composition, and when again cooled appears like wax.                           When
 decomposed by oxide of copper it yields only carbonic acid and
 water, and a sinall trace of nitrogen, which is thought perhaps
 accidental.       It seems then to be composed of carbon, hydrogen,
 and perhaps oxygen, but the proportions of its constituents have                       ;
 not yet been ascertained.
     With acids it forms neutral and bisalts, which crystallize with
 facility, especially the latter.
     Sulphate of Brucine crystallizes in long slender needles, which
 appear to be four-sided prisms terminated bv pyramids.                          It is
 very   soluble   in  water, and slightly so        in   alcohol.     It  is very bit
 ter, and is decomposable by potash, soda, ammonia, barytes,
 strontian, lime, and magnesia; aud also by morphium and strych
 nine, which dissolve in it very readily by uniting with the acid.
 None of the acids dissolve this salt except strong nitric acid,
 which alters the brucine itself, and produces, as with strychnine
 and with morphium, a fine red colour. A super sulphate is formed
 by adding sulphuric acid to a neutral solution of sulphate of bru
 cine.     The supersulphate is less soluble in water, and crystallizes
 more readily than the neutral sulphate.                     The neutral sulphate

   Phosphate of Brucine. — Brucine dissolves with facility in
phosphoric acid.       The neutral phosphate does not crystallize.
When more acid is added the bisulphate crystallizes readily,
yielding large rectangular tables with bevelled edges.            This salt
is very soluble in water, effloresces slightly in the air, and is so^-
luble in alcohol at common temperatures.
    Nitrate of Brucine does not crystallize, but by evaporation '
forms a gummy mass.          The binitrate crystallizes readily in a^i-
cular quadrangular prisms, terminated by dihedral summits.
These crystals when sufficiently heated inflame and burn, as
does binitrate of strychnine.        They are readily distinguishable;
from the nitrate of strychnine, which is a neutral salt.             If the
nitric acid be added in excess a fine red colour is produced, ,as
with strychnine, occasioned probably by a peroxygenation of the
alkali. When either of these liquids is heated it becomes yel
low. Protomuriate of tin dropped into the yellow liquid of strych
nine causes a dirty-brown precipitate, but dropped into the yelr
                                                                      : " ''^ '
low liquid of brucine produces an intense beautiful purple.
    Acetate of Brucine is very soluble, and appears not capable
of being crystallized.                                                   .. .
    Oxalate of Brucine crystallizes very readily in long needles,
especially   if the acid  be in excess.
    Brucine, when administered internally,           produces tetanus, and
acts  on  the  nerves without attacking the          brain or injuring the
intellectual faculties. Its intensity as a poison is to that of strych
nine as one to twelve.        It required four grains to kill a rabbit ;
and a dog having taken three grains suffered severely, but reco
vered. This alkali appears to be combined in the bark with gallic

   This alkali is obtained from the seeds of staves- acre {Delplii-
num staphysagria).       The seeds, deprived of their husks and
rinds, are  boiled   in a small quantity of distilled water, theih
pressed in a cloth, and the decoction filtered, and then boiled
for a few minutes with pure magnesia; it must then be re-filtered,
and the residuum left on the filter : when well Washed it is boiled
with highly rectified alcohol, which dissolves the alkali, and, by
evaporation, it is obtained as a white pulverulent substance pre
senting a few crystalline points.       . . ,
   It may also be obtained by making sulphuric acid to act en
the seeds, unshelled, but well bruised ; precipitating the solution
by subcarbonate of potash ; and acting on the precipitate by al
cohol ; but when obtained in this way it is very impure.
   Pure delphine is crystalline while wet ; but being dried by ex
posure to the air rapidly becomes opaque.          It ha6 a bitter acrid
taste, melts when heated, and becomes hard and brittle, like resin,
on' cooling : when more highly heated, it blackens and is decom
posed.     It dissolves in small quantity in water, but very readily
in alcohol ; the latter solution renders syrup of violets green, and
restores the blue tint of litmus reddened by an acid.          With the
acids it form's neutral salts, which are very soluble. The alkalies
precipitate the delphine m a white gelatinous state, like alumine.
   Sulphate of Delphine, when evaporated in the air, does not
crystallize, but becomes a transparent mass, like gum.           It has a
bitter acrid taste, and dissolves in alcohol and in water.          It is
decomposed in the Voltaic current, parting with its alkali at the
negative pole.
   Nitrate of Delphine, evaporated to dryness, becomes a yellow
crystalline mass ; treated with excess of acid it is converted into
a yellow matter, little soluble in water, but soluble in boiling- al
cohol. This solution is bitter, not precipitable by potash, ajm-
monia, or lime-water ; and, though not alkaline, appears not to
contain any nitric acid. Further quantities of acid do not destroy
it, nor does it   form oxalic acid.   It  does not, like strychnine and
morphium, take a red colour with nitric acid.
   Acetate   of  Delphine  is  not crystallizable, but forms      trans
                                                                 a,
parent   hard  mass, of a bitter and acrid taste, and     is readily de

above salts.                  ...

ranged,  the   machine      was    made     to  produce   the   diatonic    notes of

were ascertained by the revolutions of a wheel, which made one
revolution while the plate made thirteen and a half.
   The vibrations indicated in the' table which follows are the re
sults of preliminary experiments as exact as the imperfection of
the instrument employed would admit of : it deserves to be re
marked, however, that they approximate very nearly to the theory
proposed by Sauveur in his works on Acoustics.                      I have strong
hopes, nevertheless, that I shall be able to push these experiments
much further when I shall have completed the apparatus I am
now engaged in making, and which, being wholly appropriated

   If water  is passed through the Sirene instead of air, sound is
equally  produced,      even when it is entirely immersed in the fluid;
and the same number of shocks produce the same notes as are
done by the air.        It is on account of this property of being so
norous in water that I have given it the name of Sirene.
   It may not perhaps be improper to mention, that when the
Sirene is moved with a certain quickness, it produces octave sounds
higher than the last fa of pianos with six octaves, and much
better characterized.

 Sir, — At

                  having occurred to me that some appearances attri
 buted to the atmosphere are contradictory to the known proper
 ties of this environing fluid, and my objections having received
 some sanction from private friends ; in the hope that they may
 receive a timely correction or stronger corroboration from your
 able correspondents, I have drawn them up for your perusal and
 most candid criticism. See fig. A. (PI. IV.)
     E the earth, aaa the atmosphere.
    Were the atmosphere of a like density throughout, its appear
 ance would be the same in every direction, except where local
 causes might effect a partial change in its phenomena ; but these
 excepted, the form and colour of the great body of the air would
 necessarily impose upon the sight equality of distance and of
 tint on every hand, unless the greater quantity of air from its ex
 terior through the horizon to the eye might lessen the apparent
 atmospheric distance there, and give its colour strength.
     The greater density of the air upon the general surface of the
 earth, compared with its tenuity on mountains, has been most
 fully proved; and, if it be not transparent in an absolute sense,
 then much less quantity of atmosphere must be contained in the
 same measure of distance vertically from the eye than horizon
 tally; and consequently, the lower elevations of the sight could
 not but discern a nearer and a stronger coloured indication of
 the atmosphere than could be viewed above.

 In    Number 289 of the Annales de Chimie, there is a Memoir
by M. Dabit op Sulphuric Ether, in which                   he endeavours to
show that the action of sulphuric acid upon alcohol is not conV
fined, as Fourcroy and Vauquelin have supposed, to determining
the formation of water, on account of its great affinity for that
liquid^ but that the sulphuric acid is really decomposed, that it
yields a portion of oxygen to the alcohol, without however passing
into the state of sulphurous acid ; and that it forms a new acid
intermediary between the sulphurous and sulphuric,

    •Vauquelin have endeavoured to refute the theory of M. Dabit
    dn the formation of ether, and they have justly remarked that
    this theory, were it true, is incompletely demonstrated.          M. Da
    bit had potj in fact, given any proof of the existence of his acid,
    and his theory might therefore be considered as a play of the
    imagination. However, two years after he published in the 43d
    volume of the Atinales de Chimie, p. 101, a Sequel to his first
    Memoir, in which he allows' that the objection which Fourcroy
    and Vauquelin had made was well founded; and lie replies to
    it by a series of experiments which do not leave any doubt as to
    the formation of a particular acid during the conversion of the
    alcohol into ether by means of sulphuric acid.          It is astonishing
    that these experiments, really very interesting, should remain so
,   long forgotten, and that they should have fixed for the first time
    the attention of M. Sertuerner, who speaks of them, besides, as
    if they had never been known. The justice which is due to M,
    Dabit, as much as the importance of the subject, induces us to
    give an extract from his memoir: we shall afterwards make known

                   XLVI.     Anatomical Preparations.
 It has     been usual to employ for this purpose spirit of wine
 somewhat above proof, and which costs I8i. or 20$. per gallon.
 It has been ascertained by Mr. W. Cooke, of Great Prescot-
 street, that a saturated solution of muriate of soda (common salt)
 answers the purpose equally well ; and this solution (about three
 pounds of salt to the gallon) does not cost above \0d. per gallon.
 The process, as the author. remarks*, is exceedingly simple.
     "  It consists (says Mr. Cooke) in putting animal substances
 (deprived of their blood by maceration in water) into a saturated
 solution of muriate of soda. Yet, as I believe the transparency
 of the fluid and the permanency of the preservation depend upon
 some trivial parts of the management, I shall give the particulars.
      " I keep a saturated solution of muriate of soda in good spring
 water.      Every gallon of water dissolves about three pounds of
 salt.
      " The. specimens intended for preservation are macerated in
 water, frequently changed, to deprive them of the colouring part
 of the blood, which usually occupies three or four days, or more,
 if the substances are large. I then place them in a solution of
 salt, kept in a common receptacle, to saturate them with the
  salt; and, as the water suspended in the animal structure would
 reduce the strength of the solution, this is counteracted by
 placing in it a linen bag filled with the muriate.           It is kept in a
 linen bag to prevent the foreign matters of the salt from soiling
 the preparations.       At the expiration of a few days they may be
  transferred from this vessel, into that bottle of solution which is
 to contain them permanently, or they may remain in the inter-

 mediate vessel as long as conveniency may require.            The solu-
 tibn in which they are finally to be kept should be a very little
 below saturation.      Evaporation is much less liable to happen
 than if spirit is employed ; yet should it occur, from any acci
 dent, crystallization would result, unless this precaution were
 adopted.     I have added about half an ounce of very clear water
 to a quart of the saturated solution.
   "   All kinds of animal structure do not exhibit the same rela
 tive gravity when saturated with the solution ; some will float
 whilst others sink. In the final operation of preservation, the
latter undergo the same treatment as is adopted with spirit, viz.,
 by supporting them with delicate threads of silk ; but the former
require some body to give them an increase of gravity.
   "   In almost all preparations it is requisite to keep certain parts
separated by means of quill, bristle, or other insoluble substance ;
instead of these, I use delicate pieces of glass, which may be ob
tained from the glass-blowers of every degree of fineness. These
answer fully; they look neater than any thing else; can be ap
plied with great facility; render sufficient weight, and are of very
little cost; for a few pence I purchased enough to last some years.
In the specimen of ulcerated intestine, the glasses applied [as
stated in the former letter] were not intended to be permanent ;
I had not then procured the glass' from the manufacturer. Mem
branous parts it is customary to spread on talc, as two of the
specimens are applied now with you.          I think, however,.by sus
pending a fine cylinder of glass at the bottom, the part retains a
more natural appearance ; and, therefore, of late, I have entirely
relinquished the talc.
  "   When the specimens are put into a solution of proper
Strength, and perfectly transparent, and the parts properly sepa
rated, to exhibit the different objects it is designed to show, the
next point of importance is to close the bottles with accuracy
and neatness.
    " For the reasons already stated, glass, with a medium of
resin, was chosen.      I make the rim of the bottle perfectly dry,
and spread on it some resin, with a common spatula. The glass
 (previously fitted) is then applied, and by holding the warm spa
tula pretty close to   it,the resin softens, and the top  is  fixed with
the utmost accuracy.         Ihave thought   it   best to conduct this
process in a moderately warm room, and the glass should be ra
ther less than the circumference of the rim, of on lifting the bot
tles   by the top, as   is very generally done, the glass might be
raised.    With small bottles    it     sufficient to make the resin
                                       is
smooth, and then varnish it; but on bottles of larger size, ad
                                                      a

the edge,   by  means of glue.

    ,    Majesty, &c. Svo. pp.309.
 Mr            .   Goodwin        rests    his claim to attention    on the important
 part of the veterinary art, of which he treats in this work, on the
 best of all foundations, long experience.       For twenty years he
 has been extensively occupied in attending to the management
 and diseases of horses of all denominations.
    The system of shoeing horses which Mr. G. recommends is in
 direct opposition to the common method employed in England.
The. circumstance which led him to adopt          he thus relates:
                                                               it,
    "Several years, ago, when cavalry-officers and others,' who
 had been on the continent, were going through Carlton-House
stables,    repeatedlyi heard them observe, that the proportion of
                   I
lame horses in France, compared to the number in England, was
quite trifling.   This induced me to neglect no opportunity of                       in
quiring into the cause of so important     fact     frequently asked

        I
the communication between France arid this country was opened*

brought from the king of France's stables, both of which werii''
aged, and had previously undergone several years of hard work.                            *
Their feet were very perfect     form, and in good order, and

.  work.-    I  do not  wish  to make it  appear that a correct notion
   was to be formed of the French principles of shoeing by two ex
   amples ; but they afforded me an opportunity of observing their
  method in a general manner.           I soon perceived that there was
   not any similarity whatever in the form of their shoes, or in their
   principles of shoeing, with the mode practised by the English ;
   I therefore began to suspect that the plan of shoeing horses in
   France would sufficiently explain, and would eventually prove,
   the truth of the general observation, that I had continually heard
  repeated for years, viz. that lame horses were seldom to be seen
  in that country.                                                ;
      ** I was most desirous to make a trial of the French
                                                                system ;
  and having obtained permission for that purpose, I selected some
  post-horses belonging to the private stables at Carlton House,
  that could not be kept at work when shod upon the English prin
  ciple; it soon appeared that they improved in their feet, and
  went to work.        Others were shod in the same manner with the
  same success.
     "Two years elapsed, the new system of shoeing being at
  tended with continued success ; and I anxiously availed myself,
 during this period, of every opportunity to become acquainted
 with the reasoning of the French veterinarians on this important
  subject.                                                          , \
     " I found it consistent with every view I had entertained j and
 I have now great satisfaction in making it publicly known, that
after a trial of the system for several years in this large establish
ment (the royal), consisting of horses used for the different
purposes of the road, posting, town-work, and hunting, its be
neficial effects are so manifest, that I have no hesitation in pro
nouncing it to be the best possible practice as yet discovered."
     The work is clearly written, and contains a great deal of cu
rious and important information.           We extract the following as
no unfavourable specimen.          The author is speaking of the nerve
operation.
   " It may, 1 think, fairly be considered as an era in the Vete
rinary Art.   In cases of lameness, hitherto considered as admit
ting of no relief, viz. all those permanent diseases of the feet
which have been so frequently adverted to, it has been proposed
by Mr. Sewell of the Veterinary College, to divide, or rather to

    "After a number of successful cases resulting from this opera
tion, there were persons that attempted to take away th"! merit of
the discovery from Mr. Sewell, by stating that Mr. Mooreroft had
performed the operation twenty years ago.                    Admitting that as
fact, what does it show ? That no beneficial result originated from
Mr. Mooccroft's attempt ; for if there had, we should have heard
of it either from him or his successor.             It therefore appears, that
if Mr.    Sewell  had   not shown    its utility,  we should never have heard
of Mr. Mooreroft having performed it. I have also heard Profes
sor Coleman say that he performed the operation more than twenty
years back ; but when he said so, he by no means intended to Je^j-
tten the credit due to Mr. Sewell; on the contrary, he imjaitea
blame to himself for not persevering in it.              1 have heard there are
other persons who have attempted to insinuate a sort of claim as
being the suggestors of this operation.             They are, however, in my
opinion, all without any foundation in truth. I have considered
it necessary to make these remarks, to oppose any insidious at
tempts to rob Mr. Sewell of the fame he has so justly acquired.
Some evils certainly attend the performance of this operation ;, but
1 look at them as I should on the explosion of a powder-mill,                    a-,
steam engine,    a   gas apparatus, or any serious evil which may occa
sionally attend any useful and important invention; and however
SHch accidents may be lamented, powder and gas will be made,
and steam applied as       a   mechanical power.
    " The fair way of balancing the account to put the evils One
                                                     is,                   in
scale and the advantages in the other, when                it will appear which
preponderates    ;    and as far as my observation goes, and from all
the information    I     have, it   is greatly in favour of the latter.        The
evils I   allude  to  are  the  loss  of  hoofs, consequently     a   loss of the
animal.       Two cases which occurred at the Royal stud may serve
to illustrate others   :   a   mare seven years lame, and another five,
were operated on for experiment.               They both became sound; but
about nine months after the operation, there appeared                 in  one case
a  trifling separation    between    the  horny    and sensible  sole  at  the toe.
This increased daily, notwithstanding all my endeavours to sub
due inflammation      ;   it then extended to the coronet, and at this
there .was considerable inflammation and swelling of the. leg the          :
separation increased round the coronet, and in short time there
                                                            a
W.as  a  separation between the horny and sensible laminae.            I    should
have    rather  said  insensible laminae,     as  there  was pot the least sen
sation in the foot at this time.           In this state the coffin bone was
let through the hoof, and was fractured in many pieces.                       The
other case was very similar to this, and have heard of other cases,

have heard of many similar cases in different parts of the country 5
but, on the other hand, I see many fine and valuable horses at:
work, that were of no use to the owner before the operation, and
have continued at severe work now two years without any return
of lameness ; and I see no reason why they may not be as effective
as they now are many years to come.                It therefore beeomes a
question with the owners of lame horses, where no other remedy
offers to be of any advantage, whether they will work them lame,
sell them for little or nothing, or risk the chances of the nerve
operation.       A determination of these alternatives will much de- \
        on the kind of work a horse under these circumstances may I
   e required to perform.
Eend                            If a lameness is not severe, a horse may
do slow draught without having recourse to the operation 5 but,
on the other hand, if a horse is required for quick draught or for
 riding, I conceive there are few persons that would not risk the
 chances of the operation.         With stallions and brood-mares there
 can be no necessity to risk         it,
                                     except     extreme cases of lameness.

 The two instances mentioned of failure in brood-mares that had
been some years previously lame, but on becoming sound again
never performed any sort of work, proves the experiment to have
been made under every favourable circumstance;                        however
                                                                           it

 pears   that  the  chance   of success  depends    much    on  the  length of
 time the     disease   may   have  existed  previously    to  the operation.
 Wi^h horses with thin flat feet and weak lamina, the operation
is   not so likely to succeed as with those where horn abounds.
  The structure of the horse's foot         particularly favourable to the
                                                is
 success of this operation, as there are no muscles within the
  horny box therefore, as the powers which put the foot in mo

  sary to its motion ; which might have been the case had itheen.
  otherwise constructed. It has been imagined, that the fo6t,' after
  this operation, would become a mere block, and that the animal
  would be rendered dangerous to ride or to drive.          On making
  close observations on this point, I am glad to find that it exists
  only in the imagination, as horses that we have now at wort,
  who have undergone the operation nearly two years, are con
  sidered quite as effective, in every respect, as those which have
  itpt required it.   It has also been stated, that the hoof and foot
  waste   after the operation ; but I am glad to know that this ob
  servation is imaginary also.     I have observed in hoofs where the
  operation has been performed a more plentiful production of
  horn than before, and a greater disposition to grow in the natu
  ral form ; and I think this is a consequence to be expected, As
  the irritable state of the foot being destroyed by the division pf
  the nerve, the secretion is more likely to go on freely. When the
  operation has been performed before any considerable change of
 structure has taken place, I have no doubt that the original cause
 is in time removed-altogether, by the animal being enabled to
 bear the full proportion of weight on the lame foot ; as I have
 shown, that if the foot, from any cause, is long kept in a state of
 relaxation, the horn soon contracts, and tightens on the internal
 contents, and hence arises the utility of the patten shoe being
 applied on the sound foot in ca^es of lameness. ..
     " It is useful to know that where the nervous influence has
.been restored, and lameness in some cases has returned, a repeT
 tition of the operation has been attended with the same advan
                                   ¦
 tages as in the first instance.
     " The operation itself is very simple. Having first ascertained
 the course of the artery by the pulsation,- an incision is made
 through the skin, about an inch and a half or two inehes in
 length ; and on removing the cellular substance, the artery, veiii,
 and nerve are all shown running together, the nerve on the inside
 of the artery and close to it. A needle may be readily passed
 under  it,  leaving a thread, which, on pulling .a little, enables the
 operator to separate the nerve from the artery with ease, and to
 take out as much as      is  considered necessary; after which the
 skin should be closed with a stitch, which sometimes heals         hy
 the first intention  ; after which bleeding and physic are useful."

      M, Caillaud's account of his discoveries in Egypt will shortly
   be published in Paris.    Some time ago he discovered near Mount
  Zabarah, the famous emerald mines which were previously known
  only by the writings of the ancient authors, and the stories of the
  Arabs.     They had. been almost forgotten for a long lapse of time,
   and were totally unproductive to the government of the country.
  They were discovered by M. Caillaud nearly in the same state in
  which they had been left by the engineers of the Ptolemies.          He
  penetrated into a vast number of excavations and subterraneous
  canals, some of which 'are so deep that 400 men may Work
 in them at once. In the mines were found cords, levers, tools c)f
  various kinds, vases, and lamps; and the arrangement of the
  works afforded every facility for studying the ancient process of
 mining.       M. Caillaud himself set about working the mines, and
 he has presented six pounds of emeralds to Mahommed Ali Pashaw.
 In the vicinity of the mines, the ruins of a little town have been
 discovered, which in ancient times was probably inhabited by the
 miners: among the ruins are the remains of several Gi'neco-Egyp-
 tian Temples With inscriptions.         M. Caillaud has twice visited
/Zabarah ; during his second journey he was accompanied by a con
 siderable number of armed men, miners and workmen, whom the
 Pashaw had placed under his directions.        On his wav to the eme
 rald mines, the French traveller crossed one of the ancient routes
 for the trade of India, by the way of Egypt. He observed station?,
 enclosures for the union and protection of caravans, cisterns, &c.
 Mi Caillaud learnt from the Arabs of the tribes of Ababdeh and
 Bycharyn, that this road led to the ruins of a very extensive town,
 on the banks of the Red Sea, situated about the 24th degree of
 latitude, near the mountain of Elbe.         This town has since been
 visited by MM. Belzohi and Bitche, and will probably be better
 described by them than by M. Caillaud.            On the banks of the
•Red Sea, the traveller discovered a mountain of sulphur on which
 some diggings had been made; in the neighbourhood of this moun-
 tai*nvtrace$ of volcanic eruptions were observable, and a quan      '
 tify of pttzzolane and other igneoiw substances were found. .

'
  bringing alung with him a vast number of drawings, notes, and
'

  treasures have been purchased by the French government.            The
  antiques   are deposited  in the  cabinet of   medals  and antiques  of
  the king's library,   and  the drawings   will  be engraved and   pub
  lished with descriptions in two vols, folio. M. Caillaud has again
  set out for Egypt.      In November last he was at Bony-SoueV)-
  25 leagues from Cairo. He was about to depart for the Fayoumy
  and to proceed towards the Oash of Sivah.            He must ere this
  have made many new and interesting observations. At a quarter
  of a league from one of the pyramids of Sakkarah, he descended
  into a hypogeum sacred to the deity Apis, where he found, in a
  kind of labyrinth, several bulls embalmed and preserved like
  mummies.
      It shoulS be remarked, that M. Belzoni had performed the
  same journey not long before; and perhaps had discovered this
  same sepulchre of Apis, in company with Mr. Beechey (son of
  Sir William, the painter), whose name the French writers most

 the discovery of Cicero's Treatise de Republka, has excited great

 Itttwo re-written codices of the Vatican, I have, lately found
 some lost works of the first Latin classics.      In the first of these
.MSS. I have discovered the lost books De Republica of Cicero,
 written in excellent letters of the best time, in three hundred
 pages, each in two columns, and             fortunately legible.    The
 titles of the above noble subject, and of the books, appear in the
 margin : and the name of Cicero, as author of the work, is di
 stinctly legible.  A composition of the middle ages having been
 again written upon this MS. the original pages have been mis
 placed, and even mutilated; notwithstanding this, a great part
 remains. The moral and political. philosopher, the legislator, the
 historian, the antiquary, and the lover of pure latinity, will na
 turally expect, with impatience, the publication of this important
 work of Cicero, so long lamented as lost. I shall lose no time
 in preparing it for press, and in submitting it to your holiness's
 inspection.    The other re-written codex presents various and
 almost equally precious works.     It is singular that this MS. con
 tains some of the same works which I discovered and published
 at Milan, and I have here found what there was wanting.           I per
 ceived this at first sight, not only from comparing the subject,
 but also from the hand-writing, which is precisely the same as
  that of the Milan MS.
     " The contents are — I. The correspondence between Fronto
 and Marcus Aurelius, before and after he was Emperor.            This is
 an instructive, affectionate, and very interesting collection j the
 first and second books, containing epistles to M. Aurelius, were
 published from the Milan MS. ; that now found in the Vatican
 contains the third, and fourth, and fifth books, as Well as the
 supplement to the second, and some other works by Fronto, in
 Latin and Greek.-r-2. -The fine commentary of the inedited
 scholiast on Cicero, begun to be published by me at Milan, and
 now to be increased by five other orations, with the supplements
 to those already printed at Milan. — 3. A fragment of an oration
 by Q. Aurelius Symmachus, with the supplement of two by the
 same author, already published by roc. — 4. The supplements to
 the Homily, or Gothieo-Ulphilan Commentary, a portion of which
 was also found at Milan, together with an essay of Ulphilas.
 These' valuable works mixed into two volumes, which were taken
 for writing parchment in the middle ages, were sent partly to
 Rome and partly to Milan, from the convent of St. Columbanus
 at Bobbio.     They will now be again united in a Roman edition
 of them, which I shall lose no time in publishing.            I will not

    certain memoranda which he made during his long captivity, of
    which the following           very brief analysis.
                                  is                                                       ;

        M. d'Etourviile emigrated from France to Spain               1790; he    in
    there commenced       a course of medical studies, and afterwards re
   sided some time in Lisbon taking lessons in that science. From
                                           ;
    Lisbon he repaired to the isle of St. Thomas, situated under the
    Equator, at the extremity of the gulpkof Guinea.             He remained
,'  some years in this island, whence occasionally he made excur-
 '
   sions into the western regions of Africa.             In one of these, he
    fortunately   cured   some  dangerous   wound     under which the Mani-
    congo, a prince of the country,       was   suffering.   Having thereby
    gained the favour of the prince, he attended him in an expedi
    tion or journey more than four hundred leagues in the interior
    of the continent.
        In the course of this peregrination, M." d'Etourviile traced on
    a map the western lines of the lake Aqualiuda, respecting which,
    till then, no certain information had been obtained.              He like
    wise ascertained with precision the geographical             route of the
i  Zaire, with its sources, and the lakes           forms    its progress.

 ," Compelled to be in the train of this troop of Gijas, he ranged
 through an extent of continent from the country of the Auris-
cans to Hulla, when he escaped from their hands.                  He then pro
ceeded to a province south of the western Mountains of the Moon,
at a small distance from what he considers as the real sources of
the Nile.          Hereabout he fixes the empire of Droglodo, unknown
at present, but far more civilized than the circumjacent, regions.
The politics of the government, according to M. d'Etourville,
bear a strong resemblance to the Chinese, and the civilization of
the Droglodiaus must be traced to a very remote source.                          The
merchants          of Droglodo go,     once    a year, authorized   by  their     go
vernment, to meet the Abyssinian merchants in a narrow. passage
of the mountain Narcar. They convey thither gold dust, musk,
pearls, precious stones, ivory, gums, and Ethiopian slaves, in
exchange for which ,they receive shawls, Indian stuffs, Turkey
 carpets, and salt. .                                                     ,           Y

though in a state of slavery, he had many opportunities of nor
ticing the manners of the people and their antiquities.                  His dif
ferent observations have led him to conclude that the Abyssinian9,
the Nubians, and the ancient Egyptians, who built the pyramids^
 were all originally from Droglodo, which he conceives to have

 about half after two o'clock a noise was heard like the rumbling'
 Of a heavy carriage, accompanying which was a very sensible sha
 king of the house, bed, and furniture, which lasted about eight
 or ten seconds: during the time of its continuance, some of the'
 servants of the house state that they with difficulty preserved them-'
 selves from being shaken out of the bed; in particular a nurse,
 whose attention to an infant rendered her more liable to such an
 accident.    Immediately after the shock, water was dashed against
 the bed -room windows, in such quantity as to convey the notion
 that it was thrown at the glass outof vessels. Tosome persons, the
 noise accompanying the siiock resembled the report of a great gun.
    At Haulbowline island the sensation was very terrific.            The
 watch-house there is built with immense masses of              limestone,
 many of them weighing some hundreds; these appeared to the
 persons in the house to be" shaken in such a manner as to create
 fears of their tumbling down, and made them run into the open
 air and fall prostrate. At Ahada, opposite Cove, the noise heard'
 was such as resembled the firing of cannon ; and many there, but
 for the early hour, were inclined to think it proceeded from the
 morning gun in the harbour.
    In the town of Middleton the shock was not less severe than in
 Cork harbour.      In one house a bed was shaken so violently as to
 cause the person who lay in it to jump up, under an impression
 that the floor was giving way ; the water-jug was thrown on its
 side, and the covershaken off a teapot which stood on a shelf in the
 bed-room. Many persons thought it must have proceeded from
 an explosion of gunpowder at Cove or Spike Island, and for a great
 part of the day were most anxious to hear from their friends there.
    The more probable conjecture      is,
                                       that wme more violent shock
 has taken place ekewhere, and that details of some dreadful cala
 mity may be daily expected. Previous to the account of the awful
 and,destructive earthquake which laid Lisbon in ruins in the yea*
 1755, like sensations. were felt in Cove, and the entire coast at
that side, and we await with no ordinary anxiety to learn         if   any
"parts of the Continent have suffered under    a  like visitation at pre
 sent. — {Cork Mercan. Cluron, April 7.)

    ;  The city of Ahmedabad, in Bombay, is j ustly celebrated for its
  beautiful buildings of stone and other materials, and was not less
  s^for the famous Shaking Minarets, which were admired by every
  stranger.      The awful earthquake which visited this city on the
   1 8th of June last has, we regret to learn, levelled nearly the whole
  of these fine ornaments with the dust. The proud spires of the
  great mosque, the Juma Muzjid, erected by Sultan Ahmud, the
  king of Guzerat, and the founder of the city of Ahmedabad, which
  had stood nearly four hundred and fifty years, have tumbled to
  the ground within a few yards of the place where they once reared
  their, heads.      The mosque itself has sustained less injury than
  could have been expected, and the handsome arch which divided
 the minarets has escaped unhurt.           Another Muzjid, of elegant
 structure, which lies to the left of the road leading to the Shahee
  Bagh, denominated the Beebees, or Unchunt Koonkee ke Muz
 jid, has shared the same fate. A gentleman, while riding out,
 saw the minarets come down ; the tops were thrown to a distance,
 and immediately afterwards the stones came tumbling down one
 after another. — The only remainining shaking minarets which
 are at all worthy of notice, and are much inferior to the others,
 have, it is said, been sadly fractured ; they are situated in the
 Goompteepoora, to the east of the city, outside the walls.

      General Sir D. Ochterlony lately dispatched, as a present from
the Nawab of Bhawulpoor to Governor-general the Marquis of
 Hastings, a beautiful wild ass, of that species called by the natives
 Got Khur. This elegant creature is described as being eleven
or twelve hands high, of a beautiful light fawn or cream, colour,
with long      ears,   and large black eyes.    In disposition it is un-
traetable, and in this as well as in every other respect excepting
the colour, resembles the zebra. It is said to be a complete mode)
of strength, beauty, and agility. — Asiatic Mirror.

  the Hindoo astronomers, and by which the Bramins, Moguls,
  and other Mohammedans in India chiefly go, in the reckoning

   "  We are in hopes that our winter is over ; in fact, we had last
week some as hot weather as I ever experienced in England, but
the" following statement of the height of the thermometer will
give you some idea of its actual state : 10th. Very cold wind,
with sharp sleety snow.       11th and 12th, warmer. 13th, too hot
at 4 o'clock   P.M.   to walk comfortably, even thinly clad.       14th,
hotter still. 15th. Thermometer at 3 P.M. 76°, at 6, 66°, at
 11, 62".    16th. Thermometer at 3 P.M. 66% at 7 P.M. 73°.
This day we had no fire, in our room, our windows wide open,
coat off, &c. &c.      The ladies all resumed their summer thin ap
parel.    17.  Thermometer      at 8 A.M. 62°, at 3. P.M. 66°.       Ve
getation has come on during these last three days with a rapidity
I never before beheld. 18th. Weather much cooler. 19th.
Thermometer 2 P.M. 54°.           20th. Cold wind. Thermometer at
3 P.M. 49°.      21st. Colder still, with a N.W. wind. Thermo
meter 44° at 3 P.M.        We expect it colder still to-morrow, and
then probably we shall have it as hot again as it was last, week."

L. On the alleged Plagiarisms of Frenchmen: on theOriginaUty
  of the musical Instrument calledrthe Sirene; and on the Pitch
  and Scale, of the Notes of a French Standard Harmonica,
   which are said to        have    been ascertained        thereby.   By Mr.
   John Farey        Sen.
                              To     Mr.    Tilloch.
SIR, —     It has been to me a subject of poignant regret to learn,
from several intelligent Englishmen who have visited Paris or
travelled in France in search of useful information, that an ex
ceedingly small proportion only, of any of the ranks or classes in
society in France, understand our Language, sufficiently to converse
therein ; and that in consequence, those of our countrymen who
cannot speak French, and are unaccompanied by a friend who
does so, fluently, do little more than lose their time and spend
their money, when they cross the English'Channel, with the view
of acquiring the information             to which    I have alluded.
   It   is to this general distaste,          I mistake not, French
                                           which, if
men in general have, to the study         any   modern language but
                                      of
their own, except perhaps the Italian and German, amongst the
superior and scientific classes, and not more so to our language,
than those of others of the nations who surround them, that I
wjsh, in candour, to attribute, the many instances of apparent
plagiarism and of literary injustice, as to the discoveries and writ
ings of our countrymen, in the sciences and usefuf arts, which are
complained of in our journals, against Frenchmen * : and this re
mark I wish in particular to apply to the Baron Cagniard de la
Tour's account, translated into pages 293 and 294 of your last
Number, of the Instrument which he denominates theSirene; being
willing to suppose, that the Baron had never read, or perhaps
heard of, Dr. Robison's account in the Supplement to the third
                                                                        edition
  • * A
         memoir of the late James Watt, esq. was, as it since has appeared,
written by Mr. William Playfair, for the New Monthly Magazine, and has
thence been transferred into your last volume ; at page 445 Mr. P. has
therein, without regard to truth or propriety of language, charged M. de
Prony with gross and Wilful injustice to Mr. Watt, a3jto his improvements
 of the Steam-Engine, as my Son has (although by mistake you omitted to
place Junior after his Name) in p. 1 10 of your present volume, shown, by
quoting the passages from M. de Prony 's Work, wherein due acknowledge
 ments are made of Mr. Watt's claims : notwithstanding which, and without
noticing these extracts, Mr.        has, in another Work, viz. the original
                                   P'.
Monthly Magazine, for the present month, p. 322, in language not less un
justifiable, repeated his attacks on M. de Prony, grounding the same now,
principally on a conversation whichhe alleges to have held with Mr. W.
in 1810 or 181  1
                :   —in.answer to which beg, in the absence of my Son to

  covery, of the mode of producing pet feet musical Sounds, by the
  mere opening andsliutlingof a stop-cock, through which, slightly
  compressed air, thus interruptedly passed, at very quick inter
  vals, ip which discovery the Baron appears now to lay claim, in
  his account referred to.
      Those of your Readers who are conversant with Harmonics,
  can scarcely fail to have regretted with me *, the want of precise
 measures of the intervals of the Scale, which are actually pro-
 duced,by the most-expert and approved of the professional Tuners
 of our common keyed Instruments.               Such an instrument as the
 Sfrenc,     when     properly constructed,    and  used with the requisite
 care and precautions, seems capable of affording these measures ;
 it is however, abundantly apparent to me, that some or all of
 these requisites have been wanting, in the experiments which the
 Baron has recorded, as to the Pitch *nd Scale of the Standard
 French Instrument which he calls an Harmonica.
     In the first place I would observe, as to the pitch, that if the
 Key Note ut, or c of this Instrument make 511 vibrations in
 1", and the English concert pitch be 4 SO vibrations for the same
 note, as I believe to be usually the case, this Harmonica was
 pitched 552, or nearly a major Semitone, higher than our Eng
 lish Instruments are usually pitched or tuned .          f
     The numbers -given in the 2d and 3d columns of the Baron's
 Table, are not in the ratio I to 13'5, as the previous description
 might have led one to suppose, but in the ratio 1 to 22'5 or very
 nearly so ; and the whole 'description is so concise, and withall so
 confused, as to furnish no clue, for determining the accuracy of
                                                                            "the
state, that about two or three years ago, while he was engaged in preparing
the elaborate article Steam-Engine, which is printed in Dr. Rees's Cyclopcedia,
Mr. Watt did us the honour to call here several times, and in my presence,
libld various conversations with my Son, relating very fully to Mr. W's inven
tions and improvements of theStcam-Engine.and relating to the rival claims,
which various persons have at different times set up; into the particulars
of which rival claims, my Son had previously, spared no pains to inquire,
through every practicable channel, and having stated the conclusions to
which he had come, in each of such cases as regarded Mr. Watt's Steam-
Engine, by reading these parts of his Manuscript to Mr. W. he had the sa
tisfaction of receiving, his full assent thereto : and I beg to declare, that in
these conversations, not the slightest complaint was made, of M. de Prooy's
Conduct ; nor on a later occasion, when Mr. W., only a very few months be
fore his death, called here, and left for my Son (who was from home at the"
time) a copy of his own Work on the Steam-Engine, not then published; on-
which occasion Mr. W. sat and conversed with me for a considerable time,
on the subjects treated of in his newly printed Book.

 ference being, in the latter case, or for   4*5 vibrations; which, as

 well as the 675 vibrations assigned to g, differ so widely from
 the system of M. Sauveur, to which the Baron says that his num
 bers approximate, as to divest the whole of any character for ac
 curacy.      Ihave not seen the original account      but the translaj
 tion in     contemporary journal, introduces near the .middle of
              a
 the Table, the note mi or e, making 630 vibrations per 1", which
 is omitted in p. 294.                              .
    I should  be  glad to hear, that one   of  these new Instruments
 had been brought to this country, or rather that one had been
 made here, with every attention to accuracy of construction; and
 that    by
          means thereof, and without trusting to the fallacious use
  of Unisons *      comparing the Notes, the numbers of Vibrations

   J. hk   cultivation   of, and  improvement      in, the management of
  bees/;behig one of those subjects of rural ceconomy which the
  Society haye thought worthy of their attention, and for the»en-
  couragement of which they have offered premiums, and they
  having at the same time signified that the claimant was expected           .
  to suggest his observations on the subject, I am induced (though
  engaged in very different pursuits) to offer the following Essay
  to their consideration.       It is the result of experience, and of
  many years actual observation, not the speculation of a theorist,
  nor a compilation from the works of other authors on the same
  subject.
      It is presented to the Society with no view to the pecuniary
  premium which they have offered, for did what I here submit to
  them give me any claim, or entitle me to such mark of their ap
 probation, it should be restored to them, as sought for with no
 other view than to entitle me to have the honour of ranking

      Conceiving that the views of the Society are not merely spe-
 culative, but directed to objects of practical improvement, I can
 not hut consider the number of publications respecting the ge
 neration of bees, the prolific powers of the queen bee, the for
 mation of their cells, and administration among themselves, as
 theories ingenious and entertaining, but as in no wise tending to
 inform those who wisti to keep this valuable insect, to make it
 moist productive, or render it more generally useful.           Several of
 these publications      I have read, and the accounts in them of the
 different processes by glass hives, boxes, &c. the object of which
is tp save the bees and take the honey, are open to these objec
 tions: — the descriptions in them are too complicated to be easily
understood, and the .necessary apparatus too expensive to be pur
chased, but by a few ; and it must be recollected, that it is not
from'such, the supply of honey and wax necessary for our con
sumption is procured ; as the number of those who indulge in
these entertaining pursuits is small ; it is the husbandman, the
farmer, the gardeuer, and the cottager, who by small contribu-
tian&ifuriiish the necessary stock of wax and honey.
   Jo; offering, however, my observations to the 'Society, I feel-
considerable difficulty, a* my opinions on the subject of their pre
miums are much at Variance with theirs: they seem to consider,
that he performs a meritorious service to the public, who points;-,

                                                            to increase the
 quantity    of  wax    and   honey necessary   for  consumption, nothing

honey    for  bees. —  Their    numbers   therefore    must  be limited by
the food necessary for their support; and to suffer them to in

would soon destroy those whom             mistaken mercy had spared *.

   tures are to be sought for, other than those which surround the
  apiary in the beginning of the season, and before their numbers
   have been increased by swarms, is demonstrably proved by what
  is mentioned in some authors on the subject ; that in Piedmont
   and Savoy, the bee-masters bring their hives down the rivers on
  rafts, anchoring in different places where flowers are found in
  abundance for their food.         Is this necessary from any other cause'

some quality injurious to them, from the following circumstance                           :
In the month       of
                    May 1817, having gone down to my garden
when the tulips were in blow, and looking into the body of the
flowers for those which were well coloured,   observedI  dead bee          a
in almost every one of them, and in some two. This led me to
examine nearly the whole of my beds, and there was scarcely
any flower which did not exhibit the same appearance                       f.
   The blossoms of the first-mentioned shrubs afford to them, the
earliest flowers, particularly the gooseberry; and the cupidity
with which they suck them presents the image of sailor on his     a
return tasting fresh meat and vegetables, who during    long voy-      a

    the turnip is also very useful at that season of the year, as itvfur-

  nishes both wax and honey in abundance.. , ,
       I do not pretend to enumerate all the powers, which afford food
  to bees : the general descriptions I have already given : thosei from
  which mine have principally drawn their support, are,-the white
  clover and the blossoms of the lime tree ; and for wax, the blos
  soms of the furze and broom : it is the farina collected from these,
  that repairs the cells that have been tapped for their food during
  the winter : proximity therefore to these sources of support is a
  very desirable circumstance in the formation of an apiary, the
  benefit of which I fully experienced in the course of the summer
  of 1816. The lime trees which usually blossomed about mid
  summer, did not fall into bloom in that year until late in July :
  at midsummer the old hives are preparing, or have just cast
  swarms, and the combs in the new are not in a fit state to receive
   the honey; but in the late season of 1816, when those trees went
   into blossom, in every hive the combs were formed, and were in
   a state to receive the honey from the flower.          The beautiful and
   rich grove of Mount Mascal, near Bexley, composed entirely of
   lime trees, furnished pabulum for millions, and ail the bees which
   then left their hives, I observed in thousands to take that south
   erly direction which led to it : the consequence was, that all my
   hives, which until that time were uncommonly light, from the ef
   fect of an unfavourable season, in a fortnight's- time were amply
   filled with honey.
       The next object, in order to increase and improve the apiary,
    is,attention to the hives used, and the mode of hiving the swarms.
   There    is no prejudice which        have had more to combat with,
                                                I
   than the using of large hives, that            the use of hives without
                                                         is,
   any    attention to  the  proportion they    bear   to the swarms to be
   put into them.        In Kent they are partial to hives nearly two feet
'
   high, and as large in diameter they seem to consider that the
                                                    :
   hives cannot be too large, and that            of no importance whether
                                                        it   is
   the loaded and wearied insect           to drag his burthen up two feet

   of th6 side of the hive, or one; or whether the hive                  to be          is
   wholly, or only partially,   filled with  comb.   Both   are of the utmost
   importance.        Ihave uniformly observed, that bees never work
   well, unless the hive       full         *;

hive,  when   first  hived, to within two or three rims at the bottom;
and so necessary do I consider it to have the hive full of bees be
fore they begin to work, that I add to a small swarm either an
other, or a cast, and put two or three casts together, till a proper
proportion of bees is had : this is done with the greatest ease, by
spreading a cloth on the ground, and striking the hive which
contains the swarm to be added quickly and sharply on                  when                it,

of much consideration.           In all the hives which        have had      I                   in
Kent, the rolls are thin and hard, and little attention              paid to          is
the colour or sweetness of the straw; the consequence of which
is, that they are cold in winter:          have, therefore, procured the

and handsome.           The shape which         prefer I   low, wide, and

pointed at the. top.       Bees begin to work near the top of the hive,
and work downwards; and as the combs approach the bottom,
their labour          diminished.

dustryof   these valuable insects; and in fact on the master of the-
 bee-house being himself fond of the pursuit, great part of the
success of keeping them depends : they must be watched during
 their time of swarming, and the attacks of their enemies must be
 warded off, for of these they have not a few.      There are but two
 aspects in which the bee-house should be placed; the south, or
 some point towards it ; and the east. I have in my principal apiary
 two houses, each containing eight hives ; the one fronting the
east, and,the other the south ; I have endeavoured to ascertain
 in which of them the bees throve best, but in that respect I could
find no difference.     I however prefer the southern aspect, as it
 enjoys the benefit of the winter sun, whose warmth and effect in
 keeping the house dry, is of infinite consequence : this leads me
 to the most decisive dictum on the subject, that it is essential to
the thriving of bees, that they should be kept sheltered from
 damps and wet, in summer and in winter; as, unless they are
kept dry and warm, they will not work.         Turn up an unsheltered
 hive on a rainy day, in the midst of summer, a drowsy hum an
 nounces their torpor ; but if sheltered, so that the chilly effect of
 the rain has not reached the interior of     it,the moment the at
 mosphere  is  cleared, and  a  glimpse  of sunshine    seen, they will
                                                         is
be observed to issue from their hives to work, as alert as           notif
 a single drop of rain had fallen.
     The absolute necessity of warmth during the winter to the
preservation of bees     is,
                           independent of what has been already ob
 served, the best answer that can be given to the possibility of
 taking the honey without destruction of the bees.        If the honey
is  taken, the combs   must  be  taken too.  What       is

food is  derived from the bee-bread and wax which          taken away.

 means, ingenuity has never suggested any mode, nor speculation
glanced at its practicability.      If  you mean to carry your hives
 through the winter, you must give them their natural comfort

 should be planted in the front, as that keeps off the sun, whose
 light and warmth are the greatxJmulants to their working. Six
 hives are, in my opinion, enough for each house, and the houses
 should stand at some distance from each other : the reason              ¦  is,
 that when the bees swarm, the buzz of those which rise first is-

    But of all the numerous enemies which bees have to encoun
 ter, the most daring as well as the most destructive is the wasp.
 Rapacious, lively, and bold, he attacks the hive ; he enters it
 without fear, and plunders it without mercy: to them many hives
 fall sacrifices in the course of every season. I have found the
 only efficient remedy      is, to destroy their nests      the neighbour
                                                               in
 hood of the apiary    :    they are easily discovered in the side of a
 ditch, or near the water, where the decayed roots of the alder                             ¦»
 have left  a   cavity,  in   which places    I  have observed they much
 delight to breed       this     done at night, when they have all re

 turned to their nests,          putting port-fire into their holes, or                by
burning    straw  on  them    :  their nests, however, are not discovered
until they have become numerous, and so attract observation                           by
their flight, directed in numbers to          a particular place and be   ;
fore they are so discovered, they commit great and destructive
devastation among the hives.              Ihave uniformly closed the en
trance of my hives         by  the means pointed out           the following
                                                                in

cient, only to admit   a   single bee at a time.
    After trying the common experiments of hanging up bottles of
honey or sweet liquor near the hives, found lost as many bees

answered admirably, not for the purpose only of enabling the bees

to defend themselves from the wasps, but to shut them up during
the autumn and winter ; during the autumn to keep out the ver
min, and in winter to keep them warm *, yet give them air. This
 I put on the hives early in August, as I by these means can give
them more or less room to work, at the same time that I there^
by exclude the entrance of every insect whatever; and to this
early closing up the doors, but with a power at the same time of
giving them full liberty to go out in any number, by lifting the
slide, I attribute much of my success in the preservation of my
stock hives, as their stores are left untouched, and they are kept
dry, and all offensive insects, such as snails, moths, &c. are thus
excluded.                                                   *    '¦" '
    There are four periods or seasons at which bees are to be pari-
ticularly attended to.      The first I consider to commence from
the earliest bloom of the willow, and blossom of the gooseberry.
It has been recommended at this time to lift the hive, and sweep
the board, as the floor of the stool will be found covered with the
dross of wax, which was what closed up the combs at the begin
ning of winter, and when the cell was tapped for use, the wax
would fall to the ground.        I have never adopted that practice,
for this reason, that to      do  so, the hives which had been plas
tered close to- the boards during; the winter, must necessarily be
lifted from them, and the cold thereby introduced, which, at that
season, I think would do more injury to the bees, than any bene
fit which they would derive from taking away the loose wax from
the board.      If at this season they appear brisk, and issue from
their  hive  in numbers, let no feeding on any account be allowed.
It dulls' their early activity and industry, by their finding at home
what they would othewise gain abroad ; and the honey drawft
from the flower gives them a more healthful activity than they could
 have from any feeding : but if a hive is observed when struck',
 to emit a dull and heavy buzz, and if the bees do not issue in any
 numbers, it may be of service to feed them, but scantily, and
 merely to give them strength to go abroad.           From this time,
 until the period of swarming,' they require some little attention ;
 if the season is open, dry, and mild, in fact none; but if May
 should be wet and cold after the first swarms are cast, so that
   *,rfhe drawing a a represents two small pieces of wood about an inch
and hftlf.long, about the sixth part of an inch broad, and of the same thick
ness ; there is a groove in each, to receive a sliding piece of board b, about
an inch and a quarter wide, in which are cut two small doors wide enough
to admit one bee at a time only.     The pieces of wood a, are fixed on each
side of the door cut in the hive itself, and fastened to the hive by two large
pins ; the piece of wood b, is then fixed in the two grooves, and is raised or
put down at pleasure.     ,                              ¦„•j,.     .:

 out at work in autumn, or by throwing the loose combs of the
taken hives from whence the honey has flowed, on the grass be*
fore the bee-house, from whence they will issue in great numbers
to suck the refuse honey remaining in the combs ; and they may
be then watched on their return to the hive, and their numbers
 calculated.      This attention to the number of bees, as well as to
the weight of the hive, is a matter of observation indispensably
necessary, and on which every thing depends.            It often happens
that a hive heavy in honey has overswarmed itself, and the num>-
ber remaining in the hive is small; such is perfectly unfit to be
carried through the winter.       I have always weighed my hives at
the close of autumn, not by guess, but accurately by the scale
and weights ; I weigh them with the board on- which they stand,
having before ascertained pretty nearly the weight of the stand.
 If the hive weighs twenty-five pounds, it will safely get through
the winfer without feeding ; I have had some have gone through
it which weighed twenty-two or twenty-three pounds only; but
upon these, without feeding, I cannot absolutely decide on their
abilities to pass the mouths of winter and the early part of the
spring.        But with the aid of feeding, it is perfectly easy to
bring any hive through the winter.. And here I beg leave to gi*e
the most decided contradiction to any author who has treated it
as an idle, useless, and almost impossible expedient to save such
a hive during the season.        Many have done so, and many such
assertions I have often heard made, but from which I totally dis
sent, and from repeated experience am enabled to contradict
them.        I have had many supported by these means during nearly
the whole winter, and those at the ensuing season have thriven
out of measure, and become my best for the ensuing year.              .J-it*
    It frequently happens, that in a late and wet season, the swarms
come out in the latter part of June, and also numerous, strong,
and large casts of the same description ; they have not time to
complete their store of combs and honey, but they are valuable
for their numbers and their future promise ; their industry only
enables them to half fill their hives, and gather a support for a
few winter months. , Nothing is of more facility than to bring
those hives through the winter by feeding; and when that is done)
the remaining half of the hive is filled early in the succeeding
year ; and though they probably will not swarm, from having their
hive Jo, fill with, combs, as well as honey, I have always found the
quantity of the latter to be considerable, and the number of bees
great in proportion: their attention is undiverted by throwing
out swarms; their brood is employed at home, in what,            if hived
in,a new dwelling, they would be called upon to do, filling it with
comb as well as with honey.          • ir '. ,>c,> y,,-        .  • \.o

    8. Tlie falling hack of the conjunctions of the sun and moon
one day in 304 years, or three days in 912 years, extends the
great lunar period to 120 periods of 912 years, or upwards of
 1 00,000    years, which is an unbounded length; and however
enormous this may appear, yet an author since Mr. Ferguson
has calculated the grand lunar period at 7,948,800 synodical re
volutions, or more than 600,000 years, to go through all her va
riations and complete her cycle.           Mr. Ferguson, it must be al
lowed,     was   more   decent  when    he   assigned the very moderate
     "oA of 12,492 years !      See his Astronomy, art. 321, p. 245.
      jiis arises from our imperfect knowledge of the lunar theory.
     }. If my positions are true, the entire revolutions of the moon
are limited to the period of 912 solar years, in which time her
relative motions with the sun, and the whole phaenomena of
eclipses, are completed.        The very supposition of enlarging this
period by any supposed anticipation of either sun or moon be
yond this period, produces nothing but doubt, uncertainty, and
uselessa speculation.
     10. The reform of the calend-ar in different ages mav may in some
         affect the true dates of ancient eclipses ; but I cannot dis-
cases affe
cover that even the reform of the calendar in the age of the
Nicene Council has at all affected the dates of the eclipses prior
 to that period, nor subsequent thereto, until the time of Pope
Gregory, and the introduction of the New Style.
     1 1. It appears from the ancient writers, that the memorable
 vear commencing the sera of Nabonasser 747 years before Christ
-was a famed astronomical           epoch, when, the Babylonian and
 Egyptian     calendars  coincided   with the equinoctial points ; con
cerning which Dr.      Keill remarks, Astron. Lectures, xxvii. p.3()7:
 fc The sera of Nabonasser,"
                                   says the learned Professor,
                                                                 " has al
 ways been famous among astronomers, and began on the sixth
 of February of the Julian year carried backward, and before Christ
 747 years : and because that day was then the first of the Egyp
 tian vcar, Ptolemv and after him Copernicus computed the mo
 tions of the stars according to that aera by Egyptian years."
     12. If we compute the difference of the Julian and solar rec
 koning from the said epoch, at the rate of eleven minutes per
 annum to the date of any eclipse, and add thereto seven whole
 days for one period afterwards, we shall reduce those Julian dates
 to^M'^"-"

to five days twelve hours thirty-three minutes : add this to the

   The solar equation not amounting to the quantity of one pe
riod does not affect this example.
   The return of this eclipse was in A.D. 8S9 observed by the
Grecian astronomers at Constantinople : this being at one period
distance, seven whole days must be added to the former equation,
and from the sum the lunar difference of four days must be sub

   Thus this eclipse returned, after 912 years, within ten hours
nineteen minutes of the former.
   The second return was in April 1801, and although invisible
in England was computed in the Nautical Ephemeris to happen
April twelve days sixteen hours twenty-one minutes ; which is
one hour and a half of the equated time it was observed 1824
years before.       Now in the year 1801 the Julian style stood car*
rected by twelve whole days ; therefore to bring back the date to-
the ancient style, twelve days must be deducted, and the date
stands as follows :                                                           ,

  pened within sixteen minutes of time at two periods, or 1824

  may be corrected from that date, but from the epoch of the Na»

       If we correct the date of the eclipse A.D. 1494, by the rule
  on which the Gregorian calendar was corrected A.D. 1582, the

that the new timber used in repairing her may have the bene
fit of submersion as well as the old. I beg also to state to the
 Society that I have learnt, since the publication of ray treatise,
 that accident has furnished us with two other instances of the
good effects of sinking ships, in the San Fiorenzo frigate, which
was sunk off the French coast ahout 18 years ago, and the Re
sistance frigate, which was also sunk in attempting to heave her
down in the Mediterranean about eight or ten years since : the
latter ship is now under repair at Plymouth, and is perfectly free
of fungus, which excited considerable surprise and inquiry; and
the former is in the same favourable state. The fact, therefore,
appears to be established as completely as any fact can be proved,
the Eden having been raised one year, the Resistance about ten
years, and the San Fiorenzo about 18 years.         Nothing more
strongly shows the opinion entertained by the Lords of the Ad
 miralty than the orders they have issued, and the consideration
that they never would have given such orders (so contrary ta for
mer prejudices) on any other than an unquestionable foundation.

of the true solar year as used in our best solar tables. This error
in 500 years would amount to nearly three days, an error twenty
times greater than exists in that which he attempts to correct.

          your Number for July, noticing the voyage of M. de Forbia
    in the Levant, you express his concern, that he was unable to
    profit by the discovery of the Temple of the Sphinx, which an
    unpardonable egotism, he says, had caused to be buried up or
    covered again.        As this leads to an implication, that it was
    Mr. Salt who discovered that beautiful monument, I think it right
    to exculpate this gentleman from the above charge of egotism.
        It was I, and not Mr. Salt, that caused the temple to be cover
    ed up again ; and here are my reasons for it.            I had already re
    moved obstructions from the newly discovered passages, and from
    the new subterranean chamber of the great pyramid ; and finding
    nothing all around but the live or natural rock stone, 1 set about
    exploring the base of the Sphinx, in hopes of lighting on some
    communication that might lead to any new points of the pyra
    mid. After having been at work for several months, with a
    hundred and fifty Arabs, and not unfrequently at the risk of be
    ing buried in the downfalls of sand, I was at length enabled to
    clear out the area of a temple of Osiris : its site at .about the
    depth of 40 feet, and within the very claws of the Sphinx. M.de
    Forbin is within the limits of strict truth, when he asserts that
    this is one of the finest monuments of the power of the arts in
    ancient Egypt.
        After having taken the dimensions and the most correct de
    signs of all these antiquities, I was concerned to find a number                    <?f.
    Arab women, allured           superstition, coining, at first, to worship
                                 by
    and   kiss  the  images,  on  their first view of them, but, not content
    witkthis, proceeding       afterwards   to break off fragments or pieces
     to serve as amulets or charms          :  this way, several hieroglyphics
                                                in
     have been already disfigured.        At length, being apprehensive that
    this fine workmanship, which            ithad cost me so much labour
     (even   at  the  hazard  of losing  my   sight)  to explore, should come
     to destruction, I     resolved to inter         anew, till circumstances

sible,   the result of my discoveries, in a periodical journal: my
plan of the temple, and a brief notice of my labours, have in
deed already appeared in one of these for January last.
   It appears to me that the whole aggregate of Egyptian anti
quities would speedily be laid open for the investigation of Eu
ropean archaeologists, were it not for a sort of jealous rivalship
that has crept in among the explorers of these scientific riches.
The most valuable and indeed the most proper instrument' 'for
these purposes, in respect of his physical force and capabilities,
I mean M. Belzdni,' is about to leave Egypt. A report prevails
that, on his return to Cairo from his last expedition, one of the
agents of M. D. assaulted, and actually fired a pistol at him.
This circumstance was mentioned to ine by M. Briggs, on his
arrival from Alexandria.
   This event should not, however, be a source of alarm to Eu
ropeans inclined to undertake journeys into a country so inter
esting.    For my own part,         my intention to return thither;

ing, in your Magazine for April, offered some reply to my re
marks on Professor Jameson's 3rd edition of his System of Mi
neralogy,      beg to submit the following observations in return.
                  I
    I am  first  accused of confounding     natural history method
                                                        a
with natural method. Not having had the advantage of Pro
         a
fessor Jameson's instruction,      can reconcile myself, without an
                                            I
effort, to my incapacity for appreciating distinctions without dif
ferences and shall be content with the observation that, whatever
shades       of ;
           Jamesonian twilight may exist,     natural history method
                                                            a
at variance with      natural method
                         a               a solecismis  language cer   in
tainly beyond my
                     " inferior apprehension."
   G. M. erroneously supposes Professor Jameson to have been
censured for deviating from a chemical arrangement:            he                   is
blamed for adopting a derangement which compels him to de
viate from nature.
                    " Nunquam    allud natura, aliud sapientia dicit."
    Your correspondent evidently considers me  staunch advocate   a
for   achemical system.    can with pleasure assure him, that
                                    1                                               I

am not either in mineralogy, or any other subject, bigoted to a
particular theory : and that I will cheerfully abjure my chemical
 heresy the moment any one will point out a safer and more cer
tain ,gujde. At , present I certainly prefer a system which tells
me what a thing tf, to one which informs me what it looks like. s
 I prefer a system which admits pure " white lead spar " to be
an.pje of lead, to one which, in direct opposition to truth and
 common sense, calls it an earth ! Anxious for improvement, I
have inquired amongst the best mineralogists of my acquaintance,
hy what anti-alchemy the numerous metals in the Professor's
second volume have been transmuted into earths.                        Some have
 stared ; others       have smiled   and   shook    their    heads   ; but I have
DOt yet been fortunate enough to meet with one who could ex
plain. Finally, 1 prefer an arrangement, let itsi basis be what
 it way, whose consistency with natural affinity will enable me to
judge with some degree of correctness where I am to look for a
 mineral, to a chaos which compels me to refer eternally to the
 ifl,<)jes, or to dive at random amongst the leaves for a quarter of
 ap l^ur, consoling myself with singing
                 " Whither, my love, ah! whither    art thou   gone?
                                                                      "

 seen the book he is vindicating ?                Has it escaped his notice,
 that     some    of the Professor's   new  earthy minerals are upwards of
.6*9, and his metallic ones         as  low as 4*0 ?      .-.    <••   f\  ¦   - A
      We' ace also told, that by adopting the method in discussion,
 we should be enabled " to recognise a mineral at first sight, and
 give it its proper place in the system."            Here is at once the point
 at issoe : — and the above proposition I unequivocally deny.                     It
 would enable us to form groups of heavy minerals, white ones,

 but sacrificed facility to precision * : and if mineralogy          be doomed
  to  rank   amongst    the  sciences,  its  foundation  must  rest  on  a firmer
  basis than colour, hardness,        and     weight.
      As for the discrepancies which are " so trivial as scarcely to
  deserve attention," they may rest in peace : it is waste of words
  to argue for mathematical exactness with men who think nothing
 of an unit or two in specific gravities, and eight or ten degree*
  in the measure of a right angle !            f
       We are reminded how easily I might perceive that the obser
  vations to enable a student to distinguish particular minerals
  from those which they more nearly resemble, are not delivered as
   essential characters.       This I did perceive; and considered that
   very   circumstance     a  great objection.       The principal complaint
  is, that by      "  a very absurd adherence to a system" (to use
   G. M.'s own words) the essential characters are made to depend
  whojly on circumstances which have frequently nothing charac
  teristic in them ; and the discrimination of the species is left to
  be ultimately determined upon principles which the founder of the
  system has not the candour to avow.
      Towards the conclusion we are told, that the excellence of a
  system will consist in
                                " laying down such methods, founded on
   the external characters of minerals, as shall afford the means of
  immediately placing the mineral in the class, order and species
                                 Expunge the word " external
  to which it belongs."
                                                                      " and

  sentence will appear unexceptionable ; but, while minerals re
  main destitute of organization, and liable to continual variations
  from accidental contamination with foreign substances, it will be
  found that a system, altogether dependent on external characters,
  will never impart a degree of knowledge worthy the name of a
  scientific attainment.         Of this we have a lamentable proof in the
  work under discussion, which presents us with groups of earthy
  minerals without an atom of earth in their composition.

  your Magazine for January were written, I had not learnt any

been educated in the Professor's principles, he does not see the

LVIII.    Acgount of the Importation into France of the Cache-
    mire-wool Goat, extracted from a Memoir on this Subject
   read to the Royal Academy of Sciences, September 1819.
 7S/L. Amadeus Joubert quitted Paris in April 1818, and pro
 ceeded first by Odessa, Tangarock, and Astracari, to the camp of
general Jermoloff in Caucasus, gaining information on the way
relative to the object of his journey, from the Buchanans,
 the Kirghiz, and the Armenians, who frequent Astracan.                  He
 was there told that there existed amongst the numerous hordes
 of Kirghiz (a nomadic tribe residing in Bucharia, on the banks
of the Oural lake) a species of goat of a dazzling white, bearing
 every year a remarkable fleece about the month of June.                The
 specimens    of  it which  he  there   collected   convinced   him  of  the
 identity of this    wool  with  that which     is imported into France
 through Russia.      This discovery was the more important to him,
 as it promised to save him the long and difficult journey which
 he would otherwise have had to encounter in penetrating to
 Thibet through Persia and Cashemire.              In this he was not de
 ceived ; for he actually collected scattered samples of this fine
  wool, at some hundreds of wersts from the Wolga, amongst the
                                  Gg    2                           steppes

 steppes that separate Astracan from Orembnrg,        which  satisfied
  him that he needed not to penetrate further.       He had    besides
  observed, that in the language of the country they gave the name
  of Thibet-goat to the animal which furnished this fine fleece.
  He therefore bought of the Kirghis in this district, from the
 hordes called Cara-Agadgi and Kaisacks, twelve hundred and
 eighty-nine of these animals, and directed his course homewards
 wit' them by Tsaritzin, where he brought them across the Wolga.
 After making all the deductions from this number occasioned by
 losses on the road, by the shipment of them at Kaffa, and the
 passage home, there now exist in France four hundred of this
 stock of Cachemire-wool goats.
     During a short stay which M. Joubert made at Constantinople,
 in his passage homewards with his goats, he held a conversation,
 through the second interpreter to the French embassy, with an
 Armenian named Khodja-Youssuf, who was sent eighteen years
 ago by a house in Constantinople into Cachemire to procure shawls
 made after patterns which he carried with him. This Armenian
 resided a long time in Cachemire, Lahore, and Pichawer, and in
 learning the language of these countries, he obtained much po
 sitive information as to the manufacture of these valued articles.
 He stated to M. Joubert, that the animal which yields this beau
 tiful material is neither a camel nor a sheep, as some have re
 ported, but is a goat, resembling the common goat in appear
 ance, having straight horns, and a white or clear brown coat.
A coarse hair covers the fine downy wool, which last is the only
material from which the shawls are wove.
     Khodja-Youssuf had seen at Cachemire twenty or thirty of
these goats, which were kept there for curiosity.        The women
and children pick out the fine wool from the coarse haih, and
other heterogeneous matter; which is afterwards carded by
young girls with their fingers on India muslin, to lengthen the
fibre, and clean it from dirt and foulness ; and in this state it is
delivered to the dyers and spinners.      The loom that is used is
horizontal and very simple ; the weaver sits on the bench, a child
is placed below him with his eyes on the pattern, and gives him
notice after every throw of the shuttle, of the colours wanted,
and the bobbins to be next employed.         The finest shawls cost
from 5 to 600 rupees (12 to 1500 francs).       The most beautiful
wool comes from the provinces of Lassa and Ladack in Thibet J
and also a good deal of it is imported into Thibet and Cache
mire, from Casgar and Bucharia, all of which goes to form the
fine shawls, of which there is such a great demand throughout
Asia. The fine wool is brought into- Cachemire in bales, mixed

                                                       Deal, May 1, 1820.
             A young nautical         friend of mine, whose perseverance
   in acquiring a    complete knowledge of the scientific principles of
   his profession is only equalled by his diffidence and modesty,
   consulted me a few days back on a difficulty he had met with in
   the practical application of the table alluded to in the head of
   this article ; and I soon perceived that it was not one that could
   be removed, as it arose out of some erroneous principle employed
   in the computation of the numbers in question ; and as I con
   ceive it to be of the highest importance that no error of this kind
   should be allowed to slide unnoticed into our nautical practice,
   I have been induced to draw up the following remarks, which
   may be the means of checking -the evil that might otherwise arise
   out of the use of this table.
      The subject of local magnetism has of late attracted the at
  tention of many of our most eminent navigators and philoso
   phers, and various observations have accordingly been made in
  different quarters of the globe, the results of which show that in
  the northern hemisphere, the north end of the needle is drawn
  towards the vessel, and in the southern hemisphere, the south
t end ; or we may say generally, that the end of the needle which
  dips is always attracted by the iron of the vessel.          It appears
  also by the observations of Captain Flinders, that the effect in
  creases in both hemispheres as the dip increases • a fact which
  has been amply verified by the experiments of Captain Ross in his
  recent voyage to the arctic regions.
      In consequence of this change of effect in parting north and
  south from the magnetic equator, it seemed to follow of necessity,
                                                                          '
  that the attraction vanished entirely where the dip is zero ; and
  such is the principle laid down by Captain Flinders, who how
  ever had obviously failed in establishing the law of increase of
  effect in different latitudes.
     The recent voyages of discovery towards the north having
  thrown additional light on this subject, Dr. Young, the learned
  Secretary to the Board of Longitude, undertook to establish a
  new law of increase, and computed a table for the use of navi
  gators, which is published or circulated by order of the members
  of that board, whereby the correction for local attraction is re
  duced to a simple logarithmic operation, the dip leing first as
  certained.     It is to this table I am desirous of calling the atten
  tion of your nautical readers.
                                                                      We

358                      Remarks on an   Error in   a Table
    We have seen that all experiments confirm the fact, first nor
ticed by Captain Flinders, that although the effect of local at
traction is the same in quantity in north and south latitudes,
where the dips are equal, yet it is directly opposite in direction,
the north end of the needle being in one case attracted by the
vessel, and in the other the south.            For example: Suppose a
ship's head to be east, at the Nore, and that the local attraction
of the vessel at the maximum is half a point, then the north end
of the needle will be drawn half a point from its true bearing to
wards the east.        Now, at Port Jackson the dip is as nearly as
possible   the   same   as in England; but it being the south end that
dips, the effect    will still be half a point the contrary way ; that is,
the north point will now be deflected half a point to the west,
the ship's head being east as before.
    This contrary effect has place in both cases till we arrive at
the equator, where according to Captain Flinders it vanishes en
tirely ; but according to Dr. Young's table (although the effect
 must change as we cross the magnetic equator) it does not va
nish, being at the equator itself equal to about one half what it is
in England. This was the difficulty of my young friend, and it
is certainly one which I am unable to explain ; and I will add
 that it is a result absolutely impossible in itself, and contrary to
 that principle maintained by all philosophers, that the operations
 of nature are never made per saltus.              To put the case in a
 stronger light, let us suppose three vessels, whose local attractions
 are equal, the maximum of each being half a point at the Nore:
 then according to Dr. Young's table, the attraction of each at
 and very near the magnetic equator will be about 3".               Let us
 suppose   these   three  vessels to be a mile distance  from  each other,
 one being    on   the  equator   and the other  two  a mile  on each  side
 of   it,
        the one       north and tlte other in south magnetic latitude
                         in                                                  ;
  and let us further suppose, that they are all sailing due east             :
 and that each takes an azimuth observation at the same instant.
  No one can doubt for moment that these azimuths will be the
                               a
  same in each vessel, and let us suppose that .they are such as to
  give the computed variation                 Ifnow each vessel correct
 her variation according to Dr. Young's table, the one in south
 latitude will make her corrected variation 10a — 3° = 7° west,
  and the one in north latitude will make hers 10° + 3° = 13'
 west,      difference of 6°
            a                      while the vessel on the equator will

  have no guide to know in what direction her correction             to be
                                                                        is
  applied.     The   case  which   we have here supposed      is no means
                                                                   by
  one advanced for the purpose o exaggerating the amount of
  the error     ;   it   case that would actually occur in sailing from
                         is
                         a

   Enough has now been said to prove that the principle upon
which this table is constructed must necessarily be erroneous,
and we hope it may be the means of preventing any further issue
of the copies of it ; for we must not consider an error of this
kind in the light of a mere philosophical inaccuracy, but as one
which may involve in it the destruction of lives and property to
an immense extent. I make no pretensions to scrutinize the ma
thematical introduction to the table in question, I have every
respect for the mathematical talents of its learned author, and
have little doubt this part is correct ; it. is however highly pro
bable that the error is in the data or hypothesis.        It is certainly
very   improbable    that iron at  the equator  should lose  all its effect
on a magnetised needle, as supposed by Captain Flinders; but it
is actually impossible that the change should be such as is indi
cated in the table before us.
    I shall make only one other observation, which                   is,
                                                            that an error
once introduced into. nautical computations                     is

 to eradicate. The midshipman who learns the use of Dr. Young's
table this year will use       all his life, and with the utmost con

360             On the Alteration which Sulphuric Acid
moment when it is sufficiently concentrated to crystallize, there
is obtained by the refrigeration the proto-sulphovinate of lime.
    This salt is in small flakes; it has a peculiar burnt taste; it
attracts humidity, and inflames when a lighted candle is implied
to it. Strongly heated it becomes black and very acid             The de
composition which is announced by this black colour, takes place
as soon as, by the progress of the evaporation, salt is deposited on
the sides of the vessel ; it extends even to the whole of the salt,
if at the moment when it begins to manifest itself it is not stopped
by the addition of a little chalk ; and the liquor, in which no
trace of sulphuric acid could previously be discovered, contains
then a great excess of it. The acid of proto-sulphovinate of lime
or of barytes may be easily obtained by decomposing the liquor by
sulphuric acid.      This new acid gives the whole secret of etheri-
fication, since it is produced with sulphuric ether.            Many che
mists   believe  that  the sulphuric acid  loses  none   of its saturating
property in acting upon alcohol; but the reverse is the case, as
any person may convince himself by testing the acid before and
 after its action on alcohol.
    Almost all the organic substances and powerful acids act in
 the same manner.
    The second acid (deut-cenothionicum) is found in the residue
 of the distillation of the ether, treated several times with alco
hol and perfectly exhausted, but fresh, and not black or altered.
This residue is saturated with chalk or with carbonate of barytes, as
already mentioned. The deuto-sulphovinate of lime is very sweet,
and possesses the property of absorbing the oxygen from the air,
and of producing sulphate of lime, a good deal of sulphuric acid,
and the third acid {trit-cenothionicum).         It is thus seen why the
residue   of  the  preparation  of ether  restored to the air the pro
perty which it had lost of giving ether; and why it saturates
then more than before.         The sulphovinous deut-acid produces
thus by decomposition much sulphuric acid and the sulphovinous
trit-acid.
    The sulphovinous trit-acid is obtained very easily by exposing
to the air, until there is no longer any absorption, of oxygen,
either the second acid or the exhausted residue of the distilla
tion of sulphuric ether.       By saturating with chalk the trito-sul-
phovinate of lime is obtained, which is deliquescent when exposed
to the air, and, like all acetates, combustible. It has Very nearly
the same savour as the first sulphovmate of lime, and has many
affinities with this salt.
    The sulphovinous acids are easily isolated from their combina
tions with lime or with barytes. Distilled, each of them gives a dif
ferent product. The three sulphovinates of lime give,for example,
by distillation, three new liquid crystallizable acids remotely re
                                                                 sembling

  M. Sertuerner mentions       that in distilling  the proto-nitrovinate
  of lime the fumes caused him inexpressible pains, like meconic
  acid; but of this he promised to say more thereafter.
     Such are the principal facts contained in the memoir of
  M. Sertuerner relatively to acids formed by the reaction of sul
  phuric acid upon alcohol. He pleads the great extent of the sub
 ject which it embraced, as an apology for not entering much into
  detail on any of the points.      But M. Gilbert properly observes,
  that it was only by entering into such detail that he could carry
  conviction to the minds of his readers ; for it must be confessed
  that he is far from having demonstrated the existence of his three
  acids, and that by the vagueness of his assertions he has left
  the field free to those who, occupying themselves with the sub
 ject, place their reliance on precise experiments.
     M. Vogel read to the Academy of Sciences of Munich on the
  9th of October 1819, "Some Inquiries into the mutual Decom-
. position of Sulphuric Acid and Alcohol," &c. which he has printed
  in the Journal de Pharmacie, torn. vi. p. 1, and the object of
  which was to repeat the experiments of M. Sertuerner.              We
  shall extract from this also some particulars.
     Equal parts in weight of alcohol at 40' and concentrated sul
  phuric acid have been slowly mixed together, and the mixture
  kept eight hours in a flask closely corked up. The liquid after
  being diluted with double its volume of water was divided into
  two equal part«, one of which was neutralized by carbonate of
  barytes, and the other by carbonate of lead.
     After separating the sulphates of barytes and of lead by filter
  ing, the liquors were charged with salts of barytes and lead. These
  saline solutions evaporated to dryness and heated in a crucible
  yielded sulphurous acid gas, and a heavy white oil of ethereal
  odour ; there remained in the crucible some sulphate of barytes
  or sulphate of lead. The sulphuric acid yielded similar results
  with three parts of alcohol.
     Equal parts in weight of alcohol and sulphuric acid were set
  to boil in a crucible until ether began to escape.       The crucible
  was then recooled, and the liquid     which    remained, divided into
  three equal parts; the first was restored to the crucible and set
  to boil until the half of the ether which it could furnish had
  passed into the receiver; the second was heated until It had
  given forth all its ether ; the third was not heated at all.
      Each of these portions saturated with carbonate of lead gave
  a new soluble salt (sulphovinate of lead), but it was the second

which furnished the greatest quantity.       The residue of the etheV
may    however   be turned  to advantage   when  it is not too much
carbonized.
    To obtain the acid contained in this salt a current of hydro-
tiilphuric acid was employed. We may also decompose the salt
Formed by the same acid with barytes by means of sulphuric acid.
    The new acid, or the sulphovinous acid, cannot be concentrated
on the fire ; for the liquid has scarcely begun to boil, when it is
already forced to contain a great quantity of sulphuric acid.
Placed under an empty receiver, by the side of a jar filled with
sulphuric acid, it concentrated, and at last appeared almost as
oily as sulphuric acid.     It had not yet suffered decomposition,
and its density was 1,319.      Left for a longer time in the empty
reciever it became decomposed ; some sulphurous gas was dis
engaged, and there remained in the vase concentrated sulphuric
acid, and some drops of ethereal oil.       Sulphovinous acid of the
density of 1,319 may remain in cpld contact with nitric acid
without being decomposed ; but heated nitrous vapours are sent
forth, and sulphuric acid remains.        Similar phenomena' occur
when the sulphovinates are treated with nitric acid.        M. Vogel
has not remarked any difference between the acids extracted at
different periods before or after the separation of the ether, and
he does not adopt the three modifications of M. Sertuerner.
    Sulphovinous acid concentrated cannot be long preserved in its
state of purity ; after the lapse of about fifteen days it begins to
affect the salts of barytes.
    The sulphovinate of lime, obtained by saturating the residue of
the ether with chalk, is in the form of quadrilateral tablets, bi
sected at right angles ; is unalterable when exposed to the air,
but when the salt has evaporated in a body, it attracts humidity.
The crystals have a taste slightly sweet, and are very soluble in
water and alcohol.       In the empty receiver by the side of the
lime they lose their transparency, as also their water of crystalli
zation. Thrown into a hot crucible they burn with flame, and
blacken ; but by continuing to heat the crucible, they become
white, and are nothing then but sulphate of lime.
    The sulphovinate of lime heated slowly in a crucible, bubbles
and becomes black ; an ethereal empyreumatie liquid passes into
the receiver, accompanied with a yellow oil which sinks in wa
ter.    This oil has something of the oleum villi; but it does not
possess its lightness.     Sulphurous gas is at last expelled, and
there remains in the crucible sulphate of lime mixed with a little
charcoal.
    The sulphovinate of barytes is prepared by saturating the re
sidue of the ether with carbonate of barytes.       By a slow evapo
ration of the liquor crystals very brilliant and possessed of trans
                                                              parency

                    experiences,    in acting upon uilcolwl.               363
pjirency are obtained ; they are foursided andunalterable by tha
air. Although very soluble in water, the sulphovinate of barytes
is scarcely so in alcohol. Washed with very concentrated alcohol,
in order to see whether the oil adhered mechanically to its sur
face, it yielded on distillation the same products as if it had not
been washed « viz. an ethereal empyreumatic liquid and a heavy
yellow oil.      Prom this result we may conclude, that the oil is
not mixed mechanically with the salt, but that it is in a true state
qf combination .
    The sulphovinate of lead may be obtained like the two pre
ceding salts, by saturating the residue of ether with carbonate of
lead.     By evaporation there remains a saline mass, which is so
attractive of humidity that in some hours it deliquesces entirely.
The salt dried, requires scarcely the half of its weight of water to
dissolve it; it is also very soluble in alcohol.            Heated in a cru
cible,   it  yields   a heavy   oil,  and  the residue  consists  of sulphate
 of lead mixed with a little charcoal.
    The sulphovinate of potash was prepared by neutralizing the
carbonate of potash by pure acid.               It makes its appearance in
pearly scales similar to those of boracic acid ; it is greasy to the
touch like tajc; its taste is sweetish; it dissolves easily in water,
and fuses with a mild heat.
    The sulphovinate of soda presents itself in brilliant crystals,
 the form of which is not very regular and which effloresce slightly
 when exposed to the air.
    The sulphovinate of copper is prepared by dissolving carbo
 nate of copper in sulphovinous acid.            The solution gives by eva
poration blue crystals       in  large   pieces,  very soluble in water and
in alcohol ; the salt passes into the state of sulphate when heated
 to some degrees above the temperature of boiling water.
    Sulphovinous acid dissolves iron with a disengagement of hy
drogenous gas. The solution is colourless, of a sweetish taste,
and yields no precipitate with salts of barytes.              By spontaneous
evaporation,      foursided   prisms   are  obtained   of a yellow-white    co
lour. These crystals           effloresce   on   exposure    to the  air,  and
promptly lose their transparency.
,   The sulphovinates may remain a long time exposed to the air
without suffering decomposition.             Several solutions of these salts
may    be   even   boiled   without    sulphuric   acid being formed ; it is
only very      concentrated    solutions    which   do not support a long
(ebullition. ,
    After having examined many salts formed by sulphovinous acid,
JVI. Vogel compares this acid with hypo-sulphuric acid.
    Both in a liquid state are colourless, very bitter, and cannot he
.concentrated by ebullition without being changed into sulphuric
.acid, and into sulphurous acid.

     Both can be rendered more dense, and in the same degree, in
 the vacuum of the pneumatic machine.
     Both form soluble salts which have the strongest resemblance.
     Both, as well as their salts, are decomposed by nitric acid aided
 by heat, and give sulphuric acid and sulphates.
     The difference between them consists in this, that the*sulpho-
 vinous acid and its salts contain a volatile oil, which escapes -at
 a high temperature,     and is partly decomposed.       The hypo-sul-'
 pbutic   acid,  on the contrary,  is converted by heat into sulphurous'
 acid and sulphuric acid without yielding oil, and the hypo-sul
 phates do not carbonize at a red heat.
     From these facts, it results that sulphuric acid mixed with
 alcohol is decomposed without the assistance of heat ; that it
 abandons the oxygen, and gives birth to a particular acid. Du
 ring etherification, the action of sulphuric acid is not confined to
 determining the formation of water, as Fourcroy and Vauquelin
 have announced, and the theory of ether ought therefore to be
 modified.      The new acid has the greatest affinity to the hypo-
 sulphuric acid, and only differs from it in the volatile oil with
 which it is combined-.
     On leaving sulphuric acid in contact with birch saw-dust, or
 oil of lavender, it produces an acid which forms with barytes and
 the oxide of lead very soluble salts, which analysed are also re
 duced- into sulphates.
     As soon as we received an account of the experiments of
 M- Vogel we hastened to repeat them.
     We made accordingly a mixture of equal parts of sulphuric
 acid and alcohol, and exposed it to heat until sulphurous acid
 began to manifest itself.      The residue saturated with lime and
 filtered, furnished by evaporation a salt in small flakes; but to
 obtain more precise results on the nature of sulphovinous acid
 we transformed this salt into sulphovinate of barvtes, decompos
 ing it by, a slight excess of that base, and passing afterwards
 through the filtered solution a current of carbonic acid gas.' By
.a crystallization effected in the course of twelve hours we ob
 tained the salt crystallized in small pearly scales of a square
form; but by a spontaneous evaporation, we obtained beautiful
four-faced rhomboidal prisms terminated by a pyramid with four
faces corresponding to those of the prism.         These crystals have
a very beautiful appearance, and are not affected by exposure to
the air ; in the receiver, however, by the side of the concen
trated sulphuric acid, they become opaque in the course of twenty-
four hours, and abandon a certain quantity of water. One hun
dred parts, of salt 'simply dried in the air have lost by calcination
4i>'07; but a hundred parts of the same salt dried in the re^
ceiver have only lost 4 1*5.                                        The

                  ttperiences in acting upon Alcohol.             3b'5    :
    The purest sulphovinate of barytes subjected to the action of
heat is very easily decomposed, even by a slight evaporation, to
dryness.     Its products are an inflammable gas which burns like
defiant gas, sulphurous acid, very little carbonic acid, water,
and an ethereal oil, the odour of which mixed with that of sul- :
phurous acid, has much resemblance to that of acetic ether.           It-
is not improbable that this ether might be formed ; but we made
our experiments on too minute quantities to obtain the certainty
of it.    There remained in the apparatus sulphate of barytes,
blackened by a very small quantity of charcoal, which a short
exposure in the air to a red heat sufficed to purify completely.
    The analysis of sulphovinate of barytes not having been vet:
made, and M. Vogel having contented himself with remarking
the analogy which exists between sulphovinous acid and hypo-
sulphuric acid, it appeared to us interesting to inquire whether
the composition of the first of these acids, abstracting the vege
table matter, was the same as that of the second, and in what the:
manner vegetable matter influences its capacity of saturation.
    One hundred parts of sulphovinate of barytes dried in the air
lost 45,07, and furnished .*t4"93 sulphate of barytes very white
and very pure.      One hundred other parts of the same salt, cal
cined with a mixture of chlorate and carbonate of potash, and
afterwards precipitated by chlornret of barium, produced 1 1 1 -47-
of sulphate of barytes, being nearly double 54-93.                      >.
    By   thus  abstracting  the vegetable   matter  the sulphovinous,
acid appears composed in the same manner as hypo-sulphuric
acid, and its capacity of saturation is not changed by the pre
sence of this vegetable matter, which seems to play there the same
                                          '
part as water of crystallization.                               > . .
     Nevertheless the vegetable matter gives to the sulphovinates
particular characters.     That of barytes has a crystallization dif
ferent from that of the hypo-sulphate, and it loses 45 07 by the,
calcination, while the latter loses only 29-9.       The other salts
formed by sulphovinous acid and hypo-sulphuric acid appear
 equally different, and merit particular attention. M. Dabit thinks
that the vegetable matter was accidental in the sulphovinates ;
but as it is on the contrary essential to them, the proofs which
he has offered to demonstrate the existence of an acid more oxy
genated than sulphurous acid, and less so than sulphuric acid,
 cannot now be regarded ; for the decomposition of nitric acid by
 the sulphovinate of barytes which he had observed, and even the
direct absorption of oxygen gas by this salt, which besides has
 not been confirmed, may be attributed to the vegetable matter
 itself.
    Agreeably to the observations which have been made, and by
 ourselves in particular, we admit that the greater part of the ve
                                                               getable

366                 .Account   of the Origin of the Art
 getable and animal matters on which the concentrated sulphuric
 acid exerts an action at a moderate temperature, and without
 manifesting sulphurous acid, on being treated by that acid, gave
 birth to hypo-sulphuric acid combined with a vegetable or ani
 mal matter, which appears in general different for each kind
 of substance.       Ought we accordingly to distinguish as many
 particular   acids   as there are vegetable or animal matters com
 bined with hypo- sulphuric acid?            We think not: but it would
 be premature to attach at present too much importance to this
 opinion.
    The theory of etherification         as it has been given by Fourcroy
 and Vauquelin     can   no longer  be   maintained.  Sulphuric acid really
 yields oxygen to alcohol,      and    the result of the etherification ap
 pears to be ether, hypo-sulphuric acid, and a vegetable matter
 of an oily nature, which has the greatest analogy to mild spirit of
 wine.     It forms in fact a considerable quantity of hypo-sulphuric
 acid, relatively to the ether produced, and the spirit of wine docs
 not manifest itself, except at the same time with the sulphurous,
 acid — that is to say, that these two bodies are the result of the
decomposition of sulphovinous acid. The alcohol, to change itself
into ether, only requires to abandon hydrogen and oxygen in the
proportions in which these bodies enter into the composition of
 water; but since the sulphuric acid really yields oxygen, it should
 separate from the charcoal, and it is in the spirit of wine we,
ought to find it again.
    It is very probable, according to these new facts, that in the
bitter of Welter, and other analogous compounds, the acid is in
the state of nitrous acid.
    The investigations which we have made are still too imper
fect to be much insisted on, and we should even have deferred
making them known had it not been for the opportunity furnished
us by those of MM. Dabit, Sertuerner and Vogel.
LXI.      Account    of the Origin of the Art of manufacturing Tin-
                Plate,     By JSamuel Parses, F.L.S.*
Formerly         none of the English workers in iron or tin had any
knowledge whatever of the methods by which this useful article
could be produced ; our ancestors, from time immemorial, having
supplied themselves with it from Bohemia and Saxony.                    The
establishment of this manufacture in those districts was doubt-
   * From A descriptive Account of the several Processes which are usually
pursued in the Manufacture of the Article known in Commerce by the Name
of Tin-Plate, inserted in Vol. III. oi the Memoirs of the Literary aud Philo

  less owing to their    vicinity to the tin mines ill the circle of Ersge-
 birg, which, next to those of Cornwall, are the largest in Europe-.
 The ore which is found there is not the tin pyrites, but the mi
  neral called tinstone ; and it is curious that it should occur in
  abundance both on the Bohemian and Saxon sides of the moun
 tain group i accordingly, manufactories of tinned iron have been
  established in both those kingdoms.           Alluvial deposits of grain-
  tin are also Found in the same vicinity.
      From the time of the invention of tin-plate to the end of the
 seventeenth century, not only England, but also the whole of
 Europe depended upon the manufactures of Bohemia and Saxony
 for their supply.         However, about the year 1665 one Andrew
 Yarranton, encouraged by some persons of property, undertook
 to go over to Saxony to acquire a knowledge of the art — and on
 his return, several parcels of tin-plate were made of a superior
 quality to those which we had been accustomed to import from
 Saxony; but Owing to some unfortunate and unforeseen circum
 stances, which are all detailed by Mr. Yarranton *, the manu
 factory was riot at that time established in any part of Greeft
 Britain.
      As it is now difficult to procure a copy of the work from which
 I have obtained a knowledge of the manner in which this manu
factory was brought into England, an abridgement of the author's
own account of the transaction may perhaps be interesting to
some of the members of the Society.
      "Knowing," says Mr. Yarranton, "the usefulness of tin-plates,
and the goodness of our metals for that purpose, I did (about six
teen years since f) endeavour to find out the way for making
thereof ; whereupon, I acquainted a person of much riches, and
one that was very understanding in the iron manufacture; who
was pleased to say, that he Had often designed to get the trade
into England, but never could find out the way.                Upon which
it was agreed, that a sum of monies should be advanced,
by several persons, for the defraying my charge of travelling to
the place where these plates were made ; and from thence to
bring away the art of making them. Upon which, an able fire
man, that well understood the whole nature of iron, was made
choice of to accompany me ; and being fitted with an engenioiis
interpreter, that well understood the language, and that had
dealt much in that commodity, we marched first for Hamburg,

 Saxomes Court, where we had notice of the place where the
 plates were made ; which was in a large tract of mountainous
 land, running from a place called Seger-Hutton, unto a town
 called Awe, being in length about twenty miles ; the tin-works
 being there fixed upon a great river running clear along the valley,
 and also upon some little rivulets that run out of the mountains
 of Bohemia and Saxony; and coming to the works, we were very
 civilly treated, and, contrary to our expectation, we had much
 liberty to view, and see the works go — with the way and man
 ner of their working and extending the plates, as also the per
 fect view of such materials as they used in clearing the plates,
 to make them fit to take tin, with the way they use in tinning
 them over, when cleared from their rust and blackness.                     And
 having (as we judged) sufficiently obtained the whole art of
 making and tinning the plates, we then came for England, where
 the several persons concerned in the affair thought fit to make
 some trial in making some small quantities of plates and tinning
  them, which was done; and all workmen that wrought upon
 them agreeing that the plates were much better than those which
 were made in Germany; upon which, preparation was making
 to set this beneficial thing at work ; — but, it being understood
,at London, a pate'nt was trumpt up, and the patentee was

  he carried on for several years ; arid during this period, he made regular
  surveys of the three great rivers in England, and by means of associations
  which were formed by himself, be rendered three other rivers navigable —
  he studied agriculture with such effect, that many of the arable estates in

 Cornish miner, a protestant, who had been banished out of
  England for his religion, found out the tin in Saxony— both
 which persons proved instruments of great wealth to that duke
 and country*."
     Notwithstanding Mr. Yarranton had so completely introduced
'the knowledge of making tin-plate into this country, I do not
 find that any manufacture of that article was established in these
 kingdoms until some time between the years 1720 and 1730,
 which must have been long after Mr. Yarranton's death. The
 first establishment of this kind was, I believe, fixed in Monmouth
 shire, where it continued to flourish many years f.
     About the time that this manufactory was established, the
  amiable and intelligent M. Reaumur, to whom the French are
 indebted for a new mode of graduating the thermometer, and for
 many discoveries and improvements in the arts %, — undertook to
 discover the method of making tin-plates for the French people.
 This eminent man, whose mind was cast in a mould very similar
 to that of Mr. Yarranton, but who possessed more science, never
 relinquished any thing which he undertook; and accordingly, not
 withstanding the innumerable difficulties which he had to encoun
 ter, at length succeeded in acquiring such a knowledge of the prin
 ciples of the manufacture, as enabled him to instruct several peo
 ple in the vicinity Of Paris, in an art which, until then, had never
                                                                       '
 been practised in that country.                                         .
     Soon after the time of which I am speaking, several similar
 manufactories were erected in Great Britain; and now the esta
 blishments of this nature are so numerous and extensive in many
 parts of these kingdoms, that the manufacture of tin-plate is be
 come of great national importance, and more than one hundred
 thousand boxes of these plates are annually exported.

    * Saxony is only separated from Bohemia by a chain of mountains called
 the Erzegeberg; which in German signifies hills that contain mines.
    f   Upon further inquiry, I find that this was at the town of Ponty Pool ;
 and it is remarkable, that after the lapse of nearly 100 years the manufacture
 has recently been re-established at the same town, on a very extensive scale.
    J  It was Mons. Reaumur who was the means of introducing into France
 the methods of making porcelain ; for when Francis d'EntrocoIIes, who had
 resided many years in China as a Christian Missionary, sent to France spe
 cimens of the materials used by the Chinese in their porcelain, M. Reaumur
 immediately instituted a series of experiments to discover the method of
 imitating their productions, and in the years 1727 and 1729 communicated
 the result of his researches to the Academy of Sciences j and his two n»e-
  tnoirs were published by the Society in their Transactions.

   LXII.    Account    of a Visit to the Crater of the Volcano Goenong
      Apie,  one of the  Islands of Banda. By Captain Verheul*.
   In    the year 1817 (says M. V.), being in the Archipelago of
   Banda, with His Majesty's ship Admiral Evertsen, of which I
   had the command, commissioned by the Government to receive
   from the English possession of those islands so celebrated for
   their principal production, the nutmeg; I formed the design of
   visiting the Goenong Apie, or volcano, situated in one of these
   islands, and of ascending to the summit as nearly as possible.
   Being fond of drawing, I promised myself a rich harvest for my
   collection of Indian sketches and drawings.
       The little island of Goenong Apie rises in the form of a cone
   above the surface of the ocean; two-thirds are covered with co
   coa and other trees, the rest is arid, and bears the traces of lava
   in different directions, which lead to the flattened summit. The
   island does not produce any spices ; but some of the inhabitants
   of Banda have made in the lower part some gardens, the most
   considerable of which belongs to Mr. Vetter, officer of the royal
   marine in the colonies, and commandant of the port of Banda.
   Formerly there were also some forts to protect the. western out
   let, but none now exist.
 i     The 3d of April was the day I fixed for the execution of this
   arduous expedition.        I preferred the night in order to avoid the
   excessive heat of the sun ; and the more so, as the full moon fa
   voured our enterprise.
       Mr. Vetter offered some of his slaves to serve us as guides, and
   several officers of the ship Evertsen joined our party.         An hour
   after midnight we went on board a boat, and proceeded to the
   country-house of Mr. Vetter, whose dwelling with several other
   habitations had been almost entirely demolished by the earth-
. quake in October,       1816.     There we put aside our superfluous
   clothes, and carrying bamboo canes, wc proceeded to the execu~
   tion of our project. Several negroes of our company carried the
   necessary refreshments, and the flags of the Netherlands, which
   we proposed to place on the edge of the crater.            The night was
   magnificent : soon every thing around us was desert, and very-
   often we were enveloped in darkness by the thick foliage of the
   trees, shrubs, and other plants, so that we were obliged to feel
   with our canes, and to climb from rock to rock, in order to find
    a practicable path.      One of the Indians who preceded us, armed
   with a kind of axe called klenang, with which he cut away the
   branches that impeded our progress, pointed out to us the clefts
   in the rocks, produced as it seems by earthquakes.              We were
    often obliged to go a long way about in order to avoid the ere-

proceeded along their black edges, by the brambles and ferns

 which grow- there in an abundance, and to an extraordinary
height, .,. .
    The most varied scenes, sometimes agreeable, and sometime*
 terrible, opened themselves to our view whenever a beam of the
 moon penetrated the darkness which surrounded us.           Here trees
 with their branches interlaced, there ancient trunks overthrown
 or rooted up, everywhere enormous steep rocks, some wholly
 barren, some covered with a kind of verdure, the clamp clefts
 in which served as 'retreats for monstrous serpents, the sight of
 which terrified us whenever we discovered them by their hissing.
 We found hercnumerous majestic cocoa trees loaded with fruit.
 By degrees we advanced, and as the thickness of the trees and
 the verdure of them, as well as the rocks, visibly diminished, we
 enjoyed more and more the lustre of the queen of night, and we
 had reason to hope that we should soon be at the end of our pil-i
 grimage on the barren part of the mountain.         It was about half-
 past four in the morning when we at last arrived ; and the scene
 which offered itself to our view amply repaid our fatigues.       The
 wbcHe cone appeared from the bottom like an extremely smooth
 mass formed of heaps of lava ; the summit was enveloped in sul
 phureous clouds issuing from the crater, gently agitated by the
 night breeze, and their edges silvered by the beams of the moon.
 From time to time flashes or quick eruptions of fire issued from
 the interior of the volcano.    A mournful silence prevailed around
 us, the ppean was blended with the clouds, and the islands seemed
 to float beneath our feet in the dim perspective.
    After having reposed some moments in this place, we under
 took the dangerous and fatiguing task of ascending a slope of
 50°, and climbing over a mass of moving stones.         As in coming
 loose they drew others along with them, we were obliged to keep
 in a line abreast of each other, in order to avoid mutual injury
 when we were thrown down by these stones.          It often happened
 that when we leaned upon the largest masses, they loosened, and
 lamed our hands and feet.       At pretty short intervals we had op
 portunities of resting upon ferns growing between the rocks; then
 we took breath, and refreshed ourselves with a beverage which
we had carried with us.
    Suddenly the horizon cleared up, and we perceived the ex
tremity of the ocean, and the clouds floating around us like a
gilded zone; it was the approach of dawn.            At the same time
the morning-gun was heard from the Evertsen, and the noise re
peated from one island to another insensibly died away, like that
of' thunder upon the vast surface of the ocean. The dawning
light showed us the verdure of the trees below our feet like an
                                                                  even

of the houses and the forts Neira and Lonthoer. The sun now
 rose in all its splendour:   he issued majestically from the bosom
of   the ocean, and his brilliant rays were reflected by the waves
of the calmest sea. We seemed to float with the steep Pico on
                                                                  '
 which we stood, having above our heads the serenest sky.            No
expression   is adequate to paint   so astonishing  a picture.
    Meantime the sulphuric vapour which issued from the crater
began to incommode us, and our situation appeared the more
critical, as we found the stones at every successive step more and
more loose, and the noise they made in falling was augmented
by that which was heard in the interior of the crater. Thick sul
phuric exhalations issued with violence from the clefts of the
mountain, in the sides of which we heard a confused rumbling
noise, resembling the roaring of the sea agitated by a tempest.
    We at last arrived at the upper edge of the crater, with our
shoes and clothes half burnt, and our hands wounded by the
sharp lava.     The appearance of the interior of the crater, which
is in the form of a funnel, is singularly striking; the whole sur
face is covered with a lava of the most beautiful yellow colour
imaginable ; the smoke issued from a number of channels or tubes
of sulphur, frequently accompanied by a hollow sound. The
crater itself may be calculated at about 200 feet in diameter, and
the bottom is divided into two parts.          On the north side the-
bottom is not visible, the edges are steep, so that their greatest
thickness does not exceed four feet.       On the south side the bot
 tom is seen covered with an immense quantity of rocks, which
appear to have been thrown into it by the last eruption, the"
traces of which are visible in a deep furrow of lava across the
whole mountain..
    We went on as far as the top of a peak which rises on the
northern side; it was there that Lieutenant de Tong and myself
placed the standard of the Netherlands.        We found there also a
cassowary which had run away from the farm of Mr. Vetter, si
tuated at the foot of the mountain.       It seems that this bird was
suffocated by the sulphureous atmosphere.
    The wind began to blow from the south, and as it drove the
thick sulphuric clouds from the entrance of the crater, we had a
mind to examine more nearly a part, of the interior. For this pur
pose we kept our handkerchiefs tied before our noses and mouths,
to preserve them from the azotic gas, and descended into the
volcano. The sulphur upon which we walked broke and crackled'
like frozen snow, and thie heat of the ground obliged us to be
always in motion.      Sometimes a hollow sound was heard under,
our feet: the smoke, continually effervescent, issued from the
veins of crystallized sulphur, and, escaping with violence, evapo
                                                                 rated

sulphur, mixed with    very brilliant saltpetre, produced

cal effect;  but when we arrived at the edge of the second region
of the bottom of the crater we perceived      thick and boiling va
                                               a
pour.
  This vapour not permitting        us to advance, or remain any longer
where we were, we turned baek, and went out of the crater loaded
with beautiful pieces of lava and crystallized sulphur.       We were
                                                                     by
the more eager to get out, as we feared being suffocated             a
change jof the wind.      Our Indians were still more afraid to re
main than we were      ;and it   must be confessed that our situation
was imminently dangerous,       since  a few months after we had       vi
sited this place the south part of the crater, into which we had
entered, sunk in, with all the rocks which       itcontained.
    When we had got out of this, abyss, we rested for half an hour?
and then proceeded to the most; difficult part of our expedition
—-this was to descend.       One of gur companions was so terrified
at the sight of   adeclivity of four thousand feet, and of slippery
                                                             a
and almost perpendicular road which we had to pass, that his
fear checking his respiration gave us      agreat deal of trouble but
                                                                   ;
with the assistance of the Indians he, safely reached the forests
of the inferior region.
     found that the best way to descend this cone covered with
'
 I
lava, was to keep to the places where the ashes of the lava are
the finest, leaning upon   a   bamboo cane, and to let myself glide
down till I  was up to my knees in the ashes, then to extricate
myself and begin the operation again.           Itwas in this manner,
which   is,however, very fatiguing and painful to the feet, that       I
succeeded in reaching the end of the barren part of the mountain.
In such cases great care must be taken not to fall forwards, as
such a fall might be fatal.
    We were all extremely fatigued and thirsty, our stock of liquor
being exhausted    ; and proceeding with difficulty from one tree
to another, we arrived, at length, weary and overcome, at little a
Indian hut, where we lay down upon the grass. One of our
party was unable to utter       a single word; however, the cocoa-
pine and     piece of water-melon, which each of us took, soon
              a
restored us, and at noon we regained the valley of Neira, with
our clothes in tatters, almost Without shoes, and bruised and
scratched all over.    During all the time of our expedition our
friends below had observed us with telescopes.
    The standard which we had placed on the upper rock was seen
for long time floating
    a                      in the air; but at last    disappeared, be

LXIII.  Account of the Fall of the Glacier of the PVmshorn,
  which happened on the 27th of December 1819, and the De
  struction of the Village of Randa, in the Valley of Vispach.
Th k village     of Randa is situated about six leagues above Vis
pach,   on  the   south or right branch of the valley of Vispach",
commonly     known     under the name of the Valley of St. Nicolas.
The village   is  about  2400 feet from the right bank of the Visp,
on the steep declivity of a hill composed of fragments, the stony
ground of which has been converted by the industry of the in
habitants of Randa into pastures.        Opposite to this hill is an
other of the same nature, above which are the. rocks covered by
the Glacier of Randa ; the highest summit of which, called the
Weisshorn, is elevated about 9000 feet above the village.         The
breadth of the valley at the height of the village (nearly 250 feet
above the river) is about half a league.
    On the 27th of December, 1819, about six o'clock in the
morning, towards the eastern and very steep side of the highest
summit of the Weisshorn, a part of the glacier became loose, fell
with a noise like thunder on the mass of ice below, and an
nounced, by the most dreadful crash, the ravages with which the
Talley was threatened.      At the moment when the snow and ice
¦truck on the lower mass of the glacier, the clergyman of the
place and some other persons observed a strong light*, which
however immediately vanished, and every thing was again en
veloped in the darkest night. A frightful hurricane, occasioned
by the pressure of the air, instantly succeeded, and in a moment
spread the most tremendous devastation. The fall of the glacier
Uself did not hurt the village, but the hurricane which it occa
sioned was so powerful that it threw mill-stones several toisea
up the mountain, tore up by the roots distant larch trees of the
largest size ; threw blocks of ice of four cubic feet over the vil
lage a distance of half a league ; it tore off the top of the stone
belfry, levelled several houses with the ground, and carried the
timbers of others more than a quarter of a league beyond the
Village into the forest.    Eight goats were whirled from a stable
to a  distance   exceeding  100 toises ; and it is remarkable that one
of them was found alive. More than a quarter of a league above
the valley, the barns opposite the glacier are seen stripped             ojf
their roofs.

any doubt of its reality.

    On the whole, nine houses in the village are totally destroyed,,
 and the other thirteen more or less damaged ; eighteen grana-
fie&j eight small dwellings, two mills, and seventy-two barns are
 destroyed, or irreparably injured.       Of twelve persons who were
buried in this catastrophe, ten are still living; one was taken
out dead, and the twelfth has not yet been found. .
    The avalanche, formed of a mixture of snow, ice, and stone*,
 covers the fields and the pasturages situated below the village for
the length of at least 2 400 feet, and extends in breadth about
 1000 feet.    The mass which has fallen measures on an average
 150 feet in height.     The damage is estimated at about 20,000
francs.                                                                  ;: ,
    It is remarkable that some barns on the other side below the
glacier which were almost covered with the fragments, were
thereby protected from the hurricane, and escaped uninjured ;

                                                  that only two persons

their houses, and buried under the ruins and drifted snow. The
prompt assistance afforded          by

time the whole glacier     of the  Weisshorn    had  fallen down.       Two
other less considerable falls happened in 1736 and 1786, but
not precisely in the same place.
    This time only small part of the glacier fell down, and

dismay      by

the mass         by
                similar clefts.       It therefore much to be feared
                                           is
that the glacier cannot much longer support itself on the very
steep summit, and that the remains of the village of Randa are
destined to destruction         the inevitable fall of the impending
                               by

        LXIV.          Memoir upon Zircon.                 By M. CHEVRfiOL *.
The      zircon on which the author made his experiments was
  brought from the island of Ceylon.
     Hydrochloric acid, mixed with nitric acid, separated from it a
  great deal of peroxide of iron and a trace of oxide of titanium;
 but the latter is not essential to the composition of zircon.
     (a) A portion of zircon, which had been previously treated
 with nitro-muriatic acid, was plunged in double its weight of a
 solution of potash in alcohol, with which it was exposed to a
 cherry red temperature in a silver crucible ; the water separated
 from the heated mass a considerable quantity of potash, retain
 ing traces of silex and of zircon.
    {b)  The matter undissolved                     by
                                         the water was a compound of
 silex, of zircon, andiof potash, which maybe considered as a sort
 of double salt this compound has the following properties.

                                is
lowed to obtain the zircon separate from iron, a result which,
no person before him has been able to accomplish. He fused the
zircon containing iron with potash in a silver crucible    he ex            :
hausted the mass of all the matter soluble in water which    con^               it
tained. There remained a zirconate of potash, blended with,
oxides of iron, of copper, and of silver (the two latter proceed
ing from the crucible).  He poured upon this zirconate concen
trated hydrochloric acid there was aii immediate disengagement
                                     ;
of heat, of steam, and of hydrochloric gas. The substance, now,
in the state of a soft paste, was put into a glass cylinder of an
inch in diameter and five inches in length; concentrated hydro
chloric acid was added to                 it,
                              until that acid detached from the
matter contained in the cylinder nothing but hydrochlorate of

2d, by its not being coloured by hydrosulphuric acid ; 3d, by the hy-
drosulphate of ammonia producing with it a perfectly white preci
pitate. M. Chevreul took the mass which had been washed with-
the hydrochloric acid ; he diluted it in water, filtered the mix
ture, and precipitated the pure zircon by ammonia.                 The hy
drate    which   he  obtained  he  calcined    in  a glass capsule.     This
process, it will be observed, rests principally on this circum
stance 5 that a quantity of concentrated hydrochloric acid insuf
ficient to dissolve a certain quantity of hydrochlorate of zircon,
 suffices, on the contrary, to dissolve the hydrochlorates of iron
 and copper intermixed with the latter.
     M. Chevreul afterwards subjected the zircon and the peroxide
 of titanium to a comparative examination.
     The hydrated zircon dried in the air is soluble in hydrochloric                 ,
 acid. This combination crystallizes in small satin-like needles
 of the purest white.       The excess of acid may be expelled from
 the hydrochlorate by evaporating to dryness : on rewatering the
 residue, but very little zircon is separated, especially if the solu
 tion which was evaporated was concentrated : on again treating
 it with hydrochloric acid, the process ends by redissolving it en
 tirely, if the evaporation has not been pushed too far.
     The hydrochlorate of titanium takes a yellow colour when a
  concentrated solution of it is evaporated to dryness : a greater
  quantity of it is decomposed than is the case with hydrochlorate
  of zircon when evaporated ; and when the acid is added to the
  residue, it has not the effect of redissolving it.         But what most
  distinguishes   this hydrochlorate    from    the  preceding           is,
                                                                      that on
 joining three parts of water to one part of               solution of each

an excess of prussiate, although the latter did not, however, cause
any precipitate in the liquor which had given the white precipi
tate.    The yellow colour of prussiate of zircon explains how
Klaproth imagined that he had discovered nickel in zircon, be
cause he obtained a green precipitate on mixing with the prus
siate of potash a solution of zircon which contained a little iron.
    The hydrochlorate of zircon does not become violet when a
little zinc is added, which is the case with hydrochlorate of ti
tanium.
    The two hydrochlorates have an excessively astringent taste,
and both precipitate gelatine; which proves that they have much
more affinity for animal matters than the salts of yttria, of glu-
cine, and of alumine, the taste of which is sweet, and only slightly
astringent.
    The two hydrochlorates are completely decomposed by a red
heat ; they lose their acid, and their base remains in a state of
purity; the zircon is perfectly white ; the peroxide of titanium
is  of a yellowish gray.
    Lastly: The hydrates of titanium and zircon heated in a small
glass capsule above the flame of alcohol blacken, and then be*
come incandescent        as   if  they experienced a combustion.          The
zircon is demi-vitrified, and of the purest white when exempt
from iron ; when it contains iron, it is of a greenish hue.              The
oxide of titanium is of a gray yellow.                                     • -

portion of the elements of silicate and zirconate of potash.               He
will determine the composition of several salts of zircon, and wiH
investigate, whether the colour of prussiate of zircon may not be
owing to some foreign substances, perhaps to traces of peroxide
of titanium.

       Free Remarks on    Mr.    Greenough's     Geological Map.        3St
 ever of attempting to follow this course, Mr. G. has, on his Map,
 named each of the 34 Groups of Strata that are separately de
 picted thereon by colours, after some Place or District : these
 Places or Districts, being those (as he says) " where each Group
 may be i>est studied  f."
     And tairdli/, and chiefly I feel happy, because now, further,
 delusive and exaggerated promises, of the high degree of excel
 lency to which this Map was to attain, made by Mr. G. his Con
 tributors, and G. S. Friends, must be at an end ; it is now be
fore the Public, and many besides myself will carefully compare
 it with Mr. Smith's 15 Sheet, and his one Sheet Maps, and more
 especially so, with the 12 of his County Geological Maps, which
 are on Sale, separately: and I hope and trust, for the character
 of the Country and Age in which I live, as well as for the sake of
 my much-injured Friend Mr. Smith, that the result will be, such
  a future sale and spread of his Maps and Works, as shall at least
 re-instate the Fortune, of this ingeuious and deserving Individual.
     As to Sections, properly so called, exhibiting a supposed ver
 tical division of the Earth, along some particular Line (a Koad
 for instance, which is defined, and shown on the Map), for
 showing the edges of the Groups of Strata, and the manner and
 form of their overlieing each other, no such thing will be found,
 either in Mr. Greenough's Memoir, or on his Map; which is the
 more surprising, because Mr. Wm. Phillips, who has been sup
 posed to be well versed in the G. S. secrets, in p. 29 of the Ap
 pendix to his " Outlines," 1st Edit., gave reasons to expect,
  that the " great Map" of the " Geological Society," would when
 published, be accompanied by numerous Sections, and .by an
   f I believe myself to have been the Writer who, in June 1814, first re
commended this principle, of running Assemblages (or Groups) of Strata, in
page x. of the Preface to my Derbyshire Report1 Vol. 1. Mr. Smith,      I  be
lieve, in a partial manner adopted the same principle, in the earliest stages
of his investigations, although in the first account of the " Order of the
Strata", which he privately circulated in 1 799, (two years before I had
heard or read of Mr. S. which first occurred in the spring of 1801,) arid
which account he published in September 1815, in p. 8 of the Memoir ac
companying his Map, not one of his 23 Strata were so named : — while ho
was giving me Instructions, in the Autumn of 1801 and Spring of 1802,
Mr. S. usually spoke of, and described a large portion of his mapped Strata,
by the Names of Places upon them, and I have accordingly, in my first short
account of his Order of the Strata, (p. 1 1 1 to 1 14 of Derb Rep. V. I.) thus
named 10 of his Strata : yet before the publication of his Map, Mr. S. ap
pears to have so far abandoned this good principle of naming, as to have
retained  it,only for three of his Strata, viz. those of London, Purbeck, and
Derbyshire — Mr. Greenough has however adopted throughout (although
            :                                       i
not with the best selection of Places in some instances) and for so doing
has my thanks — for me to have expected that this Gentleman should have

  by Letters in the Map, and which therefore ought to have been
  made capable of pasting on to the margins of the Map. (by being
  printed only on one side, instead of both sides of the paper) be
  cause, without this addition to its Margins, the Map is incomplete
  and in a great degree useless, only 5 pages and 6 lines are de
 voted, to the description of the Map, or the other proper sub
 jects of an accompanying Memoir.
     An awkward and lame sort of an Apology for the conduct pur
 sued towards Mr. Smith (of which more anon) and acknowledge
 ments to some Individuals who have assisted the Author, occupy
 full two of these pages; leaving only three pages to the histori
 cal and the descriptive account of the Map, and of the principles
 on which it has been constructed ; those who may not have per
 used the Author's late Work on Geology, should not fall into the
 mistake of supposing, that the paucity and absolute defectiveness
 of this Memoir, will be found supplied by the separate Work al
 luded to, because, in neither of them, is the least mention or al*
 lusiott made to the other ; indeed, how could this have heert
 done ? because, the " Critical examination of the first principles
 of Geology," criticises to an excess, so as to unhinge              it,

 principle (which the Author notices, and as far as he has been
 able) on which Mr. Smith proceeded, in commencing his Map, 27
 or 28 years ago, and on which he prosecuted the same until, at the
very beginning of this Centufy,     itwas in a  very sufficient state to
have been published, as scores besides myself are still living to
testify, and to identify the 15-sheet Map (still in existence) which
Mr. Smith exhibited, to those whose Names (but not their Mo
nies) he solicited as Subscribers, to    a reduction of this Map, and
a  Work describing it.  I   say sufficient state of perfection, to have
at that time justified its publication, had more adequate pecuniary
encouragement been given (of which, more anon) because, to pre

the number and the order of super-position, of all the many Groups

period, or even in 1815, have been quite correctly accomplished,
or that these important objects are, even now accomplished,                    by
this Map of Mr. Greenough's, would argue, either           very shallow

 an earnest and affectionate remonstrance which has been since

     New Observatories. — The reviving taste for Astronomical pur
 suits is exemplified, not only by the formation of the Society just
 alluded to, but also by the intended establishment of two new
  Observatories.    One of which is at the expense of Government,
 and is to be built at the Cape of Good Hope; with an observer t
 assistants, &c.    The other is to be built at Cambridge, partly at
 the expeuse of the University, and partly by public subscription.
 The Plumian professor. is to be the observer at this latter place \
 since it appears that, by the foundation deed, he is bound to ob-*
serve ; and his duties are there laid down with great minuteness.
 Both these observatories are to be furnished with the best instru
 ments our artists can make.        The observations made at Cam
 bridge are to be printed annually, and circulated amongst the
 different observatories on the continent: a measure which can
 not be sufficiently applauded, and which affords the best check
 against any negligence on the part of the observer.     The obser
 vations made at the observatory at Oxford, are suffered to moulder,
 in their manuscript state, on the shelves of the Royal Society.

                          ASIATIC COLLEGE.
     The first Report of the College for Asiatic Christian and other
 Youth, instituted at Seratnpore in August 1818, under the pa
 tronage of the Marquis of Hastings, has just been published.
 The Committee observe, That slow as may have been the pro
 gress it has made, they can say with truth that every view they
 have taken of the subject has served more fully to impress them
 with the necessity of weighing with the utmost care, everycir-
 cumstance respecting an institution, the judicious planning of
 which, or the reverse, must in a great measure decide whether
 it shall ultimately fall useless to the ground, and like a heap of
 ruins remain only to discourage others from attempts of the same
 nature, or abide a blessing to the various tribes of India.
     We quote with pleasure the following passages, which show
 that the immediate and distinct object of the College is liberally
 to enlighten the people of India, and to diffuse a competent
 knowledge of arts and sciences, unconnected with any exclusive
 system of religious instruction.
     The Committee observe, " that they are fully convinced of the
 importance of supporting native youths who are not Christians
 while they prosecute their studies, as well as those who are. This
 will be attended with little disadvantage.      As a brahmun can
 not, wjthout .losing cast, eat" with a soodra, nor even under the

are not Christians must live separately, and of course without the,
walls of the College, in order to preserve inviolable their oWn
ideas of cast, which it is not the design of this institution to con
strain them to violate in any degree.         But without being thus
supported, a youth of the brightest talents might be wholly de
barred those advantages which might hereafter render him a
blessing to his country; and to lay this as an additional burden
on his generous European patron*, who, after subscribing to the
College, may have sent thither from the most distant parts of
 India an ingenious native youth for education, from regard to
the faithful services of his parent, perhaps a trusty and valued
domestic, Would be placing a barrier in the way of his obtaining
kuowledge of the highest kind, which in most instances would
 scarcelv be surmounted.       An institution which ought to combine
 within   itself every advantage for instruction, ought to be as free
 as the air ; and no native youth ought to be deprived of its be
 nefits, for having the misfortune to be born and brought up with
 in any particular circle ; the barrier to admission ought to be
 none, beyond the inability of its funds to support and instruct
 more.
    " They are equally convinced, that no native youth should be
 constrained to do a single act as the condition of his enjoying
 the benefits of this institution^ to the doing of which he attaches
 any idea of moral evil.     As it can be no crime in any youth that
 he did not regulate the circumstances of his birth and of his first
 reception of ideas,-— to make it the condition of his receiving cer
 tain important literary advantages, that he shall be constrained
 to do what he himself deems it wrong, or to hear books read
 which he deems it wrong to hear, is the ready way to corrupt
 the moral principle implanted in his mind by nature. While
 therefore the Committee are aware of the necessity of guarding
 against the omission of College duties from mere idleness, under
 the pretence of conscience, they are firmly convinced, that to
  compel any native youth to violate his sense of right and wrong,
 would be to teach him to act against his conscience for the sake
 of advantage ; — and that to deprive him in the least degree of
 the benefits of the institution for refusing      it,
                                                   would be, to turn    a
  desire to act rightly into  a  crime,  and to be  guilty of the most

would have to support him while there, in addition to his donation or sub
scription. This has been since weighed by the Committee for managing         ;
the College; and, on more mature consideration,      appears to them, that

the donation or subscription which entitles any gentleman to send a youth,   t

  this, if it be ever effected, must be attempted by suitable means ;
 flagrant injustice.      In their view, nothing but incorrigible negli
  gence, or immoral conduct, can form a just reason for depriving
 any youth, whatever be his religious prejudices, of the advantages
 of this institution.
     **
        They also feel the propriety of introducing into this College,
 all the science now possessed ly the natives themselves. To an
 institution intended to convey superior information to native youth
 of the highest casts, it is desirable that there be that respectabi
 lity attached in the eyes of the most learned among the natives,
 which shall prevent their undervaluing the instruction conveyed,
 because it is not what they have. All the science they really
 have, ought to be preserved, and not a particle of it lost.      If they
 have carried the study of any branch of knowledge beyond us,
 this circumstance ought to be acknowledged and improved ; if
 they have merely trodden in the same path, a knowledge of the
 science they really have, will enable us to take it up where they
 fail, and carry it to its proper extent ; while the ideas they now
 possess, and the terms in which they express them, will facilitate
 the communication of superior ideas.           This particularly applies
 to grammar, and to astronomy, which latter science, from its
 connexion with their religious festivals, is cultivated by them
 with peculiar eagerness."
     There are thirty-seven       students attached to the College, of
 which nineteen are Christians or of Christian families, — -fourteen
 are Hindoos of cast, and four have neither cast nor religion. Of
 the fourteen Hindoos of cast, eleven are Brahmuns ; nine of
whom are thoroughly acquainted with astronomy and geography,
and who receive for their monthly support three rupees each.
They are now employed in studying the Lilavalee, the first
astronomical work usually taught in India, preparatory to being
 made acquainted with European astronomy.
    Since the institution of the College the Committee have de
cided upon printing
    "   The Four Vedas, the great palladium of Hindooism, around
which Superstition, for obvious purposes, has thrown such a de
gree of veneration, that the soodra who durst only listen to them,
was deemed guilty of a crime to be expiated only by melted
lead being poured into his ears.          These days of darkness how
ever are now evidently passing away: every thing sacred in the
Scriptures has been exposed to public view; and the enlightened
among the Hindoos themselves do not hesitate to acknowledge,
that darkness and concealment can add no real worth to any
work, but rather tend to create suspicion ; that every work must
found its claims to intrinsic worth whollv on its contents ; and
                                     L 12     .                      that

   that these claims can never be substantiated as long as its con
   tents are withheld from public view.— The expense of printing
   this work will undoubtedly be great, as it is voluminous; and
   its completion must necessarily occupy many years: nor do they
   expect that the College will ever be reimbursed for the expense
   of printing it; since, with the exception of learned bodies- in
   Europe and America, who may wish to enrich their libraries with
   a copy of a work so ancient, few purchasers can be expected.
   As copies of the Vedas, however, are already so scarce, and nre
   likely to become far more so, the Committee think it highly pro
   per to take measures to preserve this ancient monument of Hin-
   dooism from complete oblivion."
       The Committee having purchased a spot of ground, on the
   banks of the river, exactly facing the country residence* of the
    Governor-general at Barrackpore, which cost 1 1,500 rupees, have
   determined on erecting the buildings for the College, to consist
   of a centre building which shall include a large hall for public
   examinations and the dispatch of public business, rooms for the
   various classes, suitable rooms for the library and the museum
   and an observatory above ; and of two wings for the accommoda
   tion of the students and professors. The building will contain
   two stories, it being intended to render the rooms on the ground
   floor equally habitable with those above, with the view of com
   bining the strictest ceconomy with the greatest convenience%ttd
   neatness.    On the same principle the erection of a double row
   of rooms has been preferred, a single row involving a certain
   waste of expense, and a triple row being highly inconvenient for'
   those who should occupy the middle rooms.           The central build
   ing will form a front of about a hundred and twenty feet, each
   wing an extension of somewhat more than a hundred and eighty;
   and the whole when completed present a front of nearly five hun
   dred feet. Each of the wings will contain rooms for theaccomm-
   modation of nearly a hundred native Christian students, besides
   rooms for the professors.      The College, when completed, there
   fore, will be capable of containing from a hundred aud sixty to
   two hundred Christian students; and perhaps an equal or greater
   number of other students will preserve their cast inviolate by
   boarding in the town. It is not intended, however, to build
   more than one wing at present; the rest of the buildings can be
    added as the circumstances of the College may render them ne
   cessary. • . ,7         , -               ,                •, i.'f

and to be done efficiently, it should be attempted through the
natives themselves, as Europeans are too far removed from them,
and too little adapted to the climate, to become the immediate
agents to any extent in this important work.           But if it must be
done by native agents, what method more likely to effect        it,  than
that of collecting youths from every tribe and every part of India,
and, restraining them from nothing but idleness and positive
vice, to imbue their minds with the love of study and investiga
tion, lay open to them,          means of an ample library and able
                                    by
teachers, the various stores of learning and science furnished         by
the western as well as the eastern world, and give them leisure
and opportunity to pursue their researches free from interruption
and distracting care, till they ultimately return to their own pro
vinces, fraught with knowledge, and not corrupted         by   unreason
able expectations, to     become        blessing

the end of life    ? But to accomplish this, some spot    is   necessary,
secluded from those allurements to vice which abound in eastern
capitals, together with       library and apparatus, the collection of
                                a
which, with suitable buildings, and the support of able professors,
involves too great an expense to be provided in many different
places at the same time.         Of the suitableness of Seramporc for
this purpose, sufficiently near the capital of India and yet per-            *
fectly retired — -and the fitness to accomplish this object, of the
plan now so fully laid before the public, the Committee leave
the public to judge in them
                        ;            might appear presumption. They
                                         it
merely   add,  that these  ideas  are  the result of many years devoted
to  the  consideration  of  the  state  of India, and the most effectual
means of promoting its best       interests.    To this complete disclo
sure of them, they have therefore nothing to add, but that every
benefaction to the Institution, whether intended as         a    donation
for the general purposes of the Institution, or for the support of
particular native students, — or whether           be in the form of an
                                                   it
 nual contribution for few years, will be received with the warmest
                            a
 gratitude, and applied with the utmost consideration and faith

substance possesses any active virtues.   As Dr. P.'s experiments
are new, we shall insert them at full length —        :

     " A. Ten grains of elaterium, obtained from          respectable
                                                                  a
chemist, and having all the sensible properties which indicated
it to be genuine, were digested for twenty-four hours, with                di
stilled water, at  a temperature far below that of boiling      four  j
grains only were dissolved.
     " B. The solution was intensely bitter, of brownish yellow

                                                 alcohol, although           a
solution of iodine produced     blue colour
                                 a             the solution, there
                                                    ;
fore, contained no gum, and only slight traces of starch.
     " C. The solution, after standing twenty-four hours, yielded
a pellicle of insoluble matter, which, when burnt, appeared to
resemble gluten.
    « D: The six grains which were insoluble in water were
treated, for forty-eight hours, with alcohol, of the specific gravity
.817, at 66° of Fahrenheit     ; green solution was obtained, but
                                   a
by   slow evaporation only half grain of solid green matter was
                                      a
procured. The insoluble residue obstinately adhered to and coated
the filter, like a varnish, and completely defended the mass from
the action of the alcohol  :   itprobable that

     "   E. Ten grains of elaterium, from the   same sample, were
treated with alcohol, of the specific gravity .817, at 66° Fahren
heit, for twenty-four hours    ;upon being filtered, and the resi
duum washed with successive portions of alcohol, the elaterium
was found to have lost only 1.6 of       grain. The high specific
                                              a
gravity of the alcohol in this experiment was important; had                it
been lower, different results would have been produced.
     "F. The alcoholic solution, obtained in the last experiment,
was.  of   most brilliant and beautiful green colour, resembling
            a
that of the oil of cajeput, but brighter   upon slowly evaporating
                                                :

    " G. The solid green matter of the last experiment was treated
with boiling distilled water, when     minute portion was thus dis
                                          a
solved, and a solution of    a most intensely bitter taste, and of          a
brownish yellow colour, resulted.

                                         water, was inflammable,

resin; in very minute quantities it purges.     It appears to be the
element in which all the powers of the elaterium are concen
trated, and which have been denominated elatin.

(Exp. E.) was boiled in double distilled water, when 5.9 grains
were dissolved.                                                *  >

was left afterExperiment I. amounted to 2.5 grains; it burnt
like wood,  and was insoluble in alkalies/'

            SMOKE FROM STEAM-ENGINES                   AND FURNACES.
   On the 2d of May Mr. M. A. Taylor brought forward -a mo
tion in the House of Commons, for      Select Committee to con
                                                 a
sider of the practicability of compelling persons using steam-
engines and furnaces to erect the same in a manner less preju
dicial to the health and comfort of the public. His object, ne
said, was to consider of some means                   by
                                          which the smoke might
be consumed before      issed from the chimneys.
                                 it                From the dis
coveries he had made, and from what he had himself witnessed,
he was sure that the smoke which now issued to the destruction
of all kinds of vegetables, might be removed and prevented.- He
had formerly brought this subject before the House, and a Com
mittee had been granted, the report from which clearly showed
that the plan for consuming smoke was not impracticable.   Since
                                                            then

   392         Smoke from Steam- Engines and Furnaces.
    then he had seen several places where smoke was actually con->
    sumed ; and if the House would take the pains to inquire) they
'
    would find it no difficult matter to put a Stop to those nuisances
    which now made London, Liverpool, Birmingham, and Man
    chester almost uninhabitable.      Gentlemen might think this state
    ment exaggerated — but he meant to say, that literally those
    places were uninhabitable, for many people residing near great
    furnaces were obliged to send their families away from their ha
   bitations to plaees hired for their reception, in order that they
   might be free from those unhealthy nuisances. This was done
   by numbers of people in Manchester.           The plan he should pro
   pose   had been  successfully  carried  into effect at Warwick, in the
   manufactory of a Mr. Barnes ; and he could assert that it had
    been done with scarcely any additional expense, and with one-
   third less consumption of fuel than was now generally used in
   furnaces.     If gentlemen who heard him would take the trouble
    of going to the manufactory of Mr. Barnes, they would find this
   to be the fact; they would scarcely be able to find where the
   furnace was ; and they would perceive no more smoke there than
   in any common chimney. He had himself gone to Warwick, to be
   satisfied of the fact which he now stated ; and as a proof that no
   nuisance existed in the manufactory he spoke of, there was a
   bleaching-ground within ten yards of the furnace; there was also
   a garden, and a conservatory ; and none of these sustained the
   slightest injury or annoyance from smoke. A similar plan had been
   adopted with equal success at a distillery at a little distance beyond
   the Penitentiary on Mill-bank. If gentlemen would go there, they
   would see a Mack intense smoke coming out of one furnace and
   passing into another, where it was entirely consumed before it
   got kito the open air.     In order to be fully satisfied of the effect
   of the opposite and generally prevailing system, they need only
   go over to the other side of the water, where there were several
   furnaces sending forth their masses of smoke every day.              In
   Bridge-street, Blackfriars, there was a furnace which annoyed
   the whole neighbourhood.       He had witnessed ebullitions of smoke
   near St. James's palace ; and those who resided near or fre
   quented Hyder-park must have been frequently annoyed by that
   which issued from the Cannon brewery. -If he should. be able
   to satisfy the House that the nuisance could be abated by the ap
   plication of certain remedies, he hoped he might be permitted,
   to bring in a declaratory law by which such nuisance might be
   abated by 'the verdict, of a jury.    If be succeeded in effecting- an
   object so conducive to the health and comfort of the public, ho
   stuiuld consider himself as having deserved well of his eeuntry.
 . He concluded with moving that a Select Committee be appoint-!
   ed to take the subject into their consideration.        .
                                                                      Mr.

                  ; . i..'  -Steam Navigation.    ,                  393
     Mr. Denman seconded the motion.         Hehad himself witnessed
all the inconveniences ahd nuisances stated by his honourable
friend, and he was: sore they could be removed.              ,        .     ¦
     Sir Charles Mordaunt spoke to the same effect ; and expressed
his conviction that the proposed law would be beneficial to the
nation at large.                    .   .      !    .•*«¦,-,,. •> ¦ . ,

and is fitted up with high and airy state rooms, thoroughly ven
tilated by means of sky lights the whole length of the cabin,
which is very extensive.        Her after cabin is neatly arranged for
the accommodation of ladies, and separated by means of folding
doors, in the modern, style.       She has also a range of births fore
and aft, together with a commodious fore cabin.. And, what
adds to the greatest comfort and security of all, her engine and
other machinery are completely insulated, and unconnected as it
were with the other part of the ship. In the centre, lengthwise,
is a kind of well-hole or square trunk, made both fire and water
proof ; no possible accident, therefore, by the bursting of the
boiler, can reach either. of the cabins.      This trunk or well-hole
being inclosed by very thick plank, caulked and leaded, may be
inundated with water at pleasure, without any-inconvenience to
the passengers. .                .          .
     The furnace is also completely surrounded by the continuation
of the boiler, so that no part of the fire can ever come in contact
with the wood. There is a space of about nine or ten inches
filled in with materials, nonconductors of beat, which answer
 the double purpose of excluding the heat from the cabin, and at
 the same time deadening the disagreeable noise of the engine.
 She is also provided with a leather hose, similar to those; used by
 our fire-engine companies in this city, which will enable the hot
 or cold water to be conveyed to any part of the ship, and fur
 nishing at the same time the great conveniency to the passengers
 of a warm or cold bath at pleasure! Her engine was constructed

             VARIATION OF THE MAGNETIC NEEDLE.                .   .
   In our 53d Volume, p. 387, we mentioned that the excellent
 and unremitting observations of Colonel Mark Beaufoy, made at
Bushey-Heath, near Stanmore, in Middlesex, had shown that the
magnetic variation to the westward of the true north had uni
formly increased, on taking the means monthly, until the begin
ning of the last year, after which it had fluctuated, but giving a
mean variation of 24° 37' 0" in the first three months of 1819.
The observations since published by the Colonel in a contempo
rary Journal, seem to show that this was the maximum varia
tion, occurring in February or March 1819; because he finds
the monthly means, since the beginning of April of that year,
to have uniformly decreased.     It further appears from the Co
lonel's statements, that the    western variation had been on the
increase through 162 years,     or since 1657 : it was only 77 years
before this period that the     first authentic observations on the
variation can be found, or in    1580, when the needle at London
varied to the east 11° 15'.
                    MARINE THERMOMETER.
   From many experiments made of late years by scientific per
sons, there seems every reason to believe that the thermometer
is an instrument of far greater importance to navigators than it
has been generally supposed.
   The late celebrated Dr. Franklin   was the first person who    na-
ticed the great difference between the temperature of the water
on the North American coast, on and off soundings, and sug
gested the use of a thermometer as an indicator of an approach
to that dangerous shore, as it had been uniformly found that
the nearer any vessel approximated the shore, the colder the tem
perature of the water became.
   Afterwards Col. Jonathan Williams, of Philadelphia, endea
voured with some success to call the attention of seafaring men
to the importance of the thermometer as a nautical instrument;
and satisfactorily succeeded in showing that no vessel on board
of which a thermometer  is,can possibly be cast away on the coasts
                                                                   of

of  the United States, without at least a sufficient warning of the
approach to danger, to allow of its being avoided, unless the ship
should be so entirely disabled as to be totally unmanageable.
    The statements of Dr. Franklin and Colonel Williams applied
only: to the coasts of North America ; and hence it came to be
generally supposed that the increased heat of the sea,- when out
of soundings, was caused by the Gulf stream-current, which issu
ing from the Gulf of Mexico, sweeps to the northward along the
coasts of the United States: it has of late however been esta
blished that the decreasing temperature of the water, as any ves
sel approaches the coasts of Spain, Portugal, and Barbary, is suf
ficient to give warning to any attentive navigator of his approach
to these coasts ; and it seems probable, from the experiments of
Mr. Davy, (brother to the celebrated Sir Humphry,) that the
thermometer will be found to point out, not only the proximity
of land, but also that of extensive banks, &c. in all places.
    A person whose experience had shown him that in quitting
the American coasts, there was an increase of 12 deg. of Fahren
heit's scale in the temperature of the sea in a few hours run from
the mouth of the Delaware, found also on approaching the coast
of Portugal, that the. mercury in the tube of the thermometer,
sunk from 69 degrees, at which it stood in the open sea, to 6Gi
degrees, when his ship was about three or four miles from Cape-
St. Vincent; and subsequently, that in beating through the
                                                                     "
Straits of Gibraltar with a contrary wind, the mercury in the
thermometer rose and fell in proportion to the distance he
was from the Spanish or African shores, ranging from 68 de
grees, at which it stood in the middle of the Strait, to 61 degrees,
which was the lowest to which it sunk on the African side ; and on
the Spanish shore it never fell lower than 64 degrees ; which is
easily accounted for, as the ship was never so near that shore, it
being considered adviseable to keep at a distance from the shoals,
&c. near Tariffa.
    The person already mentioned having discovered many objec
tions to the mode of using the thermometer, recommended by
Colonel Williams, and having had several thermometers broken,
applied to different mechanics in various places to construct a
marine thermometer case for him, which would protect the in
strument and facilitate its use ; but unsuccessfully until he some
time since applied to Messrs. Gardner and Jamieson, mathema
tical instrument makers in Glasgow. Mr. Jamieson, of that firm,
invented and made a case, which not only prevents the thermo
meter inclosed in it from being injured, but admits and retains
water from any depth which may be desired ; so that the results
obtained by the experiments made with it are exempted from
any chance of being influenced by the solar rays in summer

cold climates, as by an ingenious contrivance the bulb of the
thermometer is kept immersed in a column of water admitted
and retained by the case, from the greatest depth to which it
has been sunk.
    Mr. Purdy, the hydrographer of London, has expressed his
opinion of Mr. Jamieson's invention in very flattering terms, as
have also many highly respectable scientific and nautical men.

                              To Mr. Tilloch.
    Sir,- — From an expression in Mr. Meikle's note, printed in
your last Number, I feel it my duty to request that those who
think proper may examine for themselves, whether, in the quo
tations which I gave from his letter, I have in any respect dis
torted the meaning of the words which he actually used.
    After what I have said in my former letters on the question in
discussion, it is unnecessary to make any observations on the
 other parts of his note.

 the command of Major Gray, on whom the direction devolved
 after the death of Major Peddie, has returned to Galam, on the

 the Foplado.        Mr. Docherd, the surgeon attached to the expe

LXVIII.        On the apparent Place  of the Pole-Start   By Francis
                               Bajly, Esq.
The         following tables, showing the apparent place of the pole-
star for every day of the years 1820, 1821, and 1822, were lately
published at Dorpat in Livonia, by Dr. Struve, the director of the
observatory at that place.         They are computed from the for
mulae and tables given by M. Bessel in various periodical works,
which are not generally known or read in this country: and
therefore the following account of them may perhaps be accept
able to the public.
    . It is well known   to the practical astronomer that the pole-
star, on account of its magnitude, and proximity to the pole, can
be seen (with telescopes of no very considerable power) at all
times of the year, by day as well as by night : so that, when the
weather is favourable, it may be observed on the meridian twice
within every twenty-four hours. On account of the extensive use
to which such observations may be applied, it has become de
sirable that the apparent position of this star in right ascension
and declination should be accurately determined for that precise
moment in every day in the year, when it passes the meridian.
   i The tables, which follow,     have therefore been calculated, for
that purpose, by Dr. Struve abovementioned, and Dr. Walbeck
the director of the observatory at Abo in Finland.           The places
of the star were calculated by each of them separately for every
fifth day; and the values for the intermediate days were inter
polated, after applying for each separate day the correction de
pending on the . moon's longitude.            The method of deducing
these values, I shall now proceed to explain.
      The mean place of the pole-star for the 1st day of January in
any given year (denoted by 1815 +f, where / denotes the num
ber of years from 1815) is first deduced from the formulae given
by M. Bessel, in his Fundamenta. Astronomies ; page 306 : one
of which formulae serves to determine the right ascension of the
 star, and the other its declination.       They are as follow :

whence, the mean places, for the 1st of January in the years
1820, 1821, and 1822, will be as under: viz.
                  A\.  in time.                     D.

        1822=       57. 29,909                    21. 33 ,495
    Next come the corrections on account of* precession, aberra
tion, nutation &c: and it is here that M. Bessel has shown that
peculiar talent for analysis, for which he is so justly celebrated.
The formulae for these corrections are thrown into a synoptical
table, in page 404, for the sake of a more convenient reference;
 and are taken from the fourth part of the Astronomical observa
 tions made by M. Bessel at the Royal Observatory in Konigs-
berg; a work which contains a fund of useful and interesting in
 formation,   and is by far the best specimen of an active observa
tory, of any extant.      The quantities, expressed by A\, D, ai, ©,
  D , Q , denote respectively the right ascension and declination
 of the star, the obliquity of the ecliptic, the true longitude of the
 sun, the true longitude of the moon, and the place of the moon's
nodes.
     In the formulae No. 2 and 5, the reader will readily recognise
 the common formulae for aberration and nutation: the co-efficients
 for the nutation are those given by M. Lindenau ; and for the
 aberration, that adopted by M.Delambre. The other quantities
 are here for the first time deduced by M. Bessel, for the purpose
 of determining the apparent place of the star to the greatest ex
 actness.    By the help of a few subsidiary tables he has rendered
 the use of these formulae very simple and easy.          The formulae
  1. 2. 3. 4 he has thrown together into one table, showing their
 values for every fifth day of the year: 5. 6. 7, together with the
 mean place of the star, he has thrown together into another table,
 showing their values for every hundredth day, for the years 1S05
 to 1820:. No. 8. 10 are, in separate tables: and 9 is altogether
 omitted, as its maximum never exceeds 0",01. These subsidiary
 tables are calculated for the meridian of Paris, and corrections are
 given for applying them to the meridians of other observatories :
 the correction for Greenwich is insensible.
    From these subsidiary tables, the following tables have heen cal-'
 culated : .and it should be particularly observed that they show the
 apparent place of the pole-star at the time of its upper culmi
 nation; and not its place at noon, from which it will frequently
 very sensibly differ.       M. Bessel has explained the method,
 whereby he deduces the apparent place of a star at the time of
 its culmination, in Bode's Aslronomisches. Jahrhtch for 1817,
 page 197 j as well as in his Fundamenta Astronomies, page 67,
                                                                where

                      On the apparent Place    of the Pole- Star.          403
      where he has moreover given tables and rules for determining
      the apparent places of 14 of the principal stars observed by Brad
     ley, at the time they passed the meridian of Greenwich, for the
      years 1750 to" 1762.      And in the first part of his Astronomical
     observations above mentioned, he has given tables and rules for
     determining the apparent places of JDr. Maskelyne's 36 principal
     stars at the time of their culmination, for every tenth day of the
     year.    As these stars are generally observed when on, or near,
     the meridian, it certainly would be desirable that their apparent
     places should be given for tbe time of their culmination, and not
     for noon, as is usually practised.
         I have thought it the more necessary to make these observa
     tions, in order to olTviate any false impression which may arise
     from comparing the values given in this table, with those which
     are now given for the first time in the Nautical Almanac for 1822.
     For instance, the apparent place of the pole-star on June 29, 1822
    is stated in the Nautical Almanac to be iR=0h. 57'. 19",6,
     D = 88". 21'. 29",6 ; whereas, in the following tables, it is stated
     to be   M   = 0*. 57'. 20",8, D = 88°. 21'. 29',0.        Now various
    reasons may be assigned for this, and other differences : in the
    first place, the computations are not made for the same moment
    of time ; secondly, the mean place, at the beginning of the year,
    is not the same in each ; and thirdly, the corrections are more
    numerous in the latter than in the former.          Still however this
    will not account for the whole of the differences observable in
     the two tables.
        As the pole-star is sometimes obscured, when other principal
    stars in its neighbourhood, such as 8,              Ursce minoris and
                                                       /3,   y
        Cepliei, are visible, the observations of which might be made
'
y
    available to many useful purposes, would          not be desirable to
                                                        it
    attempt the correction of the places of those stars in           similar
                                                                      a
    manner       ?Some of the stars, also, situated still further from the
    pole, and immediately in the zenith, such as             Draconis and
                                                                  y
    others, of which considerable use     ismade in practical astronomy,
    may likewise be subject to variations not hitherto understood           ;
    tut which may hereafter yield to the investigations of the analyst.
    In short,    is   too much to presume that what
                      it                                  called the proper

     motion of      star may at some future time be resolvable into ge

                          ;
     way as that of aberration and nutation?        These subjects, how
     ever,
         I    shall leave at present for the consideration of those who
     have leisure and disposition for the investigation     contenting my
                                                                 :

LXIX. An            Essay on the Reflection, Refraction, and Inflection
    of Light ; on the Colours of thin transparent Plates, and a
    new Theory of Vision.    By Captain Forman, R.N.
Truth       is the only legitimate object of philosophical research ;
and whoever believes his own opinions, to be true, and fancies
that he can add to the general stock of knowledge by imparting
some new discovery, has not only the right, but is bound in duty,
to make his opinions known.           amongIf,   number of erroneous-
                                                              a
opinions, he has afforded but one hint which in the hands jof                     H
wiser man may lead to important results, he lias conferred          real    a'
benefit on society; whilst his errors, though they may outlive his.
own time, will finally be dispelled              by
                                        the light of true philosophy,
to which his own hint has so materially contributed.
    My design in writing this essay        to show the true cause of.
                                                   is
the reflection and refraction of light; and as Sir Isaac Newton
lias already accounted for these phenomena           his hypothesis of
                                                                  by
alternate fits of easy refraction and reflection in the medium,                  it
follows of course that intend to oppose his opinion; for,
                           f                                       both     if
our opinions coincided, there could be no motive for my writing
concerning the cause of these phenomena, and this essay, in that
case, would be wholly unnecessary. For this opposition however
I  shall offer no apology, because      am only exercising         right    a
which he exercised before me and      ;  all menif Iall ages had been
                                                                  in
bound to withhold their opinions whenever they happened to
differ from those of great men who had preceded them, we"
should    ina  great measure have lost the benefit of Sir Isaac New
ton's own discoveries, philosophy would still be       its infancy, and
                                                                   in
there could be no hope that the mists of ignorance would ever
be dispersed.
    For agreat many ages the history of natural philosophy, was
little more than a record of errors, every one vieing with ant
other in*kbsurditv and extravagance.       Here and there we meet
with  a transient gleam of true philosophy, like the sun shooting
forth his beams through the gloom of winter's fog, which just
                                                          a
served to guide the traveller     few steps further on his way, and
                                      a
then left him to grope in the dark, perhaps for another genera
tion, before any further advance was made in the progress of
science.       Itchiefly to Lord Bacon that we are indebted for the

principle of making experiment the basis of philosophy; and all
that he wrote besides, excellent as all his writings ate, willjbeaf
po comparison to the obligation he has conferred upon scienae,
 by the establishment of this law. Before his time, the ipse dixit
of an acknowledged philosopher was sufficient to establish an
opinion however absurd but with this test, like another Hercules,

         a
remarkable ways those rays that pass through are refracted, or

                                   power that we call refraction, while

power which       iscalled reflection.

plternate refraction and reflection           not borne out
                                                          is       analogy,          by

concerning the cause of these phenomena.
    As these two phaenomena of reflection and refraction are ton
tally dissimilar,      appears to me to be highly probable that they
                       it
are produced       bytwo distinct causes      that                    is,
                                                      that there are two

distinct substances in the medium, one of which possesses in its
                            I of
                           reflecting light, and the other that of re
nature the power
fracting it. When speak of               medium however as possessing
                                                a
tjiese properties,      Iam to be understood with some limitation.
1   believe glass, water, and every thing else that          called     me      is        a
dium, to be perfectly neutral in these respects, and that the
power of reflecting and refracting light resides in           fluid" or ga^i    a
composed of two distinct substances, that adheres to the surface
of these bodies. This shall prove, first,
                                   I                                 by

is a sWbstance   adhering to water and          glass — and, by analogy, tir
 every other medium possessing these properties— that does reflect
light, because.it may be removed ; and when it isrthe surfaces of
these bodies no longer do reflect any fight ; and lastly, by that
part of the atmosphere of Saturn which reflects the light, usually
denominated his ring ; for it is evidently not his atmosphere that
reflects this light, or the whole of it would be equally illumi
nated; and as it wi contrary to all analogy to suppose that any
thing could reside on the surface of air but what is lighter' than
air, the substance that reflects this light can be no other than
some such a delicate fluid as I have supposed reflects the light
from the surfaces of glass and water, and if it is true in one in
stance it may be in another.
    1. The cause of the reflection of light* must be attributed
cither to the resistance of a substance that opposes its admission,
pr to the dislike of the rays to enter a medium where that sub
stance resides.    Now if this objectionable substance made a part
of the glass, it is evident that the same substance would be found'
in equal proportions aH through, and the rays would be reflected'
from the interior as well as from the surfaces, which is contrary
to fact ; but very few would, in that case, be able to get through
Jo the other side, and glass in consequence would reflect a mass
of light, as it does now when pounded into dust, but no distinct
image of any object, and could be only a semi-transparent body,
instead of a clear pellucid substance as it now is.
   If it be said that glass, in consequence of some sort of chemi
cal process, by the contact of the air might possess this property
only on its surface, I answer, that this is not sufficient to account
for the phenomenon, because, as glass reflects light inwardty
From its further surfac e, that part of the surface that did so would
be inside, and could not be in contact with the air ; and there
fore, if it were the particles of glass that reflected the rays back
again, all the particles throughout        would also reflect light,
For they all have the same nature ; and consequently we can only
get rid oF the difficulty by supposing that it is nor,N the glass,
but a fluid that adheres to       that has the property oF reflecting
                                     it,
light.
   2.I  am now to show that there        substance adhering to
                                               is   a
the surfaces of water and glass which may be removed, and that
no light  isreflected From those parts of the surfaces of these
bodies from whence     it removed.

  independent of both.
       There is evidently then a fluid adhering to the surface of glass—
  and by analogy we may suppose to every other medium producing1
  the same effect — that, twhatever connexion it might originally
  have had with the air, is so far independent of air that it remains
  attached to the surface of glass in a receiver where the air is ex
  hausted, and it possesses the property of reflecting light, which,
  does not belong to the air in general.
    . That it is this fluid that reflects light inwardly from the further
  surface of the medium, is a position that cannot, after these proofs^'
  be disputed with any show of reason ; and although we can get'
  at no positive proof of the fact, there is every presumption that
  it is this fluid also, and not the glass, that reflects light outwardly*
  from the first surface ; because, as I before observed, all the par-
, tides of glass possess the same nature ; and if the particles on the
  surface of glass reflected the rays of light, those rays that pass
  through would be reflected by the particles in every succeeding"
  stratum ; which is evidently contrary to fact : for it is only by.'
  supposing that the reflection of light is confined to the surface of ,
  glass that We can account for the image being so distinct. All
  this difficulty is removed by supposing that it is the substance
  adhering to glass that produces this effect ; and surely no fair
  reason can be 'assigned why it should not reflect light one way,'
  when it can be proved by positive fact that it does the other
  way J and that it does do so, is confirmed by the third class of
  argument I was to adduce in the phaenomenon of Saturn's ring.
                                                                               *
     ¦3. This luminous
                            ring has excited the attention of the philo-
  sopher ever since it was first discovered, and various hypotheses
  have been formed in order to account for its appearance.                For
  tunately for my principle, it at once serves to explain and is con
  firmed by the phenomenon.            The only philosophical way to ac
  count for phasnomena which are out of our reach, is to prove by
  analogy that such phaenomena may be produced by the cause we'
  ha.vp assigned; that is, that the same causes do actually produce
  similar effects in instances that are within the reach of our'ex-
  periments.       Now I have already proved that there is a fluid ad-
      * The air cannot be entirely exhausted in a receiver, but it may be made
  tefi thousand times rarer than it was before ; and consequently the power
  of reflecting light, if it belonged to the air, should be ten thousand times
  leas than it was before, and the image reflected by it ten thousand times
  fainter.                                                            .

  ring, is produced by       a similar fluid .resting on his atmosphere :
  and, this opinion is the. more probable, because it coincides in
  every respeet with the known laws of nature ; for we observe in
  our own atmosphere that heavy bodies sink downwards towards
  the earth, .while light ones are lifted up by it; and therefore to
  suppose that this ring is produced by the reflection of any solid
  body in that situation, and not by such a light substance as I have
  imagined, is to suppose what is contrary to all analogy, and what
  moreover is wholly unnecessary, as it can be proved that a flui4
  is capable of producing the effect, while no such proof can be
  adduced in favour of glass or crystal.                          v -i l% im'

       If this hypothesis of     the  cause of the phenomenon of Saturn's
   ring be admitted — and it is the only one analogy will warrant-—
   the phenomenon confirms all I wish to establish concerning my
   principle of reflection. Whatever may be the substance that reflects
  this light, it proves that atmospheric air does ,not reflect light, be
   cause in that case the whole of Saturn's atmosphere would re
   flect light as well as this substance that reflects his ring ; and as
   the light of the ring is reflected both ways, outwardly as well as
   inwardly, if this substance be such a fluid as            I have supposed,
   the fluid adhering to the surface of glass may do so also ; and
   then there can be no necessity for the agency of glass or water in
   the reflection of light, any further than as these bodies attach to
" themselves the fluid that does reflect light,, and all the inconve^
   niences attending that opinion are consequently avoided *, „..-, . .
        Having now fully proved that there is a fluid adhering to glass
   and other mediums that has the property of reflecting light, it
   may be worth while, before I commence my inquiries concerning
    the refraction of light, to endeavour to ascertain the cause of its
    existence.       The reader will however understand that what I have
   to propose is merely conjectural; and if I should be. mistaken in
    my opinion concerning the cause of the existence of this fluid,
    my mistake cannot in any wise invalidate the principle that such
   a fluid does exist, because the existence of it has been proved,
   not upoq the mere plea, of a probable supposition, but by the
       f If the ring of Saturn should hs as I have supposed a fluid, and not a
    fixtme, we are provided by it with a means of ascertaining- the depth of
    his atrnosphere ; for as all bodies with which we are acquainted are subject
    to the laws of gravity, this fluid could not remain where it is, unless there
    was some substance immediately below it that prevented its descent, and
    thai"s4ibitanc'e  can be no other than the atmosphere of Saturn.   So that by

    Light is reflected from the further surface of glass, a* well
when the rays strike perpendicularly upon it as when "hej"*rteJ
oblique: but this extraordinary reflection, as it is called, and
which by the way is only observable in a prism, is never visible
except when the rays are passing out so obliquely that they would
be brought in again by the common law of refraction if there'
was no reflection at all.         It is impossible that the same cause
can produce different effects ; and it is therefore contrary to every
principle of sound philosophy to ascribe this phenomenon to the
power of reflection, which involves so many difficulties, when it
may be produced by refraction without supposing any difficulty
whatever.
     It is evident that the same cause must produce the same effect
 when all the circumstances are similar; and no reason can be
 assigned why the first surface of glass should not give out as
 much light as the other, except by supposing a different cause,
 and (hat cause can only be refraction. I take it for granted, then,
 that no one after this will attribute this extraordinary light on
 the further surface of the prism to any other cause than that of
 refraction ; and admitting this, it is easy to prove that the power
 of refracting light is in a fluid that adheres to glass, and not n>*
 the glass itself, because this fluid may be removed by pressure}
 and the light, in that case, never makes its appearance.                    Upon
 pressing my finger     hard   upon   that   part  of the   surface   of the prism

  duced in proof of the existence of anything, by analogy, neces
 sity, and matter of fact ; it accounts for all the phenomena of
  light passing through a medium, without involving any difficulty,
  which cannot be said of any other system ; and if further proof
  should still be required, it is to be found in the Utter incapacity
 of the old hypothesis to produce the phenomena it is intended
    "

           What kind of action or disposition this is," says Sir Isaac
  Newton in speaking of his hypothesis of alternate reflection and
 refraction, " whether it consists of a circulating or a vibrating
 motion of the ray, or of the medium, or something else, I do
 uot here inquire*.         Those who are averse from assenting to any
 new discoveries but such as they can explain by an hypothesis,
 may for the present suppose, that as stones by falling upon water
 put the water into an undulating motion, and all bodies by per
 cussion excite vibrations in the air, so the rays of light by im
 pinging on any refracting or reflecting surface excite vibrations
 in the refracting or reflecting medium or substance, and by ex
 citing them agitate the solid parts of the refracting or reflecting
 body, and by agitating them cause the body to grow warm or
 hot    f  ; that the vibrations thus excited are propagated in the re
 fracting or reflecting medium or substance, much after the man
 ner that vibrations are propagated in the air for causing sound,
 and move faster than the rays, so as to overtake them ; and that
 when any ray is in that part of the vibration which conspires
 with its motion, it easily breaks through a refracting surface, but
 wheti it is in the contrary part of the vibration which impedes
 its motion, it is easily reflected ; and, by consequence, that every
 ra$r. is successively disposed
                                      to be easily reflected, or easily trans
 mitted, by every vibration         which  overtakes it.      But whether this
 hypothesis be true or false, I do not here consider.                 I content
 nwself with the bare discovery that the rays of light are by some
 cruise or other alternately disposed to be reflected or refracted for
 many vicissitudes."                                        •
     'Now it must be evident to every oue who reads this paragraph
 with attention, that no part of the argument it contains is
   ¦y tf*     ¦ '
    f   This reasoning, to say the least of it, is vague and unsatisfactory, and
 ean. hardly be said to account for the phenomena, when it is uncertain what
-the action is, whether it be a circulating or a vibrating motion, and whether
 this motion be in the ray, the medium, or any thing else.
    <T It the solid par s of a glass lens grew hot in consequence  of light pass-
 iig through, would it not be perceptible to the touch ? and after all, what
 efftct can the heated parts of a medium have upon the sun's rays, which are
 infinitely hotter than they can possibly bei Even if they have any effect,
 they must alternately grow hot and cold as many times in a moment of time
 as there are rays of light reflected and refracted in the medium in that time ;
 which is absolutely impossible.

 under these circumstances, a double refracting' substance ought
 not to exhibit two images any more than a single refracting sub
 stance; because, if the rays falling but a little oblique upon the
 surface could be made visible to the eye in one instance, it must
 in the other, for the law is precisely the same in both cases ; and
 eveo if it were so, it would not produce a double image,but the
 one image would be extended over the whole of the retina*, so
 that the object would not be doubled but only magnified. •/

                        peculiarity of Iceland crystal* its double image,
 after what I have just said, will be easily explained by a re
ference, to the plate.          Let K-LMN (Plate V.) represent a
 piece of -common glass, and a ray from the object A striking
 upon thesfirst surface, and passing on through P by the ordinary
 reflection into the eye at E.         The image of the object then w.ill
 appear at P ; but there will be only one image, because all the
 other rays from this object will be refracted outside of the eye,
 and consequently cannot be visible.             Now if instead of glass the
 tafGS'bfwe   to  pass through      a  double    refracting substance, while
 tb^jav li enters the eye from P by the ordinary refraction, the
 substance possessing the greatest power of refraction will refract
 the ,r*y r down to Q in a greater angle, and from thence into
 the tye, so that two images of one object must always appear
 whenever the substance possesses a double refracting power, and
 the rays from it are oblique and not perpendicular.                         .;
     The reader will understand that I am not here showing the
 power of refraction that each substance possesses, but am merely
 explaining the case.                                             n .,!«•¦ 1
     The reader will understand that I do not pretend, in either of
.these figures, to give the exact quantum of the power of refrac
 tion that each substance possesses ; my object is merely to show
 the principle of double refraction ; and as long as there are two
 refracting substances in the same medium possessing different
 degrees of power, there must always be two images let the dif
 ference of power be what it will.                         V»J.vr» bit»:!»l

 434          An Essay on the Reflection, Refraction, and Inflection
 If   the thickness of the plate be extended to GH, these rays will
   have separated very considerably by the time they arrive at P
   and Q ; and supposing the eye to be at E, the ray QQ will not
   enter it at all, but the rays will be refracted into it from T, and
   the two images will in consequence appear at P and T.                Now,
   whether we consider the difference in the angles                 PET  and
  peg, or the quantity of space between the images on the two
   surfaces, it is evident from this, that the distance between the
   images must always increase in proportion as the thickness of
   the plate increases.
       4. In order to account for there being six images, it is only
  necessary to observe, that in this case there are three different
  surfaces for the rays to pass through ; that        is,some of them pass
   through the two parallel surfaces KM and LN (fig. 3.) others
  through KM and MN, and others again through                      KL
                                                                   and LNj
   and as there are two images for each surface,           follows of course
                                                          it
  that there must be six images altogether. Every one knows that
  the number of images in       amultiplying glass        always in propor
                                                          is
  tion to the number of its surfaces and;
                                                if
                                                I      can make       appear
                                                                         it
  that in common glass of this figure and in the same situation
  we should see three images, there can be no difficulty in under
  standing why there should be six images in Iceland crystal or
  any other double refracting substance of the same figure.
       For the convenience of measurement,      I    have made the angles
  of refraction in this figure to be half the angle of incidence, which
     believe   rather more than the ordinary refraction
                is                                                 in

                                                                              ;
      the angles had been less, the images would have been shown
 just as well, — with only this difference, that the eye must have
  been removed further from the plate. Let      K    L M then represent
                                                               N
 a   plate of common    glass, and  rays of light   from  A, striking upon
 O
 P       and Q, refracted into the eye at       E    bythe common law of
  refraction, and three images of the same object will appear at
R    S  and T.     Now   ifthere was some other substance           in
                                                                   the plate
  that refracted the rays in    a greater or less degree, every one of
 these images would of course be doubled, as                Ihave shown in
  fig.   1,and the  phasnomenon consequently         isexplained.
      5. From not considering that the multiplication of the images
 in Iceland crystal, as in glass, depends upon the number of sur
 faces the rays have to pass through, and not from any new modi
 fication either in the crystal or the rays,          it  has surprised at
 least the early writers on optics not      a little, that the two images
 of any object, viewed through Iceland crystal, should not be
 doubled when these rays have to pass through                second crystal
                                                               a
 before they enter the eye and ;    I  believe  it  has never yet been sa
 tisfactorily explained, why sometimes there should be four images
 exhibited       by
                 the two crystals and at others only two.                     "It   is
                                                                   wonderful,"

             of Light ;   and a new Theory        of Fision.                435
wonderful," says Huygens, (see the Edinburgh Philosophical
Journal for January) " why the rays C E and D G, incident from
the air upon the lower crystal, should not divide themselves like
the first ray A B." In another place he calls it a wonderful phe
nomenon; and he accounts for there being sometimes only two
and at other times four images, by supposing that the waves of
light
       " have acquired a certain form or arrangement, in virtue
of which, by meeting the texture of the second crystal in on*
position, they are capable of moving the two different matters
which serve for the two kinds of refraction ; while, by meeting
the second crystal in another position, they have not the power
of moving any of these matters. But in what manner," he says,
" this happens, I have not been able to form any satisfactory con
jecture."
   Now this wonderful phenomenon         is explained in a moment by
considering   that the  crystals are  placed in such a position, with
respect  to  each  other,  that  in  one   instance, the rays passing
through two different surfaces in the lower crystal enter the eye,
and consequently exhibit four images, while in another position,
the only rays that can enter the eye are those that pass through
 the two parallel surfaces, and then only two images can be visi
ble.   Suppose two plates of glass to be placed, as I have repre
sented them in fig. 4, and rays of light from A to be striking
upon the first plate in every direction.         Now by the common
law of refraction*, the ray a would enter the eye at E; but be
and d, and all other rays from rhat object would be refracted
away from the eye in different angles, and could not possibly en
ter it while it remained in that position ; so that while the plates
are placed in that position,     with respect to each other, and the
objects, only one image can enter the eye; and all the difference
between Iceland crystal and glass       is,
                                          that the images are doubled.
If  the plates however, with respect to the object and the eye,
should be placed as   I  have represented them        in
                                                      fig.     5,
                                                             the ray a,
from A, will enter the lower plate at one surface, and the ray                b
at another; and then two images will be visible at            asE, have I
represented them; and when the crystals possess              double re
                                                                a
fracting power,     bythe same rule there will be four,              •
   6. The sixth peculiarity of Iceland crystal, that sometimes one
image appears to move, and sometimes the other, when the cry
stal is moving on its axis, may be explained        in
                                                    this way    Which
                                                                    :

 of refraction to be half the angle of incidence the effect, however, except
                                              :

be stationary ; while the other must change its place on the1 re
tina, and of course will appear to be in motion.              By the same
rule the moon, in stormy weather, very frequently appears to be
in motion ; whereas, if we fix our eyes steadfastly upon                  it,
                                                                     we per
ceive at once that the moon          stationary,

that are in motion.       Whenever we are moving, objects           that  are
motionless change their position with respect to one another                              ;
and whichever of two objects we look directly at, will appear to
keep its position, and the other to be in motion; and upon the
same principle we maf account for this phenomenon.

                                 glass     this
                                           is     Whenever an object
                                                     :                                   is
viewed through      a plate of plain glass, there are very near as many
 rays from that object enter the eye, as there are when the glass
is  out of the way but in all double refracting substances, half
                         :
the rays that would enter the eye under any other circumstances,
 are bent out       bythe extraordinary refraction, the rays that do
enter the eye are so much the thinner, and the light in conse
quence     isproportionally fainter.
     Itaffords very strong grounds for the presumption that an                           hy

Newton accounted for the phenomenon of double refraction                                  by
supposing an original difference in the rays of light                *, means by
of which " some rays are constantly refracted after the usual man
ner, and others constantly after the unusual manner."              But the          if
phenomenon of double refraction depended solely upon this dif
ference of properties in the rays, the phenomenon would be exhi
bited in glass as well as in Iceland crystal, and in neither of thera

with any . regularity, because it must depend upon the mere acci
dent of the rays coming down with one or the other side foremost.
The phenomenon could not be constant in Iceland crystal, and
never in glass, if the cause did not in great measure reside in
the crystal ; and then there can be no necessity to suppose any
such difference in the properties of light; for, if we admit that
there is one substance in Iceland crystal that has the power of
turning the rays round, and another that has not (and we can
only account for the phenomenon upon his principle by supposing
this), there can be no difficulty in supposing that there are two
distinct substances in the crystal possessing a greater and less
power of refraction ; and as the rays strike upon one or other of
these substances, they are more or less refracted.
    Huygens accounted for this phenomenon in a very different
way : Light, according to him, instead of being an effluvium of
particles propagated in straight lines from a luminous body, and
proceeding in all directions, consists in undulations of an ethereal
medium.      " He supposes the ordinary refraction to be produced
by spherical undulations, propagated through the crystal, while
the extraordinary refraction arises from spheroidal undulations*."
 Here I must confess that I have never read any of the arguments
by which this theory of undulations is supported ; and therefore
 I do not pretend to controvert them : but as I cannot form in
my mind any idea by which it can account for the phaenomena
of light, at least, without the violation of some of the known laws
of nature, I shall propose certain objections to        which,     the it,                   if

light consists in undulations of an ethereal medium*,         it may
be said, perhaps, that Huygens made use of these terms in con
descension to the want of capacity in ordinary readers, who
would not nave understood him had he explained himself in any
other way: but a philosophy which can be comprehended only
by a few, is rather metaphysical than solid; it can answer no ge
neral purpose of usefulness, and, in all probability, is not founded
upon any solid principles.
   By supposing light to consist of separate particles, it is easy
to conceive how they may cross each other, as they are conti
nually doing ; but there is no analogy in nature to support the
opinion that undulations of a fluid can cross each other without
one or the other, or both, being thrown into confusion.      If we
throw two stones into water at a little distance from each other,
two circles of undulations are produced, proceeding from two
centres; but the moment they meet they are broken and thrown
into confusion, and the undulations only proceed where there is
Ho interruption.
    If it is difficult to conceive how it is possible for undulations
to cross each other without being broken, it is also equally
 difficult to conceive how these undulations can pass through a
 medium without being separated into particles, and then the hy
pothesis is destroyed : a stone thrown into water easily passes
through, because the particles of water give way to the greater
force of gravity by which it is impelled ; and a particle of light
may do the same: but it is impossible tor a fluid to pass through
 another, without one or the other being broken and dispersed;
 and the water evidently is not, or we should see it in commotion.
 If we hold a tumbler upside down and immerse it in water, we see
 that the air still remains at the bottom of       it,
                                                     and cannot escape
 through the water And
                     :         is  not, then, too much to suppose that
                                    it
 any other fluid can pass through, without either being thrown
 into confusion or separated into particles'?
 I     can readily conceive that particles of light and colour, en
tering the eye in different directions, may impinge on the retina
distinct figures and colours, and that the mind may distinguish
 these figures and colours       the sense of seeing, as

                                To   Mr. Tilloch.
SfR,    In  my Remarks on the Ancient Eclipses, page 348 of your
Magazine, I have suggested the idea of the whole ecliptic pheno
mena being comprehended in the space of 912 solar years, and
have produced some convincing examples that the hypothesis is
not improbable : these examples are submitted with deference to           .
such of your readers as are practitioners in these calculations,
and who are disposed to listen to useful discussion.
   In the next place I propose to show, that not only the samp
eclipses return at the expiration of one or more complete periods,
but also the same set ies of eclipses returns in true succession,           *
This being a very important point to examine, it constitutes the
subject of this paper : I take it for granted, that the great astro
nomical year commencing with the Nabonassarean sera is a true
epoch for computing the Julian equation according to Rem. XI,
page 345, and that the dates of those eclipses subsequent to thaf
period must be corrected on that principle.
   The manner proceeded on is simply this ; 1 st. The first co
lumn gives the historical dates as per table, Phil. Mag. p. 244,
2d. The second column shows the equation to be added accord
ing to the rate of 1 1 minutes per annum from the aforesaid
epoch.      3d. The third column shows the equated or true time
of the said eclipses ; and, 4th. The fourth column shows the
corresponding dates. The Julian equation at the rate of seven
days for one period, and 14 days for two periods ; less by four
days for one, and eight days for two periods ; which leaves six
days for two periods to be added for dates preceding the Gre
gorian and New style, is added afterwards for want of room.

    In comparing the above historical dates with the equated
times, the calendar of the ancients appears to have differed up
wards of five whole days from the astronomical time in the space
of about 750 years. The dates of the corresponding eclipses from
A D. 1104 to A.D. 1823 are of three denominations in the
Tables : 1. Such as are set down prior to the correction of the
Gregorian calendar.       2. Such as are registered or computed ac
cording to that calendar : and, 3. Such as come under the New
style.   Those set down in the tables according to the New style
very nearly agree with the equated dates; this is manifest by
inspection: those set down according to the Gregorian style do
not so well correspond ; which may be attributed perhaps to the
defect of that calendar : but those eclipses set down prior to
the year 1582 require the equation of two whole periods to be
added, because tliev were recorded before any such correction
took place : which will discover two things necessary to be in
quired into; first, whether the solar equation allowed for each
period is correct ; and, secondly, whether those eclipses have
been registered by the same or different calendars.

   From     these   examples  it  appears   that   the assumed equation
above given very nearly reduess the dates to the same day, and
time of the day within a few hours, although it must be remarked
the distance of time is no less than 1824 years.          To proceed on
any nicer calculation would be prolix, but not unprofitable in a
work devoted to the subject of the lunar astronomy.
   Again : If you add to the above equated dates the Julian equa
tion, these equated dates will correspond with the equated dates
of those eclipses which happened for seven hundred years before
the Christian sera, and the result will amount to the same mea
sure of time, or very nearly : 1 shall produce an example of this
sort.

   Having now produced the principles          upon which the eclipses
of the ancients may be verified without the tedious method of
calculation by tables and anomalies, and reduced their dates by a
most simple method to a common standard, agreeing with mo
dern observations, I proceed on other remarks.
   The year A.D. 1801 appears to have been remarkable for the
places of the sun and moon in the autumnal equinox, and an
                                                                    epoch

                     Remarks on Ancient Eclipses.                443
 epoch most convenient for calculating  the lunar periods and cycles
  to any extent.    The place of the moon's ascending node and
 apogee in September of that year coincided with points in the
 heavens not occurring during many ages, at least for upwards of
 .nine centuries.
     In 912 solar years there are 48 lunar cycles of 19 years, and
 exactly 49 revolutions of the nodes : therefore if you divide this
 period by 48, the precise measure of one cycle is obtained; and
  if you divide the same period by 49, you will ascertain the period
 of one revolution of the nodes. The whole of these calculations
 depend upon the just quantity of the solar year, any .augmenta
 tion or diminution of which, beyond or short of its true and ab
solute measure, affects all the lunar calculations founded on it.
 A difference of one minute in the quantity of a solar year will
 amount to 15 hours 12 minutes for a whole period, and a dif
 ference of but one second in a lunation will amount to three
¦hours in that space of time; a difference of eight seconds will
amount to one day; and one hour and a half in a cycle will
amount to three days.
     In 912 solar years there are 228 bissextiles and seven inter
calary days, in all 235 days; and in one lunar cycle are 12 x 19
•=228 lunations, and seven intercalary; in all 235 lunations;
also in a lunar cycle are 940 changes of the moon, and in 912
solar years are 940 lunations : this harmony really subsists, and
js confirmed by every evidence of observation.
     The lunar cycle is computed at 19 solar years, and constitutes
one fundamental principle of the Paschal Tables published in all
editions of the book of Common Prayer. The fractional quantities
belong to the pure astronomy, and which can only affect the ec
clesiastical and calendar reckoning in a lapse of some centuries.
This cycle comprehends a regular series of eclipses ; and when
expired, a new series begins, with a variation which requires a
whole period to exhaust ; so that forty-eight such cycles must
elapse before such period terminates. This arises from the motion
of the moon's ecliptic points or nodes, whose revolutions pro
duce these admirable variations.
     The precise measure of this cycle is variously estimated, but
the following method will nearly approximate to the truth,
                 Days. H. M.            Davs. H. M.

$44                Remarks on Ancient Eclipses.
Therefore    19 solar years   contain 6939 days 14 hours 31 mi
nutes, at the rate of 1 1 minutes per annum for the Julian excess ;
and by deducting three whole days in 912 years the moon com
pletes her course within one hour and a half of the sun, and con
sequently the cycle contains 6939 days 13 hours one minute,
which makes a difference of three whole days in 912 solar years.
    If tfee moon anticipates the sun three days in 912 solar years,
it is evident the moon's motion roust be completed in less time
than the sun, and therefore the quantity of one hour and a half
must be deducted from the solar time as above stated : but the
question    is,  whether this equation for the lunar anticipation                              is
any   real  element  in the lunar astronomy; or whether       may not       it
be   accounted   for  on  the unknown   measures  of  the moon's  true
motions.       The concurrence of so many examples of eclipses of
 the sun and moon at fixed periods, stated in the preceding re
marks, affords so many convincing testimonies for the coincidence
of their motions, as seems to exclude the idea, that any positive
anticipation of either the sun or moon really exists ;'and for this
plain and self-evident fact, that every eclipse      caused     isuni            by   a
son and concurrence of their motions.
    The true measure of a lunar cycle of 19 years may,            pre        it   is
sumed, be best determined from         acomparative statement of the
 motions of the sun and moon with the elements of each at that
interval, as computed in the British Nautical Almanack, which
is  the highest authority to be consulted             in
                                               so exact     determina  a

 LXXI.     On the Distribution of the Magnetic Fluids in Masses
    of Iron: and     on the Deviations -which they produce in Com
    passes placed within their Influence.             By Mr. Charles
    BONNYCASTLE.
It    having been observed by modern navigators, that the iron
which enters so largely into the construction and equipment of their
vessels, js capable of producing a very sensible effect upon the
needle ; much attention has lately been turned towards explain
ing and correcting the error thus produced.               With this view,
Mr. Barlow of the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, has, not
long since, published a Memoir, containing the results of a nu
merous set of experiments, made principally upon spheres of iron:
and a few pages on this subject have also been written by Dr.
Young, and printed by order of the Board of Longitude.
    The latter of these productions, from its nature and the as
sumptions on which its investigations are founded, can only be
considered as affording a probable approximation to the truth;
and the former, independently of its impeaching in some degree
the received theory of magnetism, is professedly experimental ;
and for this reason requires some further evidence to prove that
the conclusions of its author, drawn as they are from a restricted
case, may be safely employed under the variously modified ac
tions which arise from the irregularity of the ferruginous masses
contained in a ship, and the alterations in the intensities and di
rections of the magnetic fluids, which take place with every
change of position on the surface of the globe.
    To remove these difficulties, and to investigate from the theory
of Coulomb the magnetic attractions of masses of iron of all
figures, and for all places, is the object of the following pages ;
in which if I have succeeded, I flatter myself I shall have added
something to the stability of the theory I have employed^ by
showing how ready an explanation it affords of many magnetic,
phaenomena, to the investigation of which it has hitherto been
applied without success*.
    The principle upon which it is my intention to found this in
quiry, is an extension of the law that regulates the action of elec-
   * Mr. Barlow, although led by his results to entertain some doubts of
Coulomb's theory, has observed,
                                   " If therefore, when the mass of iron is
great, and the distance at which it acts considerable, the laws which I have
developed should be found to be the necessary consequence of the hypo-i
thesis to which I have alluded, (Coulomb's,) the agreement will furnish
one of the best proofs that has yet been given of the accuracy of the de
ductions upon which that hypothesis is founded; and, I should hope, with
out detracting in any manner from the value of the experimental results de
tailed in the foregoing pages of this work.— (Essay on Magnetic Attrac

tvified bodies upon conductors ; which was first given by M.
Poisson in the Memoirs of the Institute for 1811, and employed
by him to determine the development of the electric fluids in
 spheres that mutually act on each other; an investigation to
 which, I believe, it has been heretofore entirely restricted.
     Confining ourselves in this place to magnetic forces, the law
which 1 have here alluded to may be briefly deduced as follows :
     Conceive every particle of the given mass of iron, as contain
ing equal quantities of the magnetic fluids; it is then manifest
that they will, by their mutual actions, neutralize each other; and
the magnetism, thus reduced to a latent state, will be incapable
of producing any external effect by which its presence might be
 detected.                                                            '
     But dn the approach of a magnet, this state of equilibrium is
 immediately disturbed ; the different fluids are repulsed or at
 tracted according as the predominant pole is of the same or a
 contrary denomination ; the liberated fluids in their turn cause
 a further displacement ; and a series of these successive actions
 will go on until the developed magnetism is so distributed that
 its action upon any particle is equal, and opposite, to that of the
 disturbing magnet.
     In the case we are considering, the disturbing force is the la
 tent magnetism of the earth; which, from the distance of its
 poles, may be considered as acting in parallel lines, and with equal
 forces on all the particles of the mass : hence the condition which
 we have deduced for the equilibrium of the fluids may be enun
 ciated as follows :
     If  the latent magnetism of a mass of iron be developed ly the
 action of the earth, it will recede to the turface, and will there
form a very thin shell, whose nature is suck, that its action in a.
 given direction is always equal to a certain constant quantity.
     To determine from this law the thickness of the shell at any
 required point,   is, in most instances,   problem that seems nearly

is   a  sphere, a case which is, immediately connected with our pre
  sent inquiry, the solution may readily be obtained as follows      :
     Let ANBS (fig.           be the given sphere, of which the centre

  to the two spheres,        urged towards O,

Attractions will be as m i and hk = (iw') ; which, putting the
angle N O C equal a, is as cos a and sin a.       In the same way it
appears that the difference   of the attractions  pn, pn' is as cos a
and    —  sin a : the attractions therefore perpendicular to N'S
destroy each other ; whilst in the direction of that line they are
equal to a constant quantity; and as NS is the direction of the
dip, it is manifest that this distribution of the fluid is agreeable
to the law that we have laid down.
   Let $ be the ahgle which the conjugate diameter of any point
in the surface makes with the meridian ; I the thickness of the
shell at the given point ; and T the polar thickness.     Then from
the foregoing demonstration we readily derive the following ana
lytical expression for the thickness of the shell at any point of
the surface, viz.           t = T. sin p.     • .
    It would be foreign to our present purpose to enter any further
into the investigation of particular cases ; all that we have pro
posed to investigate may be derived either from what has .pre
ceded, or from the following general theorem, which it will be
our next object to demonstrate.

   The truth of this theorem may     be readily established; for, con
ceiving the force in the direction of the dip to be unity, the forces

clude that the distribution of the fluid assigned td'am/ £orrh!V)by
the theorem, is such as would produce a force equal and oppo^
site to that of the terrestrial magnetism ; and consequently such                «
will fulfil the conditions to which we have arrived in page 447.
     Having thus deduced the laws which regulate the accumula
tion of the magnetic fluids in masses of iron of all forms ; it will
now be merely an affair of analysis to determine the deviations
which their attractions are capable of producing upon compasses
whose situations are known with respect to the given body. ]'
     When the given body is of an irregular form, the deviations
 produced can only be obtained by knowing the attractions for
three o^her directions of the dip : but if the mass be either *phe-?
rical or spheroidal, the effect may be calculated by a direct pro
cess. Thufe; let A GD S (fig. 9) be the given sphere ; where O is
the centre; N S the direction of the dip ; and & the centre of the
second sphere (page 447-S) ; let also C be the-place of the com*
pass, and join C O, C O' ; the first of which cuts the sphere in
some point P; join NP,                APj      and produce the latter to meet
the horizontal eircle G H P in H, through which point draw OC
meeting the vertical C C' in              C   : then the necessary construction
will    be  finished  by  drawing      in  the  vertical plane the axe OAyarid
the rectangular        axes    O  G,   OD    in  the plane of the horizon, OG

     Thesame law probably obtains for other solids, but n
that we have yet demonstrated will enable in' to 'draw so get _
conclusion : that it is true for spheres and spheroids, may be
monstrated as follows. Since we have st eu (page 4-17-8) that                                               the
development of the magnetic fluids which produces on any par
ticle p of the sphere an attraction equal and contrary to that of the
terrestrial magnetism, takes place at the surface ; it follows that
             to take away all that interior portion of the mass whieh
               "
                 y  a concentric sphere, having the radius pO, the
                 '
                   the fluids in p would still be maintained ; and the
                and consequent attraction of the magnetism in the
    — thus produced,
shell       i             would be the same as for the whole sphere,
                                                               i
    Since moreover the attraction of each   c:    of the equal spheres
A N B S, A N' B S', varies as either of their masses ; the differ
ence of their attractions, which is proportional to the magnetic
attraction of the first sphere, must also vary as the same mass,
or as the cube of the diameter.
    The same demonstration will evidently extend to s
    Hence, to complete the investigation which we have pre
to ourselves, it will now be necessary to examine the attractii
of irregular bodies ; which may be effected by the fotlowi]
theorem, analogous in its nature and demonstration tothat^ive
in page 449.

    the efficacy of the method. The truth of the latter, however, fol
    lows immediately from our theorem ; for since the attraction of
    any mass of iron, whose parts are similar and equal on each side
    the meridian, passing through the compass, can be found in all
    positions, the compass and mass retaining their relative situations,
   from the attractions in any three; it follows, that if we can find
    a mass of iron whose effect shall double that of the ship in three
   directions of the vessel's head ; it will also, cceteris paribus,
   double it for every other position of the vessel ; either with, re
   gard to the points of the compass, or the situation on the globe.
       It was my intention to have added some further application*
   of the method I have followed in this inquiry ; but 1 have already
   surpassed the bounds to which I had proposed to restrict my
   self: and I can therefore only add my sincere wish that the
   hitherto greatly neglected subject of magnetism may continue
   to attract the attention which it has lately received from Govern -
   ment; and by which alone we can hope to see explained mauv
   of those complicated phenomena of variation that, from the
   widely extended observations they require, would perhapi for
   ever baffle the most arduous exertions of individual talent.

       Cables on the Construction of Capt. Samuel Brown, and
       the Patent Chain Cable of Thomas Brum'on, Esq. ; and of
   ¦
      Iron Cables compared with Hempen Cables as elicited on the
       Trial of the Cause B ronton against Hawks and otfiersj, up-
      fore  the  Lord Chief Justice Abbott and a Special Spec,    Jury,
      2bth  May 1820.
    This   was an action for infringing a patent granted to I
  tiffin the   year  1813, for certain improvements in the (
  tion, making, or manufacturing of ships' anchors and windlasses,
   and chain-cables, or moorings.      The cause was of considerable
  importance, and occupied the attention of the Court for upwards
  of five hours.     The case for the plaintiff was opened with great
  ability bv Mr. Scarlett, and was confined to an infringement of
  one partonlv of the patent, namely, the chain-cables:     but it wa»
  contended by the Solicitor-General for the defendants, that, as
  the patent was not for one, but three articles, if any one of them
  were not new at the time of obtaining the patent, or not useful,
-
  the patent would be void.
      The Judge was not disposed to admit this: it was possible that
  the oldness or inutility of any one of the three articles embrcaet 1
  in a grant, might render the grant void as to that one, without
                                           t                destroying

      destroying the right to the other two; aw therefore his Lord-
      ship would reserve the point of                  i head, if defendants
 , insisted on filtering into any other <              ian the infringement
    . complained of, shoilld the jury not (L-.        he plaintiff upon this
      point      It was finally so settled; the defendants insisting on in
      quiring into the novelty of plaintiff's mode of manufacturing
      ships' anchors.      They admitted the novelty of the windlass.
         On the part of the plaintiff, the utility of the chain cable was
      proved bv Captain Johnston, the acting manager of the house of
      Messrs. Buckles and Co. eminent ship-owners in the city, who
      stated, that all the ships belonging to their house were furnished
    .with the patent chain-cables and anchors; that the hempen ca
      bles used frequently to give way, the iron ones never; and that
      in a vovatje to the West Indies their ships used to break On aw
      average two of the common anchors every voyage— sometimes
      three ; but that they have never yet broken one of the patent
      anchors.     The actual infringement of the patent was then proved
      by a gentleman who bought a chain cable from defendants,
          ressed or marked with the name of Hawks on every one of
          links, a piece of which was exhibited to the Jury.
         Dr. Gregory and Mr. Barlow of the Royal Military Academy,
     Woolwich), Mr. Brunei and Mr. Donkin (both eminent engi
     neers), gave evidence to the perspicuity of the specification, and
      the scientific merits of the chain-cable and anchor.           The im-
  '
     provements in the former they stated to be, the placing the whole
     material of the links in the same sectional plane, the introducing
        broad-ended stay into each liilk to prevent the sides from col-
        psing when exposed to a strain ; the making the ends of this
        ay remain in their place by lapping upon and surrounding a
     considerable portion of the opposite curved parts of the opposite
     sides of the link, and the making those parts of each link which
     interpose between the central stay and the neighbouring inter -
     posed links at each end, as straight as possible, that they might
     not be solicited to change their figure when exposed to a srrain— <
     every change of the figure being apt to injure the fibre of the
     iron : and these improvements were pointed out as being manifest
     and self-evident, by comparing the patent chain-cable with the
     chain-cables before in use, which were manufactured by Captain
, Brown. — In these cables the links had stays, but instead of being
         >ad ended, they were sharp-pointed ; and instead of
                                                                      lapping
             and embracing the opposite inner sides of the link, were
       ecured in the links by holes punched in these to receive the
    pointed ends of the pins or stays — a mode of combining them
    that tended to weaken the link and endanger its rupture, by
    breaking it over the points of the stay as fulcrums, when exposed
                                   instead of presenting the substance of

 the link in the same sectional plane, Capt. Brown's links are
 made of a twisted form, for the avowed purpose of giving them
 elasticity — a form extremely injurious to the strength of the link,
 as the first effort of tension must be to draw the link out of its
•twist, and bring those portions of it which lie between the points
 of strain into straight lines.
     John Knowles, Esq. secretary to the surveyors of the navy,
 gave a most interesting detail of experiments made by order of
 the Navy-office, to ascertain the comparative merits of Brown's
 chain-cables and those of the patentee.            In every experiment,
 Brown's twisted links, with sharp-ended stays, were ruptured
 and broken, while the plaintiff's remained uninjured.              In conse
 quence, orders were issued that no more chain-cables on Brown's
 construction should be admitted for the service of the navy; but
 only and exclusively, chain-cables with broad-ended stays in the
 links, and the links having their substance in the same plane.
  .  Mr. Knowles read the minutes of the experiments alluded to, and
 which were signed by the commissioners of the navy, as follows :

Messrs. Brunton and Company's 33 feet. At a strain of 50 tons
the former had stretched 12 inches, the latter 6.               On a strain
of €0 tons having been applied, the former had stretched 24
inches, and the latter 12. Capt. Brown's was broken in the body
of the iron by a strain of 6,5 tons; the iron was of a very good
quality: the stays of the twisted chain were generally crooked."

   28 tons broke the      f chain.    The hempen cable was measured
  after a strain of 25    tons had been applied; it had stretched 12
  inches in 10 feet.      The hempen cable was broken bv a strain of
  30 tons."
       Experiment 4. "A 24 inch hempen cable was attached to a
   1 1 inch iron cable of Capt. Brown's, and a 1| inch iron cable of
  Messrs. Brunton and Company's manufacture.              After a strain of
  30 tons the cable measured 22 inches: when 76 tons had been
  applied, it was reduced in circumference : the cable was broken
  in the iiip at 91 tons."
      Experiment 5. "A length of Capt. Brown's twisted chain of
   If   inch, that he had supplied to Deptford yard, was attached
  to one of    l\ inch manufactured by Messrs. Brunton and Com
  pany.      The  link of Capt. Brown's was broken by a strain of 64
  tons.     It was again tried, and another link broke at 70 tons.
  The iron was found to be of a bad quality."
      " After the first experiment, Capt. Brown doubted the accu
  racy of the results given by the hydraulic engine, [the testing
  machine is made on the ingenious principle of Mr. Bramah's hy
  draulic press] imagining that the strain was nearly one-half more
  than the balances indicated: but the truth of the engine appears
  to have been proved by the strain on the 12 inch hempen cable;
  as it bore, according      to that machine,     about 2 tons more than
  was expected."                                                      '-

  Mr. Bruriton's, made in order to ascertain what they would bear,
  and thereby to be better able to apportion the chain cables to be
  substituted for them."
      Mr. Solicitor General (for the defendants) — " We do not

 l&16y that not only the triangular chain but the parallel chain
should 'be tried against them."
    " Brunton's was the angular?" — "Yes."
    "  And Capt. Brown desired some experiments to be made be
tween the elliptical and angular chains?" — "Yes."
    " Did he ( Brunton) admit that the plan of Brown's was strong
est?" — "No; he admitted that it was as strong, and it would
be only trying the excellency of the workmanship and the- iron
against workmanship and iron."                                          -    *
       Mr. Brunton admitted that the elliptical was as strong as the
angular form, supposing they were made the same way, and not
that- the elliptical link with the pointed stay was as strong?" —
"No; that was not spoken of. Capt. Brown wished to have
manufactured chains for the purpose of trial, with links that had
their sides nearly as a straight line, considering that the more it
deviated it became the weaker.           Brown wished it to be done;
but the Navy Board thought it unnecessary to enter into it, as
it was admitted to be as strong."
    The plaintiff next called Mr. Bramah; hut the Judge here
intimated, that already the evidence for the plaintiff appeared so
plain, that he should like to learn from defendants' counsel what
answer they could give to so strong a case, without now taking
up the time of the court in examining more witnesses for plain
tiff, till it should be seen, from the nature of the defence, whether
it would be necessary? — in which event, he would not preclude
defendant from calling more witnesses. • •
    The counsel for plaintiff said, they had many scientific men yet
to be examined, if necessary* ; but had no objection to what had
been recommended by his lordship.
    Defendants' counsel contended, that neither the chain -cable
nor the anchor were new. Chains having oval links, very simi
lar in form to those described by the patentee, had been in use
for ages, therefore he could have no exclusive right to the use of
such chains ; and Capt. Brown had used stays, therefore he could
have no exclusive right to them, it was also stated, that evidence
would be offered to prove that links having their substance in
the same plane, and having what might be called broad-ended
stays (though not so broad, nor precisely of the form ot plaintiff's
stay), had been in use long before the date of the patent. . .
    * We have seldom or never    seen in any cause such a phalanx of scien
tific and practical men as were subpoenaed  for the plaintiff. Besides those
already mentioned, we observed among them, Professor Millington, of the
Royal Institution, Messrs. Mawdeslay, Wilson Lowry, Ostell, Galloway,
Tilloch, Keir, Collinge, John Farcy jun., Hawkins, Gill, Joseph Farey,
T.Jones (instrument-maker t« the Board of Longitude), and others; beside*
Master ship-builders, Sea Captains, and people versant with naval matters,
but whose names we could not learn.
                                                                       Mr.

462       On the comparative Strength      of Cham    Cables.
   Mr. Solicitor General. — "That    there is a great resemblance
between our links [Hawks's] and fig.. 5. [Brunton's] is because
it resembles the common oval link. We are not precluded, I
submit, from the use of the oval link, because he [the patentee]
 has specified something like it?"
     Lord Chief Justice. — " Unless you have evidence to show that
 the broad-headed stay is either old or useless, they will most
 likely succeed. — Any evidence you can call to show that it is not
 the invention of the plaintiff, or useless, will be of importance."
     Mr. Jessop was called for defendants. He was of opinion that
 a  little curvature in the sides, was rather better than having them
 straight between the points of strain, as making it better able to
 stand the effect of a sudden jerk. But on a question from Mr.
 Scarlett, whether the iron cable by which a ship rides, could be
 brought into a straight line, so as to be jerked? he stated his
 meaning to be,
                    " that mere positive strength applied to iron does
 not apply to the same material when used against a jerk."
     A link of a chain, not of the form of plaintiff's, but having
 Stays with ends that might be called comparatively broad, and
 secured by lapping round the inner part of the link where inter
 posed, like the plaintiffs, was now put in, and sworn to by one
 of Mr. Rennie's workmen, as having been (or rather similar
 links) made and used some months before the date of the pa
 tent : but on cross-examining the witness, it was proved that they
 were not made for a chain, properly so called; that only four of
 them were made in all; and that they were applied to the join
ing of two bolts in some building.
     Some old men (nail-makers) were called to prove, that among
 parcels of old iron, which they were in the habit of working up
 into nails, they had frequently, many years ago, met with pieces
 of chain having stays in them, which were not sharp- pointed;'
 and some persons belonging to the arsenals were brought. to prove
 the recent sale of similar pieces of chain among the old stores.
 Various pieces of the kind of chain alluded to were produced and
 sworn to by the witnesses : but it turned out on examining them,
 that the stays did not lap Tound the substance of the link, leaving
 the substance unhurt, but, on the contrary, were retained in their
 places by being received into notches chiselled out of the substance
 of the link; and it was also proved, even by defendants' wit
 nesses, that the stays were not put into the links to strengthen
 them against a strain, but merely to prevent the chain from
•kinking — that  is,   two or more of the links getting entangled;
 and that they were made solely for pump chains,.
     Defendants' counsel next put in what  ,is   commonly well known
 by    the name ofa     mushroom-anchor,     and another known     by
 the name of the adze-anchor, both having their names from their
 respective forms. The head of the former, instead of having arms
                                                                 and

 and flukes, lias a large round head, shaped like a dish, or a por
 tion of a sphere : the latter is like a cooper's adze. They are both
 made of cast iron, with a shank of malleable iron riveted into them :
 this the counsel insisted was the same method as that described
 by the plaintiff, and therefore his anchors were not new. .
    The answer was, That these were not the kind of anchors
 claimed or described by the patentee, whose anchors had arms
 and flukes, and were described as ship's anchors, which these
 were not.      It was proved, even by the witnesses for defendants,
 that these anchors were employed only for stationary moorings
 —and not for ships' anchors used on voyages.
    It was now put to the jury, whether there was any necessity
 for the plaintiff's counsel to take up their time ? and they stated,
 that they thought it not necessary, as they were perfectly masters
 of the whole case.
    The Chief Justice now addressed the jury. It was not neces
 sary that he should recapitulate the whole evidence respecting the
 particular infringement complained of, as the plaintiff's counsel
 had not been called upon to address them. He wished, however,
 in giving their verdict respecting the infringement on the chain-
 cable, to be also informed by them, whether they found the
 anchor to be new and beneficial ?
    The jury found for the plaintiff upon all the points: namely,
 that the specification was sufficient, the chain-cable and anchor
 new and beneficial, and that the defendants had infringed the
 chain-cable.      Nominal damages alone were sought for in this
 action, the question of Right being all that was to be tried, as
 the defendants were to account, under a previous suit in Chan
 cery, for the profits they had made by the use of the invention.
 The jury accordingly awarded One Shilling damages, besides
-costs of suit.
    The verdict seemed to give very general satisfaction to a
 crowded court.

   '
      June 9. This was the last meeting for the present sessions,
  and was very numerously attended.         A paper by Mr. F. Baily
  was rend, on the method of adjusting a transit instrument by
  observing the passage of two stars, differing considerably from
  each other in declination:     and a new Table was given, whereby
 the deviation of the instrument and the error of the clock might
  be readily determined without the trouble of computation.          Por-
  table'transit instruments are now made with great neatness and
 accuracy; and are a valuable acquisition to every ceconomical
 observatory, and to such persons as are travelling with a view to
 improve the connected sciences of astronomy and geography.
  Instruments of this kind are often fixed in situations which d6
 not command a view of the pole star: and under such circum
 stances, the table, above alluded to, is very desirable.         Indeed
 M. Delambre prefers this mode of adjusting a transit instrument,
 to the observation of the circum-polar stars : he considers the
 results as more correct, and obtainable in much less time.—
 Sir H. Englefield requested permission to address the meeting,
 and called their attention to the new bodies which have lately
 been discovered, and which are supposed to be of a cometary
 nature.     He noticed the discoveries of Cassini and Short, sup
 posed to be of new planets, which have not since been observed ;
 and wished some of the members who had time and inclination
 for the purpose, would submit the observations of those two ce
 lebrated astronomers to the test of analysis, in order to determine
 whether those bodies assimilated in their motions to those which
 have been lately discovered. — The Society afterwards adjourned
 till the 10th of'November.

      NOTE ON THE DIVINING ROD, BY DR. CHARLES HUTTON.
                             To  Mr. Tilloch.
     SlR, — In  the last No. (44) of the Quarterly Review, several
small mistakes have accidentally crept into the short account re
lating to the alleged property of the divining rod, for the discovery
of water, when used by certain persons.          And as it must be de
sirable that every work should be     as  correct as possible, I com
 municate for you*>consideration the following particulars relating
to the Bote in pp. 373 and 374, concerning some small inadver-              .
tencies that have occurred through forgetftilness, or by mistakes
in reports passing through two or three different persons, as will
appear by comparing the note with the full account in the 4th
     Vot.'SS. No. 266. June 1820.               X x                  vol.

        466                      Nole on       the divtrtinc'    Rod.
           The note begins thus: "Jan. 21st, lSl<8: it is just, $0jears
        since Lady N.'s attention was first called to this subjective, was
        then 16 years of age."   Which must therefore haye,beenyin£he
        year 1768; whereas Lady.iM.'s first letter to Dr. Button stated,
       that the transaction was in 1772                (if    not 1773), when she was Id
       years:  old.    But  these      are    only  trifling     discrepancies.
           ;TJne remainder    of   the   note     differs    not   materially from the state
      ment in Lady M.'s          letter   in    Dr.   Mutton's        book above mentioned,
       tilliwe arrive at the paragraph             in      the middle of the 374th page,
      .viz. " A    few years afterwards she went, at Dr. Hut ton's particular
       request, to see him at Woolwich (Common), and she then showed
       him the experiment, and discovered                    a    springin   a    field which he
       had lately bought near the New College, then building.                                   This
       same field    he  has  since      sold    to  the    College,      and for a    larger price
                                                                                    ~

       The fact     is, that Dr. H. having about 15 or 16 years before pur
       chased the field alluded to, bounded close upon the east side of
       Woolwich Common, and being convenient for erecting dwelling-
       houses, he immediately commenced a series of operations of that
       kind, and in the first year (1790) built the first house, which, he
       occupied with his family during several years afterwards                                 This
       house has now been used for the last 14 years as the hospital of the
       Military Academy or College, and goes                     by      the name of the Cube
       House; standing on square of 40 feet each side, and the same
                                   a
       in height.      During the building of this house, as                      it    had always
       been reported        and     understood          that     no   water   was     to  be., found
       oh the neighbouring common, for his satisfaction Dr. H.'jpro-
       cured  a   set of iron boring rods, with which he boid (he ground
       to the depth of 50 feet, where he found copious spring of water,
                                                                 a

                     NEW ELECTBICAL BATTERY*          v.!:
   Dr. Dana, of Harvard University in America, has constructed
an, electrical battery of plates, extremely portable and compact;
and from his experiments appearing to be very powerful.               .It                           .
consists of alternate plates of flat glass and tin foil, the glass
plates being on all sides two inches larger than those of foil. The
alternate plates of tin foil are connected together, i. e: the 1st,-
8d, 5th, 7th, &c, on one side, and the other series, or 2d, 4th,
6th, 8th, &o. on the other side, slips of tin foil extending from
the sheet to the edge of the glass plates for that purpose.       These
connexions unite together all the surfaces, which, when the bat
tery is charged, take by induction the same ^tate.          A battery
constructed in this way contains, in the bulk of a 4to volume, a.
very powerful instrument; and when made of plate glass, it i*
extremely easy, by varnishing the edges, to keep the whole of
the inner sprfaces from the air, and to retain it         a constant              iji
state of dry insulation.              —                 ¦

fu'rnacesj to erect them on a construction less prejudicial to health
than the methods hitherto pursued.                           The motion having been

those intetested in the discussion.                       The method alluded toby
Mr; Taylor as having been successful at Warwick, is not the
only, and we are much inclined to believe not the best, that
may be adopted for causing furnaces to burn their own smoke;

      D. Tader in the course of various researches respecting the
 fermentation of grain, has ascertained that the gluten of wheat •
 is componed of two substances perfectly distinct from each other,
                                                                                                       :
 one of which he has named gloiodine, and the other zimome. The
 first of these gives to gluten its elasticity, and the second is the' :
 cause of the fermentation which takes place on the mixture of
                                                                           '                   ,; -'*'A
