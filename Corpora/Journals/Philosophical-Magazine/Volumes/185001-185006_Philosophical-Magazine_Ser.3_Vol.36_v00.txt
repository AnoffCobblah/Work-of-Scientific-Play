I. Experiments on the Extraction of Gold and Silver from
   their Ores by the Wet Way. By JoHN PERCY, M.D., F.R.S.*
     TTENTION has of late been directed to the extraction
      of silver by the wet way from many of its ores, of which
large quantities are now imported into this country, especially
from South America. Several processes have been pro
jected; and one, the subject of a patent, is now extensively
practised.    It consists in calcining the ore with chloride of
sodium, precisely as in the amalgamation process of Freiberg,
and then dissolving out the chloride of silver formed during
the calcination by a hot saturated solution of chloride of so
dium.     From this solution the silver is precipitated by me
tallic copper, and then cupelled. I have examined many
South American silver ores, and have found them very vari
able in respect to the proportion of silver, and the presence of
gold and other metals. In one ore I have found as much as
30+ per cent. of fine silver. Several smelting establishments
have, I know, attempted to work some of these ores in the
dry way, but the results have not been favourable. , Hence
will appear the importance of directing attention to the oeco
nomic extraction of the silver by the wet way.
    The ore which I subjected to experiment was an auri
 ferous silver ore, which contained a large proportion of
 blende, with galena, iron pyrites and copper pyrites in
 small quantity; the non-metallic part of it consisted chiefly of
silica. The silver was present as sulphuret. By roasting,
 the ore swelled up much, and sulphurous acid was copiously
disengaged. I received it in the state of coarse brownish
gray powder. I made numerous experiments upon it, to
ascertain the best mode of extracting the precious metals by

2         Dr. Percy on the Extraction of Gold and Silver
 the dry way, and then proceeded with experiments on the
 extraction of those metals by the wet way, the results of which
 I now communicate.
    The mean of two assays of the roasted ore by the dry way
gave of fine silver containing gold
                       7.977 grs. in 1000.                   -
                      55.839 in the pound avoirdupois.
                        260 oz. in the ton.
    The silver contained of gold per cent. 3.78.
    Therefore, the total quantity of fine silver in 1000 grs. of
 roasted ore is 7.676, and of fine gold 0.301.
    Or, 250; oz. fine silver in the ton, and 9 oz. 16 dwts, fine
gold.
    1.   Ammonia extracted some silver from the roasted ore,
                                                           -      -
 notwithstanding the roasting towards the last was effected at
 a bright red heat.
    2. A solution of hyposulphite of soda also extracted from
 it a very sensible quantity of silver.
    3. I digested 1000 grs. of roasted ore for a few hours with
 a dilute solution of hyposulphite of soda, containing 150 grs.
 of the crystallized salt. The digestion was made at a tem
 perature just warm to the hand. I filtered, washed well,
 added to the filtrate an excess of dilute sulphuric acid, and
then boiled. Almost immediately after the addition of the sul
phuricacid, sulphurous acid was evolved and sulphur deposited;
but until the solution became hot, it did not acquire a dark
colour. I boiled for some time, stirring constantly until the
 supernatant liquor became bright and the dark precipitate
 subsided. I filtered, washed well and dried. I enclosed this
 precipitate in a sheet of assay-lead”, and cupelled. I obtained
 a bead of fine silver weighing 4.800. An accident occurred
in this experiment, which may have caused a slight loss... I
treated the bead with nitric acid, and obtained a sensible
residue of gold. I parted, with the usual precautions, and
melted the residue of gold before the blowpipe. The bead of
fine gold weighed 0-009. The silver therefore contained 0-187
per cent. of gold. This result appeared to me to be interesting,
as showing that hyposulphite of soda dissolved out a sensible
amount of gold from the ore roasted per se. Is it probable
that, in the presence of a large excess of other metallic oxides,
 the gold itself may, at least in a certain proportion, have
existed in combination with oxygen 't

   I treated the residual ore a second time with a dilute solu
tion of hyposulphite of soda, and proceeded in the manner
just described. I obtained another bead of fine silver, weigh
ing 0.050. Some loss was also again accidentally occasioned
in this second determination.
  4. Goldleaf was digested in a solution of hyposulphite of soda,
but it did not appear to be in any degree acted upon; neither
did silver leaf appear to be appreciably dissolved by the same
menstruum, although the surface after some time became tar
nished, the solution being freely exposed to the atmosphere. A
piece of copper wire, which had been previously dipped in ni
tric acid and washed, was immersed in the solution of hyposul
phite containing the silver leaf; but there was not the slightest .
appearance of the deposition of silver. However, the surface
of the copper acquired a dark colour, and by subsequent ex
posure to the atmosphere became beautifully iridescent.
   5. Into a large stoppered bottle I put 1000 grs. of the
roasted, finely pounded and sifted ore. I then nearly filled
the bottle with distilled water, and passed a stream of chlorine
through for an hour, having previously added 50 grs. of chlo
ride of potassium, with a view to form a stable double salt of
gold. After shaking the bottle at intervals during the passage
of the gas, there was a manifest absorption of the gas, as
proved by the rushing in of the air on withdrawing the stopper.
The agitation was repeated several times, and with the same
effect. I left the whole for about four days, shaking at inter
vals. When the powder had subsided after shaking, I uni
formly observed the disengagement of numerous small bubbles
of gas from the ore. On plunging a spill, burning only with
a spark, into the neck of the bottle, combustion was evidently
increased, the spark burning distinctly brighter. A strong
odour of some oxygen compound of chlorine continued to be
evolved. I filtered, and obtained a clear and colourless solu
tion, which I reduced considerably by evaporation. During
the evaporation, a white scum formed on the surface, and
white matter (PbCl) was deposited, which towards the last
occasioned succussions.     To the solution thus reduced, when
cold, 100 grs. of hyposulphite of soda were added; but the de
posited matter did not appear sensibly to dissolve. I treated
the residual ore with a solution of 200 grs. of hyposulphite
of soda; I filtered and washed.     I mixed the filtrate with the
solution previously mentioned, and carefully washed in the
precipitate. I added hydrochloric acid, and digested as usual,
stirring continually. Sulphurous acid did not appear to be
copiously evolved. The precipitate thus obtained was red
dish-brown and not black. It was washed on a filter, dried,

 enclosed in 130 grs. of assay-lead, and cupelled. The bead not
 being clean, was recupelled. I added 100 grs, of hyposulphite
 to the filtered solution and boiled, when a dark olive-brown
 precipitate was thrown down, which was dried, detached
 from the filter (the same as used in the first filtration) as com
 pletely as possible, and heated in a porcelain capsule to expel
 the free sulphur. A small quantity of black matter remained,
 which was enclosed in about 80 grs. of assay lead, and cupelled.
 When the lead was melted, I put the filter on it and inci
 nerated, and I also added the bead of silver previously ob
 tained, and enclosed in a small piece of assay lead. I ob
 tained a good bead of fine silver. However, the cupellation
 was not perfectly satisfactory, as I observed some very minute
 particles of silver surrounded by black scoria on the sides of
the cupel.
    The bead weighed 5.385 grs. By parting with nitric acid,
 it yielded of gold 0-100, or 1.857 per cent.
    6, 1000 grs. of the roasted ore were treated with chlorine
 precisely in the manner described in experiment 5, and left
 during four months. Bubbles of gas continued to be evolved
 sensibly for a long time; and even at the end of the four
 months, on stirring the ore, still continued to be disengaged
 from its surface. The clear supernatant solution was de
 canted, and the residue treated with a cold solution of 200 grs.
 of hyposulphite of soda; it was left for two or three days, fil
 tered and washed with cold water. I then digested the fil
 trate on the sand-bath with excess of sulphuric acid until the
 odour of sulphurous acid ceased to be detected. I washed
 the precipitate with boiling water, when after long washing,
it still continued to become turbid by the addition of BaCl
 (from PbCl). The dry precipitate was seen to be mixed with
 shining, colourless, acicular crystals. I roasted till no odour
of sulphurous acid was evolved, and then cupelled the residue
with 200 grs. of lead. There was evidently a considerable
quantity of matter present which would not pass into the cupel.
I recupelled the bead with a small additional quantity of lead.
    I obtained a bead of fine silver, weighing 5'80 grs. On the
addition of carbonate of potash to the decanted supernatant
liquor, a copious white precipitate was thrown down.
    7. I digested 1000 grs. of the finely-pounded roasted ore with
a solution of hyposulphite of soda containing 200 grs. of the
salt, at a temperature just warm to the hand, and then filtered.
I boiled the filtrate, which became brown. I added to the
boiling solution excess of dilute sulphuric acid, and continued
to digest for some time at about 212°F., stirring continually.
I filtered and dried. I detached the precipitate from the fil

                Jrom their Ores by the Wet Way.                 5
ter, and expelled the excess of sulphur by a gentle heat. I
enclosed the residuum in about 100 grs, of assay lead, and
cupelled. The bead weighed 0-802 gr. This is a very much
smaller quantity than that previously obtained (exp. 3) by
treating the roasted ore in the state of coarse powder without
subsequent trituration, as was practised in the present experi
 ment. Is it probable that by the act of trituration the asso
 ciated matter present, which existed in so large a proportion
compared with that of silver, may have protected the silver
from the action of the hyposulphite?
    On adding sulphuretted hydrogen water to the filtrate, after
precipitation by sulphuric acid, not the slightest blackness was
produced. A precipitate of the pure colour of sulphur, canary
yellow, was produced from the reaction of the sulphuretted
hydrogen upon the sulphurous acid remaining in the solution.
 I transferred the ore, after treatment with the salt of soda,
into a glass jar, and passed through a stream of chlorine for
nearly an hour, stirred well, and left the jar with its contents
covered until the following morning. The odour of chlorine
still continued to be strongly evolved. I added chloride of
sodium, and digested for several hours on the sand-bath, re
placing from time to time the water removed by evaporation: the
surface became covered with small white crystals. Afterwards
I added a solution containing 200 grs. of hyposulphite of soda,
and digested at a temperature just warm to the hand, stirring
well. I filtered and washed, and again treated the residual ore
with a further solution of hyposulphite containing 50 grs. of the
salt. I then filtered and washed. I mixed the two solutions,
and digested as usual with dilute SO” in excess, and filtered.
On the addition of HS water to the filtrate, the latter became
dark-coloured.     I then added an excess of HS water until
the odour of HS persisted, when after standing the filtrate
did not again become discoloured. I washed and dried. The
filtrate, which was readily detached from the filter without
sensible loss, was gently heated in a porcelain capsule to expel
the free sulphur. It then weighed 24 grs. I enclosed it,
together with the ash of the filter, which was incinerated in the
same capsule as used for expelling the free sulphur, in 200 grs.
of assay-lead. The capsule was not stained, and every appre
ciable trace of matter was removed. By cupellation I ob
tained a bead weighing 5:005 grs.
   I again exposed the residual ore diffused through water to
the action of a stream of chlorine precisely as before, except
that after digestion during a few hours I added KO until an
alkaline reaction was obtained, the reaction having been found
to be acid. White matter, apparently similar to that pre

6       Dr. Percy on the Extraction of Gold and Silver
viously observed under the same circumstances, again occurred
on the surface. I treated with a solution of 200 grs. of hypo
sulphite of soda. On testing the wash-water with HS water,
S was precipitated, and there was not the slightest dark dis
coloration.    I proceeded exactly as before, and cupelled with
about 60 grs. of assay lead. The bead of fine silver weighed
0.675 gr. I again treated the residual ore in a similar manner
with Cl for about an hour and a half, and then digested for a
considerable time on the sand-bath. On the following day I
dissolved out with a solution of 200 grs. of hyposulphite. I
treated the filtrate as usual with dilute SOP, and tested the
wash-water with HS water.       I proceeded as before.     I em
ployed 100 grs. of assay lead for cupellation. The bead of
fine silver weighed 0-154. The total amount of fine silver
obtained is 6:636 grs. By parting with NO”, I obtained of
gold 0.197. The silver therefore contained of gold 2.968
per cent.
    I now boiled the residual ore with a solution containing 100
 grs. of KCy, filtered and washed. By addition of HCl in
 excess to the filtrate, a white precipitate was produced; but
 on continuing the digestion until the odour of hydrocyanic
 acid could no longer be detected, it became dark-coloured,
 which I believed to be owing to the presence of S in some
 form. I digested the precipitate with NO", and obtained a
 pale blue solution, which did not become in the slightest de
 gree turbid by the addition of HCl. On the filter remained
 only a minute quantity of matter, like sulphur in appearance,
 somewhat discoloured; and by heat the characteristic odour
 of sulphur was evolved, and only a minute quantity of matter
 was left.
     8. In another experiment, in which I heated 1000 grs. of
 the finely-pounded ore, triturated after roasting, with a solu
 tion of 200 grs. of hyposulphite, I obtained a bead of fine
  silver weighing only 0.81.
     9. I digested 1000 grs. of roasted ore with a solution of
  common chloride of lime (hypochlorite) on the sand-bath
  during two or three days. I then washed and digested the
 residuum, at a warm temperature, with a solution of 150 grs.
  of hyposulphite of soda. I filtered and washed. To the fil
  trate I added an excess of dilute SO", and heated till the su
  pernatant liquor became quite clear. I filtered, washed
  slightly and dried. I enclosed the filter, with its contents, in
  200 grs. of assay lead, and I subsequently added on the cupel
  100 grs. I obtained a bead of fine silver weighing 5,469, and
  Containing gold, but only to the extent of '02. I do not,
  however, place much confidence in this determination of the

                 from their Ores by the Wet Way.                   7.
gold, as the manipulation was hardly conducted with the
requisite care.
    I dried the residual ore, and by trituration reduced it to a
very fine state of division, so that it was passed through the
finest copper sieve. I suspended it in cold distilled water,
and passed through a stream of Cl during about a quarter of
an hour, stirring continually. I then digested on the sand
bath, and left till the next day, when I still perceived a faint
odour of Cl. I added 100 grs. of hyposulphite of soda, and
digested at a gentle temperature, stirring occasionally. I de
canted and filtered the supernatant liquor. I again digested
the residue with an additional quantity of 100 grs. of hypo
sulphite, filtered and washed. I boiled the filtrate, as usual,
with an excess of dilute SO”. The precipitate soon became
dark-coloured. I digested until the supernatant liquor be
came clear, filtered, washed and dried. I detached the pre
cipitate from the filter, which was done without appreciable
loss; heated it in a capsule, to expel the free sulphur, and
digested it with aqua regia. As the white product which was
obtained by this means was mixed with minute acicular cry
stals like chloride of lead, I treated it, after washing, with zinc
and dilute hydrochloric acid. I washed and dried the metallic
residue, enclosed it in 110 grs. of assay lead, and cupelled. I
obtained a bead of fine silver weighing 0.829 gr., making a
total of fine silver 6'298.
... I examined the liquid left after digestion of the first preci
pitate with aqua regia, for gold. , I diluted it considerably,
and boiled with oxalic acid. On the following day (the oxalic
acid being added at night) I observed a film of reduced gold
of a reddish-brown colour; and a few days afterwards I
distinctly recognised minute particles having the colour and
metallic lustre of gold.
    10. I treated 1000 grs. of the well-roasted ore, in its coarsely
pounded state, with a cold solution of Fe°CP. Fe"O" was
soon precipitated, being displaced doubtless by the oxide of
zinc *. The supernatant liquor became clear and colourless.
I added HCl, which redissolved the Fe°CP, but it was again
precipitated. I added a considerable quantity of HCl, and
obtained a greenish-yellow brown solution. I filtered and
washed, and treated the residue with a solution of 150 grs. of
hyposulphite of soda. I proceeded as uusul with SO’. . I
used 200 grs. of assay lead in the cupellation, and obtained a
bead of fine silver weighing 4.909 grs.
    11. I confirmed the fact, that when chloride of silver is dis
solved in a solution of hyposulphite of soda, and treated with a
                * Oxide of copper will also displace it.

8         Mr. T. Weddle on Annuities and Assurances
mineral acid, a copious precipitation of dark-coloured matter
takes place, which is doubtless AgS. But whether the whole
of the silver is precipitated under these circumstances as sul
phuret I did not ascertain; though from the copious precipi
tate produced, I think that such is probably the case.
                     Concluding   Observations.
    1. The loss of fine silver in the most satisfactory experi
 ment was 133 per cent. Formerly, in the old amalgamation
process in Mexico, my respected friend Mr. John        #       in
forms me, the loss frequently amounted to 35 per cent. But at
present, since the introduction of the barrel-process, the loss
has been reduced to 9 or even 5 per cent. My results there
fore may be regarded as sufficiently satisfactory to justify at
tention to them with reference to their oeconomic application.
It is probable that on the large scale, with proper appliances,
the silver would be much more completely extracted.
   2. I would especially direct attention to chloride of lime
and chlorine as the agents for effecting the conversion of the
silver into chloride, and to hyposulphite of lime, which may
readily be obtained as a cheap substitute for hyposulphite of
soda to dissolve the chloride. The silver it is obvious might
be precipitated either as metal or sulphuret.
   3. Since many of the South American silver ores contain
gold, it is desirable that both the silver and gold should be
extracted by one process; and to this end chlorine or chloride
of lime seems to be indicated by the preceding experiments.
      II. On Annuities and Assurances on Successive Lives.
                By THOMAs WEDDLE, F.R.A.S.*
M'             in his Treatise on Annuities (Chapter VII.), has
        discussed this subject with much clearness and elegance;
yet his method of investigation does not seem to be the best
possible, nor do I think that his results are given in forms
well adapted to numerical applications.       It may therefore be
not altogether useless to consider the subject in a somewhat
different manner, and so to exhibit the formulas as best to
meet the wants of the computer.
   Problem I. To determine the present value (an) of an
assurance of £1 payable on the failure of the last of n success
ive lives A', A".... A(n).
   Let a? denote the value at the time of nomination of an
assurance of £1 payable on the death of ACP); A(p) itself de
                   * Communicated by the Author.

noting the value of an annuity of £1 during the life of A(p),
so that we have (r being the interest of £1 for a year)
                        1 -r A(p)
                a?==T#— . . . . . . . . (1)
          ... 1-a” = 1+(1+A9),
                          + r.
                                               . . . . . . (2)
and
             1+A* = (1+!) (1-a?).                . . . . . (3.)
   We have evidently a =a'; also when A" shall be nominated
the value of £1 payable at his death will be a”; but the pre
sent value of £1 payable when A" shall be nominated, that is,
at the end of the year in which Al shall die, is a ; hence the
present value of £1 payable at the death of A" is
                          a x a"=a'a";
                          •".   a2=a'a".
   And generally when the life A(p) shall be nominated, the
then value of £1 payable at his death will be a P); but the
present value of £1 payable at the death of AP-9, that is, at
the nomination of A(p), is ap-i,
                       ... ap=ap–1 a P.
Hence taking p=1, 2, 3.... n in succession, we have
                              a1=a'
                              as=ala"
                                 – 2 al"
                              a8= a2a
                              ân - an- 1 - a(*).
Multiply these equations together and cancel the common
factors
                    an=a'a"a"..... a'" . . . . . . (4.)
   Hence the present value of an assurance payable on the
failure of the last of any number of successive lives is very
readily computed, providing we have a table of the present
values of assurances on single lives; and such tables are given
in D. Jones's work on Annuities and Reversionary Payments
(Tables IX. and XXII.), according to both the Northampton
and Carlisle Tables of Mortality. If however only a table of
annuities be at hand, it will be better to modify (4.) as fol
lows:

10        Mr. T. Weddle on Annuities and Assurances
   By (1) we have a "=v(1-r/\?), where v=(1+r)-', the
present value of £1, due in a year, hence (4.) becomes
     an=v"(1-r/\!). (1-r/\")..... (1-r/\"). . . . (5.)
   Problem II. To determine (ap) the present value of an an
nuity of £1 on the pth life mentioned in Problem I.
   At the nomination of A(p) &l will be due, and the annuity
on his life will be worth AP); hence the life will then be worth
1 + A(p); but £1 due at the nomination of AP is now worth
ap-1; hence the present value of the annuity on the pth life is
                         ap–1. (1 + AP),
     ..., (4.), ap-a'a"...a?". (1 + AP), .        . . . . (6.)
and this is the present value of £1 per annum on the pth life.
   The preceding (6.) is the form that will generally be found
best adapted to computation; but ap may also be expressed
in terms of a only, or of A only, as follows (see (1.) and (3.)):—
   ap=   ( !)". ... a "(l-a(P),
            +                               .  .  . . . . (7.)
and
   ap=vp-1(1-r/\!)(1-r/\").... (1-r/\?-1)(1 + Ap).             (8.)
   It may be observed too that (7.) is little, if any, inferior to
(6.) in point of easy application, as it requires a reference to
one table only, while (6.) requires a reference to two.
   Note. Unless the annuity be due, that is, unless a payment
is to be made immediately, none of the preceding formulas
will give ap the value of the annuity on the first life, correctly.
If we suppose, as usual, that the first payment will be made
in a year, the true value of a, will be
      a;=A'=     (1+ })(1-R)-1,        .   .  .   . .    .  . (9.)

III. On the supposed Inversion of Hydrostatical Principles
   which takes place in the casting of Specula for Reflecting Te
   lescopes on a “chilling” base formed of hoop-iron packed
   edgewise. By Professor PottER, A.M."
TH: method of forming the “chilling” base of the mould
       for casting specula with hoop-iron packed edgewise, in
stead of a simple disc of iron, is Lord Rosse's undisputed dis
covery. In his paper in the Philosophical Transactions for
1840, entitled “An account of Experiments on the Reflecting
Telescope. By the Right Honourable Lord Oxmantown,
F.R.S,” he has the following:—“At first a simple disc of iron
was tried, but although the castings were sound, there was
this defect; that bubbles of air were often entangled between
the iron and speculum metal, producing cavities which it was
tedious to grind out: the iron disc was therefore replaced by
one made of pieces of hoop-iron placed side by side, with
their edges up, tightly packed in an iron frame: the edges
were brought to a smooth surface of the proper curve either
by the file or lathe, whichever was the most convenient. A
metallic surface was thus constructed everywhere porous; as
however close the hoop-iron had been packed, the interstices
suffered air to pass freely through. So successful was this
                    * Communicated by the Author.

14      On the casting of Specula for Reflecting Telescopes.
expedient, that of sixteen plates cast for the three-feet spe
culum, not one was defective:” &c.
    If the successful casting of these sixteen plates was due to
the base being of packed hoop-iron in place of a solid disc, it
must be admitted that Lord Rosse's discovery was a great
improvement upon the solid disc; but if the ordinary prin
ciples of hydrostatics show that such an effect could not result,
the cavities which were found on the surface of his first cast
ings upon a solid disc must be referred to some other cause:
such as, that in his first attempts on the “chilling” method,
the melted metal not being sufficiently fluid for that mode of
casting, it did not flow uniformly over the disc, but becoming
solid too quickly, left cavities in some places.
    If the metal retained its fluidity for ever so brief an interval
of time after an air-bubble was entangled between the iron
and melted speculum metal, we can ascertain the nature and
effect of the forces acting on it by the principles of hydrosta
tics. Let AB be the upper surface of the chilling body, bac
                                                           C
                                                        B
a portion of air entangled within the melted metal ABCD.
Now the pressure at different points in a fluid increasing with
the depth, the parts at b and c will be subject to greater pres
sure than those about a ; and hence the bubble of air will in
stantly take the form edf, and ascend as at hgk through the
fluid metal, like air-bubbles in water, by virtue of the property
of fluid pressure, that “the resultant pressure of a fluid, on a
body immersed in it, equals the weight of the fluid displaced, and
acts vertically upwards through the centre of gravity of the fluid
displaced.” It is hence futile to prepare a way for escape
downwards when there is no tendency to escape in that di
rection.
    As fluids in contact, which do not mix, arrange themselves
in descending order according to their greater specific gravi
ties, it is impossible to see how air could place itself below
fluid metal; and we must conclude that the presence of cavi
 ties on the face of his castings indicate that his Lordship's
 metal was then deficient in fluidity, and, flowing unequally
 over the chilling surface, on becoming too quickly solidified,
 contained the cavities which were found.

           On a Property of the Interminable Decimals.          15
   It is perhaps needless to remark that air-holes are left
 through the upper part of the sand of the mould to allow a
free escape of the air upwards, as it is displaced by the metal
 entering by the ingate.               -
   My apology for writing in so much detail on such a subject
is, that I am well-aware the number of amateur telescope
makers in this country is much greater than generally ima
gined; and one who immediately published his discoveries
for the benefit of brother amateurs, ought also to caution
them against useless and unphilosophical methods.
IV. On a property of the Interminable Decimals which arise
  Jrom the development of an Incommensurable Fraction. By
   J. R. YoUNG, late Professor of Mathematics, Belfast".
TH: following curious property of fractional developments
       has, I believe, hitherto escaped notice. I find that, in
at least one interesting inquiry, it is capable of a practical ap
plication, not altogether unworthy of notice: whether or not
it can be turned to useful account in any other direction, I
am not able to say; but I think it deserving of record, as a
remarkable arithmetical theorem, though depending only upon
a very simple principle. Before explaining this principle, it
may be better first to exemplify the property itself, as a thing
ceases to appear remarkable, and often ceases to be valued,
as soon as it is found to be capable of a simple explanation.
   Let an incommensurable fraction be taken at random, say
#   then
              1
                = . 1428.571428.571428.571428, &c.
              7
   It is a property of the development of such a fraction that,
stop wherever we may, a certain number of figures may be
cut off the end, such that if the figures left be all multiplied
by a certain determinable number, all the original figures will
be reproduced, with the exception of a limited number of the
leading figures. In performing the multiplication here men
tioned, account must, as usual, be taken of the carryings from
the figures cut off.
   Cut off one place from the foregoing decimal, and multiply
the whole row, omitting that one, by 3; arranging the result
underneath, so that the like reproduced figures may stand

                        428.571428.571428.57142 8
    Cut off two places, and multiply by 2:
                   • 1428.571428.571428.5714, 28
                       28571428.571428.5714, 28
    Cut off three places, and multiply by 6:

                         8571428.571428.571 428
    In like manner, cut off four places, and multiply by 4; five
places, and multiply by 5; six places, and multiply by 8;
seven places, and multiply by 3; eight places, and multiply
by 9, or by 2; nine places, and multiply by 6. And in all these
cases the decimals will recur as above, to whatever extent the
development be carried.
    Similar circumstances have place for all incommensurable
fractions, the multipliers being different for different fractions.
               1
Thus, take 13'
                 # = 076923076923076923076.
    If two figures be cut off, the proper multiplier will be 9; if
three be cut off, it will be 12; if four be cut off, it will be 3;
if five, 4, &c.
    I proceed to show what I venture to think to be a useful
application of the above property.
    In finding the circumference of a circle from the diameter,
the usual process is to multiply the diameter by the number
3.1416; and, in determining the diameter from the circumfe
rence, to divide by the same number. When the diameter
consists of several figures, the multiplication is rather long;
and there is a proportionate liability to error, especially in the
addition part of the work. And when the circumference is
given, whether it be a large number or a small one, the divi
sion becomes tedious if several decimals are required. For
                               22
rough purposes, the ratio 7 of Archimedes is employed, as
involving simpler operations. I propose here to show how
the rule of Archimedes may be perfected by aid of the above
property.

                    the Interminable Decimals.               17
                           # =3: 1428.5714, 2857 &c.,
 Multiply by 4, and subtract:          125714 2857
               there remains    3.1416
    We have thus got the number employed in the more accu
 rate approximation; so that we have the following easy rule.
    Multiply the diameter by 22, divide the product by 7, cut
 off four figures on the right, multiply the others by 4, place
 the product under the unabridged number, and subtract: the
 remainder will be the circumference.
    Multiply the circumference by 7, divide the product by
 2 x 11, cut off four figures on the right, multiply the others
 by 4, placing the product under the unabridged number, and
 add: the sum will be the diameter.
    Ex. 1. The diameter of a circle is 883220 miles: required
 the circumference.
                              883.220
                                    22
                             1766440
                            1766440
                          "|1943O840
                             2775834° 2857
                                 11 || 0 3337
         Circumference = 2774723. 952 miles.
And this result is the same as we should have got by employ
ing the number 3.1416.
   2. The circumference of a circle is 6850: required the
diameter.
                              6850
                                  7
                           247950
                          11|23975
                              2179°5 45.45
                                     8 7182
                Diameter = 21804 1727
   The foregoing principle is easily explained as follows:–
    If we subtract a single decimal figure from unity, we shall
get a single decimal figure for the remainder; if the subtract
ive decimal be preceded by a cipher, we shall get a single
figure preceded by a 9; if the subtractive decimal have two

                                                                     s
 18            Mr. J. R. Young on a Property of
 ciphers prefixed, the remainder will be a figure preceded by
 two '9s, and so on. Consequently, if unity be divided by any
 number, giving an interminable decimal, as by 7, for instance,
 then if from this unit we take care to subtract such a figure,
 preceded by ciphers or not, as will cause the remainder to be
 accurately divisible by 7, it is plain that the subtractive num
 ber when divided by 7, must furnish the same interminable
 decimals, after a limited number, as those furnished by          #:
 otherwise the difference between the two rows could not be a
 finite number; that is, the remainder mentioned above could
 not be exactly divisible by 7.
    This explanation will no doubt prove sufficient: three figures
                                                            #
 were cut off from the end of the partial development of above,
 and the other figures multiplied by 6, because 1--006="994,

    But an explanation yet more simple readily offers itself.
    -        •                  .    1               •          •
 Still reverting to the fraction 5, we see that, in prosecuting
the division, the first remainder that we get is 3; therefore
                           1.7 -

remainder carried from the nth figure of the development,

lopment, diminished by multiplied by that remainder, must
leave a result consisting only of the n first figures of the deve
lopment. Hence the number n of figures to be cut off being

                     the Interminable Decimals.               19
 given, the proper multiplier is at once found by observing
 what is carried from the nth figure of the development; and
 it is plain that what is thus carried may be increased by any
 multiple of the divisor. And nothing further in the way of
 explanation can be required.
    A word or two is however necessary, in reference to the
 foregoing rule, for finding the diameter of a circle from its
 circumference. By the rule, the expression for the diameter
 from the circumference, c, is
                           7
                          # (1+.0004)c.
    But the true formula, or rather that which replaces the use
 of 3.1416, is
                     7        _ 7...   I + 0004
              22(1--0004)° 22' 1-00000016°.
 So that in the work of the second example above, the divisor
 1-'00000016 has been regarded as unit; an error which
 cannot affect the first six places of figures, and which can
 affect the seventh only by a unit; for
               1+.0004        (1 + 0004)(1 +:00000016)
            1- "00000016 T      1–'0000000000000256
 And this error is of no practical importance, in reference at
 least to a comparison between the new and the old rules; for
 the seventh figure will always be erroneous, even when 3.1416
 is employed, the result can be correct only to the sixth place
 in the most favourable circumstances.
    I would here further add, as arithmetical facility, in calcu
lations of very frequent occurrence in practice, is my more
especial object of consideration in the present paper, that the
result of any multiplication by 3.1416 may with but little
trouble be converted into what the more accurate multiplier
3.141593 would have produced. For since
                               3•14 16
               diminished by 3.141593
                           is    "000007
it follows that if we only push the number multiplied by 3.1416
six places back, multiply it so depressed by 7, and subtract
the result from the product furnished by 3.1416, we shall get
the same figures as the more correct multiplier above would
have produced. For instance, from the circumference deter
mined above, namely,
                                  2774723.9520
                        subtract         6-182540
              and we shall have 2774717-76.9460

the subtractive number being seven times the proposed dia
meter pushed six places to the right. And similar facilities
may be introduced, in connexion with long multiplications,
whenever the penultimate figure in the multiplier is a 9. I
have only one other remark to make in reference to these
simple matters. Should any one count the number of figures
                                                                     w
employed in the first example above, and compare the amount
with the number of figures engaged in the common process,
no saving will appear to have been effected; but that time is
saved, and the risk of error diminished, by the more simple
character of the operation proposed, cannot, I think, be ques
tioned.
   But figures may be saved. The above way of employing
the multiplier   #.  is not the best way: the best way is that
which follows, namely,
                               883220

                              2774723.952
   I need scarcely say, in conclusion, that the above principles,
applied to the multiplier 3.1416, are in the same way appli
cable to 7854, the fourth part of that multiplier: this may
be replaced by the more simple multiplier         :      the above
explained correction being introduced.
   The readers of this Journal will perhaps pardon me for
obtruding upon their attention matters of so truly elementary
a character. The composition of the paper has, for a few
hours, relieved my mind from the pressure of a most painful
and a most unmerited calamity; and as it is very probable that
I shall not encumber these pages again for a long time, I crave
their indulgence on the ground just stated.

Rammelsberg procured from M. Krantz of Berlin, were found
to agree pretty well with the statements of Professor Shephard,

those described by Shephard. When heated alone the mi

platinum forceps it fuses with difficulty at the edges into a black
mass; the borax bead is yellow in the outer flame, and be
comes colourless on cooling, unless a very large quantity of
the mineral has been dissolved; in the inner flame it appears
green after treatment with tin. It likewise gives a yellow glass
with microcosmic salt in the outer flame, which becomes colour
less still more readily; treated with tin on charcoal in the inner
flame, it at last becomes distinctly violet. The finely pulverized
mineral is but imperfectly decomposed by hydrochloric acid.

                CHLORITE.      B.Y. M. RAMMELSBERG.
               [Poggendorff’s Annalen, vol. lxxvii. p. 414.]
   According to Rammelsberg, two minerals, Leuchtenbergite
and Pennine, certainly belong to chlorite, and should not be
separated from it by distinct names. A review of the various
analyses which Rammelsberg has corrected and rendered
more complete, has led him to the following conclusions re
specting the Chlorites:—Certain varieties of Chlorites occur,
which are characterized by containing about 30 per cent. of
acid, and by a lesser amount of iron, such for instance are the
Chlorites of Achmatowsk, from Schwarzenstein in Zillerthal,
from Mauléon in the Pyrenees, from the river Balschoi Ire
mel, and from the Schischminskian Mountains near Slatoust;
further, from Zermatt in the Matterthal Canton Vaux; and
these two latter have been incorrectly distinguished as Leuch
tenbergite and Pennine”. The relation of the oxygen to the
magnesia or (FeO) of the alumina, or (Fe° O”) of the silica
and of the water, is for all more or less nearly as 5 : 3: 6:4,
and the formula thence deducible is
        (3RO+ SiO2+R2 O'SiO2+2HO)+2MgO, HO.
    It is however highly probable with respect to the other va
rieties, on account of the difficulty in determining the relative
 quantities of protoxide and peroxide of iron, that the above
relation=3:2:4: 3. To the variety corresponding to this
atomic proportion, Rammelsberg gives the name of Chlorite.
Its formula is consequently                               -
            3(3RO+ SiO4)+(2R*O3 + SiO4)+9HO.
    Ripidolite, 3(3RO + SiO4)+(3R* O*-i-SiO4)+9HO, is the
name which Rammelsberg assigns to the series of modifica
 tions which occur at St. Gothard, in the valley Rauris of the
 Pinzgau, at the Greiner in the Zillerthal, at St. Christoph,
 and at Mont des Sept Lacs in Savoy; they are characterized
 by a less amount of acid (26–27 per cent.), a less amount of
 magnesia, and a larger amount of iron, and appear all to pos
 sess the following relations as regards the oxygen, 3: 3: 4:3.
    According to this therefore the Chlorites contain one-third
 less alumina than the Ripidolites, the quantities of the other
 elements remaining the same. Both series however are so alike
 in their properties, that if we suppose alumina to replace
 silicic acid in the Chlorites in the atomic proportion of 1:1,
 and in the Ripidolites of 3:2, a common expression is ob
 tained for the two minerals, both then becoming hydrated
 bisilicates (aluminates).

    Under this name Breithaupt describes a mineral from the

a blue pigment. It has a metallic lustre, and is of a dark tin
white colour. Streak black; hardness 7; brittle; spec. grav.

slate, accompanied by heavy Glanzcobalt (Cobaltine, Cobalt
glanz), and other minerals. According to Plattner, this mineral
£       exactly the same reactions before the blowpipe as Co
  altine, and an analysis made by that chemist shows that
 Glaukodote contains the same per-centage of sulphur as the
 Cobaltine from Skutterrud, according to Stromeyer; the sum
of the quantities of cobalt and iron in the two minerals like
wise agree, but the atoms Fe, Co, S, As are in Glaukodote as
2 : 4: 6: 6, leading to the formula 2(CoS*+ CoAs”)+(FeS2

 he formerly described by that of Kausimkies; it has hitherto
 occurred but in small quantity in the Kurprinz Friederic
 August mine at Grosschirma, near Freiberg, always upon
 copper pyrites, accompanied by iron pyrites, spathic iron,
 horn-stone, quartz, &c.; also at the Sauschwart mine near
 Schneeberg, and likewise at Coak's Kitchen in Cornwall; also
 upon copper pyrites. It has a brilliant metallic lustre, is of a
 tin-white colour, sometimes variegated, and sometimes with a
 greenish iridescence. Streak          £      differing in fact in nothing

      ARKANSITE AND BROOKITE.               B.Y. M. RAMMELSBERG.
                [Poggendorff’s Annalen, vol. lxxvii. p. 586.]
   According to the researches of Rammelsberg, Arkansite is
only a variety of Brookite. Arkansite was discovered by Powell
at Magnet Cove, Hot Springs, County Arkansas, and de
scribed and named by Shephard. According to him, this mi
neral, when heated in a glass tube, furnishes neither moisture
nor hydrofluoric acid; it is not changed before the blowpipe,
and gives a dark yellowglass with borax. When boiled with sul
phuric acid, it is converted into a yellowish-green mass, which

26                      Mineralogical Notices.
gives the reactions of titanic acid, whilst from the sulphuric so
lution (which gave a precipitate with sulphate of potash soluble
in an excess of the precipitant) yttria was obtained, in which
there might still possibly be zirconia and thorina. Arkansite
fuses with bisulphate of potash, according to Shephard, to a
£           mass, which, on ebullition with water, deposits a
  eavy white precipitate; he found 67 per cent of titanic acid,
and concluded from his experiments that the mineral was
titanate of yttria.
    Subsequently Shephard asserted the metallic acid to be
niobic acid, and gave as his opinion that the mineral was
niobate of yttria and thorina. He found the specific gravity
to be 3-854.
    Rammelsberg has recently examined this mineral; he found
the spec. grav, to be 3'892, 3.923, 3-949. 1:7205 grm. lost
on ignition 0.0045. After fusing the residue with bisulphate
of soda, the mass readily dissolved in water at a gentle heat,
the mineral consequently contains no tantalic, niobic or pelopic
acid. The solution mixed with some sulphuric acid deposited
on boiling 1:49 of a white powder, which proved to be pure
titanic acid, both before the blowpipe as well as on being
mixed with sugar and carbonized, and then heated in a cur
rent of chlorine. Ammonia precipitated from the filtered so
lution 0.217 of a white gelatinous substance, which also proved
 to be pure titanic acid on being tested in the same manner.
 By treating the precipitates with hydrofluoric acid, the mineral
 was found to be free from silica; on treating them with chlo
rine, there was no production of the difficultly volatile chlo
 rides of yttrium, thorium, and zirconium.
    On igniting a quantity of the separated titanic acid with
carbonate of soda, 100 parts expelled 50:52 parts of carbonic
acid. Now, since titanic acid contains, according to the expe
riments of Pierre, 38.86 per cent. of oxygen, and according to
those of H. Rose 39:71, 1 atom of titanic acid expels 1 atom
 of carbonic acid. The error amounts only to 0.005 carbonic
acid, which is trifling considering the small quantity employed.
    In this treatment alone 94 per cent of the weight of the
 Arkansite had been obtained of pure titanic acid; there re
mained 0.06 grm, in which nothing else could be detected
with certainty.
    Rammelsberg then observes, in opposition to an earlier
statement of Breithaupt, that the crystalline form of Arkansite
is identical with that of Brookite”, although the secondary

 when he supposes them as little advanced as at the period
 of Father Mersennus, and in spite of their well-founded belief
      * From the Annales de Chimie et de Physique for October 1849.

 28            M. J. Antoine on the Multiple Sounds
 that they have long since possessed an exact, simple and direct
 theory of multiple sounds.                       -
    I regret that M. Duhamel has thought proper to be very
 brief in transcribing the state of science. It is with fear that
 I undertake to be his substitute in a delicate matter, which he
 has studied for many years; nevertheless, I shall venture to
 give an historical sketch, in order better to appreciate the
 present position of the question.
    The phaenomenon of multiple sounds has been known for a
 very long time, for Aristotle asks by what reason the grave
 sounds contain also sharper sounds. Mersennus however
 was the first physicist who submitted this to experimental
 analysis.
    This ingenious observer classed the different higher sounds
 which accompany the fundamental note of a string, and found
 the same series for strings of different materials, tension and
 dimensions. The supplementary sounds which he could di
 stinguish, placing himself in favourable circumstances, are
 the octave, the twelfth, the fifteenth, the major seventeenth,
 the nineteenth and the twenty-second. When accustomed to
 these experiments, it is easy to prolong the series beyond
 these limits.   Mersennus classed also the tones which com
 pose the multiple sounds of bells, as those, more curious still,
which proceed sometimes simultaneously from the pipes of an
Ol'Oran.
   # seeking the cause of this multiplicity of sounds, Mersennus
made an experiment which might have led him to discover it;
but the sagacity of his spirit was baffled, and the truth escaped
him. He examined the vibrations of a long string, and see
ing no division established, he concluded that strings do not
divide to produce the simultaneous harmonics, and he there
fore sought the explanation of the phaenomenon in the wrong
quarter.
   The theory of multiple sounds did not make progress until
experimental analysis had disclosed the cause of this multitude
of sounds which may be separately drawn from one and the
same sonorous body. It had been long known that a con
siderable series of successive sounds could be produced from
the trumpet; Mersennus made the exact classification of them,
and compared it to that of the different sounds which one pipe
of an organ can give; but he could not discover the cause.
The difficulty was great; and it was first solved, not upon
aérial columns, but upon vibrating strings.
   In 1673, William Noble and Thomas Pigot made that beau
tiful experiment, in which small pieces of paper, placed astride
upon a string, are seen to remain immoveable in certain

                 produced by Vibrating Bodies.                  29
positions, whilst beyond they are often projected from the
string. Wallis considered the fact so curious and so novel,
that he gave it a place in his Treatise on Algebra. It resulted
clearly from the experiments of Noble and Pigot, that the
same string can separately produce the different harmonics
of the fundamental tone, and that, for this, it divides itself into
aliquot parts which vibrate alternately in a contrary direction,
remaining separated by immoveable points or nodes.
   The cause of the phaenomenon being thus clearly charac
terized in the particular case of vibrating strings, it remained
to generalize it. Daniel Bernouilli by ingenious experiments
treated the case, perhaps the most difficult, of wind-instru
ments, and finally experiment reached by degrees all pos
sible cases, so that it is proved that a sonorous body can pro
duce a considerable series of very different sounds, and that
for each of them it divides into a corresponding system of
vibrating parts and nodal surfaces.
   It would perhaps be proper now to examine the connexion
which exists between multiple sounds and the cause of the
different sounds which bodies can give successively. How
ever, to suit my purpose, I shall first say a few words on the
processes which physicists have devised for drawing a varied
succession of isolated sounds from the same sonorous body.
I shall limit myself to the case of vibrating strings, the only
one which has presented notable difficulties.
   When Noble and Pigot made their capital experiment,
only a single regular means was known of making a string pro
duce its harmonics successively. It was not touched, it was not
directly vibrated with the bow, but the harmonic which it was
desired to raise was sounded at a distance, and instantly the
string began to vibrate, to form its nodes and produce the
harmonic. This communication of movement by the air and
the supports of the string, or, as was then said, this com
munication of sounds by sympathy, had been discovered by
Fracaster. Mersennus had made the experimental analysis
of it with care, and had found that the sounds most apt to
excite by sympathy the vibrations of a string form the differ
ent harmonics of the fundamental tone; he had also remarked
that the fifth, the fourth, the major third and other conso
nances, produce also feeble vibrations, when the string is per
fect, long, and stretched on a suitable instrument. The fol
lowing case is perhaps not wholly unworthy to be mentioned.
Two strings are stretched on a sonometer, and they are set
so near to unison as to give beats when they vibrate si
multaneously. Then if one of them be made to vibrate di
rectly, the string which has not been touched experiences very

30            M. J. Antoine on the Multiple Sounds
perceptible vibrations; and further, it causes beats to be
heard. This experiment shows the imperfection of one of
the processes which are indicated for tuning instruments.
   In order to produce from a string the series of its har
monics in succession, Sauveur afterwards devised a second
method, more convenient, and more effective than the first.
As in the old process the string was not touched, the har
monic which it was desired to excite was sounded by the side,
but he produced this first generating sound by vibrating the
prolongation itself of the cord. The harmonics obtained in
this manner are in some degree indefinite; the higher ones
are not, it is true, so well characterized as the lower. Never
theless, with a string one metre in length, Sauveur distin
guished clearly thirty-two harmonics, and could hear more
than a hundred and twenty-eight. Sauveur's method is, in
this respect, much superior to the old process.
   Sauveur did not seek whether it is possible to establish the
subdivisions of the string, by vibrating it directly with the
bow. This may however be attained, although the execution
presents difficulties. If the bow is moved on the middle of the
string, avoiding to impart the movement of totality which gives
rise to the fundamental tone, we have at first only a harsh and
very disagreeable grating sound. This fact, related by Wallis
as known before him, is produced, as Wallis has remarked,
when the bow is drawn on one of the points of the string
which correspond to its division into aliquot parts, with this
circumstance however, that the sound becomes less and less
disagreeable, in proportion as the divisions are more nu
Inerous.
   It must not however be imagined that the phaenomenon
mentioned by Wallis is constantly verified. For, on passing
the bow on the middle of the string and modifying its ve
locity and its pressure, a sharp sound of great purity is in the
end obtained, after some essays. When this sound is full, it is
easy to sustain it as long as is desired, even whilst increasing
considerably the pressure of the bow. By this means the un
even harmonics may be drawn from a string.
   It is easy to distinguish in these experiments the formation
of the nodes and their position. If the string gives, for ex
ample, the nineteenth harmonic, when observing it in broad
daylight, it looks as if formed of nineteen equal spindles, placed
one after another. The points where these spindles unite
appear immoveable; if they are lightly touched with the fin
ger, the sound which the bow maintains is not changed, and
the string is not felt to tremble. If, on the contrary, one of the
spindles is touched at a proper distance from their extremities,

                  produced by Vibrating Bodies.               31
the trembling of the string is felt and the sound is no longer
obtained.
    We may thus prove the existence of the nineteen vibrating
parts, by passing the bow successively on each of them; by
this manoeuvre the sound will not be changed. If the bow
approaches too near one of the nodes, the harmonic produced
instantly disappears, and the fundamental generally supplies
its place.
    If it is desired to ascertain the position of the nodes, by
means of light bodies placed astride upon the string, circles
of paper must be used strung through the middle, or better
still, a wire ring, in order that if the bow does not succeed
at the first stroke in producing an harmonic, the light bodies
may not be thrown off from the string.
   The uneven divisions are not the only ones which may be pro
duced by vibrating the string directly with the bow. The even
divisions are obtained by drawing the bow skilfully at a pro
per distance from the nodes which it is wished to form. The
success of the experiment will be rendered easy by touching
an instant only one of the nodes.
    The method which I have just pointed out may also serve
to bring out with force, or to silence certain sounds in the
concert of the harmonics which ordinarily accompany the fun
damental tone.
    After this perhaps too long digression, I revert to the prin
cipal question. When the cause of the successive sounds which
a body can give had been proved by experiment, the expla
nation of multiple sounds very naturally followed,—the expla
nation of which so greatly puzzled Father Mersennus. It is
easy, in fact, to conceive that when different modes of vibra
tions, capable of existing isolatedly in a body, are produced
in it together, each of them gives out the sound which corre
sponds to it.     M. Biot has developed this theory with ele
gance; it has since been reproduced in the works of physi
cists.   I know not for what reasons M. Duhamel has not even
mentioned it.
   The exactitude of the commonly admitted theory on mul
tiple sounds, is confirmed and in some sort submitted to the
eye, in the phaenomenon of multiple strings and rods, which
is perceived when they are made to yield different sounds
simultaneously. To appreciate what there is completely de
monstrative in this phaenomenon, it is sufficient to bring at
tention to the facts.
   When a rod AB, fig. 1, fixed in A, vibrates on each side
its position of equilibrium AB between the extreme posi
tions AC, AD, in a breadth which exceeds its thickness,

32             M. J. Antoine on the Multiple Sounds
two images of the rod are seen perfectly traced and as it were
immoveable in the positions AC, AD. The rod passes very
rapidly each intermediate position, and reaches Fig. 1.
the extreme positions AC, AD, with velocities C B D
which are annulled and then increase again by
imperceptible degrees. The images produced
on the retina by the rod, when it is in the positions
near the minima of velocity, where it remains al
most immoveable for a comparatively long time,
must be more vivid than in the other positions;
thence the appearance observed. The two clearly
visible images of the rod also approach by degrees,
in proportion as the magnitude of the vibrations
diminishes.                                                  A.
   If the rod possesses at last a vibratory movement and a
motion of translation, instead of two images, a very consider
able number will be perceptible at regular distances over the
whole extent that the movement of translation causes the rod
to pass. Thus, if a knife be held in the middle, and one of
its ends be struck on a fixed obstacle, leaving the knife free
to rebound and vibrate, there will be perceived ten, twenty,
thirty knives regularly distributed in front of the obstacle. If
an object be struck with a bow, several images of the bow will
be seen, each presenting a perfect and very distinct design of
all the parts of the bow.                  Fig. 2

                   produced by Vibrating Bodies.                     33
     Vibrating strings present analogous phaenomena.
     Let us suppose that the string vibrated produces the funda
  mental tone with energy, and gives the harmonics only in a
  slightly perceptible manner. Two very distinct images are then
  seen in the extreme positions Am B,              Fig. 3
  Am'B, fig. 3; these images are vi-                 ig. 3.

 positions.
     If the bow is drawn so as only to give the octave of the
 fundamental sound, two equal spindles are seen placed one
 after the other, and each one giving two images of the string in
 the positions where the velocity is annulled, as in AnM, An'M,

 pearances are the immediate con-                Fig. 4.

  string into two distinct parts      A-E--->"
 which vibrate separately.
     If the fundamental tone be drawn from the string and at the
 same time its octave, so that these two sounds are very power
 ful in comparison with the other harmonics, which we will
 suppose to be very weak, four images of the string are then
 seen arranged as indicated in the figure. According to the
 explanation commonly admitted of multiple sounds, whilst the
 whole string vibrates, its two halves themselves vibrate, taking
 contrary curves. Hence it follows, that when the string quits
 the position AB, fig. 5, to take               Fi
the direction toward the curve                    ig. 5.
 AaCbB,the firsthalf of thestring A++=
 AC will present its concavity,           only      H       A:
for example, at AB, and the se-                                  • -
cond half, CB, its convexity. During this transfer, the velocities
of the different points of the string will tend to disappear
successively: the curve AaCbB is the spot which the different
points of the string attain when their velocity becomes null.
    After curving, as we have pointed out, the string will assume
opposite curves, and will then return in the direction         of the
primitive curves, and so on. During these variations of form,
the points of the string will pass from the position AaChB to
the position AeCfB, where their velocity will be successively
annulled, then to the position AgBMB, where the velocities
are still null, then to the position Am Hn B, where these velo:
cities become null for the fourth time; and lastly, they will
return to the position AaCbB, where the velocities were first

 annulled, and where they will become null again successively
  for each point, if the decrease in amplitude of the vibrations
  is neglected.
     From these considerations it follows, that during the com
 plete vibration of the string, four distinct loci are formed in
 which the points of the string arrive successively without ve
 locity, after having traversed the intermediate positions with a
 greater or less rapidity. Thence results the appearance of
 four distinct strings, curved as the lines of the figure indicate,
 and consequently the explanation of the optical phaenomenon
 which is observed. It follows from these same considerations,
 that during an entire oscillation, the string strikes the air four
 different times, in passing from AaCl, B to AeCfB, from this
 last position to Ag HkB, then to the position Am HnB, and
 lastly, to the first position AaCbB. These four shocks are
 not identical: in the first and the third, the two halves of the
 string strike the air in a contrary direction, whilst in the second
 and the fourth, the string strikes the air in the same direction at
 all the points, nearly as if it moved without being divided.
 Thence it results that in the series of shocks which the tym
 panum of the ear receives, at each second shock the impres
 sion made on us must have something distinctive, and the
 periodical return of this phaenomenon brings the simultaneous
 sensation of two sounds, the one the octave to the other. This
 is precisely the fact which observation indicates and which
 had to be explained.
     All the preceding observations may be confirmed by com
 pleting in the following manner the experiment which we
 have just described.
    If, by a suitable management of the bow, the octave of the
fundamental tone is weakened, the spindles AaCe, Cb Bf,
 AgHm, HkBn will diminish in width, and will end in being
imperceptible, when the octave has become very weak.
    If, on the contrary, you weaken the fundamental sound,
the spindles will persist, but the parts C and H will approach,
will tend towards being confounded, and will in fact be so,
when the fundamental sound is silenced.
    The form of the curves will be easily determined upon
which the different points of the string arrive successively with
out velocity, and the duration of the motion of each point in
passing from one curve to the other, by aid of the formula

                  produced by Vibrating Bodies.                 35
    In order to demonstrate the effects of the combination of
two vibratory movements on a body, we have only to produce
movements sufficiently slow to enable us to follow readily their
different phases. We shall easily obtain this result by the aid
of a long vibrating rod, by striking this rod in a suitable man
ner during its vibrations of totality, so as to produce a double
vibratory movement. This experiment is not without in
terest.
    I shall not pursue further the analysis of these different
phaenomena, nor shall I speak of the curious appearances
presented by a vibrating string when left to itself. What I have
developed suffices to render perceptible to the eyes the expla
nation of simultaneous harmonic sounds, as deduced from the
fundamental experiments of Pigot, Noble and Sauveur.
    Let us now examine the explanation of multiple sounds pro
posed by M. Duhamel. In this examination, we shall con
sider more specially vibrating strings, as offering the most
elegant and interesting example of multiple sounds. To
abridge and profit by the details on which we have already
entered, we will suppose that the string gives simultaneously
the fundamental tone and its octave.
    In the first part of his memoir, M. Duhamel establishes
this proposition: “When a body is made to vibrate by seve
ral causes which separately would produce the simple sounds
which it can give, its surface generally divides itself into a cer
tain finite number of parts, in each of which the vibrations
have unequal durations. These different durations have re
lation to sounds corresponding to the different causes, and we
are in the same position as if we had several separate surfaces,
each having a particular movement of vibration.”
    In the vibrating string which gives the fundamental tone and
its octave, the middle is the only point the vibrations of which
differ in duration from those of the other points; I do not
 find here two finite portions of string in each of which the vi
 brations have unequal durations. Perhaps it will be said that
 one of the two finite portions is reduced to a point or to the
 contour of the middle of the string, but then the proposition
 would not be new with regard to strings. Still, however, this
 interpretation does not appear to me admissible, for, accord
 ing to the proposition, we must be in the same case as if we
 had several separate surfaces, each having a particular move
 ment of vibration; thence the fundamental tone would be solely
 attributable to the vibrations of the middle of the string, that
 is to say, of a single point; they would therefore be insensible
 with relation to the vibrations which give the octave. . It is
 known that the fundamental tone may be very powerful, and
                                D 2

36            M. J. Antoine on the Multiple Sounds
we have seen in the ordinary theory of sounds that the string
produces this tone by striking the air at all its points.
    M. Duhamel, whilst reproducing the preceding proposition
in the same memoir, changes its sense very materially, when he
says that each of the sounds exists in one or more finite parts
of the surface, and appears to be perceptible there only. The
isolation of each sound is therefore not absolute, but approxi
mative; with this interpretation, the proposition of M. Du
hamel allows of the string producing the fundamental tone by
striking the surrounding air at all its points: only, the energy
of the shocks will vary throughout the extent of the string, and
may be very great in one finite part of the string, with reference
to other parts. In this sense, the proposition would have little
novelty.
    In the second part of his memoir, M. Duhamel becomes
 more explicit; he abandons entirely the absolute sense of the
 first form of his proposition, that is to say, that which would
 be a real novelty, and admits, what is far from being anything
 new, that, during the multiple sounds of a body, there are
 portions of the surface which seem to give only one sound,
 although however we may be sure that they give out several
 others. In the case of the vibrating string, that is as much as
 to say, if I am not mistaken, that the middle of the string does
 not contribute directly to the production of the octave, and
 that the parts adjoining this middle contribute to it only in a
 scarcely perceptible manner, which is evident.
     In the second part of his memoir, M. Duhamel adopts fully
 the received ideas on the multiple sound of bodies, but he
 presents them under a form which is peculiar to himself, and
 which we proceed to examine.
     He admits, as every one does, that when a string produces
 the fundamental tone and its octave, its vibratory movement
 is composed of the two movements which correspond to the
 separate production of these two sounds; he does not seek to
 prove experimentally that it is so, but he shows that if the
  movement of the string is compounded as we have just said,
 there must result from it the simultaneous sensation of the
 fundamental sound and its octave.
     In the common theory of multiple sounds, this consequence
 is in some sort immediate. When the entire string makes a
 vibration, its two halves which vibrate at the same time make
 two, and thence it follows that it strikes the air four times
 during a complete vibration; but the shocks are not identical,
 they only resemble one another alternately two to two; the ear
 is sensible to this periodical return of such shocks, and thence
 the origin of the compound sensation which is perceived.

                 produced by Vibrating Bodies.                37
   M. Duhamel does not consider directly the shocks as they
take place in reality, but he substitutes for them an equivalen
system; instead of the string affected by the compound movet
ment, he substitutes two identical strings placed close to each
other, each executing simple vibrations which are an octave
from each other. It is certain that the movement imparted to
the air, whether by the single string, or by the two equivalent
strings united, is very perceptibly the same, and our organ
must be affected in the same manner in the two cases; now,
it is known that two adjacent strings, one of which vibrates
the octave of the other, cause the two sounds to be heard
simultaneously; they must therefore be thus heard by virtue
of the equivalent vibrations of the single string.
   If I have rightly seized the point of view which M. Duhamel
has taken, it appears from the preceding developments, that
M. Duhamel, with all the physicists of the present day, finds
the origin of multiple sounds in the manner in which the vi
bratory movement of bodies is composed. To establish this
dependence, physicists consider directly the different shocks
really imparted to the air, whilst M. Duhamel substitutes for
the body vibrating with a compound movement, an equivalent
system of simple movements, the impression of which on our
organs is well known.
   The common theory of multiple sounds is more direct than
that of M. Duhamel, since in it we regard phaenomena as they
are really produced; it is also more elementary, and conse
quently more simple, as it does not require us to have recourse
to propositions, one of which at least is not within the reach
of every one. For these two reasons, the ordinary theory ap
pears to us preferable in general; nevertheless, in certain
complicated cases, we think that the mode of demonstration
proposed by M. Duhamel may have the advantage.
   Whichever of the two theories be adopted, one difficulty
relative to the multiple sounds of bodies remains entirely to
be solved. This difficulty arises from our not having as yet
been able to submit to analysis the true theory of the bow.
   The bow produces four principal effects. It sustains the
equality of the sounds as long as is wished; it sustains also
those feeble sounds which appear to die away under the
fingers of the artist, whilst the sounds given by the strings,
 when pinched, are at first powerful, then soon become weak
ened, and are very quickly lost. The bow admits of giving
 to sounds different degrees of strength; it serves to impart
 to them particular qualities by appropriately awakening the
 harmonics; and lastly, it can bring out separately the different
 harmonics from a string. By these effects, the bow is the
 supreme master of sounds.

38            M. J. Antoine on the Multiple Sounds
   The bow acts thus by a series of slight impulses which it im
parts to the string. These shocks, being continually renewed,
keep up the movement which tends to become weaker; be
coming slighter or more energetic, they change the ampli
tude of the vibrations, and consequently the strength of the
sounds; by being applied to the different parts of the string,
in suitable conditions, they are able to determine various
modes of vibrations which give rise to the separate or simul
taneous harmonics.
   The impulses which the bow can impart are renewed with
such great rapidity, that we cannot be assured of their existence
 when looking at the string. However, if the pressure of the
 bow is considerable and the velocity very moderate, the sounds
produced present the same characters as if they were attri
butable to a series of shocks. Moreover a series of jerks
may then be seen, which render manifest to the eye the dif
ferent shocks of the bow. The experiment takes a new cha
racter of evidence when the tension of the string is very weak
or the vibrations are slow.
   When the experiment is performed which has just been
indicated, and the jerks of the string are very perceptible, in
dependent of the fundamental tone of the string, two supple
mentary sounds are heard which are the fundamental tones of
the two portions of the string separated by the bow.
   If the pressure of the bow be gradually diminished and its
velocity increased, the jerks become more rapid, more dif
ficult to observe, at the same time that the two supplementary
sounds are weakened; as long as the supplementary sounds
continue, they are as it were proofs of the shocks produced by
the bow. Lastly, the jerks cease to be perceptible, and yet
the two supplementary sounds are still heard, feebly it is true,
but still perceptible enough to be distinguished, with a little
attention. Thus the friction of the bow produces a succession
of shocks, the origin of all the effects of this instrument.
   It is not necessary to imagine that these shocks must be re
newed in a regular manner in order to sustain the sound, for
the sound of a string may be sustained by striking it gently
with the finger and rapidly renewing the shocks almost in an
arbitrary manner. The only difference that is remarked in
the sounds sustained by the bow or by a rapid succession of
shocks effected by pinching the string with the finger, is refer
able only to the delicacy and the lightness of the shocks of
the bow.
   The existence of the supplementary sounds, incontestable
proofs of the shocks of the bow, is very clear and very decided,
when the rapidity of the bow does not exceed certain limits.
In the case where the bow moves in the ordinary way, the

                 produced by Vibrating Bodies.                39
supplementary sounds become so feeble, that the perception
of these sounds might be attributed to a preconceived illusion
of the mind, although analogy then lends its aid to the con
clusions. Nevertheless, if any doubt still remained, it would
 be easy to remove it by the following observations.
   When the bow causes a string to sound, its hairs execute
transversal vibrations. To prove this, it suffices to pass a
simple wire ring around the hairs: whilst the bow moves
on the sonorous string, the wire ring, by its movements, ren
ders the vibrations of the hairs evident.
   The vibrations rendered perceptible by the wire ring are
very remarkable when the bow is reduced to a single hair, and
especially when the place of the hairs is supplied by a sono
 rous cord, rubbed with resin.
   Ordinarily the tension given to the hairs of the bow is such,
that the sound rendered by each hair, vibrating separately, is
very grave with reference to the sound which the bow should
draw from a string; whatever tension is given to the hairs of
the bow or to the bodies which supply their place, the trans
versal vibrations are always established and are constantly
rendered evident by the experiment, so that the shocks of the
vibrating string against the hairs, and consequently the shocks
of the hairs against the string, are incontestable.
   It would be difficult to say a priori what influence the vi
brations of the bow have on the clearness of the vibrations of
the string, and consequently on the purity of the sounds pro
duced. This influence is probably not to be neglected. It is
known that a double-base, a tenor, or a violin bow can
not be employed indifferently for an instrument; it is also
known that artists bestow great care in the choice which they
make among bows of the same kind, and that they adopt cer
tain tensions for the hairs. It would be interesting to sub
mit the properties of bows to experimental analysis, and per
haps some result useful to practical music might be found.
When the tension of the bow is such, that the sound of each
hair has for octave of higher or lower order the sound of the
vibrating string, or one of its consonances, would the sound
produced be finer than under other conditions?
   The analytical solution of the problem of vibrating strings
is remarkably beautiful, and yet it is incomplete. To explain
the effects produced, it is not enough, in practice, to recur,
as is done in analysis, to very various primitive states. Ordi
narily the initial state is the state of equilibrium under the
influence of the tension of the string, and yet what variety of
effects does the bow produce
   Ordinary analysis does not even suffice in the very simple
                            -

case in which the string is pinched. The initial figure and the
primitive velocities are not arbitrarily given; they depend on
the shock, and can be known only when the shock is exactly
known.
   The difficulty presented by the analytical theory of the bow,
and even of the isolated shocks produced by pinching a string,
is in fact that general and hitherto insurmountable difficulty,
of subjecting the phaenomenon of the shock to an exact ana
lysis. It is known that only one very particular case of this
phaenomenon has been able to be approached, that only which
Poisson has developed.
   M. Duhamel does not consider the action of the bow under
the point of view which has just been indicated. He regards
the friction of the bow as equivalent, not to a series of shocks,
but to a system of constant forces. A centre of attraction
placed beside the string, far enough off for the displacements
to be comparatively imperceptible, might therefore, according
to this view, be a substitute for the bow.   This seems at first
sight scarcely probable. Be it as it may, if the new theory be
exact, it should explain all the effects of the bow, and more
over its consequences should agree with the results of experi
ment.
   M. Duhamel cites an experiment of verification, from which
he has found that a circular bow, or rather a friction-wheel
acting upon a stretched string, causes it to deviate from
its position of equilibrium, and brings it in a very short time
to a new position of equilibrium in which the friction main
tains it, without the string continuing to produce a sound.
This fact, the result of M. Duhamel's theory and experiments,
may be regarded as negative with relation to this very posi
tive fact, that hurdy-gurdy players sustain the sound of a
string for whole hours, if desired. If M. Duhamel has obtained
a negative result, this is caused probably by his not having
placed the wheel in the conditions in which it acts in the
manner of the bow.
   In fine, it is not easy to see how M. Duhamel's theory
accounts for the four principal effects of the bow, and how it
has reference to the vibrations which the hairs of the bow con
stantly execute when they are passed over a sonorous string.

Relation des Bapériences pour déterminer les principales lois phy
    siques, et les données numériques qui entrent dans le Calcul des
   Machines a Vapeur. By M. REGNAULT*. 1 vol. of 800 pp.4to,
   with a folio volume of plates.
     CIENCE, like literature and the arts, has now and then its
      works of luxury. We have a proof of it in the publication which
is the subject of this article; it is indeed one of the most splendid
that has ever enriched science. We shall not pause at the beauty of
the typographic execution, although the perfection of the plates, the
great scale on which they are done, are rarely met with in works of
this kind. But here the luxury lies in the very substance of the
work, in the number, the precision and the details of the experiments,
in the variety and perfection of the apparatus, and in the richness of
the results.
    The aim with which M. Regnault began his researches, was the
determination of the principal physical laws and the numerical data,
 which enter into the calculation of steam-engines. Hitherto the
 theoretical calculation of these machines has been constantly based
 upon laws which could only be considered as hypotheses; but me
 chanicians have long asked for a general work which should establish
 these fundamental laws upon a series of direct experiments, executed
 with the means of precision which the physical sciences now offer us.
 The French government having conceived the happy and noble idea
 of executing this work, placed the necessary funds at the disposal of
 M. Regnault; this distinguished physicist has profited by it to raise
 to science, one of those monuments which are durable in proportion
 as the foundation on which they rest is more solid, and the style is
 more severe and simple. That is to say, that M. Regnault deter
 mined to penetrate to the bottom of his subject, that he has not
 allowed himself to be carried away by any hypothesis, and that he
 has shown himself in physics, what Saussure did in geology, one of
 those philosophers whose observations will remain, whatever may be
 the phases through which science is destined to pass.
     While rendering full and entire homage to the qualities which
 constitute M. Regnault one of the first physicists of this aera, we are
 far from questioning the merit of those who, following another
 course, advance science in a manner different indeed, but who leave
 behind them traces no less deep. There are men whose creative
 imaginations, opening out a totally new path, march to the conquest
 of unexpected truth, with a good fortune and success which are a
 consequence of the divination that produces a perfect appreciation
  of the laws of nature, joined to the inspiration of genius. The phy
 sicists of this school, if the name of school can be applied to that
 which is not a method, but a gift of nature, differ essentially from
     * This interesting review and summary of the beautiful researches of M.
  Regnault we have transferred from the pages of the Bibliothèque Universelle
  de Genève; it is from the pen of M. de la Rive.

those who, like M. Regnault, follow a route necessarily leading to
the end and leaving nothing to chance. The latter improve, rectify,
what the others have discovered; they often complete it; sometimes
they diminish its importance; in all cases they co-ordinate the dif
ferent parts of it, in a manner to render evident the true capacity and
just proportions of the new elements with which science is enriched.
Without the first, no science; without the second, no true science.
But we shall not further attempt to compare that which, in reality, is
not susceptible of it, since the elements of the comparison are so
different. Let us confine ourselves to a summary of our idea, in
declaring that, if Regnault is the type of one of the schools, Faraday
is the glory of the other; this is to state in two words all that science
owes to them, and the services she still expects from them.
    Returning to our subject. The question is the theoretical calcu
lation of the work done by steam-engines, which requires, according
to M. Regnault, a knowledge of the following laws and data:—
    1. The law which connects the temperatures and the elastic forces
of aqueous vapour in a state of saturation.
    2. The quantities of heat which 1 kilogramme of liquid water at
0° Cent. must absorb, to be reduced to vapour in a state of satu
ration under different pressures.
    3. The quantities of heat which 1 kilogramme of liquid water at
0° Cent. must absorb to elevate its temperature to that at which it
 becomes vaporized under different pressures.
    4. The specific heat of steam in different states of density and at
different temperatures.
    5. The law according to which the density of the steam in a state
of saturation varies under different pressures.
    6. The coefficients of the dilatation of steam acquired in its dif
 ferent states of density.
    But before entering upon the investigation of these laws, M.
 Regnault was compelled to undertake long preliminary researches, in
 order to determine a great number of auxiliary data, which ap
 peared fixed with certainty by the earlier labours of other phy
sicists, which however they were not, as experience has shown.
 These researches are in particular relative to the laws of dilatation
 and compressibility of elastic fluids, and to the measurement of
 temperatures. The first seven memoirs contained in the volume
 before us, are essentially devoted to these. It is only in the three
 last, the eighth, ninth and tenth, that M. Regnault begins to attack
 the very questions, the solution of which was the primitive intention
 of his great task, in treating the three first points denoted above.
    We reserve the analysis of these last three memoirs for another
 article. At present we shall confine ourselves to the examination
 of the preliminary researches. We do not pretend at all, be it un
 derstood, to give a complete account of them. Of seven memoirs
 which are devoted to them, there are three which we shall be con
 tent merely to mention, namely, that which relates to the determi
 nation of the weight of the litre of air and of the density of mercury,

                   Notices respecting New Books.                    43
that of which the object is the absolute dilatation of mercury,
and lastly, the memoir on the compressibility of liquids, and in par
ticular of mercury.    This last, which contains a detailed explanation
of the methods to be employed, does not include a great number of
decisive experiments, the author not having had time to execute
researches so considerable as the complete study of the subject
would have required. One of his pupils, M. Grassi, has lately made
 known the results he obtained by following the methods indicated
by M. Regnault, and by using his apparatus. As to the other two
memoirs, they contain important numerical data, it is true, but the
interest of these to us, lies essentially in the use which the author
makes of them in the more general researches of which we are about
 to treat.  Nevertheless the admirable exactitude of the methods
applied by M. Regnault, and the remarkable precision with which he
operates, lead us to report here some numerical data, the importance
of which will be appreciated by all philosophers, namely, the weight
at Paris, that is in the latitude 48° 50' 16", of the litre of air, ni
trogen, oxygen, hydrogen, and carbonic acid, at the temperature of
0° Cent. and under the pressure of 0.760 millim., as well as the den
sity of mercury at 0°.

   A litre of mercury at 0°C. weighs 13595-93 grms, and a litre of
water at the maximum of density 1000.00 grms. Thus the den
sity of mercury is 13:59593; the density of mercury in relation to
air, which it is sometimes requisite to know, for instance in the
measurement of heights by the barometer, is 10513.5 at the tempe
rature of 0° and under the pressure of 0.760 millim. at Paris.
   The two essential portions of the preliminary researches of M.
Regnault are, as we have said, that relative to the laws of dilatation
and compressibility of elastic fluids, and that of which the object
was the measurement of temperatures.            We shall run over them
successively, indicating the most striking points.
  Researches relative to the Laws of Dilatation and Compressibility
                            of Elastic Fluids.
   M. Gay-Lussac, in the first years of this century, at the close of
a great number of experiments, came to the determination that the
coefficient of dilatation between 0° and 100° C., was the same for all
gases, and for vapours when they were at some distance from their
point of condensation, and that its value was 0.375. This law and
this coefficient, subsequently verified by Dulong and Petit on hy
drogen and atmospheric air between much more distant limits of
temperature, were admitted by all physicists and employed in all
calculations. Combined with the law equally admitted under the

44                 Notices respecting New Books.
name of Mariotte's law, that the densities of air at equal temperature
are proportional to the pressures, the law of Gay-Lussac furnished
to geometers, and in particular to Laplace, the means of arriving by
calculation at simple and general notions on the constitution of
elastic fluids. It was believed that thus was found, in the gaseous
state, the state of matter most fitted to bring to light the general
qualities of bodies, since it was independent of the special nature of
each of them.
    Already, it must be remembered, the researches of Dulong and
Petit, on the cooling of bodies in different gases, had revealed a
special influence independent of the density and the other general
conditions of elastic fluids, and proper to each in particular. After
the experiments of Faraday on the liquefaction of gases, several
physicists, and particularly MM. CErsted and Svendsen in 1826, and
M. Despretz in 1827, perceived that several gases compared with
atmospheric air, departed from the law of Mariotte, and presented
compressibilities increasing with the pressure, even from the point
of two atmospheres. Some uncertainty was equally manifested re
specting Mariotte's law, applied to atmospheric air, but they appeared
tovanish completely after the excellent researches of MM. Arago and
Dulong, executed in 1827 at the request of the Academy of Sci
ences of Paris, researches which caused the law of the compres
sibility of atmospheric air to be regarded as directly verified up to
twenty-seven atmospheres, and capable of being extended without any
notable error much beyond this limit. M. Pouillet announced lately
that he had ascertained that oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, binoxide of
nitrogen, and carbonic oxide follow, up to 100 atmospheres, the same
law of compression as atmospheric air. We shall see that these re
sults, and that of MM. Arago and Dulong, must only be admitted
with some reservation, and that M Regnault has demonstrated by
direct methods that they are not rigorously exact, after having al
ready remarked that they were not readily reconcileable with his
experiments on the dilatation of gases. We will therefore in the
first place say a few words on this subject.
   The coefficient of Gay-Lussac had been generally admitted for a
great number of years, when a Swedish physicist, M. Rudberg, threw
doubts on its exactitude, showing by a series of experiments care
fully made, that it was too high, and that its true value should be
comprehended between 0.364 and 0.365.
   M. Regnault, considering that new experiments were necessary to
remove all the doubts in this respect, gave himself up ardently to
theum, at the time when M. Magnus was making analogous researches
in Berlin.
   Five series of experiments were made on atmospheric air; in the
four first, which only differed from each other in the methods em
ployed, and were based on the same principle, the dilatation of the
gas was determined in an indirect manner. Direct measurement
was made of the increase of elastic force which the gas, brought into
a volume sensibly constant, received through the elevation of the
temperature, and the dilatation was concluded, by making use of

                     Notices respecting New Books.                     4.5
Mariotte's law. The fifth series of experiments was for the purpose
of seeking the dilatation of the gas in a direct manner; for this it
would be requisite to enclose it in a very elastic envelope, so that it
might dilate freely without change of the elastic force, and that the
increase of volume it would undergo might be measured with pre
cision, the whole mass remaining at the same temperature. It was
difficult to realize these conditions practically, but M. Regnault has
approached them, by following a method analogous to that already
employed by M. Pouillet for his air pyrometer, and which consists
in having a kind of reservoir filled with mercury, communicating
with the balloon containing the gas experimented on, and causing the
mercury necessary to give place to the gas, to flow in such a manner
that it may obey its dilatation, without change of elastic force.
   It is difficult to conceive all the precautions which are required
both in this and the other methods, to ascertain exactly the capacity
of the balloons and tubes which contain the gas, to ensure thorough
desiccation of the air, to bring to one given temperature all the parts
of the apparatus, and in particular the columns of mercury, which,
by their height, serve to measure the variations of the elastic force,
or those of the volume, and to determine with the necessary precision
the heights of the columns of mercury. The very clear detail of
his experiments must be read in M. Regnault's work itself, the de
scription of all his apparatus must be followed on the plates which
accompany his memoirs, to understand the nature of the practical
difficulties which are presented by researches of this kind, and the
manner of securing himself from all the causes of error, so nume
rous, which the experimenter necessarily meets on his way. One
of the most difficult operations, until the habit has been acquired, is
the measurement of the height of the mercury raised. M. Regnault
employed for this purpose the cathetometer of Gambey, which, by
its vernier, gives an immediate reading to the fiftieth of a milli
metre.     This cathetometer is a divided vertical scale, fixed on a solid
point, and bearing a traveller furnished with a perfectly horizontal
lens.    The operator looks with the lens toward the level of the mer
cury raised in the tube, then the lens is lowered, and he looks at the
upper end of a screw, the lower end of which just touches the sur
face of the mercury in the vessel in which the tube is plunged; by
adding to the difference of level thus obtained, the distance between
the two points of the screw which had been previously measured
with the same instrument, the total height of the mercury raised is
obtained.
   The five series of experiments gave the following means for the
volume of gas at 100°, its volume at 0° being 1:—

coefficient; they are not of equally easy execution, and perhaps are
not susceptible of the same degree of exactitude; nevertheless they
lead to the same result, and this is what is required for the determi
nation of numerical elements with some degree of certainty. In
these first four series of experiments, the coefficient of dilatation is
deduced, by the calculation of the change of elastic force which a
given volume of gas undergoes when its temperature varies from 0°
to 100°, and the mean of the very closely approximate results gives
                                       0.003665.
The fifth series furnishes the number 0.003670, which differs notably
from those given by the other four; which depends, as subsequent
researches showed, on the fact that in these last experiments the gas
dilated freely, preserving the same elastic force.
   After having determined the coefficient of the dilatation of air
by different methods, and having thus studied these methods them
selves, and ascertained that when properly executed they conducted
to the same result, M. Regnault selected for operation upon the
other gases, that which had appeared to him most susceptible of
exactitude, and of surest and easiest execution; this was the method
employed in the second series of experiments; he also occasionally
made use of that of the fourth; finally, he operated with that of the
fifth, to obtain comparatively the dilatation under constant pressure
and under constant volume. He did not succeed in obtaining re
sults with oxygen, not being able, in spite of every precaution, to
prevent the action of this gas upon the mercury.
   The following are the results which demonstrate, that for all the
gases, except hydrogen, the coefficient of dilatation, determined by
direct observation of the increase of volume, which the same mass
of gas undergoes from 0° to 100°, its elastic force remaining con
stant, is greater than that which is deduced by calculation from the
observation of the elastic forces presented by an identical volume
of gas at 0° and 100°.

   This table shows equally that the different gases present coeffi
cients of dilatation differing very notably from each other, contrary
to what has been long believed.                No one will overlook the fact that
the highest coefficients of dilatation are presented by those which
are most easily liquefiable.

                   Notices respecting New Books.                     47
   It remained to determine the influence exercised on the coeffi
cient of dilatation by the pressure to which the gas is subject.
M. Regnault studied this influence on various gases, by subjecting
them to both a less and a greater pressure than that of the atmo
sphere. The apparatus employed for researches of this kind were
the same as for the preceding; the balloon which contained the gas
was successively surrounded with boiling water and melting ice.
The pressure was measured in the cases both of a high and low
pressure, by a column of mercury, the level of which was given by
the cathetometer. In the first case, as the pressure was carried up
to four atmospheres, the column was sometimes very long, and
much care was required to measure it very accurately. It was re
quisite also, among other precautions, to protect the column of
mercury from the heat coming by radiation from the source which
maintained the balloon at the temperature of boiling water, and to
take account by direct appreciation, of the increase of volume which
the balloon acquired from the effect of a high pressure, which was
done by filling it with water instead of gas.
   The experiments showed that, setting out from the atmospheric
pressure, the coefficient of dilatation of air diminishes and increases
with the pressure in a very marked manner. Thus, under a pressure
of 109.72 millims. at 0°, and of 149.31 millims. at 100°, it is i-36482,
and under a pressure of 3655-56 millims, at 0°, and 4992.09 millims.
at 100°, it is 1:37091. The densities of gas at the temperature of
melting ice, varied between the same limits of pressure, that is
to say, from 109.72 millims to 3655.56 millims, from 0.1444 up
to 4.8100 (that of air at 0° under the pressure of 760 millims.
being=1), that is to say, in the proportion of 1 to 33. Hence it
results, therefore, that the law admitted by physicists, that air di
lates by the same fraction of its volume at 0°, whatever may be its
density, is inexact, and that, on the contrary, it dilates between the
same limits of temperature, by quantities which are the more con
siderable in proportion as the density of the gas is greater, or in
other terms, as its molecules are more closely approximated.
   The same is the case with carbonic acid, the dilatation of which
increases progressively with the pressure, much more rapidly than
that of atmospheric air.
   Other experiments, made equally under different pressures, but
executed by the method of constant pressure, led to the same result,
namely, an increase of the coefficient of dilatation growing with the
pressure. The increase is even more rapid when this method is
used, than when the coefficient of dilatation is determined by means
of the variation of the elastic forces.   Carbonic acid, above all sul
phurous acid, present a dilatation increasing very rapidly with the
density; thus for a change of pressure so slight as that from 760
millims. to 980 millims, the coefficient of dilatation of sulphurous
acid changed from 0.3902 to 0-3960; and nevertheless, the gas
under a pressure of 980 millims. is not yet near to the 0° of its point
of liquefaction.                      -
   A somewhat remarkable thing is, that the difference between the

48                  Notices respecting New Books.
dilatations of atmospheric air and carbonic acid gas is much more
considerable when the pressure is the same at 0° and at 100°, than
in those in which the dilatations are calculated according to the
changes of elastic force.
   Hydrogen is the only gas of which the coefficient does not alter
with the pressure, at least up to that of four atmospheres, while that
of air continually increases from the point of ordinary barometric
pressure, under which the two gases have sensibly the same dilata
tion.
   In general, the more considerable the pressure under which the
gases are examined, the greater difference is found between their
coefficients of dilatation.  Inversely, the coefficients of dilatation of
the different gases approach to an equality in proportion as their
pressures become weaker, so that the law which says that gases
have all the same coefficient of dilatation, may be considered as a
limited law, which applies only to gases in an extreme condition of
dilatation, but which departs from the reality in proportion as the
gases are more compressed, in other terms, as their atoms are more
closely approximated.
   The first task of M. Regnault, which we have just rapidly sur
veyed, confirms us in that opinion which we announced at the out
set, namely, that a great error is committed in supposing the gaseous
condition to be a state in which the physical properties of the body,
with the exception of the density, are independent of its peculiar
nature, and connected solely with its general constitution. We see,
in fact, that the coefficient of dilatation of the gas varies with its
nature, with its density, and with the mode in which it is operated
on.   Hydrogen alone appears to present more general relations in
this respect.
   The direct determination of the densities which forms the object
of M. Regnault's second memoir, conducts to consequences in every
respect analogous. This determination, effected by a method much
more simple than those hitherto employed, and at the same time
very exact, gives the densities at 0° and 100° of the different gases
in proportion to air, which allows of the deduction from it of the
coefficients of dilatation by the method of weighing. The values of
these coefficients are nearly the same as those which had been ob
tained by the direct methods.
   The densities at 0° and under the pressure of 760 millims, found
by M. Regnault for nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen and carbonic acid,
differ very little from those to which MM. Dumas and Boussingault
arrived; they are each the mean of very slightly differing numbers,
furnished by a great number of experiments. But if they are taken.
at other temperatures, and under other pressures, the results are no
longer the same, and they furnish curious consequences. Thus
by taking the density of carbonic acid at 0° under different press
ures, but all lower than the atmospheric pressure, it is ascertained
that this gas departs from Mariotte's law in a very marked manner,
whilst at the temperature of 100° it sensibly follows this law. It is
evident, therefore, that according to the temperature and pressure

                   Notices respecting New Books.                     49
at which the operation is carried on, the density of carbonic acid
bears a different proportion to that of atmospheric air, although in
each case, as it is scarcely necessary to mention, care has been
taken to bring the air to the same temperature and the same pressure.
The following are a few figures in support of this conclusion :
   The density of carbonic acid gas at 0° is—
             Under the pressure of 760.00 millims. 1:52910
                                    374-13      ..   1.52366
                       • -          224, 17    . .   1-5214.5
   The density of the same gas at 100° is—
            Under the pressure of 760.00 millims. 1:52418
                       - -           383°39     . .  1.524, 10
   Hence it results, that the atomic weight of carbon, deduced from
the density of carbonic acid gas, varies according to that of the
densities selected. Thus the atomic weight of 75.000 admitted by
M. Dumas, conducts to the theoretical density of 1:52024 for
carbonic acid, a density very near to that found for this gas at 0°,
and under the pressure of 224.17 millims, while the density of
1:52910 ascertained for carbonic acid at 0° and under a pressure of
760 millims, conducts for the atomic weight of carbon to 76.60, a
number closely approximate to that of 76°44, for a long time
adopted by chemists on the authority of Berzelius. This example
shows the uncertainty which there is a risk of meeting in the deter
mination of atomic weights deduced from the density of elastic fluids.
   The first researches of M. Regnault showed, then, that the law
of equality and uniformity of the dilatation of elastic fluids was not
general, and that Mariotte's law seemed to be equally defective; as
we have already mentioned, other physicists had arrived at the same
result in regard to this last law, at least for gases capable of being
liquefied by high pressure. In his sixth memoir M. Regnault at
tacks the question directly, and after a critical analysis of earlier
labours, passes to the description of his own experiments. They
were made by means of apparatus erected at the College of France,
in a special building, which had been constructed, at the request of M.
Savart, for hydraulic experiments, the execution of which was pre
vented by the premature death of that skilful physicist. This building
consists of a square tower of two stories, the total height being
12.5 metres.     A mercurial manometer is fixed in the inside against
a vertical wall, which is of the entire height of the building. A cast
iron vessel, closed by a cylindrical reservoir, which serves as the
reservoir of mercury, is fitted with a cylindrical adapter bearing the
necessary tubulures, three of which are vertical; a little hydraulic
force-pump serves to compress the air in the reservoir, with which
it communicates by a horizontal tubulure. For the experiments on
the compressibility of gases, the author used only two of the vertical
tubulures; the third was hermetically closed. He placed in them
two glass tubes, one of which, three metres high, communicated with
the apparatus which cóntained the air to be compressed, and the

other, of considerable height, was intended to contain columns of
mercury making equilibrium at pressures carried as high as thirty
atmospheres. Nothing can be more interesting to read, to persons
who have to perform the manipulations necessary in experimental
researches, than the details of the ingenious and simple means by
which M. Regnault succeeded in cementing into the tubulures and
connecting end to end, the different tubes of the apparatus.
    The plan by which he contrived to effect this union, is of such
 convenient and sure application, that its employment will doubt
 less become general, especially on account of the facility with which
 it allows of the instantaneous mounting and dismounting of the dif
 ferent parts of the manometer, without risk of accident. We can
 not, to our great regret, dwell upon these details, which would lead
 us too far, any more than upon the precautions necessary for the
 exact measurement, with the cathetometer, of the difference of level
 between the surface of the column of mercury which rises in the
 little tube containing the compressed air, and the surface of the
 column of mercury raised in the large open tube, communicating of
 course with the atmosphere. One point of some importance, is to
 take into account the difference of height, and consequently of the
 atmospheric pressure, due to the elevation of the second of the mer
  curial surfaces above the level of the mercury in the reservoir; M.
  Regnault found, by direct observation, that this element of correction
  could not be neglected any more than that relating to the increase
  of the capacity of the tubes under the influence of the high pres
  sures to which they were subjected.    Finally, it is necessary to wait,
  before making an observation, till the heat liberated in the gas in
  consequence of the compression has been dissipated, and to employ
  a current of water to maintain it, during the experiment, at a tem
  perature as constant as possible.
     The gases on which M. Regnault's experiments were made, are
  atmospheric air, nitrogen, carbonic acid and hydrogen; there were
  several different series of experiments made on each gas, from the
  ordinary atmospheric pressure up to the pressure of nearly thirty
  atmospheres, expressed by columns of mercury of about twenty-two
  metres in height.
     The detailed tables of the experiments contain all the numerical
  data which permit the calculation of the relation     (#)

  inverse proportion to the pressures, were correct. Now it is seen
  that atmospheric air does not follow this law strictly, and that it
  really becomes a little more compressed than it should according to
  that law. It might be feared perhaps that the difficulty of exactly
  appreciating the volumes Vo and V, was the cause of the result con
  trary to Mariotte's law; but supposing that this circumstance gave
  rise to an error in the case of a certain pressure, the error ought to
  be always the same for all pressures.

18548.98 millims.
   Nitrogen gas in like manner becomes more compressed than it

   Mariotte's law therefore cannot be regarded even as an approxi
mative law for carbonic acid gas, when this gas is observed under
rather high pressures.
   Hydrogen does not follow Mariotte's law better than the other
gases, but what is very remarkable, it departs from it in the con
trary direction. Its compressibility, far from increasing, as in the
rest, diminishes in proportion as the pressure augments. The elastic
force of this gas is therefore analogous to that of a metallic spring,
which offers a greater resistance in proportion as it is subjected to a

        Hence it results that Mariotte's law must not be regarded as a
     mathematical expression of the perfect gaseous condition, for then
     hydrogen gas would constitute a more than perfect elastic fluid.
         The elastic resistance which hydrogen presents, probably would
     not increase indefinitely with the condensation; a certain state of
     condensation should exist in the vicinity of which Mariotte's law
     would be followed quite strictly, then, the condensation increasing,
     the hydrogen gas would depart again from the law, but in a direction

     moment of the liquefaction of the gas.
         The temperature necessarily exercises a great influence upon this
     phaenomenon, for carbonic acid gas, which at 0° departs from Ma
     riotte's law, even under pressures less than that of the atmosphere,
     no longer departs from it at the temperature of 100°. Atmospheric
     air itself departs from it much less between the same limits of den
     sity, at elevated temperatures, than at the ordinary temperature. It
     is probable that a temperature might easily be obtained, at which
     the divergences would become insensible, and at a temperature still
     more elevated atmospheric air would again depart from Mariotte's
     law, but in the contrary direction, that is, in the direction in which
     hydrogen gas departs from it at ordinary temperatures. Similar
     circumstances, but in an inverse order, would, it is not unlikely, pre
     sent themselves in hydrogen gas, if it were submitted to lower or
     higher temperatures.
         It is probable then that Mariotte's law is a law which holds for
     each gas in a certain state of density and at a definite temperature.

      having been greater, varies necessarily with the density for each gas,
     and is the more elevated in proportion as the density is more con
      siderable.
         It would be very interesting therefore to study the compressibility
     of gases at elevated temperatures, a study very difficult and almost
----    a

                    Notices respecting New Books.                      53
impossible, on account of the necessity of stationary elevated tem
peratures. However, experiments of this kind might be made with
success up to the temperature of boiling water, determining by means
of the balance the weight of gas which fills the balloon under differ
ent pressures, and at the fixed temperatures of melting ice and boil
ing water. M. Regnault describes the apparatus, composed essen
tially of two copper globes, which he destines to experiments of this
kind; but the experiments themselves have not yet been executed.
M. Regnault attaches the more importance to them, that they not
only allow of the determination of the influence of that important
element, the temperature, but that they may moreover serve to con
trol the method followed in the other experiments, to which the
objection might be made, that the anomalies perceived in atmosphe
ric air are due, at least in part, to a condensing action of the surface
of the glass tube which contains the air.
   To sum up the foregoing, we see that the very complete and pre
cise researches of M. Regnault conduct to the conclusion, that neither
the law of Gay-Lussac on the dilatation of elastic fluids by heat,
nor that of Mariotte on the constant relation which exists between
their elastic force and their volume, are laws of nature, but that
they are only approximative, and consequently only true between
certain limits. The aberrations manifest themselves for both the laws
in tolerably similar circumstances, and demonstrate the intimate rela
tion which exists between the two classes of phaenomena. Thus
the coefficients of dilatation are greater in proportion as the density
of the gas is more considerable; the same holds of the compressi
bility, hydrogen being the sole exception in both cases. Carbonic
acid gas dilates more, and likewise experiences a greater compression,
than atmospheric air in the same circumstances. Many other paral
lels of the same kind might be made, but I prefer confining myself,
in concluding this account, to dwelling for a moment on the conse
quences which, it appears to me, may be deduced from M. Regnault's
researches, in reference to the constitution itself of elastic fluids.
   It has long been said that in gaseous substances the influence of
their special nature is no longer perceptible, and that their physical
properties, excepting the density, depend alone on an agent common
to all, namely heat, and that it is for this reason that the laws they
present are general and the same for all, such, in particular, as Gay
Lussac's and Mariotte's laws. Error in the consequences, therefore
error in the point of departure.
   But what M. Regnault's labours appear to prove, is, that the less
the density of the gases, the more general and similar appear the
laws they present. Only it is necessary, in the case of those of
which the low density does not result, as in hydrogen, from their
special nature, that an elevation of temperature should compensate,
as far as possible, for the loss of elastic force to which the diminu
tion of density subjects them. In one word, what is required is, that
the atoms should be separated as widely as possible, and the elastic

54                 Notices respecting New Books.
forces be at the same time as great as possible; conditions which
are opposed to each other, except by bringing the temperature into
action. Then the special nature of the atoms no longer interposes
in the phaenomena, and the laws exhibit a generality which they did
not possess when, the atoms being more closely approximated, their
mutual action influenced the result. Thus hydrogen presents the
same coefficient of dilatation under different pressures, and the other
gases come nearer to having the same coefficient in proportion as
their density is less. With regard to that aberration from Mariotte's
law, in a contrary direction from other gases, presented by hydrogen,
 and which the other gases would probably present at high tempera
 tures, it would be a general consequence, and therefore similar for
all elastic fluids, of the laws which regulate the constituent elastic
force of the gas; it would simply prove that the intensity of this
force is not so simple a function as has been supposed, of the di
stance which separates the atoms.
    Finally, we will remark, that these considerations, based on the
experimental researches of M. Regnault, are very contrary to the
opinion long received, that under the same pressure and at the same
temperature, equal volumes of all gases contain the same number of
atoms. They are of a nature, on the other hand, to lead to the pre
sumption, that the densities of gases do not at all express the rela
tions which exist between their atomic weights; conclusions, more
over, which purely chemical considerations tend to corroborate, and
at which I had already arrived in 1833, when drawing up a report
on the Traité de Chimie of Berzelius.
    The alteration produced in the chemical properties of gases by
their less or greater degree of density, is another proof to be added
to those I have already indicated, that elastic fluids have an indi
vidual molecular constitution; a kind of cohesion, as it were, when
their atoms are not removed beyond a certain limited distance from
each other. This interesting and delicate subject, which I have but
just touched upon, can only be treated properly when new facts shall
have been added to those which the sagacity and perseverance of
physicists like M. Regnault have enriched it. I therefore terminate
here the report of this portion of the researches of the French phi
losopher, and now enter upon the memoir in which he treats of the
measurement of temperatures.
                  The Measurement of Temperatures.
   This subject, which seemed to have been exhausted by MM. Du
long and Petit, in their excellent investigations made thirty years
ago, has been wholly worked over again by M. Regnault, this re
vision having been rendered necessary from the circumstance that,
by his own experiments, the French physicist had so importantly
modified the data on the dilatation and compressibility of gases pre
viously received.
   The problem of the measurement of temperatures is perhaps
the most difficult of solution that physics present. We have, in
deed, no direct means of measuring the quantities of heat absorbed

                    Notices respecting New Books.                    55
by any body in given circumstances. This absorption of heat is
only to be perceived by the changes which take place in the state
of the body or by its dilatation. Now when the dilatations which
different bodies undergo under identical circumstances are studied
comparatively, it is soon seen that these dilatations are far from fol
lowing the same law. As to the quantities of heat acquired by the
different bodies, when they are brought successively to different
temperatures measured by the dilatations of any one of them, it is
perceived that they are variable and unequally variable in each,
while no one has yet succeeded in determining the relations which
exist between these variations of capacity and these variations of
volume.
    It is evident therefore how difficult it would be to construct a
perfect thermometer, that is to say a thermometer whose indications
would always be proportional to the quantities of heat it absorbed,
or in which the additions of equal quantities of heat would always
produce equal dilatations. However, physicists imagined that they
had found this normal thermometer in the gas-thermometer.          This
opinion was founded on the following considerations, namely, that if
thermometers are made with air and several other solid or liquid
substances, and graduated between 0° and 100°, with the supposi
tion that the dilatation is uniform, when this graduation is prolonged
beyond 100°, the air-thermometer is that which, for temperatures
above 100°, will constantly indicate the lowest temperature; and
while the others will indicate all the temperatures different from and
higher than that which the gas-thermometer denotes, the latter will
denote the same, whatever be the nature of the gas, whether, for
example, it be air or hydrogen. This result of observation seemed
moreover to be confirmed, by the opinion that was entertained that
gases are subject to simple and general laws, and by the notions
that were deduced from it as to their physical constitution, in which
no part was attributed to the proper nature of the atoms, and which
was made to depend solely upon heat, an agent common to all.
    But the researches of M. Regnault, by demonstrating that the
laws which regulate the constitution of gases are far from being so
simple and general as had been believed, have rendered it inadmis
sible to regard the gas-thermometer as a normal thermometer. The
indications of the gas-thermometers, like those of other thermometers,
can therefore only be considered as more or less complicated func
tions of the quantities of heat.
    In default of giving an exact measurement of the quantity of heat,
the thermometer must at least always remain accurately comparable
with itself, that is, must always furnish the same indication in iden
tical conditions: and, further, it is necessary to be able to reproduce
at will and always obtain instruments rigorously comparable. ... Now
the mercurial thermometer which fulfills the first condition well, only
 fulfills the second very imperfectly. Thus two mercurial thermo
meters, regulated for the same fixed points of melting ice and of the
boiling of water under the pressure of 0.760 millim, may present very
considerable differences in the course beyond these fixed points, if

56                  Notices respecting New Books.
the envelopes of these thermometers are not formed of glass of the
same nature, or the molecular condition of which is not the same.
In fact, in any thermometer formed by a liquid or gaseous substance,
 the indications of the instrument depend upon the dilatation of that
 substance, and of that of the envelope. The dilatation of mercury
 being only seven times greater than that of the glass which encloses
 it, the variations presented by the different dilatations of different
 kinds of glass form very sensible fractions of the apparent dilatations
 of the mercury, and consequently influence notably the indications
 of the instrument. In the gas-thermometer, on the contrary, the
 dilatation of the gas being a hundred and sixty times greater than
 that of glass, the variations in the dilatations of the different kinds
 of glass do not sensibly influence the indications of the apparatus,
 and do not prevent the comparison of the instruments. At the
 same time, it is important to determine the conditions in which this
instrument remains comparable.
    Thus in the question of the measurement of temperatures, it is no
longer sought to obtain an instrument which measures the quantities
 of heat, or the indications of which will be proportional to the tem
 peratures. The pretension of the physicist is more modest; he asks
 only the possibility of constructing instruments which, in the same
 conditions of temperature, shall always give exactly the same indi
 cation, that is, which shall be comparable with each other and with
 themselves. The study of this desideratum is the object of that one
 of M. Regnault's memoirs which treats of the measurement of
 temperatures. He first discusses the gas thermometer, then the
 mercurial. Finally, he devotes an important part of his memoir to
 the measurement of temperatures by means of thermo-electric cur
 rents.   We shall give in a future number, almost word for word, this
last portion, which is very little known, and in which M. Regnault
treats several interesting questions in thermo-electricity, with that
same rigorous precision which he brings into all his researches. At
present we shall confine ourselves to a rapid survey of the first two
portions of the memoir, devoted to the gas and the mercurial ther
mometers, which form a whole, the more complete, that in regard to
the measurement of temperatures, M. Regnaul thas been led to re
ject the employment of thermo-electric currents entirely, and that,
consequently, the interest of that portion of his researches lies wholly
in the details, and beside the principal subject.
                           Gas Thermometers.
    There are two ways of employing gas as a thermometric substance.
It may be placed in such conditions that the pressure to which it is
subject remains constant, its increase of volume being observed, or
the gas may be compelled to remain in the same volume while we
observe the increase of its elastic force.
    The first method requires the employment of a capillary tube,
uniting a calibrated tube to the reservoir filled with air, which is
exposed to the temperature to be measured. This arrangement
allows of the calibrated tube being removed to a distance from the

                    Notices respecting New Books.                    57
enclosure of which we desire to know the temperature, this being
indispensable; but it presents a great inconvenience when the ap
paratus is intended to measure elevated temperatures, for then the
greater portion of the air is contained in the calibrated tube, and
only a very small portion remains in the reservoir properly so called.
The result of this is that the portion which will pass out by a new
increment of temperature will be very small, and will be difficult to
measure with sufficient precision in the calibrated tube. The appa
ratus thus becomes but very slightly sensible at elevated tempera
tures; M. Regnault has therefore rejected this arrangement of the
air-thermometer.
   In the second method the gas is maintained constantly in the
same volume, and the elastic forces which it presents under different
circumstances are the points determined. In this way, by knowing
the variations produced in the elastic forces, we may calculate, by
Mariotte's law, the dilatations which the gas would have experienced
if the pressure had been kept constant. The apparatus founded on
this method, besides being more easily manageable and of greater
precision, has the advantage of presenting as much sensibility at
high temperatures as at low. But in the employment of this me.
thod two important questions present themselves for solution.       The
first is, to know if air-thermometers, filled with air at very different
densities, are comparable with each other. The second, if gas-ther
mometers, filled with gases of different nature, proceed in agreement
with each other when they have been regulated for the fixed points of
0° and 100°.
   The apparatus which M. Regnault has made use of to solve these
two questions consists of two gas-thermometers, each composed of a
glass balloon of from 700 to 800 cubic centimetres capacity, ter
minating in a curved capillary tube, which abuts, end to end, against
another capillary tube communicating with the manometric appara
tus. The union of the capillary tubes is effected by a brass tubulure
bearing a rectangular appendix, into which is cemented a capillary
tube, serving to put the apparatus in communication with an air
pump, by means of which the interior of the apparatus may be dried,
and the different gases to be operated on be introduced. The bal
loons themselves are plunged into a heating apparatus filled with oil,
which is constantly agitated in order to maintain an equal tempera
ture throughout the bath. We pass over the details of the experi
ments, and the enumeration of the precautions taken to dry the in
terior of the apparatus properly, to maintain the temperature as
nearly stationary as possible, and to determine satisfactorily the
levels of the mercury in the manometers.         The experiments were
conducted in the same manner, whether it was wished to compare
the course of an air-thermometer with that of a thermometer filled
with some other gas, or to compare the course of an air-thermome
ter charged with air having an initial elastic force of about 760
millims. at 0°, with that of a similar thermometer filled with air of
a less or greater density.
    The tables contain the results of the experiments made on the

58                 Notices respecting New Books.
comparison of air-thermometers charged with air under an initial
pressure of 762, 553, and 438 millims. In a subsequent series
of experiments, the initial elastic force of the air was carried as far
as 1486 millims. The experiments were made from 0° up to
325° of the scale made with the graduation of the instruments be
tween 0° and 100°. All these thermometers proceeded in sensible
agreement, even when the air which each contained was under very
different pressure, so that it may be admitted with all certainty, that
the air-thermometer is a perfectly comparable instrument, even when
charged with air of different densities.
   Two thermometers charged, one with air, the other with hydro
gen, with an initial elastic force of 754 millims. at 0°, proceeded
with perfect agreement from 0° to 325°. The same was the case
with two thermometers of carbonic acid gas, which, in two series of
experiments, proceeded in equally perfect agreement with the air
thermometer. The last was in both cases charged with air of an
initial elastic force of 742 millims, while in the carbonic acid gas
thermometers the initial elastic force of the gas was, in one 741
millims, and in the other only 464 millims. It must be observed
that the temperatures were calculated, in the various experiments,
by taking for the coefficient of dilatation of air 0.003665, for that
of hydrogen 0.003652, and for that of carbonic acid 0.003695 when
it was under the pressure of 741 millims, and 0.03682 when it was
under the pressure of 464 millims.
   Two series of experiments made on the comparison of a normal
air-thermometer with a thermometer of sulphurous acid gas, under
the initial pressure of 762.17 millims. for the air, and successively
of 751.47 millims. and of 588.70 millims. for the sulphurous acid,
showed a very notable difference of course between the two instru
ments.    In the first series 0.003825 was taken for the coefficient of
dilatation of the sulphurous acid gas, and in the second 0-003794.
The sulphurous acid thermometer fell behind the air-thermometer
from the point of 100°, and the differences increased regularly with
the temperature. Thus the mean coefficient of dilatation of sul
phurous acid gas diminishes in a very marked manner with the tem
perature measured in the air-thermometer; in fact, the value of this
mean coefficient for each degree Centigrade is found to be
                   from 0 to 9812           00038251
                             to 257-17      0-0037923
                             to 310-31      O-0037893
                       The Mercurial Thermometer.
   The air-thermometer is the only instrument, especially for ele
vated temperatures, which can be used in exact experiments, but
the use of it is difficult; there are even circumstances in which it
is impossible to employ it. Then it becomes necessary to use a
mercurial thermometer; and then a direct comparison must be made
of this instrument with the air-thermometer, in order that its indi
cations may be transformed into those of the normal thermometer.

                    Notices respecting New Books.                  59
Dulong and Petit had already made this comparison, and calculated
a table which permitted the necessary transformation; but this table
is inexact, even for the particular mercurial thermometer which
they employed, because their experiments were calculated with much
too high a coefficient of dilatation—the coefficient 0-375 of Gay
Lussac.
    M. Regnault, after he had made a great number of experiments
on this subject, perceived that the different mercurial thermometers
were not comparable, either because they had not been constructed
of the same kind of glass, or because they had been blown in a dif
ferent manner. At the same time, he was desirous of ascertaining
if mercurial thermometers, constructed of the same kind of glass,
would, although blown in a different manner, proceed sufficiently in
agreement to allow of their being regarded as comparable. If this
circumstance were realized, it would suffice to make, once for all,
the comparison of one of these thermometers with the air-thermo
meter, and to admit the same table of correction for all similar in
struments. To settle this question, M. Regnault executed a long
series of experiments with the aim of comparing with the air-ther
mometer, not only mercurial thermometers formed of an identical
quality of glass worked in a different way, but also those made of
the different kinds of glass which are met with commercially in
France, and which are employed in physical apparatus. The mer
curial thermometers employed in these experiments were overflow
thermometers (thermometres a déversement); they are more easily
constructed than the ordinary thermometers with graduated stem,
and present the great advantage, that it is always easy to keep the
whole of the column of mercury in the bath. In order to construct
 overflow-thermometers, the mercury must be boiled in the instru
 ments several successive times and with great care, after which they
 are left to cool with the recurved point of the capillary tubes kept
 in a bath of mercury previously heated. Then the reservoirs and
 capillary tubes are enveloped in melting ice, the open point remain
 ing plunged in the basin of mercury, and it is easily seen that the
 thermometer has acquired the temperature of 0° when the column
 of mercury remains stationary at the extremity of the capillary tube.
 The mercury which escapes in consequence of the elevation of tem
 perature is collected in a little empty capsule, and weighed with
 great care. To obtain the weight of the mercury which filled the
 thermometer at 0°, the weight of the mercury which has escaped
 through the elevation of the temperature above 0° is added to that
 of the weight of the thermometer itself, subtracting from the whole
 the weight of the empty apparatus. Then, knowing the weight of
 the mercury at 0°, and weighing with care the quantity which
 escapes in proportion as the temperature is elevated, it is easy to
  conclude from it the temperature itself, and to compare it to that
  which would be given by a thermometer constructed of the same
  glass but with a graduated stem. M. Regnault successively analysed
  with care the indications of the thermometer with graduated stem
  and the overflow-thermometer; he shows that by taking into ac

60                  Notices respecting New Books.
count all the circumstances, the dilatation of the bulb, that of the
tube, &c., the indication which the first of these thermometers would
give is identical with that which the second would give in the same
circumstances, provided that their reservoirs were of the same
capacity.
   Convinced by this analysis that he might employ indifferently
either form of the thermometer, M. Regnault, from the motives we
have already indicated, preferred the method of overflow, as sus
ceptible of much greater exactitude; the greatest losses which he
could perceive in his weighings never exceeded 3 or 4 milligrammes,
which is exceedingly inconsiderable for the temperatures to which
his experiments were carried.
   He tried in succession thermometers made with the flint-glass of
Choisy-le-Roi, with common glass, with green glass, and with
Swedish glass. He took care to have each kind of glass analysed
by a skilful chemist, and the analyses were made of the reservoirs
themselves of the thermometers.
   The flint-glass of Choisy-le-Roi always presenting exactly the same
composition, on account of the very particular care taken in the
manufacture, is uncommonly well-fitted for comparative experi
ments. Three thermometers were prepared with this kind of glass;
one had the reservoir made of a flint-glass tube about 14 millims. in
internal diameter, and this was soldered to a capillary tube of the
same glass; the second was obtained by blowing a spherical reser
voir on a capillary tube of flint-glass; and the third was formed of the
same capillary tube worked in the lamp so as to produce a cylin
drical reservoir.    This last exhibited a rather larger proportion of
silica in the analysis, which was probably occasioned by the long
working in the lamp having driven off some of the other ingredients
of the glass by volatilization.
   Observed successively in their course, compared with air-ther
mometers, the three mercurial thermometers, made of Choisy-le-Roi
flint-glass, proceeded in sensible agreement from 0° up to 325°, and
experiment showed that the same corrections may be applied to
them to bring their indications to those of the air-thermometer. But
though the law of dilatation did not differ in the glass of the different
thermometers, this was not the case with the absolute dilatation, which
was very different for each of the reservoirs, the first of which ex
hibited a sensibly smaller coefficient of dilatation than the other two.
   Several thermometers constructed of common glass, but some
with cylindrical, others with spherical reservoirs, and some formed
of tubes or little globes soldered to capillary tubes, were in like
manner compared with the air-thermometers.           It was found that
they differed considerably in their course from the thermometers
with flint-glass envelopes, and that these two kinds of thermometers
could not be regarded as comparable. The dilatations of common
glass between 0° and 100° varied in a very marked manner with the
difference of composition, and above all according to the manner in
which the glass had been worked. Now there are great differences
in the composition of common glass, which is not manufactured with

                    Notices respecting New Books.                     61
the same care as the Choisy-le-Roi flint-glass.    At the same time, on
comparing together the results obtained on thermometers of com
mon glass, the same conclusion is arrived at as for the thermome
ters made of the flint-glass of Choisy-le-Roi, namely, mercurial ther
mometers constructed of the different varieties of common glass, which
are at present used in the manufacture of chemical instruments, do
*ot proceed in strict accordance beyond the fixed points which have
been used to regulate their scales; but the differences are so small
that they may be neglected in most experiments, especially if care be
taken to reject glasses which contain a sensible quantity of lead, which
may readily be detected when they are worked in the lamp.
   The thermometers made of green glass, similar to that which is
used in Paris for organic analyses, and of a Swedish glass, remark
able for its infusibility, gave results sufficiently analogous to those
which had been obtained from the more numerous observations
made with the other thermometers. Only, the coefficient of dilata
tion of these two kinds of glass, which, besides, were of a different
chemical composition, was not the same as that of the other glasses.
   After having demonstrated that thermo-electrical currents cannot
be used for the measurement of temperatures, in a portion of his
work of which we shall not speak at present, since we shall copy it
verbatim, M. Regnault terminates his memoir with some general
conclusions, of which the following is a summary.
   The air-thermometer is the only instrument of measurement which
can be applied with confidence to the determination of elevated tem
peratures; this is the only one M. Regnault will employ when the
temperatures exceed 100°.
   The air-thermometer should be founded on the measurement of
the changes of elastic force which a given volume of air undergoes
when it is brought to different temperatures. It is requisite, as far
as possible, to arrange the air-thermometer so as to determine di
rectly by experiment the elastic forces between 0° and 100°, the
reservoir being plunged into melting ice or kept in the vapour of
boiling water. But if, from the arrangement of the apparatus, the
direct determination of the two fixed points of the thermometric
scale is impossible, as sometimes happens, it becomes necessary to
take the point of departure of the air-thermometer at the tempera
ture of the surrounding medium, ascertained by a mercurial ther
mometer, and then to deduce, by calculation, the elements proper
to the apparatus for the temperature of melting ice.
   When the thermometer contains air having an elastic force of
760 millims. at 0°, and if it does not exceed the temperature of 350°,
the elastic force of the air within will not become greater than
 1720 millims.; there will be no fear, therefore, of a permanent de
formity of the envelope being produced. But at higher tempera
tures there may be a fear of this alteration of form;-1, because the
internal pressure becomes considerable; 2, because the glass may
undergo a sensible softening. It is consequently advisable to intro
duce into the thermometer air having a weaker elastic force when

62           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
the instrument is intended for the measurement of very high tempe
ratures. If, for example, the air at 0° has an elastic force of 300
millims, it will acquire at 500° an elastic force of 850 millims, which
only exceeds the external pressure by about 90 millims.
   When operating at high temperatures, by a peculiar arrangement
of the apparatus it is possible to avoid the danger of an alteration
of the form of the reservoir when there is only one temperature to
determine. But there is always a cause of uncertainty arising from
ignorance of the law of dilatation of the envelope, which may be of
platinum instead of glass, in particular in the case of an air-pyro
meter; but this cause never leads to very considerable errors, as
may be seen by experiments made up to 350° on air-thermometers
with a glass envelope. The errors may become more considerable,
and even rise to several degrees when the temperature exceeds 300°,
if, the dilatation of the envelope between 0° and 100° being un
known, the apparent coefficient of dilatation be deduced from the
elastic forces which the gas presents from 0° to 100°.
   M. Regnault indicates, in concluding, the possibility of employing
with advantage a thermometer of mercurial vapour, in a great many
cases in which the experiments do not require very minute precision;
that is to say, this instrument would be a pyrometer intended to
measure temperatures above that of the boiling-point of mercury.
The mercury ariving at ebullition drives the air completely out of
the apparatus, and the vapour of mercury, behaving now as a per
manent gas, dilates so as to remain in equilibrium with the external
pressure. By means of a peculiar arrangement, it is possible to ex
tract the mercury which has been condensed on the sides and deter
mine its weight, after the apparatus has cooled down to the tempera
ture of the surrounding medium. By means of a very simple formula,
and by admitting for mercurial vapour the same coefficient of dila
tation as that of air, the temperature to which the apparatus has
been exposed may be determined. It is requisite only, in order to
avoid the oxidation of the mercury at the beginning of the experi
ment, when the mercurial vapour has not yet driven the air out of
the apparatus, to place in the vessel a little oil of naphtha, which
first drives out the air and then is itself expelled by the mercurial
vapour.
   M. Regnault announces that he intends to execute some experi
ments, by this method, at the porcelain manufactory of Sèvres; we
do not know whether he has realized his project; the results, if he
has obtained any, are still unknown to us.

  NEW PROCESS       FOR   EXTRACTING SUGAR         FROM THE SUGAR
                       CANE,    BY M. MELSENS.
     HE following account of the new and important method of ex
      tracting sugar from the sugar-cane, is abridged from the first of
two long articles recently published in the Courier de l'Europe.

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.               63
    The great difficulty which has been experienced up to the present
time in the preparation of sugar, has been owing to the rapidity
with which it, when dissolved in water, alters by exposure to the
air in hot climates.     It must, however, be clear, since the cells of
the sugar-cane are themselves full of sugar dissolved in water, and
this solution can be kept for a long time in them, without under
going any alteration at all, that if the same conditions which exist
in nature could only be obtained in practice, there is no reason why
an artificial solution of sugar may not be kept unaltered for a con
siderable space of time; or in other words, why water should not
be used for the purpose of dissolving the sugar out of the crude juice
expressed from the cane.
    The difficulties, indeed, are not owing to the sugar or to the water,
but to the air, and the ferments produced by its action on the crude
sap of the sugar-cane. The object of M. Melsens was, then, to ex
 clude the air from the sap when extracted from the cane, and to
 prevent the formation of any ferments which might change the cha
 racter of the saccharine matter.      This he has succeeded in doing by
 availing himself of the well-known affinity of sulphurous acid for
 oxygen gas. Sulphurous acid, however, alone was found not to
 answer the purpose; the sulphuric acid, produced by the absorption
 of oxygen by sulphurous acid, acting on the sugar, converts it into
 grape-sugar.      This difficulty has been overcome by using sulphurous
 acid combined with a powerful base, which, as the sulphurous acid
 is converted into sulphuric acid, combines with the latter and forms
  an insoluble salt.
     The acid sulphites, and more especially the bisulphite of lime,
  were employed by M. Melsens for the double purpose of preventing
  fermentation by the action of the sulphurous acid, and of neutralising
  the sulphuric acid as fast as it formed by means of the lime.
     Sugar-candy dissolved in cold water containing bisulphite of lime,
  even in excess, crystallized entirely, and without undergoing any
  change, by spontaneous evaporation, at a low temperature.        Several
  other experiments of the same nature, but differing in their details,
  always gave the same result; in each the sugar crystallized out by
  spontaneous evaporation, without any loss either in quantity or in
  quality, and without any appearance of molasses. In these experi
  ments, the sugar dissolved in water, containing bisulphite of lime in
  excess, was boiled, and then left to evaporate, sometimes after being
  filtered, sometimes without any filtration at all.
     From the experiments which M. Melsens has made with bisulphite
   of lime, it is probable that if a cold solution of this salt were to be
   poured on the sugar-cane grinder, so as to mix with the juice the
   moment it is expressed from the cane, the sugar might be kept
   for some time, and might be exposed to the heat necessary for its
   clarification without any sensible loss or deterioration.
      But this same salt also possesses the property of coagulating, at a
   temperature of 212°, milk, white of egg, blood, and yolk of egg
   mixed with water. At a temperature of 212°, bisulphite of lime acts
   as a clarifier. It separates the albumen, caseum, and other similar

 64.          Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
 azotized matters which are found in the sugar-cane. This separation
 is effected without appreciable loss in the quantity, or deterioration
 in the quality, of the sugar.
    Bisulphite of lime, moreover, rapidly and tolerably effectually
 bleaches the coloured substances found in the sugar-cane; it pre
 vents the formation of other coloured matters produced by the action
 of air on the pulp of the cane; it also stops the production of those
 which are formed during evaporation, and above all of those which
 require for their development the joint action of air and a free alkali.
    It seems that coloured substances which, under ordinary circum
 stances, are formed spontaneously by the exposure of the pulp of the
 sugar-cane to the air, never make their appearance when bisulphite
 of lime is employed. By evaporating, at a low temperature, bisulphite
 of lime mixed with–1, a common solution of sugar; 2, the crude sap
of the sugar-cane; 3, the juice of beet-root; no coloration was pro
 duced.    By an evaporation of the same substances at a high tem
perature, the coloration was scarcely visible; indeed, with red beet
root the colour was completely destroyed, and the sugar obtained
was perfectly white.
    It seems, then, that bisulphite of lime can be employed in the
extraction of sugar:—1st, as an antiseptic, preventing the production
and action of any ferment; 2nd, as a substance greedy of oxygen,
opposing any alteration that might be caused by its action on the
juice; 3rd, as a clarifier, coagulating at a temperature of 212° all
albuminous and other coagulable matters; 4th, as a body bleaching
all pre-existing coloured products; 5th, as a body opposing itself in
a very high degree to the formation of coloured substances; 6th, as
a base capable of neutralising any hurtful acids which might exist or
be formed in the juice, and substituting in their place a weak in
active acid, namely, sulphurous acid.
   M. Melsens is of opinion that sugar can be obtained from the
sugar-cane with no other source of heat than a tropical sun, except
ing only for the purpose of clarification; indeed, the bisulphite of
lime prevents the crude juice of the cane, or the syrup obtained
therefrom, from undergoing any changes; great rapidity in the pro
cess of crystallization, indispensable at present, becomes by using
this salt unnecessary; and more than this, the quantity of sugar
which is now lost in the bagasse, in consequence of the impossibility
of washing it out unchanged, can be all collected by being dissolved
in water charged with bisulphite of lime.
   The only objection that can be made to the above process is, that
the sugar obtained by means of bisulphite of lime has a sulphurous
taste; this is true, but the taste is completely lost—1st, by crushing
the sugar and exposing it to the air, whereby the little sulphite of
lime which there may be is converted into a tasteless sulphate; 2nd,
by exposing the sugar to an atmosphere containing ammonia; if this
is done the sugar acquires a very agreeable flavour of vanilla, but is
apt to become a little discoloured; 3rd, by clarifying it until it loses
10 per cent. of its weight; by this process a pure white sugar can be
obtained, which will bear comparison with any sample produced at

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                 65
 present. The last is the process recommended to be used on a large
 scale. The quantity of sugar fit for the market which can be ob
 tained from the sugar-cane by adopting bisulphite of lime, as above
 recommended, is at least double that obtained by the usual pro
 CeSSeS.
    In consequence of M. Melsens having made all his experiments on
 the sugar-cane at Paris, and therefore on a small scale, he is not
 able to state how bisulphite of lime can best be used in the large
 colonial sugar manufactories, but is compelled to leave the application
 of the principles on which his method depends to the intelligence of
 the manufacturers themselves.                   -
    In the preparation of beet-root sugar bisulphite of lime is quite as
 useful as in the extraction of cane-sugar; the way in which it is to
 be employed in the former is fully explained in the second article
 published in the 507th number of the Courier de l'Europe, to which
 we must refer those among our readers who desire any further in
formation on the subject.—Gard. Chron., Dec. 15, 1849.

      To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,
   Having lately had occasion to advert to the superior practical
utility of Fahrenheit's thermometric scale, as not ordinarily requiring
decimal divisions and negative degrees like its congeners, it occurred
to me that a superior scale was feasible by dividing the distance from
–40° Fahr. = -40° Cent. = –32° Reaum. unto the boiling-point
+212° Fahr. = + 100° Cent. = +80° Reaum. into one thousand
degrees, placing zero at the former temperature. Thus one of my
degrees =0°:252 Fahr. =0° 140 Cent. =0° 112 Reaum.; and except
for some chemical purposes and extraordinary arctic temperatures
no negative degrees would be necessary.
   If the zero were placed at
           –38° Fahr. = —38°-8 Cent. = —31°-1 Reaum.,
             my degree        =#     Fahr. = #  Cent. =:   Reaum.

   In a small tract printed ten years ago, I showed that the idea of an
absolute zero of cold expressible by a thermometer (Library of Useful
Knowledge, Heat, ch. viii.) involved some fallacy. Fill a cylindrical
tube with a heat-dilatable fluid, e.g. air, and continuing the divisions
to each end of the tube, we should find that as air expands #5th
in volume per degree from 32° Fahr. to 212° Fahr., the bottom
of the tube would have –480+32=-448°Fahr. marked on it.
Fill such a tube with mercury, which expands wwwnth per degree
betwixt the same extremes, and the bottom of the tube will indicate
 —£958° Fahr.         Now could the substance ever contract to the
bottom of the tube, its density must become infinitely great, as it
then forms an infinitesimally thin stratum. May it therefore not be
concluded that every substance has its own minimum temperature
for maximum density, above or below which it expands just as water
on each side of 39°Fahr.; the latter fluid having the lion's share of
this peculiarity, just as magnetism is ordinarily visible in iron above
all other metals, resembling in some sort the elective affinity so
common in chemical combinations ?

ACTION OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID ON THE HYDRATES OF OIL OF

   If one of the hydrates of oil of turpentine be treated with hydro
chloric acid, water is separated and camphor formed, that is to say
a hydrochlorate of the oil combined with water. The product is not
similar to the solid camphor of turpentine, either in composition or
chemical properties, but it appears to be identical with the camphor
of oil of lemons.     Its composition is as follows:

   Its melting-point is the same as that of the camphor of oil of
lemons, that is to say about 113°F.; when this hydrochlorate is
heated, it is decomposed, and loses hydrochloric acid. Treated with
potassium, it gives rise to a fluid colourless oil, the odour of which
may be mistaken for that of the oil of lemons. When the decom
position is effected at the lowest possible temperature, the product
obtained has the sweet odour of lemon-peel; when, on the other hand,
the camphor is made to boil, so as to deprive it of acid as much as
possible, so that the decomposition by the potassium takes place at
a high temperature, the odour of the product resembles that of citren,
or the substance resulting from the action of lime on the oil of lemons.

      ON THE DRY DISTILLATION OF CAMPHORATE OF LIME.
    MM. Gerhardt and Lies-Bodart have found that the dry distillation
of the salts of lime and organic acids produces interesting results,
which serve as a transition between different series: with the excep
tion of suberic acid, monobasic acids only have been examined in
this respect: the authors have made experiments with camphoric
acid, the characters of which as a bibasic acid are very distinct.
They have ascertained that camphorate of lime yields by heat an
essential oil, possessing the odour of oil of peppermint, and that its
composition is similar to that of the acetonides of the monobasic
acids. This oil is represented by C"H"O=2 volumes of vapour.
 It is remarkable on account of the metamorphoses which it under
goes by anhydrous phosphoric acid, which converts it into cumen,
C” H”=2 volumes of vapour; its identity with which the authors
have ascertained by the easy formation and analysis of sulphocu
 menate of barytes, C” H” BaSO”. This reaction associates the cam
phoric to the cuminic, and consequently to the benzoic series. As
 camphoric acid, though bibasic, offers no exception to the general
 rule, it is probable that the anomaly which is presented by suberic
 acid may be got rid of by more complete researches.—L'Institut,

                CYAN IDE AND NITRURET OF TITANIUM.
    W. Woehler has examined the cubic crystals obtained from the
 iron blast furnaces and hitherto supposed to be metallic titanium; he
 has found that they are formed of cyanide and nitruret of titanium;
 they contain 18 per cent. of nitrogen and 4 per cent. of carbon, their
 formula being TiC*N+3TiN (or TCy+3TiaN).
    M. Woehler also states that the titanium obtained by M. H. Rose
 is a nitruret of titanium containing 28 per cent of nitrogen, its for
 mula is Ti” N*.
    The cubic crystals fused with hydrate of potash yield ammoniacal
  gas; these crystals, heated in a current of chlorine, produce a liquid
  chloride of titanium, and a very volatile crystallized body, which is
  a compound of cyanide and chloride of titanium; the latter substance
  may be obtained by exposing chloride of titanium to gaseous chloride
  of cyanogen.     By heating the cubes to redness in a current of
  aqueous vapour the latter is decomposed, hydrogen gas is obtained,
  as already observed by M. Regnault; but there are also produced

  ammonia and hydrocyanic acid. The titanic acid which is left pos
  sesses the same octohedral form as anatase; it is artificial anatase.
  M. Woehler succeeded in forming cubic crystals by heating a mixture
  of titanic acid and ferrocyanide of potash in a forge. As to the
  simple nitruret, it is very easily obtained by heating titanic acid to
  redness in a current of ammoniacal gas, or of cyanogen or hydrocy
  anic acid gas. This substance always possesses a remarkable me
   tallic lustre.
       By the same process M. Woehler has obtained the nitrurets of
  several other metals, with which he is at present occupied.—

          ANALYSIS OF CAST IRON.         BY F. C. WRIGHTSON, ESQ.
.      The effect of phosphorus in producing what is termed “cold short
   iron” has long been admitted. That the use of the hot blast occa
   sioned an increase in the phosphorus of the iron has, however, so
    far as I am aware, never been suspected; at all events, the fact has
    never been announced. It was with the view of elucidating this
    point, and also of furnishing more complete analyses of cast iron than
    had yet been done, that I undertook, in the autumn of last year, a
    series of analyses, the results of which I communicated to the Bir
    mingham Philosophical Society; and they were afterwards published
    in No. 3 of the ‘Quarterly Journal of the Chemical Society. It is
    necessary to mention this for reference, the results as to phosphorus
    being partly deduced therefrom. I have endeavoured in the present
    analyses more completely to establish the fact, that the hot blast
    increases the “cold shortness” of iron, by occasioning the reduction
    of a larger amount of phosphoric acid. I have also paid some atten
    tion to the different states in which carbon appears to be combined,
     which I shall point out; a fact previously noticed by Bromeis and
    Karsten.                                                    -
        Karsten states, that if the ore contains phosphoric acid, he has
     invariably found it as phosphorus in the slag. I have appended a
     number of analyses of the ores from which the cast irons were made.
     Phosphoric acid exists in most of them to a considerable extent.
     They are never smelted separately, but indiscriminately, two, three
     or four kinds at once.
        Karsten states, that the artificial graphite, obtained by dissolving
     gray iron in an acid, must be considered as a compound of carbon
     and iron. He does not, however, give any analyses of this substance.
     I have examined some specimens obtained by treating the irons C.I.,
     C. III., H. VII. and H. VIII., and subjoin the analyses of three; (see
     p. 74.) I had not sufficient material to complete that of No. VII.
     Those of the higher numbers contain carbon and iron (besides small
     quantities of silica, &c.) in nearly their equivalent ratios; whilst the
     lower numbers appear to be mixtures of silicates of oxide of iron,
     &c., with varying proportions of carbon.       It would seem, in fact, as
     though the carbon of the latter had separated from the molten iron
      in an uncombined state, and that of the former as a carburet. I say,
     “separated from the iron,” to distinguish it from that which evi

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                 69
dently remains combined in the iron, with it or other elements, or it
could not be eliminated as a hydrocarbon when the iron is treated
with acids; but the nature of these combinations of carbon would
be an ample subject for distinct investigation. In distinguishing
between the carbons existing in the specimens, I would only observe
that the b-carbon is separated by acids, and may be collected on a
filter, whilst the a-carbon cannot be so collected; it escapes as a
hydrocarbon, having a powerful alliaceous odour, and may be par
tially collected as a liquid. I have only further to notice the in
variable presence of sodium or potassium, or both, in these irons.
Karsten states that they have not been found as constituents of iron
hitherto. As they are present in only a few of the ores, they are
probably, in part at least, derived from the smelting materials.
   Method of Analysis for the Irons.—The specimens were easily
broken into small pieces in a steel mortar. In one portion of from
20 to 30 grs. the sulphur and phosphorus were determined. In a
second quantity, all the other constituents were determined except
the carbon. On being treated with HCl and warmed, the iron is
quickly acted on, and in a few hours dissolved, leaving black flakes
and particles floating in the liquid. These were collected on a filter
previously dried at 212° and weighed. After well washing, until
no trace of HCl remained, the filter was again dried and weighed.
The increase was carbon principally, with small quantities of sili
cates of oxides of iron, lime, &c., and in the numbers VII. and VIII., iron
in an equivalent proportion to the carbon. In these latter, as also in
the numbers I. and III., the silica, iron, &c. of the substance sepa
 rated by the filter were determined by fusing it with nitrate of pot
 ash mixed with twice its weight of carbonate of soda; the iron, &c.,
 separated in the usual manner, gave the carbon by loss. This was
 afterwards verified in two instances by a direct determination of the
 carbon in a combustion-tube. The iron, &c., separated in the
 above manner, was added to that obtained from the solution. The
 carbon was designated b, and being deducted from the entire quan
 tity found in the iron by the method to be detailed, gave the quan
 tity of carbon designated a for the reason before named. The fil
 tered liquid and washings, evaporated to dryness and again treated
 with acid and water, usually left a minute portion of silica, which
 was separated, weighed, and added to the former quantity. A cur
 rent of sulphuretted hydrogen being passed through a small quantity
 of the solution, it in no case gave any other than a milk-white pre
 cipitate of sulphur. After being carefully freed from this and from
 SH, it was returned to the main solution, NO" added, and boiled
 until all the iron was peroxidized, and ammonia added gradually
 until the solution only faintly reddened litmus, and nearly all the
 iron was precipitated. A little neutral benzoate of ammonia sepa
 rated the last portions of the peroxide of iron. The precipitate,
 after well washing, was dried, ignited, weighed and examined for
 manganese by fusion with nitrate and carbonate of potash; for chrome
 and alumina by dissolving in ClH, and precipitating with caustic

 70            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
 potash in excess; only minute traces of alumina were occasionally
 found. But the peroxide had in one or two instances to be
 redissolved and the manganese separated afresh. This occurred
 when ammonia had been added to the solution in excess, and
 a few drops of HCl again added, which were not sufficient to
 neutralize or acidify the whole of the solution, which from being
 very bulky required care in neutralizing. When the entire solution,
 after attaining the requisite degree of acidity, was transferred from
 one vessel to another so as to obtain a uniform mixture, then no
 trace of manganese was found with the iron. From the amount of
 peroxide the per-centage of iron was calculated. Before proceeding
 to separate the manganese, the solution and washings were evapo
 rated to dryness, and the salts of ammonia driven off by ignition to
 redness. This, I had found from repeated trials, was absolutely
 necessary, in order to separate the whole of the manganese by hydro
 sulphate of ammonia. After ignition, the residue was always of
 a brown colour from the peroxide of manganese; a drop or two of
 HCl dissolved this. Ammonia and hydrosulphate of ammonia
 were then added, and the solution allowed to stand for several hours,
 and gently warmed. The sulphuret of manganese thus separated
 was converted into sulphate of manganese, from which the per
 centage of manganese was calculated. In one or two cases, where
 small quantities of nickel and cobalt were present, these were left as
 sulphurets on the filter, when the sulphuret of manganese was dis
 solved by dilute sulphuric acid. The solution, after getting rid of the
 excess of hydrosulphate of ammonia, was neutralized, and oxalate of
ammonia added. The lime thus separated was converted into car
bonate, and from it the proportion of calcium deduced.         A drop or
two of the solution with phosphate of soda occasionally indicated very
minute traces of magnesia; these were overlooked. After separating
the lime, the solution was evaporated to dryness, ignited in a platinum
capsule, and the residue, consisting of the alkaline chlorides, weighed;
a few drops of solution of bichloride of platinum being added to the
moistened salts, the potash was separated (when sufficient in quan
tity to weigh) in the usual manner; the weight of the chloride of
potassium calculated, and deducted from the weight of the mixed
chlorides; the loss gave the weight of the chloride of sodium.
   Determination of the Sulphur and Phosphorus.—The iron, re
duced to fragments, was treated with fuming nitric acid and gently
warmed; the reaction was violent. The nitrous fumes given off
contained no trace of SH. The solution was evaporated to dryness,
and the dried mass treated with HCl and water; to a little of the
filtered solution a drop or two of BaCl were added; if, after standing
several hours, any precipitate or cloudiness was occasioned, the
whole of the solution was treated in like manner, and the sulphate
of barytes allowed fully to subside, separated, detached from filter,
&c., and the weight of sulphur calculated. The excess of baryta was
separated from the solution by a few drops of dilute SO3, and after
wards supertartrate of ammonia added in sufficient proportion to

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                 71
prevent the precipitation of the iron by ammonia, which was then
added in considerable excess, and a current of SH passed through
the solution for several hours.     The solution was then allowed to
stand in a warm place until it had become of a clear light yellow
colour, when it was quickly filtered and washed with water con
taining a little hydrosulphate of ammonia. The solution was then
evaporated to dryness, the ammoniacal salts driven off by ignition,
and the residue, consisting of phosphoric acid, with minute portions
of lime, alumina and alkalies, fused with a little carbonate of potash
and soda. [This fusion sometimes required repeating once or twice
before the whole of the phosphoric acid was detached as tribasic
alkaline phosphates.] The PO" was then determined in the usual
manner as the ammonio-phosphate of magnesia.
   Determination of Carbon.—The iron was reduced to a moderately
fine powder by being turned in a lathe. A still finer powder was
obtained from this by sifting through lawn. About 30 or 40 grs.
of this were rubbed for a considerable time in an agate mortar along
with about its own weight of hard white sand, which had been pre
viously mixed with a little oxide of copper, and ignited to destroy
any traces of organic matter. When an almost impalpable powder
was thus obtained (care being taken to avoid any loss by rubbing
over a sheet of glazed paper), it was mixed with 6 or 8 times its
bulk of chromate of lead, and introduced into a combustion-tube, at
the extreme point of which a few grains of chlorate of potash had
been placed; the combustion was conducted with the usual precau
tions, and the carbon calculated from the carbonic acid formed, the
latter of course being passed through a CaCl tube previous to absorp
tion. Trials were made with the substances remaining in the com
bustion-tube, to ascertain if any trace of carbon remained therein;
but no trace of carbonic acid was obtained by attempted recom
bustion of substances again powdered.
   Nitrogen was sought for in the iron by mixing the powder with
soda-lime, &c.; but none, or only such minute traces of ammonia
were obtained as to render it questionable if they might not have been
derived from the atmosphere of the laboratory. I append a com
parison of the proportions of phosphorus in the hot and cold blast
iron, taken from this and the series of analyses before alluded to.
No. V. is generally considered the best in quality for forge iron,
Nos. VII. and VIII.being too brittle, this in all probability arising from
the different mode in which the carbon is combined. The difference
in appearance between these two irons and the others is remarkable,
being of a much whiter and finer fracture, with only a few grayish
specks in the centre of the “pig." In No. V. these are much increased,
and the colour is of a mottled gray; in Nos. IV. and III. the colour is
still darker. These different appearances can be caused in the same
iron simply by altering the time of cooling; if, for example, when
the iron of the gray or mottled kind is running, a portion just set be
thrown into cold water, it becomes precisely similar to No.VII. or VIII.

 aspect and fracture of the gray iron by being frequently heated to
 whiteness and very gradually cooled down. It would seem, in fact,
 as though the carbon, in part at least, were held in solution in the
 molten iron, just as certain salts are in hot water; and that in the
 gray iron, during the process of cooling, a considerable part had
 been deposited in an uncombined state, either from its being present
 in larger quantity or from being more slowly cooled.

that all, or nearly all, the iron in C. I. and C. III. must have been
in the state of peroxide, whilst that of C. VIII. must necessarily
have existed in the metallic state, or rather as a carburet.                                         With

ON THE PERIODICAL APPEARANCE OF SHOOTING STARS FROM
    THE 13TH TO THE 15TH OF NOVEMBER.                  BY VON HUM
    BoLDT *.
   I learned with astonishment from the newspapers that it had just
been stated to the Academy that the fall of shooting stars from the
12–14 November had advanced this year twenty-four days; that the
fall of the Asteroids took place from the 15th to the 17th of Octo
ber. This change of the node (of the intersection of the ring of the
Asteroids and of the orbit of the earth), a change so abrupt from
one year to another (the phaenomenon having been invariably at
tached to the 12–17 of November from 1799 up to 1848), seemed to
me hardly probable. In fact, the fall which is asserted to have been
observed the 15–17 of October 1849, did not cause the great phae
nomenon of November in this same year to disappear. At the Ob
servatory of Breslau, M. de Boguslawski and a great number of
young students who are acquainted with the constellations and know
how to observe the time, were placed at six large windows taking in
the whole horizon.      On the 12th of November, from 10h 30" to
12h 30m, there were reckoned in all 88 shooting stars, 78 of which
have been traced on maps: 1 was of the magnitude of Venus, 1 of Ju
piter, 15 of stars of the first magnitude, 31 of the second magnitude.
On the 13th of November, again twenty-six observers, but a little
fog. They could only take observations from 10" 30" to 12" 15".
They saw 69 shooting stars, 62 of which were marked on maps of
the heavens.      At 10" 23' 12", mean time of Breslau, a fire-ball tra
versed from the Cameleopard toward the Great Bear. Also 1 shoot
ing star as large as Venus, 9 as stars of the first magnitude, 20 of
the second magnitude, 25 of the third magnitude. Observations
will be made at Breslau from 10h 30" to 12" 30", from the 6th to
the 12th of December, on account of the period on which I have
insisted in the Kosmos. You will recollect that the three great
falls of shooting stars (such as have not been seen in Europe in
 this century) were, on the 12–13 November 1799, Cumana; the
 12–13 November 1833, North America; the 13–14 November
 1834, North America. Since then the falls have frequently been

in the night of 13–14 November, and we might have conjectured
a movement of the node.          You will remark that in 1849 the
phaenomenon has been most developed again the 12–13, such as
 M. Bonpland and I observed it half a century ago. The October
 stream, which has been observed this year, from 15–17 October, is
independent of the November stream, since they have both been seen
in the same year 1849. It is remarkable that the Arabian writers
also notice two enormous falls, one of the 19 October 1202 (Fraehn,
in the Bulletin de l'Académie de Saint Pétersbourg, t. iii. p. 308),
and the other, October 902, on the night of the decease of King
Ibrahim-ben-Ahmed (Conde, Historia de la dominacion de los Arabes,
p. 346.).    M. Sédillot might find the precise date of the death of
this king.    I think that many apparent anomalies are explained, if
we admit that the stream is of a certain magnitude, a variable magni
tude; and that the asteroids, in the annular zone, are unequally
distanced and agglomerated.       Have we not seen the comet of Biela
divide into two comets, since December 19, 1845, each having its
tail, advancing parallel at twenty minutes distance from one another !
Cosmical nebulae, that have so little mass, such as comets, fire-balls,
and shooting stars, must be subject to undergo many transforma
tions in form, direction and velocity.
               ON TEREBIC ACID.        B.Y. M. A. CAILLOT.
   M. A. Caillot, Professor of Medicine at Strasburgh, has obtained
a new product which he calls terebic acid, by treating oil of turpen
time with nitric acid.
   This acid, under the influence of heat, as also all other acids, the
temperature of which may be raised from 266° to 275° F., is con
verted into carbonic acid and pyro-terebic acid.
   The formula of this acid uncombined is C"H"O": it produces
several kinds of salts.
   A. Monobasic salts: the formula of these is C"H"O", MO; they are
soluble in water and crystallizable. They are obtained by treating
terebic acid with insoluble carbonates, or by double decomposition.
   B. Terebic acid forms other saline compounds which contain 2
equivalents of base for the 14 equivalents of carbon contained in the
acid. If the circumstances resembled common bibasic acids, the for
mula of these salts would be C*H*O", 2MO. M. Caillot obtained
only one thus constituted; it was an insoluble salt of lead.
   In all the other bibasic salts, the water of the terebic acid, instead
of being eliminated, remains in the salts, or even with certain bases,
three equivalents are added. This water is essential to the consti
tution of the salt, for it cannot be expelled without disengaging
pyrogenous compounds at the same time.
   Adopting the generally received opinions of science, we are led to
admit the existence of two new acids, both of them bibasic; one of
these, which the author calls diaterebic acid, is represented by the
formula C*H"O"-H2HO; the other, which he names metaterebic
acid, has the formula C*H"O"+2HO.

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.               77
    The formula of the metaterebates is C*H"O", 2MO; those ob
tained by the author are the metaterebates of barytes, strontia,
potash, soda, magnesia and manganese. They are perfectly soluble
in water, and most of them crystallizable.      They are formed, either
by neutralizing the acid with the bases, or by double decomposition.
The metaterebates of zinc, nickel and iron, obtained by double de
composition, are almost immediately converted into monobasic tere
bates, and deposit half their bases.
     The formula of the diaterebates is C*H" O°, 2MO.         M. Caillot
has obtained the salts of lime, silver, copper and lead. All may be
 prepared by double decomposition, but the diaterebate of lime may
be obtained by direct means. This last salt is soluble and crystal
lizable; the others are nearly insoluble.
     C. Compounds of Lead.—Besides the terebate of lead and the
 diaterebate, M. Caillot has obtained several other remarkable com
 pounds.     By dissolving two equivalents of oxide of lead in an equi
 valent of terebic acid, there is composed a salt C"H"O"PbO, 2HO,
 soluble in water in all proportions. This compound can part with
 two equivalents of water and leave C*H"O"2PbO, 2PbO.
     On dissolving hydrate of lead in terebic acid, or still better, in a
 concentrated solution of monoterebate of lead, a compound is obtained
 which is soluble in water in all proportions, C*H"O°5PbO=C*H*O"
 5PbO, 2HO.        By long-continued ebullition the solution deposits
 a new salt, the formula of which is C*H*O"5PbO, 2PbO.            A cold
  solution of metaterebate of barytes dissolves a large quantity of the
  oxides of lead and silver. New compounds are formed, respecting
  which M. Caillot has promised future communications.          From the
  facts contained in this memoir it may be concluded—
      1st. That terebic acid combines with all bases so as to produce
  monobasic salts.
      2nd. That when there is an excess of an alkaline base, this acid
  combines with various proportions of water according to the nature
   of the bases, to constitute two new acids, namely, the diaterebic and
   metaterebic, both of which are bibasic.
      3rd. That oxide of lead forms with the terebic acid several com
   pounds, among which are two that are without analogy in che
   mistry, and which the author is inclined to consider as performing
   the functions of acids.
      4th. That the combination of water in the diaterebates and the
   metaterebates appears to be the essential condition of the bibasity of
    these salts. The author is of opinion that this proposition acquires
    additional probability, on considering the facts observed respecting
    the phosphates by Mr. Graham, and those respecting the phosphites
    and hypophosphites by M. Wurtz, and the acids of antimony and
    tin by M. Fremy.—L'Institut, Novembre 7, 1849.                -
           ON THE AETHEREAL COMPOUNDS OF TEREBIC ACID.
                             BY M. A. CAILLOT.
       The results obtained by the author with re.pect to the composition
    of the terebates, induced him to direct his researches to the aethereal

78            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
compounds of terebic acid. Hitherto he has obtained only the com
pounds which correspond to the monobasic terebates; they are repre
sented by the general formula C*H" O'(C"H")O=C"H"O", HO,
(C"H")0.      He has obtained the vinic, amylic and methylic com
pounds, which in their general physical properties much resemble
others; thus at common temperatures they are liquid, oleaginous,
slightly soluble in water; they have a hot, acrid, bitter, but not an
acid taste; the vinic and amylic compounds may be distilled without
undergoing decomposition. M. Caillot was able to determine the
density of the vapour of the vinic compound: it confirmed the results
of the elementary analyses.       The methylic compound is altered
by distillation.
   These compounds act with bases like acids, but the salts which
they produce are not permanent. The terebovinate proper for ana
lysis was obtained with great difficulty; its formula is C"H"O", BaO,
C*H* O. With the slightest increase of temperature these vinic salts
reproduce the alcohol from which they are formed, and generate a
bibasic metaterebate, half of the vinic acid being set free. This
transformation may be represented by the following equation:
   2(C"H"O", Bao, C'H'O)+7HO,(C"H"O"2Bao)+C'H'O'
           +(C*H*O", HO, C*H*O).
   The property which terebic acid possesses of forming vinic acid,
seems to indicate that this acid may produce bibasic anhydrous
salts, of the formula C*H*O"2MO.—L'Institut, Novembre 7, 1849.

                        PARATARTARIC ACID,
   M. Kestner states that this acid was produced for some years, or
from 1822 to 1824 nearly. At this time the tartrates were saturated
with carbonate of lime, and the remainder of the tartrates were pre
cipitated by chloride of calcium; the tartrate of lime was decomposed
by great excess of sulphuric acid, evaporation was effected over the
naked fire, and the solutions of tartaric acid were decolorized by a
current of chlorine gas; this operation was performed cold, and it
was then remarked, and more especially in winter, that crystals of
parataric acid were formed which were carefully separated, because
they rendered the crystallization of the tartaric acid irregular when
they remained mixed with it.
   M. Kestner states that since the above-stated period, tartar has
been saturated by caustic lime, and the tartrate of lime formed is
decomposed by a slight excess of sulphuric acid; no chlorine is now
employed to decolorize the liquors, and no trace of parataric acid is
now obtained.
   It is stated by M. Kestner that he is entirely ignorant whether
the circumstances which he has stated have produced the paratartaric
acid : he has never been able to produce it, neither by the agency of
sulphuric acid, even at high temperatures and heating them for a
long time together, nor by the action of chlorine. Nor has he suc
ceeded in extracting it directly from tartar, although the attempt has
been made on considerable quantities.

    M. Kestner states that he is informed that Mr. Whyte, a manu
facturer of tartaric acid at Glasgow, has also produced paratartaric
acid. He regrets that he is unable to say more on the subject, and
shall be happy if science should put him in the way of reproducing
this interesting acid.—L'Institut, Novembre 14, 1849.

                         By W. BEETz, Ph.D."
IN's                              upon the measurement of the elec
     tromotive force of gas batteries are still wanting. The only
experiments which aim at quantitative determination, are those
in which Grovet measured the change in the volumes of the
gases contained in the tubes of the battery. As a rule, the
diminution of the volumes was found greater in proportion
to the activity of the current produced by the gas. If, how
ever, we require to draw any conclusion regarding electrical
excitation from this measurement, the hypothesis of Grove,
viz. that the combination of the two gases used is the source of
the electricity, and hence the circuit produces no effect when
the gases have no chemical affinity for each other, must first
be proved. Even then much deception might occur in con
sequence of secondary actions, such as were observed by
Grove himself, so that in this manner we should never be able
to obtain values which could in any way be regarded as mea
sures of the electromotive force of gas batteries. Moreover,
in consequence of the great inconstancy of gas batteries, at
least with the use of most gases, experiments made with bat
teries which have remained closed for a long time consecu
tively, only give very dubious results, because with many of
them the polarization entirely renders insensible the original
electromotive force. Even in the case of those which are ap
parently the most constant, those where hydrogen and oxygen,
 and hydrogen and chlorine are used, the original force is
 quickly diminished; the polarization cannot however here at
 tain any very considerable value, because the gases set free by

 electrolysis are for the most part again removed, and thus after
 some time great constancy obtains.
    The object of the following investigations is therefore to
 determine the electromotive force of the gas-battery quite in
 dependently of, or as much so as possible, the disturbing in
fluence which prolonged closure of the current must exert.
 For this purpose, the method of compensation proposed by
 Poggendorff" naturally presented itself; in the application of
which, the resistance of the circuit, the measurement of which
is desired, is entirely unknown, and the circuit requires to be
closed for a moment only.        If three conductors, the resistances
of which are r, r" and r", meet in two points, r being a circuit
the electromotive force of which is k', and r" one the force of
which is k", the total intensity J" existing in r" will be equal
to the intensity which k" would produce alone, minus that
which k' would have produced by its own action; hence
            J" =      k!I rT-          *: #.

Hence when the magnitude k is given, k" is also known by
the measurement of r and r".         The resistances were measured
by a rheochord spun over with German silver wire, in the
same manner as that adopted by Poggendorff, r is represented
directly by a length of wire b; r" consists of a length of wire
a, the resistance of the circuit k' (a Grove's platino-zinc cir
cuit), =w, and the resistance of a galvanometer, with a simple
needle and but few coils, inserted in this closing wire, =g.
Lastly, the resistance r" consists of that of the circuit mea
sured, and that of a delicate galvanometer G provided with
an astatic arrangement, with its conducting wires. Let the
resistances w-Hg be = R. After the positive plate of the cir
cuit under measurement (ex. gr. that platinum plate which is
coated with hydrogen) had been connected by the wire b with
the platinum plate of the Grove's circuit, by the wire a and
the galvanometer g with the zinc plate of the latter, a wire
from the negative plate of the circuit under measurement
(platinum coated with oxygen) was connected with a delicate
galvanometer. Moreover, a wire from the platinum plate of

the Grove's circuit was placed in a cup of mercury, so that
the current in r" could be closed by rapidly immersing the
second wire of the galvanometer in this cup. The length of
b was then fixed by the running clamp-screw of the instru
ment for measuring the resistance, and a altered until the
needle of the galvanometer G on closing the circuit r" remained
at 0.      We then have

R was calculated from both equations. In the present in
stance this method is very convenient, and sufficiently exact
also, when the circuit to be measured is not too inconstant (as
that in which hydrogen and oxygen are used). The follow
ing series of experiments show that this point was attended
to. By a controlling measurement made by Ohm’s method,
I convinced myself of the applicability of the above process.
Lastly, to ascertain the force k', the measuring platino-zinc
circuit was closed by the wire of the rheochord in which a
had been previously measured, the needle of the galvanometer
was then driven to 24°, which deflection I had found to cor
respond to an evolution of 13:36 cubic centimetres on an ave
rage of the mixed gases in the proportion for forming water
per minute. When the necessary resistance was p, we had
                                             k'= R+p,
where unity is that electromotive force, which, with a re
sistance of one centimetre German silver wire of 8.689 spe
cific gravity (the average of four weighings), a centimetre of
which weighs 0.00683 grm. (the mean of five determinations),
evolves 13:36 cubic centimetres of the mixed gases per minute.
With this value of unity, the force of the platino-zinc circuit
is about =42.                From these determinations the values found
may be readily compared with any others. If, for example,
we convert the measurements made by M. Poggendorff from
his unit, in which the force of the Grove's circuit is about
 =32, into mine, this force becomes 42:27. A measurement
may be adduced as an example of this.

    The value found for R in both observations was assumed
 to be constant during the whole series of observations, which
 never occupied a period of more than two hours; the same
 applies to p. All those connexions which were not (like r")
 of equal value, or had been ascertained by calculation from
 their resistance (as those contained in R), were effected by short
 pieces of copper wire of the diameter of about a line.
    Before detailing the experiments in full, a few words more
 must be said upon the preparation of the gas batteries. To
 obtain the platinized platinum in its most effective state, the
 plan proposed by M. Poggendorff was followed; the platiniza
 tion was effected in a dilute solution of chloride of platinum by
 a current from two of Grove's cells, and thus a black coating
 was produced. It will be subsequently seen, however, that in
 the method of measuring adopted, a gray, imperfectly acting
precipitate cannot produce any great changes in the force of
the circuit, as the activity of the finely-divided layer is alto
gether only a secondary one. If two platinum plates are
used to a gas battery, care must first be taken that they are
not capable of exciting any voltaic tension of themselves; they
must be tested as to their being perfectly homogeneous; and if
they are not, they must be made so. Serious error may be
fallen into in regard to this point, if the ordinary means are
used for connecting the plates with each other in the conduct
ing fluid for any time. If, for instance, upon one of the plates
hydrogen in addition to the platinum is precipitated by a
somewhat strong current, as is usually the case, and this is
combined with a clean plate of platinum to form the circuit,
hydrogen separates upon the latter plate; hence the current
will cease before the oxygen evolved at the former plate has
removed the hydrogen which it met with; consequently the ,
plates appear to be homogeneous, but are far from consisting
of pure platinum. I always took care that the hydrogen was
first entirely dissipated, by causing all the plates about to be
used in a series of experiments to act as the anodes for a short
period. The oxygen and the chlorine by which they were
then coated are much more easily removed, either by connect
ing all the plates, on the one hand, with another plate of pla
tinum in a concentrated solution of platinum, so as to form a
circuit, or by boiling them for a long time with water, or what
is still better, by subjecting them to both these processes in
succession. The plates, which were about four inches in length

and a quarter of an inch in breadth, were therefore cemented
into corks before platinization, and after the plates had been
connected in the platinum solution, they were inserted into
tubes about five inches in length; the tubes were then filled
with water; this kept boiling for several minutes, and then
replaced by the conducting fluid (dilute sulphuric acid of
 1 per cent.). This was also heated to ebullition, and the
open end of the tube then immersed in a vessel, which also
contained some of the boiled conducting fluid. The gas
under experiment, in its utmost state of purity, was then ad
mitted into the tube in such a manner that about one-third
of the plate dipped into the liquid. To connect two tubes so
as to form a circuit, an inverted U-shaped tube, filled with the
conducting liquid and connected at each end with a bladder,
was dipped into the two vessels which contained the tubes;
by this arrangement, diffusion of the gases through the liquid
was better prevented than when both the tubes were placed in
the same vessel. If, in measuring, the proportion of a to bin
the first experiments was found to be too defective, so that the
gas-circuit was traversed by a perceptible current, it was first
again tried until the galvanometer G remained at 0; the gas
battery was then taken to pieces, and the whole process of
filling it commenced anew. In the second measurement we
commence with test experiments, which are not so far removed
from the truth as to be capable of altering the battery percep
tibly. The results last obtained only are given. After a little
practice, we are generally enabled to avoid making too great
mistakes in the position of the binding-screws, particularly
when we have obtained an insight into the law which is de

   It is distinctly evident from these series of experiments, that
the electromotive forces of gases, connected by platinized pla
tinum and dilute sulphuric acid so as to form gas batteries,
follow the same law of Volta's tension series as the metals.

88       Dr. Beetz on the Electromotive Force of Gases.
Sufficient agreement of the experiments with this law might
be obtained if the means of the experiments made with the
same matters were taken, and these were considered as the
true electromotive forces; but, properly speaking, only those
experiments belonging to one and the same series ought to
be compared with each other; because in them, even an alte
ration in the composition of a gas, an impurity acquired by it
during the filling of the tubes, &c. cannot exert any influence;
those alterations only would become perceptible which the
gas might have experienced in making the measurements
themselves. In the following tables, the sums of the electro
motive forces of different circuits are compared with the elec
tromotive forces which were observed between the outermost
members of these circuits.

   The agreement between the observed and calculated values
is sufficient to place beyond doubt the position, that gas bat
teries also follow the electromotor law of Volta’s tension series.
   The electromotive forces given in the following table are the
mean results of the observations. The platinum coated with
hydrogen is taken as the starting-point, the numbers opposite
the several substances indicate the electromotive force which
they excite when placed in one of the gas tubes, hydrogen
being placed in the other. To give a clearer idea of the ab
solute value of the forces, those of platinum and zinc and pla
tinum and copper have also been determined, referred to the
same starting-point, and added to the series. In determining
the mean, the observations VI, 6; VIII., 3; and IX., 3,
have been neglected for the reasons there stated. For the
sake of comparison, I have placed the series found by Grove*
opposite my own.

    The above results settle the question of dispute between
Grove" and Schoenbeint, as to whether, in an oxyhydrogen
gas battery, the hydrogen alone, or both gases are active. The
opinion of the latter author is that the hydrogen alone produces
the current; the presence of the oxygen would only then be
of use in lessening the charge of the free plate of platinum
produced by the current. Grove’s experiments show that the
presence of air is necessary for the continuance of the current;
for when the gas battery remained enclosed under a globe
filled with air, from which the oxygen was removed by
the combustion of phosphorus, the intensity of the current
sunk to 0, and on the admission of fresh air it gradually in
creased. This experiment, which corresponds perfectly with
my experiments t upon ordinary hydrogen batteries, Grove
considers an argument against Schoenbein’s view, and he is
certainly correct. That the increase in the current caused
by the oxygen is attributable to a diminution of the charge
is indisputable; but it does not thence follow that the oxygen
exerts no electromotive action. According to the expe
riments detailed above, the electromotive force of platinum
and hydrogen is =20:13; of platinum and oxygen = 3.85;
the oxygen therefore contributes directly to the electric exci
tation, but certainly much less than the hydrogen. Air, ni
trogen, and nitrogenous compounds act with oxygen still more
feebly. The depolarizing action of the oxygen cannot be taken
into consideration here, as the closure of the circuit is merely
momentary.
    As regards the situation of the electric excitation in the gas
battery, this was found by Grove $ to be at the point of contact
of the platinum, gas and liquid. When the platinum did not

touch the liquid, no current was set up, as we should expect;
when it was entirely covered by the liquid, the current was
very feeble. Five oxyhydrogen pairs were not capable of
decomposing iodide of potassium; but when the angles of the
platinum were in contact with the gas, this decomposition was
effected by only one pair of plates. This law does not, how
ever, appear to me generally established. In the case of gases
which are copiously absorbed by water, as chlorine, it is cer
tainly incorrect”; in fact, I found with the circuit of hydrogen
and chlorine that the electromotive force was always greatest
when the chlorine contained in the tube was perfectly ab
sorbed (free from air). It certainly holds good in the case of
other gases, but in a less degree, especially when in ascer
taining the intensity of the current, the circuit is closed for
longer than a moment. The small quantities of gas dissolved
by the conducting liquid are very rapidly consumed by the
gas evolved electrolytically, and the liquid may not be able to
absorb gas throughout its entire mass with sufficient quickness
to bring the current again to a moderate intensity. The expe
riments of Jacobi and Poggendorfff tend to show that platinum
also exerts an action upon the gas when covered by the liquid;
they found that in a voltameter with platinized electrodes, the
quantity of gas evolved entirely disappears again, even after
the water has risen above it.           I however avoided the use of a
voltameter, at the poles of which the gases were evolved, be
cause the electromotive force produced by the polarization is
always greater than that of an ordinary gas battery. The plates
of platinum were cemented into the tubes in the ordinary way,
after the upper parts of them had been thickly coated with
shell-lac. Only that part of the plates thus isolated was sur
rounded by the gases; those parts with a metallic surface re
mained completely immersed in the conducting liquid. In a
circuit arranged thus, I obtained an electromotive force of
15:64, which is much too small. The principal cause of this
was, that the conducting liquid, which at that heat would have
absorbed too little gas, on cooling not only absorbed hydrogen
from above, but also air from below, from contact with which
it was not protected.
    If the platinization of the plates of platinum only increases
the electromotive force of gas batteries because the counter

and gas met.—ED. Phil. Mag.

 the platinum had been purified sufficiently.                     I therefore con

   This agreement was to have been anticipated from the ex
periments which Faraday” made upon the condensing action
of pure platinum upon gases; and Poggendorff't has already
rendered it probable, that the primary forces of gas batteries
with polished, gray, or black platinized plates, would be the
same in each case. But at the same time the agreement of
these observations yields a proof, that with the extremely short
closure of the circuit, which the compensating method requires,
the polarization does not attain any important value; other
wise the polished plates, which are capable of being more
powerfully charged, would give smaller values.
   I finally passed to experiments with gas batteries, the solid
conductor of which consisted of some other body than pla
tinum. I then met with a great difficulty in the small values
of the electromotive forces, which in most cases rendered a
determination of the relation existing between them almost
impossible. Even on using Bunsen’s coke batteries, from
which Poggendorfff anticipated great action, the forces were
not very great, and moreover still variable. It was only with
very great difficulty that I could cut discs of the coke, even
from the same piece, which were tolerably uniform. This is of
more consequence, because after what has been stated above,
we have no means of rendering them uniform artificially. The
pieces of coke were boiled for several hours with nitric acid,
then with water, afterwards with dilute sulphuric acid, and
again with water; yet I very frequently found that when the
tubes were filled with any inodorous gas in which these pieces

sulphuretted hydrogen. Those experiments in which this
occurred always yielded very small results, and were of course
rejected. In those detailed below, no sources of error were
remarked. They show that the relation of the electromotive
forces, when different gases are used, is exactly the same as
with platinum. I have therefore divided the mean electro
motive force of an oxyhydrogen platinum battery by that of
an oxyhydrogen carbon battery, and divided the forces of the
other platinum batteries by the quotient c. In this manner
the last column denoted by “calculated” was obtained. The

   The factor c evidently depends upon the condensation which
the gases experience at the surface of the solid conductor, and
by which the coating of the metal with the gases is rendered
more perfect. Hence this method might be used for deter
mining the relative condensing force of different bodies, if the
absolute magnitudes of the electromotive forces in most mat
ters were not too small.                The coefficient 0.4687 cannot cer
tainly be considered as applying to carbon generally. Other
kinds of carbon may differ very greatly.

    Although the preceding experiments afford many explana
tions of the action of gas batteries, yet they cannot possibly
decide upon the source of the force in them. The solution of
this question, however, in my opinion, would constitute nothing
less than a final decision as to the nature of electricity of con
tact. In fact, the phaenomena which have just been discussed
rank perfectly with those which occur in the excitation of a
current by solid conductors, with the only difference, that the
state of aggregation in the case of the gases may be altered by
the solid bodies in contact with them, which is not the case
with solid conductors: hence the difference in the absolute
values in the case of the forces of the gas batteries, whilst
their relative values remain the same. The special activity of
the positive gases (as hydrogen) depends solely upon the elec
tromotive force of platinum and hydrogen being far greater
than that of platinum and oxygen, or even platinum and chlo
rine; the phaenomenon observed by Matteucci” and others,
that small quantities of hydrogen may exceed the action of
large quantities of oxygen, then forms a simple analogy with
the action of amalgams, in which the positive metal (potas
sium, zinc) preponderates.
    Lastly, regarding the arrangement of the metals and gases
in an electromotor series, as given above, we must not deceive
ourselves regarding its importance. The metals mentioned
(platinum, copper and zinc) hold that position to those gas
batteries which contain plates of platinum; in the case of
other batteries, their position would be different. Whilst, for
instance, zinc is then positive towards hydrogen with a force
of 1968, Bufff found a zinc plate coated with platinum posi
tive towards a polished plate, and subsequently gave a nume
rical value to this tension f; from this he deduced the conclu
sion, that the position of hydrogen was nearer the positive end
of a tension series than zinc, a conclusion which is evidently

premature. He would only have been correct, provided, in
the gas batteries, the metallic plates were so completely coated
with the gases that they only acted as conductors, and did not
come into immediate contact with the liquid. This is, how
ever, evidently not the case; on the other hand, we always
observe the simultaneous action of the metal forming the basis
of the battery; a phaenomenon which is evident when the gas
does not come into contact with the plate itself, but is only
slightly dissolved by the liquid; whilst, when the gas comes
into immediate contact, i. e. at the point of contact of the
metal, the gas and the liquid, the action of the gas is at its
maximum, and the values then obtained are those given above.
I cannot therefore entirely agree with one statement made by
M. Buff", viz. “that the same effect is produced by the layer
of hydrogen at the negative plate of platinum (on polarization),
as also by the layer of oxygen at the positive plate of platinum,
as when, instead of two strips of platinum, a strip of solid hy
drogen and a strip of solid oxygen had been introduced into
the acid;” but I entirely agree with the following remark on this
point:—“The electromotive action excited by the immediate
contact of hydrogen and oxygen, or the electric difference of
the two matters, denotes the extreme limit of the resistance (of
the counter force) which can possibly be produced by the pola
rization of two metals in decomposing cells. This limit is more
approximated in proportion to the power possessed by the im
mersed plates to become coated with the gases, and to the com
pleteness with which the direct contact of the metallic with the
liquid conductor is by this means avoided. If the partly im
mersed strips could be completely isolated from the liquid by
the gases with which they become coated, the chemical nature
of the metallic masses would be a matter of perfect indiffer
ence.” But since the metals are not all equivalent when the
polarization is at its maximum, it can never be admitted that
the plates are completely coated with the gas, nor can the po
larizing values be regarded as the true electromotive forces of
the gases concerned.
   Here, I think, is to be sought for the cause of the phaeno
menon, that plates of the same metal yield a far greater elec
tromotive force when they are coated with the gases by polari
zation than when this is produced by any other means; they
are coated much more perfectly by polarization. The elec
tromotive force thus produced in M. Poggendorff'st experi
ments, when reduced to my unit, would be 55 for polished

   X. The AstroNoMER RoyAL on a Problem of Geodesy.
  To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,
 A    KNOWLEDGE of the result of the following investi
        gation is so necessary for the correct calculation of the
large triangles of modern surveys, and the investigation itself
is so easy, that I imagine that an equivalent solution must have
appeared already. I have not however seen one, and I there
fore think it possible that the publication of my investigation
may not be entirely without utility.
   The problem which I propose to myself is “To find the
curvature-excess upon a surface differently curved in different
directions;” the term curvature-excess having the same mean
ing for this surface which spherical-excess has for a spherical
surface; namely, the quantity by which the sum of the three
angles of a triangle (as observed with a theodolite whose axis
at each angle of the triangle is made perpendicular to the
surface) exceeds 180°. And before entering upon the inves
tigation, I wish to point out that the “geodetic lines” and
“geodetic triangles” of speculative geometers have nothing
to do with this problem. The triangles with which we are
concerned here are the rectilinear triangles formed by the
rays of light, proceeding in straight lines (except so far as they
are influenced by refraction, which does not sensibly affect
their azimuths) from one station to another. The best geo
meters possessing a practical acquaintance with surveys,—
Dalby, Delambre, and Everest,—have fully understood the
difference.
   I must also point out, that, unless we proceed to an exces
sive degree of complication, it is impossible to give the solu
tion with the same degree of completeness as for a spherical
triangle; because a surface is not defined by a mere knowledge
of the principal radii of curvature for one point of the surface,
for a higher order of superficial distances from that point than
the second. Thus, to take a very simple case, a surface having
given principal radii of curvature may be either at the equa
                      * Loc, cit, vol. lxi. p. 600,

       The Astronomer Royal on a Problem of Geodesy. 97
tor of an oblate spheroid, having the greater curvature per
pendicular to the equator, or at the equator of a prolate sphe
roid, having the greater curvature in the equator: but in the
former case, on pursuing the line of greatest curvature, we find
the curvature gradually diminishing; whereas in the latter
case, on pursuing the line of greatest curvature, we find the
curvature continuing invariable. It may also be a portion of
an infinity of other surfaces, the nature of which, on departing
to a sensible distance from the original point, varies in an in
finity of different ways.
   It is necessary, therefore, to confine ourselves to an ap
proximate solution; and it will suffice to use the approximate
formulae (including with the utmost exactness the terms de
pending on the second power of the sides of the triangle, but
no more) which are applicable to the reduction of observed
angles.
   Now any surface-triangle, however placed, may be divided
into four right-angled surface-triangles (of which one is nega
tive), the sides embracing the right angle being in the direc
tion of the greatest and least curvatures respectively. It will
be sufficient to investigate the curvature-excess for one of
these right-angled triangles. For it will be found, as a result
of the investigation, that the curvature-excess which we are
seeking will be expressed by a simple multiple of the area of
the right-angled triangle: and as the curvature-excess of the
large triangle is readily seen to be the algebraical sum of the
curvature-excesses of the four right-angled triangles, and as
the area of the large triangle is the algebraical sum of the
areas of the four right-angled triangles, it follows that the cur
vature-excess of the large triangle will be the same multiple
of the area of the large triangle.
   The process which I shall use is, to compute the reduction
of each of the horizontal angles to the chord-angle; the sum
of these reductions will be the curvature-excess.       The well
known formula for reduction is this: if D and D'be the an
gular depressions of two signals (expressed in parts of the
radius), E the horizontal angle included between them; then
the reduction (expressed in parts of the radius) is

radii of curvature in the directions of v and w. Let the angles

curvature-excess is the same as the spherical-excess of a tri
angle of the same area on the surface of a sphere whose radius
R= VWW.
   The application of this theorem to the triangles of a terres

   One of the deductions from the general expression is, that
the curvature-excess upon a developable surface is =0. For
there one of the radii of curvature is infinite.     This result is
very easily verified in the particular case of the cylinder,
whatever be the magnitude of the triangle. For if, in the first
place, we consider the “geodetic” line upon a cylinder (which,
when inclined to the axis, is a regular helix), it will be ob
vious that its directions at its two extremities make equal
angles with the axis of the cylinder; and next, if we consider
the positions of the planes of reciprocal vision at the two sta
tions (which are different), and their intersections with the
cylindrical surface at the respective points of vision (neither of
which intersections coincides with the helix), it will be obvious
that the directions of these intersections also make equal
angles with the axis of the cylinder; and therefore they are
 equally inclined (one on one side, and the other on the other
 side) to the helix; and therefore the sum of the visual azi
muthal angles in the visual triangle is equal to the sum of the
 angles in the helical triangle. But on developing the surface,
 the helical triangle becomes a rectilinear triangle, or its cur
 vature-excess = 0; and therefore the curvature-excess of the
 visual triangle = 0.

    XI. Chemical Examination of Lettsomite* (Velvet Ore).
                    By JoHN PERCY, M.D., F.R.S.'t
AT the request of Mr. Brooke and Professor Miller(of Cam
        bridge), I have examined chemically some minerals, of
which the composition has not hitherto been satisfactorily
ascertained.                                                    -
    The first which I have analysed is the velvet copper ore,
 Mr. Brooke having supplied me with a specimen containing an
unusually large proportion of the mineral, yet weighing only
 12-8 grs.
    #. analysis.—The quantity employed, after separating
extraneous matter by the aid of a lens, weighed 2.99 grs.
    On adding hydrochloric acid, slight effervescence occurred,
due to the presence of some minute particles of blue carbonate
of copper: only a trace of matter was left undissolved. The
whole was then evaporated to dryness. The residue consisted
of brown interlacing acicular crystals. Hydrochloric acid
was added, and after some time water, when a pale greenish
blue solution was obtained. This was passed through a very
small filter, which, being washed and incinerated, gave only
0.01 grain, its own ash included. The filtrate was treated
with sulphuretted hydrogen, which produced a brown-black
precipitate. This was washed with water containing hydro
chloric acid and sulphuretted hydrogen, and then digested
with dilute nitric acid. The solution was boiled with potash.
The precipitate (CuO), washed and ignited, weighed 1.44 gr.
    The last filtrate was reduced by evaporation and treated
with chloride of barium. A white precipitate (BaO, SO”) was
obtained, which, washed and ignited, weighed 1:34 gr.
    The excess of baryta was separated by sulphuric acid, and
ammonia added, when flocculent white matter, like alumina,
was precipitated, which, by the addition of hydrosulphate of
ammonia, became greenish-black. It was redissolved in hy
drochloric acid, boiled with nitric acid, and again precipitated
by ammonia. Washed and ignited it (Al2O3 and Fe2O3)
weighed 0.35.
      he filtrate, after separation of the alumina and peroxide
   * The name Lettsomite has been assigned to this mineral at the request
of Mr. Brooke, as an acknowledgement of the interesting and useful mine
ralogical assistance he has received from W. G. Lettsom, Esq., whose ex
tensive practical knowledge of minerals, and ample collection of specimens,
have enabled him to supply information which Mr. Brooke would have
found it difficult otherwise to obtain.

      Dr. Percy’s Chemical Examination of Lettsomite.           101
of iron, was treated with hydrosulphate of ammonia. No
further precipitate occurred (absence of zinc).
   Second analysis.—Weight of the mineral, carefully freed
from extraneous matter by the aid of a lens, 4:25 grs. It
was introduced into a very small tube closed at one end; the
other end was then drawn out and connected by a caoutchouc
joint with a small U-tube filled with chloride of calcium.
This was similarly connected with a large U-tube, also filled
with chloride of calcium, and communicating with an exhaust
ing pump; so that, by alternately exhausting and allowing the
air to enter, the water expelled from the mineral by heat
might be collected in the small U-tube and weighed. The
tube containing the mineral was heated in an oil-bath at 500°F.
for a considerable time. A sensible quantity of water was
evolved, and the mineral acquired a dull green colour. The
small U-tube increased in weight 0:46 gr., whilst the tube
containing the mineral lost 0.45. The difference, 0.01, was
probably owing to the air having occasionally been allowed to
pass too rapidly from without through the large U-tube to be
completely desiccated. On gently heating the tube contain
ing the mineral over a spirit-lamp, a further quantity of water
was separated. The heat was increased to dull redness for a
few seconds, and the water, which condensed in the upper
  art of the tube, expelled. This further loss by heat was 0.53.
   he total loss, therefore, by heat was 0.98, which may be esti
mated as water, for the water last evolved did not redden lit
mus. The error, certainly, does not exceed 1:27 per cent,
as proved by the following determination of sulphuric acid.
 The mineral, deprived of water by heat, was digested in di
lute nitric acid.     Some reddish-brown matter remained un
 dissolved, which, after ignition, and including the ash of a
 very small filter, weighed 0.10. Chloride of barium was added
 to the solution. The sulphate of baryta, washed and ignited,
 weighed 1.74.
    The excess of baryta was separated by sulphuric acid. The
 copper was precipitated by sulphuretted hydrogen, and de
 termined as in the first analysis. The oxide of copper weighed
 1:98.   It was redissolved in dilute nitric acid, and treated with
 excess of carbonate of ammonia; but no precipitate occurred
 after standing many hours.
    The alumina was separated from the peroxide of iron by
 potash. After adding hydrochloric acid to the potash solu
 tion of alumina, it was boiled with a little chlorate of potash
 (Fresenius). Ammonia in slight excess was added. The
 alumina, washed and ignited, weighed 0.47.

102       Dr. Percy's Chemical Examination of Lettsomite.
   The peroxide of iron was redissolved in hydrochloric acid
and precipitated by ammonia; washed and ignited, it weighed
0-05.
   In every instance the washing of the precipitates was con
tinued until the wash-water either ceased to be rendered in
the slightest degree turbid by nitrate of silver, or to leave an
appreciable residue by evaporation.
    Phosphoric acid was sought for in the alumina obtained in
the second analysis, and detected both by Berzelius's process
(fusing with silica and carbonate of soda, and subsequent pre
cipitation by ammonia and chloride of magnesium), and Svan
berg's test, molybdate of ammonia. But by the latter test
phosphoric acid was also detected in the potash used in the
preceding analysis, although prepared with alcohol. And
the same test also indicated its presence in the carbonate of
potash from which the potash was derived. On testing the
mineral directly with molybdate of ammonia, I did not detect
phosphoric acid; and I have obtained the same result with
another specimen of velvet ore, which I have recently received
from Berlin. I am particular in stating these facts, because
it is obviously of great importance to the analytical chemist
that his potash should be free from phosphoric acid, especially
in the separation of alumina from iron*.
    Matrix.—It consists chiefly of hydrated peroxide of iron,
but contains also alumina, lime, oxide of copper, sulphuric
acid, silica, and a trace of phosphoric acid (by Svanberg's
test). Here and there upon the surface is some amorphous
white matter, which is probably a basic sulphate of alumina,
as it contains alumina and sulphuric acid.

   The results of the preceding analyses agree very well with
 each other and with the composition deduced from this for
mula, when it is considered that different parts of the specimen
were operated on, that the quantities employed were neces
sarily very small, and that it was impossible to separate per
fectly the extraneous matter, consisting of brown (Fe°O”)
and white particles (probably basic sulphate of alumina).
   I have not attempted to deduce any rational formula, as
probably several might be proposed equally plausible.
   On a future occasion I hope to present the results of the
examination of another substance which frequently accom
panies velvet copper ore.

70.   IT was found (48.) that by particular management the
          boiler was rendered positive by the escape of steam.
I have since then discovered a more advantageous method of
producing this effect.                                          -

                     t Communicated by the Author.

104 Mr. R. Phillips on the connexion of the Electricity of
valve, which admitted of a pressure being maintained in the
boiler equal to about 6 lbs. on the inch; everything else was
as before (48.). The boiler was connected with the single
leaf electrometer. When the cock was opened a little, so
that the steam might escape from the brass jet with very little
force, probably a few ounces on the inch, the boiler became
feebly positive. On opening the cock more, the positive elec
tricity of the boiler became stronger until the pressure at the
jet was increased to what I estimated to be about 3 lbs. on
the inch; afterwards the positive electricity of the boiler be
came less, and at 6 lbs. on the inch the boiler was strongly
negative.
    72. The larger collector was placed in the steam at a di
stance of about 6 inches from the brass jet, and united with
the single-leaf electrometer. Many of the lower pressures
which readily made the boiler positive did not cause the
steam to give any electricity to the electrometer; but when
 the pressure was increased to 2 or 3 lbs. on the inch, a nega
 tive charge was given to the electrometer. The negative state
 of the steam, like the positive state of the boiler, went on in
 creasing, within certain limits, with the pressure. The boiler
 was always positive when the steam was negative.
    73. When the pressure was increased to a degree a little
 lower than that at which the boiler changed from positive te
 negative, the steam communicated a positive charge to the col
 lector, even at a distance of a foot from the end of the brass jet.
    74. The Armstrong's condenser with water, being inter
 posed between the boiler and jet, did not much alter the above
 effects; however, I think I may certainly say that the boiler
 changed from positive to negative at a lower pressure than it
 did without the condenser. When the boiler was positive, the
 sound of the steam was a smooth hiss; but as the pressure
 was increased it changed to a roar, the boiler becoming at the
 same time negative. With a very feeble roar the boiler was
 neutral, which neutrality I have occasionally observed without
 the condenser. The steam was also found to be negative as
 before; I did not however try to make the steam and boiler
 both positive with this arrangement.
    75. The gun-barrel and brass tube were placed before the
jet as formerly (58.), and connected with the boiler and single
 leaf electrometer, the steam being at about 6 lbs. on the inch.
 When the cock was fully opened, the electrometer was power
 fully acted on by positive electricity; and on holding the large
 collector in the steam and then bringing it to this electrometer,
 it also communicated a positive charge. In order to produce
 these effects, it was necessary that plenty of water should be

         Condensation with Lightning and the Aurora.         105
discharged with the steam, which was effected by giving the
condenser time to cool before an experiment was made.
    76. It is now seen that a simple alteration of the pressure
is sufficient to change the electrical state of the boiler from
negative to positive, and the steam from positive to negative;
and this takes place not in any adventitious manner, for I
could as easily and with equal precision make the boiler posi
tive as negative.
    77. A platinum blowpipe jet was united to the apparatus
for producing an artificial fountain by condensed air; the jet
was fixed rectangularly to the pipe of the fountain, and its
aperture was very fine; so that when the water was ejected
under a pressure of four or five atmospheres, the stream be
came divided, at a distance of about 12 to 18 inches, into a
stream of fine drops. It was found advisable to keep a very
fine piece of platinum wire in the aperture of the blowpipe
jet, as it prevented its becoming stuffed up, and by moving
the wire I could greatly vary the shape of the discharge.
The fountain itself consisted of a brass cylinder about 7 inches
long and 3 inches diameter, with the two flat ends soldered
on. I think this construction should never be employed; for
 the varying flexion, though invisible, of the brass ends, the
 thickness of which cannot be seen, appears gradually to de
 stroy the continuity of the solder, and the instrument becomes
 liable to burst, as mine has done.
    78. The larger collector was held by a tube-holder, and
 connected with the single-leaf electrometer, and water was
 discharged from the fountain through the platinum jet so that
 the drops might fall on the wire-gauze, the distance between the
 gauze and the jet being from one to two feet; the electrometer
 became charged positively. The intensity of the charge was
very variable, depending on the form of the aperture of the
jet: when the water issued as a compact stream, the electri
 city was strong; but when the platinum wire was so placed
 that the discharge flew into minute drops almost as soon as it
 left the jet, there was always very little or no electricity ob
 tained. When the distance between the jet and gauze was
 diminished to 3 or 4 inches, there was no electricity produced.
 Distilled and common water were used with about equal effect
 in these experiments; and I found, too, a brass jet might be
 substituted for one of platinum. This species of electricity
 was during my experiments frequently so abundant, that I
 doubt whether a jet of water, properly discharged, perhaps
 through an Armstrong's jet, would not be a better source of
 electricity than a jet of steam.
     79. The fountain being insulated, the discharge of the water

  106 Mr. R. Phillips on the connexion of the Electricity of
 was found to leave it negative; and when the screen which
 received the water was also connected with the electrometer,
 no electrical effects were produced: this, however, at present
 rests on only one experiment, in which the insulation was not
 so good as I should have liked.
    80. The above method of electrical excitation has an im
 posing appearance of novelty; but since the ordinary fric
 tional electricity of steam is produced by water rubbing
 against the discharging passage (Faraday), the above experi
 ments must be regarded as a singular case in which the quan
 tity of water is infinite with regard to the quantity of steam.
    81. Steam was discharged from the brass jet as before (71,
 72.), and the larger wire-gauze collector was held by means of
 a tube-holder at distances varying from 6 to 12 inches from
 the end of the brass jet. The pressure in the boiler was low,
 and the steam was so slowly discharged from the jet that it
 imparted no electricity to the screen. A stream of water was
 now discharged from the platinum jet of the fountain through
 the current of steam, generally in the same direction as the
 steam was passing, so that the water might fall on the screen
 which was connected with the single-leaf electrometer; a ne
 gative charge was obtained. As the pressure which drove the
 steam out was increased, so this negative charge increased in
 intensity until the steam was about to become positive. In per
 forming these experiments, care was taken to adjust the plati
 num jet so that the electricity of the discharged water might be
little or nothing; otherwise a positive charge was obtained from
the water. The length of the column of water and its solidity
were greatly varied; and it was thus found advantageous, in
order to have a strong negative effect, that the stream of water
should be rather compact as it issued from the jet, and that
the water should pass over a distance of 2 or 3 feet before it
entered the steam. The amount of electricity collected was
very variable under apparently similar circumstances, but it
was always negative. The state of the boiler was frequently
examined, and was always found to be positive. I also dis
charged the steam through some other jets instead of the
above-mentioned brass one, but the results did not vary.
   82. This negative charge given to the screen was, I think,
only produced by the drops of water collecting negative elec
tricity from the steam, much in the same way as the wire
gauze did (72.).
   83. The steam-cloud, instead of being allowed freely to
escape, was received into a tin pipe. This pipe was 2.5 inches
diameter, and one end formed a right angle to the rest of
the pipe; the greatest length of one limb of this pipe was

        Condensation with Lightning and the Aurora.           107
13 inches, and of the other 3-5 inches.        The shorter limb
stood before the brass jet, with its central line coinciding with
the central line of the path of the steam; the hole of this
smaller limb was also fitted with a bung having a hole in its
middle 1:3 inch diameter. The longer limb formed an angle
of about 25° with the horizon, and was attached to a glass rod
by which the tin pipe was insulated. The distance of the end
of the brass jet from the nearest part of the bung was 2.5
inches, and the tin pipe was connected with the single-leaf elec
trOmeter.
   84. The above arrangement having been completed, the
fountain was held at about 8 inches from the open end of the
longer limb, and a stream of water from the platinum jet di
rected axially through the long arm of the pipe; no electricity
was produced. Then while the water was flowing, the cock
of the boiler was turned a little, so that the steam might issue
from the jet under some very low pressure, perhaps a foot of
water: an abundance of positive electricity was now obtained;
but on again shutting off the steam, no electricity. The boiler
was uninsulated.
   85. I found this electrical effect to increase as the pressure
was increased, always taking care to keep within the point at
which the boiler would have become negative. But that no
doubt should remain as to the state of the boiler, I have often,
immediately after having obtained the positive charge as above
from the steam, connected the boiler with the electrometer
and found it always positive.
   86. The longer limb of the tin pipe was now brought to an
angle of about 55° with the horizon, and instead of the foun
tain I employed a pipette, which was kept at about 2 feet from
the end of the tin pipe; everything else remained as before.
While the steam was escaping into the pipe, as in former ex
periments (84, 85.), a slender stream of water was blown from
the pipette which fell in drops through the steam in the pipe;
a positive charge was at once given by the water to the tin
pipe, although before the water fell through the steam there
was no effect produced on the electrometer. The boiler was
positive.
    87. An electrical effect was produced by blowing water
from the pipette on an insulated screen, the screen becoming
positive. The amount of electricity, so obtained was very
 variable under apparently similar circumstances, and fre
 quently nearly nothing for a great number of trials; it was at
such times that the above experiments were made, the pipette
 being examined as to its electrical powers both before and
 after each experiment.

108     Mr. R. Phillips on the Electricity of Condensation.
    88. I have not obtained any effect by discharging air with
the steam from the boiler. My experiments were usually
made by pumping air into the boiler, and discharging the
mixture of steam and air through the brass jet, the pressures
being generally low. At a pressure of 40 lbs. on the inch,
the difficulty of getting air into the boiler was so great that
my experiments are not satisfactory; and certain capricious
results were obtained, which I feel sufficiently convinced at
present were produced by water being deposited in the dis
charging passages.
    89. The arrangement (54.) was restored, and the tube was
brought up close to the brass connecting piece, by which the
end of the tube was partly closed. The steam was also at
40 lbs. on the inch. The wire-gauze being held in the steam
as it issued from the tube, and then removed to the single-leaf
electrometer, was found to have become negative. The piece
of a gun-barrel was now substituted for the glass tube; the
steam was also negative. These two experiments are merely
variations of that formerly described (47.). It was singular
to observe how suddenly and completely the electrical pro
perties of the steam were changed by moving the gun-barrel
or glass tube out from the brass connecting piece.
    90. From the foregoing experiments, I think it follows that
the electricity of condensation (51, 52, 56,84, &c.) is developed
by drops of water moving either with, or contrary to the elec
tro-current of condensation (11, 14, &c.).
    91. I conclude from (90.) that rain is necessary to the for
mation of lightning, and from (86.) that the drops of rain need
 not possess any very great velocity.
     92. As to the connexion of lightning with rain, I have but
 to refer to Mr. Birt's paper (Phil. Mag., vol. xxxv. p. 161);
 and with regard to the connexion of mist with the aurora, I
 refer to M. De la Rive's paper (Phil. Mag, vol.xxxiv. p.291).
     93. It has been suggested by Sir John Herschel that the
 light of the sun may be produced by electric currents; and is
 it impossible that these currents may be of the same nature
 as our lightning and aurora? The sun has a dark body, an
 atmosphere, and a difference of temperature.

            XIII. On two New Salts of Chromic Acid.
                By ARCHIBALD DUNCAN, Jun., Esq.*
IN     1827, Dr. Thomson described in his paper on the Com
      pounds of Chromium (Phil. Trans. 1827, p. 223), the
double salt—potash chromate of magnesia—(KO CrO3, MgO
CrO3, 2HO) obtained by digesting a solution of bichromate
of potash over carbonate of magnesia. I obtained a corre
sponding lime-salt about two years ago by the following pro
cess. A boiling solution of bichromate of potash was poured
over newly-slaked lime in a tall vessel. The undissolved
lime having subsided, the supernatant fluid, which was of a
lemon-yellow colour, was drawn off by a syphon, and slowly
evaporated in a hot-air stove at 80°. During the first two
days of the evaporation, crystalline crusts of an orange salt
were formed on the surface of the liquor, and required to be
frequently removed. After this time, however, these crusts
ceased to be produced, and crystals of a yellow salt began to
make their appearance at the bottom of the evaporating bason,
and in two or three days more a mass of beautiful crystals was
obtained. The proportion of the orange to the yellow salt
depends a good deal on the temperature employed in the eva
poration. In one experiment the heat was raised to boiling,
and no yellow crystals were obtained at all, orange crusts
continuing to separate as fast as they could be removed.
    Yellow Potash Chromate of Lime.—This salt crystallizes in
lemon-yellow four-sided oblique prisms. It is soluble in water,
but insoluble in cold alcohol, and is formed in the latter part
of the process described.                           *
   The salt, when ignited, fuses; and on cooling, the mass has
a crystalline aspect, and is quite soluble in water.
   The mean of several analyses gave the following result:—
                                        Experiment.   Calculation.
            Chromic acid       .  .  .    51:840        52-52
            Potash     .   .   .  .  .    23.900        24'24.

   This corresponds nearly with the formula KO CrO3, CaO
CrO3+2HO, the water being slightly in excess. It therefore
is a parallel compound to the magnesian salt described by
Dr. Thomson.

110        Mr. J. Glaisher’s Remarks on the Weather
of this salt has been already described. It is soluble in water.
The mean of three analyses yielded the following result:—

                Lime    .  .  .  .  .    . 23.990

                                           99-840
   This approaches nearly to the formula 3KO 7CaO CrO,
5HO. When this salt is ignited it does not fuse, and when
cool its colour is yellow. It does not again altogether dissolve
in water, and thence it appears to have undergone decompo
S1tion.              -                 -
XIV. Remarks on the Weather during the Quarter ending
   December 31, 1849. By JAMEs GLAISHER, Esq., F.R.S.,
   F.R.A.S., and of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich *.
IN my      paper upon the meteorological particulars of the
    quarter ending September 30, 1849, and published in the
Philosophical Magazine, I spoke of the great mortality which
had existed throughout that quarter in London and its en
virons. This excess of mortality decreased rapidly; and not
less remarkable has been the decrease in the weekly and
monthly rate of mortality in the past quarter; the mortality
having been, in three successive weeks in November, 269,284,
and 270 below the estimated number. The mortality in Oc- .
tober was 557, in November was 1160, and in December was
564 less than the calculated numbers. This decrease is ex
traordinary; and it proves that the epidemic of cholera carried
off many of the sickly and weakly, whose deaths would other
wise have made up the average numbers in the past quarter.
   The meteorological returns for the past quarter have been
furnished to the Registrar-General from the usual places,
and which have passed my usual examination and reduction.
   During the past quarter there has been an unusual preva
lence of fog, particularly in the month of November. Snow
has fallen more frequently than usual, but in small quantities
only. The daily temperatures of the air till October 16 and
after November 20, with the under-mentioned exceptions, were
below their average values; in the former period the mean
defect was 4°2, and in the latter it was 4°0.      Between Oc
tober 17 and November 14 the temperature was above the
                 * Communicated by the Author.

       during the Quarter ending December 31, 1849.          111
average for the season; its mean daily excess was 6°3. From
December 5 to 8 the mean daily excess of temperature was 4°,
and between December 14 and 19 the average excess was
6°-9. This warm period of six days was remarkable, as oc
curring between two very cold periods. The temperature in
December was variable; on the 15th day it exceeded the
average by 13°4, and on the 28th it was 13° below.
   The mean temperature of the air at Greenwich for the three
months ending November, constituting the three autumnal
months, was 51°3; and that of the average from the seventy
nine preceding autumns was 49°3.
   For the month of October was 51° 1, exceeding the average
of the seventy-nine
preceding               by 1°5. years by 1°8, and that of the
                     preceding
            eight years                  •             -
   For the month of November was 44° 1, exceeding the ave
rage of the seventy-nine preceding years by 1°7, and less
than that of the preceding eight years by 0°4.
   For the month of December was 39°1, exceeding that of
the average of the preceding seventy-nine years by 0°3, and
being less than the average of the preceding eight years by 1°3.
   The mean for the quarter was 44°8, exceeding the average
of seventy-nine years by 1°3, and being of the same value as
that of the preceding eight years.
   The mean temperature of evaporation at Greenwich—
   For the month of October was 48°2; for the month of
November was 42°:2; and for the month of December was
37°-9. These values are 0°8, 0°-9, and 1°3 below those of
the averages of the same months respectively in the preceding
eight years.
   The mean temperature of the dew-point at Greenwich
   For the months of October, November and December, were
45°-1, 39°8 and 35°.1 respectively. These values are 1°0,
 1°7 and 2°. 1 below respectively the averages of the same
months in the preceding eight years. The mean value for the
quarter was 40°.0, and that of the preceding eight years was
41°6.    The difference of these numbers shows that the air
has been less humid than usual.
   The mean elastic force of vapour at Greenwich for the quarter
was 0.267 inch, being less than the average from the preceding
eight years by 0.017 inch.
   The mean weight of water in a cubic foot of air for the
quarter was 3.1 grains, being of the same value as that of the
average from the eight preceding years.
   The mean additional weight of water required to saturate a
cubic foot of air was 0.5 grain. The average from the eight
preceding years was 0.4 grain.

112       Mr. J. Glaisher's Remarks on the Weather
   The mean degree of humidity in October was 0.815, in No
vember was 0.860, and in December was 0.903.          The ave
rages for the eight preceding years were 0.883, O'901, and
O'896.
   The mean reading of the barometer at Greenwich in October
was 29.744 inches, in November was 29.743, and in December
was 29.795. These readings are 0.086 greater, 0.012 greater,
and 0.036 less respectively than the averages of the same
months in the preceding eight years.
   The reading of the barometer at Greenwich was 29-33 inches
on October 1; increased to 29.64 by 2" at 9 P.M.; it then
decreased and passed below the point 29 inches on the morn
ing of the 4th to 28.93 by 9h A.M., which was the lowest read
ing in the month. The reading then increased to 29.67 by
noon on the 7th, decreased to 29-13 by next morning, and
then increased to 29.91 by 9 A.M. on the 9th; decreased to
29.37 by 3 P.M. on the 11th; increased to 29.98 by the even
ing of the 15th, and with slight fluctuations to 30.54 by noon
on the 29th ; and this was the highest reading during the
month; after this it decreased to 29.42 by the end of the
month. The range of readings during the month was 1-61
inch.
   In November, the reading, with slight variation, decreased
to 28.98 by the evening hours of the 4th; it increased to
30.26 by the morning of the 9th; and these readings were
the lowest and highest respectively during the month. It
decreased to 29:47 by the 14th; increased to 30.19 by the 17th;
decreased with slight exception to 29.21 on the 24th; in
creased to 30.02 by the 27th; and decreased to 29.69 by the
last day. The range of readings during the month was 1:28.
   In Decemberthe reading increased to 30-01 inches on the 1st;
it decreased to 29-30 by the evening of the 2nd; increased to
29:44 by the 4th; decreased to 29.17 by the 5th; increased
to 29.70 by the 6th; decreased to 29.29 by the 8th; increased
to 30.07 by the 10th; decreased with slight exception to 29:33
by the 18th at 9h P.M.; on the 19th at 9h P.M. the reading
had increased by 0.80 inch; and on the 26th at 10h A.M. it
was 30:48, which was the highest reading during the month;
the reading then decreased to 29.29 by noon on the 28th, and
increased to 30.22 by the end of the month. The range of
readings during the month was 1-31 inch.
   At Stone, on October 1, at 9" A.M., the reading of the baro
meter was 29-168 inches, and increasing; it was 29:440 at
6h P.M. on the 2nd, when it began to decrease; on the 4th at
9h A.M. it was 28:756; and on the 6th at 9h A.M. it had in
creased to 29°451, when it was depressed again, and read

the 18th at 6" P.M.; on the 26th at 9h A.M. it was 29:481,
when it began to increase to 30.028 on the 28th at 9h A.M., still
increasing; on the 29th at 9" A.M. it was 30-360; then it de
creased to 30°250 on the same day at 9 P.M., still decreasing;
it was depressed to 29-180 on the 31st at 9" P.M. (which
makes a fall of 1-070 inch in forty-eight hours), still decreasing.
    On November 1 at 9" A.M. it was 29:114 inches: this reading
increased to 29.314 on the 2nd at 9h A.M., when it decreased
again, and was depressed to 28-730 on the 4th at 9 P.M.; on
the 8th at 3h P.M. it was 29.996, and it increased to 30.030 on
 the same day at 9" P.M., then it began to decrease; it was
 30.020 on the 9th at 9h A.M., still decreasing; it was 29.247
 on the 14th at 9h P.M.; then it increased to 29.953 on the
 17th at 9h P.M.; this decreased to 29-696 on the 18th at 9"
 P.M.; on the 20th at 9h A.M. it was 29.802, when it decreased
 again; on the 23rd at 9h P.M. it was 29.000; and on the 27th
 at 3h P.M. it was 29.825: this reading decreased to 29.468 on
 the 30th at 9" A.M.; then it increased again.
     On December 1 at 9h A.M. it was 29.779 inches; on the 2nd
 at 9h P.M. it was 29:020; it increased to 29:248 on the 3rd at
 9h P.M.; then it decreased to 28-986 on the 5th at 9h A.M.;
 on the 6th at 9 P.M. it was 29.451 : this reading decreased
 to 29.025 on the 7th at 9 P.M., then increased again, and
 was 29.868 on the 10th at 9 P.M.; on the 13th at 9h P.M. it
 was 29:488; it increased to 29.520 on the 14th at 9h A.M.:
 this reading decreased to 29.464 on the same day at 9" P.M.
 (the dry-bulb thermometer was 53°.8; on the same evening a
 gale of wind blew from the S.W. to W.); it increased again,
 and was 29.660 on the 15th at 9" P.M.; then it decreased, and
  was 29-149 at 9h P.M. on the 18th; it was 29.952 on the 19th

  creased to 30.002 at 8" P.M. on the same day, still increasing;
  it was 30.243 at 11h A.M. on the 22nd day: from that day the
  observations were discontinued.
      The average weight of a cubic foot of air, under the average
  temperature, humidity and pressure, was 542 grains; agreeing
  with the average from the eight preceding years.
      The rain fallen at Greenwich in October was 2.7 inches,
  in November was 1:5, and in December was 2.4.            The falls
  for these three months on an average of thirty-four years, are
   3:5, 2.7 and 1:5 respectively.

    The average daily ranges of the readings of the thermometer
 in air at the height of four feet above the soil, for October,
 November and December, were 15°. 1, 11°7, and 9°. 1 re
 spectively. The averages for these three months from the
 preceding eight years are 13°0, 10° 3 and 9° 0.
    The readings of the thermometer on grass in October was at
 and below 32° on five nights; the lowest was 25°5; between
 32° and 40° on eleven nights, and exceeded 40° on fifteen
 nights. In November it was at and below 32° on nineteen
 mights; the lowest reading was 15°, and above 32° on eleven
 nights. In December the lowest reading was 10°.8; the
 readings were below 32° on twenty-three nights, and above
 32° on seven only.
    At Cardington the mean of all the lowest readings of a ther
 mometer on grass in October was 34°6, in November was
 25°9, and in December was 26°. The lowest readings in
 these three months were 19° 5, 8° 0 and 8°0 respectively. At
 Nottingham the lowest reading on short grass was 16°.

minute, and was seen by many persons. That seen on Novem
 ber 5, at 6h 20m P.M., was of the size of a star of the first mag
 nitude, and described a path of 50° in length, which was
 visible during its whole extent for five minutes; at first its
 motion was straight, and then curved.
    At Stone, on November 5, Mr. Fasel saw a brilliant meteor

 seen at Edinburgh.
    On December 30, at Latimer, the Rev. S. King, at about
 5h 45" P.M., saw a very brilliant meteor, which, after travel

   At Hartwell Rectory, on December 30, at 5'45" P.M., the
Rev. C. Lowndes saw a very splendid meteor or globe of
bright light. When first seen it was situated south-west of
Andromeda. Mr. Lowndes’ attention was first attracted to it
by the light it gave. Its apparent diameter was about 4 of
arc. It immediately burst, and emitted a knotted streak of
red light, the length of which was from 5° to 6°, and the direc
tion of its motion was north by east at an angle of 20° from a
vertical line to the zenith.

   The following abstract of the weather at Guernsey has been
furnished by Dr. Hoskins, F.R.S.:—
   October:—The mean temperature agrees with the average
for five years. The rain above the average both in quantity
and number of days: the dew-point below the average.
This month was on the whole windy and rainy, but not cold.
   November:—A finer month than the former: less wind
and more sunshine: the temperature about the usual average.
Dew-point high: much humidity.
   December:—From the 1st to the 10th much rain: towards
the end slight sleet and snow showers: wind variable in
force. Although the temperature was never below 33°, par
tial frosts occurred in exposed situations. Nevertheless orange
trees, geraniums, and other exotics out of doors, were only
slightly injured. Out-of-door grapes are still to be seen in
paper bags on the walls of houses. On the whole, the weather,
though keen, was not cold. The snow did not lie more than
a few hours. Rain fell with greater continuance than usual;
as much as 1.505 inch was measured in twenty-four hours.
Generally rain occurs in heavy showers, the interval being
fine with sunshine, and the surface readily dries.
   The direction of the wind at Greenwich was north-east till
October 16, passing at the rate of 107 miles daily; it was
south-west from October 17 to November 18, with an average

118         Mr. J. Glaisher’s Remarks on the Weather
daily motion of 110 miles; it was north-east from November 18
to November 30; its motion was about 60 miles daily; it was
then north-east and south-east till December 14, with a daily
motion of 100 miles; and it was after this south-west and
north-west till the end of the year, passing on the average at
the rate of 130 miles daily.
    The daily horizontal movement of the air in October and
November was 95 miles, and in December it was 110 miles.
    During the whole of last quarter an observation at 9" A.M.
Greenwich time has been taken daily at many of the railway
stations by the station-masters, and forwarded to London free
of expense by the several railway companies, and published
on the following day in the ‘Daily News, the proprietors of
which paper have incurred the expense of collecting the several
returns from the London railway termini and printing them.
The several stations for observation were selected by the
Astronomer Royal. I visited every station before observations
were made, fixed a compass-card, and remained at the station
till I felt certain the observations would be made with accu
racy. It is evident that much valuable information may be
obtained by these means, with reference to the extent and
passage of storms over the country, the extent of sky covered
by cloud, and the extent of country over which any particular
weather prevails.
    With the full set of meteorological instruments possessed by
the regular observers, who furnish the observations for the
Quarterly Meteorological Reports, many of whom have pro
mised co-operation with the above system, by taking a similar
set of observations at the same time, whereby other simulta
neous meteorological particulars not included in the daily
returns will be supplied, I hope in the course of this year to
increase the number of stations by the addition of some in
Ireland. At all times, I should hope, that on the course of
storms being indicated, gentlemen resident in their apparent
course before reaching this country, and after leaving it, will
supply the wanting particulars, so as to help to trace it from
its source to its termination.
    The stations included in the returns to the ‘Daily News’
extend from Plymouth to the south, to Dundee to the north,
to Holyhead to the west, and to Yarmouth to the east.
    Daily I lay all the particulars as published on a map, from
which I extract the following:--

 122        Mr. J. Glaisher's Remarks on the Weather
    On November 6 a stream of air was passing from the Irish
 Sea, described as a strong breeze at Holyhead, Liverpool and
 Manchester; as a storm at Lancaster, a heavy gale at White
 haven, and a gale at Durham : the breadth of this stream
 was about 2°. It was not felt on the eastern side of the Cum
 berland mountains.
    On November 15, in latitude 53}" on the west coast, a hard
 wind blew from the Irish Sea, described as a hard wind at
 Holyhead, a gale at Crewe, and merely as a strong breeze at
 Birmingham, and as a gentle breeze only before it reached
 Northampton or Oxford, towards which places the air was
 travelling. At the same time it was described as a calm at
 Liverpool.
    On December 3 a hard wind was blowing over that part of
the country extending from Dundee to Manchester, and which
was described as a storm at Hartlepool, as a heavy gale at
 Sunderland and at Yarmouth, and as a gale at Crewe. At
all places situated south of Birmingham the air was described
to have been either in very gentle motion, or calm, with rain
falling at some places, and fog prevalent at others. Tracing
the course of this storm, it seems to have reached England at
 Yarmouth, and from thence passed in a south-east direction
up the country, it being most severe on the eastern coast, and
so on to Dundee; this storm was probably felt in Belgium;
and observations at Brussels, and at other places in its appa
rent course, would be valuable.
   On December 8 a strong wind was blowing from the Irish
Sea, affecting Holyhead, Liverpool, and described as a storm
at Lancaster; in the line continued which joins Holyhead
and Lancaster, viz. at Darlington and at Hartlepool, the wind
was blowing strongly; its direction however at these places was
from the east, or towards the Irish Sea.   The whole mass of
air north of this storm was moving from east to west, and at
places south of the storm it was moving from west to east. On
this day Irish observations are necessary to follow this storm.
   In this way data may be collected for very important addi
tions to our knowledge of meteorological phaenomena.
   I have been favoured with the following reports upon agri
culture.
   From Stonyhurst, by the Rev. A. Weld.
   The potatoe disease made no further progress after about
the middle of October; even those that were tainted in the
getting-up have remained nearly in the same state, except
that the disease seems to have taken rather the form of a dry
rot, without however extending any further.
   The crop of Swedes was very abundant, averaging upwards

        during the Quarter ending December 31, 1849.        123
of fifty tons per acre. Mangel-wurzel was also a very good
crop.
   In general the season has been favourable for the usual
winter occupations, as draining, felling timber, hedging, lead
ing manure, &c. The late severe weather has for the most
part interrupted out-door work.
   From South Hampshire, by John Clark, Esq. near Romsey.
   The seed-time for turnips was dry. The crop was in many
instances light and uneven. The subsequent fine rains and
weather have caused all kinds of root and grass to grow vigo
rously. There has been an abundance of food for cattle,
which have thriven well.
   The seed-time for wheat was all that could be desired.    A
large breadth of land is sown, and the plant is looking well.
There has been a good deal of employment for labourers, and
consequently there has been a far less number unemployed
than in many seasons past.
   The monthly mean values of the several subjects of investi
gation are published in the Registrar-General's Quarterly Re
port, and subjoined are the mean values for the quarter. The
observations have been corrected for diurnal ranges, and the
hygrometrical results have been deduced from my tables, and
the results are all comparable with each other.
   The mean of the numbers in the first column is 29-680
inches, and this value may be considered as the pressure of dry
air for England during the quarter ending December 31, 1849.
   The mean of the numbers in the second column for Guern
sey and those places situated in the counties of Cornwall and
Devonshire, is 48°3; at Liverpool and Whitehaven is 44°-2;
for those places situated south of latitude of 52°, including
Chichester and Hartwell, is 44°3; for those places situated
between the latitudes of 52° and 53°, including Saffron Wal
den and Holkham, is 43°:2; for those places situated be
tween the latitudes of 53° and 54°, including Derby and
Stonyhurst, 42° 1 ; and for Durham and Newcastle is 42°2.
These values may be considered as those of the mean tempe
ratures of the air for those parallels of latitude during the
quarter ending December 31, 1849.
   The average daily range of temperature in Cornwall and
Devonshire was 9°5; at Liverpool and Whitehaven was 7°0,
south of latitude 52° was 11°6; between latitudes 52° and 53°
was 11°4; between 53° and 54° was 11°-6; and north of 54°
was 10° 0.
   The greatest mean daily ranges of the temperature of the
air took place at Nottingham, Aylesbury, Exeter, Beckington
and Latimer; and the least occurred at Guernsey, White
haven, Liverpool and Torquay.

           Mr. J. Glaisher's Remarks on the Weather.         125
   The highest temperature of the air was about 69° at several
places; the lowest readings were 11° at Southampton, 15° at
Beckington and Chichester, and 15°-3 at Oxford. The ex
treme range of temperature of the air during the quarter in
England was therefore about 58°.
   The average quarterly range of the reading of the thermo
meter in Cornwall and Devonshire was 40°.7; at Liverpool
and Whitehaven was 48°5; south of latitude 52° was 49°:2;
and north of this parallel was 45°-1.
   The mean temperature of the dew-point in Cornwall and
Devonshire was 44° 1; south of latitude 52° was 41°3; be
tween the latitudes 52° and 53° was 40°-1; and north of 53°
was 38°7.
   The amount of cloud was such as to cover about three
fourths of the sky nearly.
   Rain has fallen on the greatest number of days at Wake
field, Holkham, Nottingham and Guernsey; the average num
ber at these places was 61. It fell on the least number of
days at Saffron Walden, St. John's Wood, Hartwell Rectory
and Oxford; and the average number at these places was 34.
The stations at which the largest falls have taken place are
Guernsey, Stonyhurst, Helston and Southampton. The
smallest falls occurred at St. John’s Wood, Oxford, Stone
and London.      The average fall in Guernsey, Cornwall and
Devonshire was 124 inches; south of latitude 52° was 6-9
inches; between latitudes 52° and 53° was 7.6inches; between
53° and 54° was 10.2 inches; at Liverpool and Whitehaven
was 11-6 inches; and at Newcastle was 7-9 inches.
    The numbers in the columns 14 to 18 show the mean values
 of the hygrometrical results; from which we find that—
    The mean weight of vapour in a cubic foot of air at all
places (excepting Cornwall and Devonshire) in the quarter
ending December 31, 1849, was 3.0 grains.
    The mean additional weight required to saturate a cubic
 foot of air was 0.5 grain.
    The mean degree of humidity (complete saturation = 1)
 Was O'857.
    The mean amount of vapour mixed with the air would have
produced water, if all had been precipitated at one time on the
surface of the earth, to the depth of 3.6 inches.
    The mean weight of a cubic foot of air under the mean
pressure, temperature and humidity, was 543 grains at the
 mean height of 182 feet.
    And these values for Cornwall and Devonshire were 3.5
 grains; 0:6 grain; 0.864; 3.9 inches; and 540 grains, at the
 average height of 122 feet.                               -

XV. On the Method of developing an Incommensurable Frac
    tion given in Colson’s edition of Sir Isaac Newton's Fluxions.
    By J. R. YoUNg, late Professor of Mathematics, Belfast”.
Ti: paper          on Incommensurable Fractions, inserted in
       the last Number of this Journal, suggests a modification
of Colson's rule for expeditiously converting such fractions
into circulating decimals, which will, I think, be regarded as
a slight improvement.
    The fraction chosen by Colson, to illustrate his process, is
#      which he developes, in the usual way, till he arrives at a
remainder consisting of but one figure: this remainder, with
the 29 underneath, is then appended to the partial develop
                                l        • -            •
ment, and the true value of 25, consisting of a    certain number
of decimals, with a supplementary fraction, is thus exhibited.
The whole is then multiplied by the numerator of this fraction,
and as many additional decimals are obtained, together with
a new supplemental fraction.
    The whole row of decimals now furnished, with the new
fraction appended, is, as before, multiplied by the numerator
of this fraction; and the extent of the row again becomes
doubled, and another supplemental fraction presents itself,
the numerator of which forms a new multiplier; and so on,
till the circulating period is completed.
    Now, in certain cases, there is much inconvenience in thus
changing the multipliers at every step; for although the mul
tiplier with which we commence may be but a single figure,
the subsequent multipliers may, some of them, consist of two
figures, or indeed of any number of figures which do not cause
the multiplier to be so great as the denominator of the original
fraction.
    It is an obvious inference from the paper referred to above,
that whenever a convenient multiplier is reached, we may, if
we please, keep to that multiplier to the end of the process;
and by so doing, we shall add on the same invariable number
of decimals at each step taken from the stage at which our
multiplier was selected, namely the number of decimals fur
nished at that stage. If, as we proceed, a multiplier still
more convenient offers itself, that at first chosen may be re
placed by it; and, as before, new rows of decimals will be
added at each subsequent step, the number of figures in every
addend being the same as the number in the row which sup

 On the Method of developing an Incommensurable Fraction. 129
 plied the multiplier; and it is to be observed that each addend
 is obtained by merely multiplying the preceding addend, and
 not the whole preceding row.
    In the instance chosen by Colson, the several multipliers
which he employs, one after another, happen to be conveni
ently small: it is not so with the fraction    #.   Treated in the
 way here suggested, the development of this fraction is as
 follows:—
     1        7     Here the multiplier is 7, and to this we may
    #I = 08:1.          keep throughout.
                      2      Here the multiplier 7 may be changed
                     31'       for 2.
        ='032258,064516        #

     31- 0.32258064516129032           31
    By Colson’s method, the multipliers for this fraction are
7, 18 and 14; and although, in that method, the number of
decimals is doubled at every step, yet this is no advantage;
for in both methods n new figures require n multiplications:
the only point of difference between the two methods is this,
namely:—in Colson’s method we are to employ the successive
multipliers as they arise, whereas in the modification of it,
here proposed, we may reject those multipliers which are
inconveniently large, and use only the smallest.
   After I had completed my former paper, a vague recollec
tion revived in my mind of having somewhere seen a process,
by Colson, having some analogy to the speculations with which
I had been occupied; and I delayed the communication of the
paper till I had sought for information on the matter from a
distinguished mathematical friend, who was not able, however,
to call anything to his remembrance, in connexion with Col
son’s name, at all allied to what I had been doing. I have
since consulted Newton’s Fluxions, and have there discovered
what I must have read many years ago; and the present sup
plementary communication is the result of my examination
of Colson’s rule. This rule admits of an application and an
extension of more general utility than the author seems to
have conceived; and it is chiefly to show this, that I submit

the present short paper to the readers of the Philosophical
Magazine. The extension spoken of is implied in this state
ment, namely: if we develope any fraction by division, what
ever be the numerator or denominator, and arrive at a re
mainder which is either a multiple or a submultiple of a former
remainder, we may discontinue the operation and thencefor
ward proceed by Colson’s rule. A single illustration wi't
suffice to confirm this principle.
   Let us take the fraction proposed by Metius for the ratio
of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, namely        #.
In performing the division, the first remainder we get is 16,
and the ninth remainder is 4, the quotient up to this remainder
being 3.14159292. Consequently
                        355                 4.

                                                . . . . 93805 &c.
where it is to be observed, that the figures cut off are those
under which the decimals, arising from the supplemental
fraction, are to be placed whenever we choose to put a stop
to the process. In the present case these decimals are 00055&c.
   The above form has been given to this process for the pur
pose of preserving an analogy to Colson's method; but, after
having got the first group of decimals 14159292, by common
division as above proposed, we may discover the following
groups, as fast as they can be written down, by continually

where the decimals recur after the 8 in the 112th place. If
the remainder at which we stop, in the operation of determi
ning the leading decimals by common division, be a multiple
instead of a submultiple of a preceding remainder, then the
continuation of the development would be obtained in a man
ner analogous to that by which the development of : is         ob
tained above. And even should the remainder, b, at which
we stop, be neither a multiple nor a submultiple of a preceding
remainder, a, yet the development may be carried on upon
the same principle; the multiplier, by aid of which each
group of decimals is derived from the preceding group, being
always a'
    Had the arithmetical facilities noticed in this paper occurred
to the older mathematicians, who spent so much time in ap
proximating to the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its
diameter, much of that time would have been spared.

     XVI. On Percylite, a Mineral not hitherto described.
                 By H. J. BRooKE, Esq., F.R.S.*
 I   RECEIVED many years since from Mr. Heuland a very
      small specimen of an undescribed sky-blue mineral in
minute cubes, accompanied by gold, on a matrix of quartz and
red oxide of iron, which was said to have come from La Sonora
in Mexico.
    In consequence of the quantity of the mineral on the spe
cimen being too small for analysis without destroying the spe
 cimen itself, the mineral has remained until this time unex
 amined. But it having been pointed out to me by Mr. Lett
 som that there was a much larger one in the British Museum,
 placed among those of gold, from which, without the slightest
 injury to it, a sufficient portion could be taken for analysis,
 I applied through Mr. Konig to the Trustees of the British
 Museum, and obtained their permission to detach the small
 quantity that has been analysed by Dr. Percy.

acid precipitates a minute quantity of white matter, which is
insoluble in excess of nitric acid, and becomes slate-coloured
by exposure to light.
   7. Heated with borax in the outer flame, a transparent
bluish-green bead is obtained, which, in the inner flame,
becomes turbid and brownish-red.
   8. The mineral by boiling in nitric acid becomes white and
then dissolves. Nitrate of silver precipitates from the solution
white curdy matter, insoluble in excess of nitric acid.

   It was impossible to separate sufficient of the mineral for
analysis; it was therefore boiled with adhering matrix in
successive portions of dilute nitric acid. To the filtered so
lution excess of nitrate of silver was added. The white pre
cipitate, washed and dried at the temperature of incipient
fusion, weighed 3.40%.

    The excess of nitrate of silver having been separated by
 hydrochloric acid, the solution was tested with chloride of
 barium, but no precipitate was produced. Hydrosulphuric
 acid was then passed through for a considerable time. The
 precipitate was digested with fuming nitric acid. Sulphuric
 acid was added, and the whole evaporated until the excess of
 sulphuric acid was completely expelled. The dry product
 was washed with water.       The insoluble white residue, washed,
 dried and ignited, weighed 3.90. Heated in the inner flame
 on charcoal with carbonate of soda, a large bead of malleable
lead was obtained.
    The last solution was boiled with excess of potass. The
dark brown precipitate, washed, dried and ignited, weighed
0.97.     Heated in the inner flame on charcoal, a bead of mal
leable copper was obtained.

entirely dissolved, and consisted of sesquioxide of iron. Frag
ments of quartz with adhering particles of metallic gold re

small quantity of white matter subsided, which became slate
coloured by exposure to light, and by fusion with carbonate
of soda on charcoal in the inner flame, gave a minute bead of
silver.

possible, the former with adherent chloride was incinerated on the cover
of a porcelain crucible. The residue was added to the chloride, and the

                  By T. H. HENRY, Esq., F.R.S.*
        R. BROOKE some years since received from Mr.
          Nuttall some specimens of a mineral found at Wheal
 Franco near Tavistock, Devon, which appeared to him and
 to Mr. Brooke to differ in external characters from all the
 substances with which they were acquainted, and it was con
 sequently provisionally named Francolite.
      t consists of small masses of irregularly formed and aggre
 gated crystals, apparently hexagonal prisms of considerable
 lustre, and covering the matrix with a sort of mammillated sur
 face. It has lately been found in another mine in larger and
 purer specimens, and I have at Mr. Brooke's request analysed
 a part of one of these.
    A small crystal, perfectly free from the matrix, was found
 by means of the blowpipe to contain lime and phosphoric acid,
 and a portion reduced to powder and warmed with sulphuric
 acid corroded glass strongly. Iron and manganese were also
 detected; but a very minute trace of chlorine was found.
     I determined with this mineral to employ the method lately
 recommended by Prof. H. Rose for the quantitative separation
 of phosphoric acid from all bases but alumina, by means of
 nitric acid and metallic mercury. The crystals were reduced
 to powder, and freed from the matrix (quartz with copper
  pyrites) by treatment in a stoppered bottle with very dilute
  nitric acid in the cold (one part of strong acid to nineteen of
  water), in which the mineral was perfectly soluble. The solu
  tion was evaporated to dryness with metallic mercury in a
  platinum dish heated by steam (the fluoride of calcium is
  hereby decomposed and the fluorine dissipated), and the re
  £ of the process conducted scrupulously according to
  the directions given by Roset.

   The separation of phosphoric acid was complete; not a

    This composition corresponds very nearly to that of fluor
apatite, CaF1+3(3CaO, PO'), in which the lime is partially re
placed by the protoxides of iron and manganese. This com
position would give per cent. (see Rammelsberg's Handwór

mation of the PO" by an accurate method, the results obtained
 by Gustave Rose in an elaborate investigation of several va
 rieties of apatite from various localities, published many years

 without interest, I have ventured to suggest another mode in
 which the question may be viewed.
    It is known that the symbol R}, when prefixed to any qua
 ternion, indicates that, out of the four constituents w, x, y, z,
 regarded in a definite order, that one is selected which stands
 in the nth place from the left-hand. If, then, to the complex
symbol R,G, there be prefixed another symbol of selection R,
it is clear that, since in the expression R}Q there is only one
constituent from which the new selection is to be made, the
combination R,R,Q will vanish for all values of m, except
m= 1. Hence may be formed the following symbolical system:

  XIX. Observations upon M. Boutigny’s recent Experiment.
                  By Professor PLücKER of Bonn”.
 IT may perhaps be a matter of interest to you              to obtain a
      confirmation of Boutigny’s recent experiment. With his
usual kindness, he exhibited to me last Easter his former ex
periments; and whilst admiring his rare perseverance in fol
lowing up a fertile idea, I then acquired an impression that it
referred to a law of nature which was by no means com
pletely revealed, and in which opinion I was further strength
ened by the report of his last experiment. In consequence
of an oral communication of this experiment, M. Fessel wrote
to me from Cologne, stating that on the following day he had
dipped his finger into lead heated to its highest point, by
               * From Poggendorff’s Annalen, Dec. 7, 1849.

 138      Observations upon Boutigny’s recent Experiment.
 which means the projecting portion of the nail of the finger
 had been burnt, but in other respects the finger remained
 perfectly uninjured; he also stated further, that a workman in
 the employ of Messrs. Behren and Co., manufacturing engi
 neers at Cologne, had made the experiment with melted iron,
 and would repeat it before me. I therefore accepted the
 offer, and, accompanied by several persons interested in the
 matter, proceeded to Cologne. The workman in my presence
 struck the unmoistened extremities of his fingers rapidly and
 not without fear against the surface of the iron, which had
just flowed from the melting furnace into a trough, and which
 was afterwards used in casting a large plate for a furnace. I
 was thus convinced of the perfect truth of Boutigny's expe
 riment; and whilst carefully examining the extremities of the
 workman's fingers, one of the two assistants of the Physical
 Cabinet accompanying me struck the entire surface of the
 open hand, which he had previously dipped in water, so
strongly against the bright red surface of the iron, that some
of the fused metal was ejected; the other assistant immediately
 afterwards also struck it with his moistened hand.          After these
experiments, which were made in opposition to Boutigny’s
 precautions not to strike the mass, experiments which for the
 sake of precaution I wished to make before the immersion,
became unnecessary; I moistened my right hand, inserted.
the index finger almost completely into the melted mass, and
 moving it very slowly through it, withdrew it in two seconds:
at the same time I felt how the iron moved before my finger,
but did not experience the slightest sensation of heat”.
    I should have considered the temperature of the iron, which
was about 2732°F., as below 96°F.; for on withdrawing the
finger, it was not so warm as the other hand. M. Fessel also,
and the other three persons who accompanied me, repeated
this experiment with certain modifications: one of them with
his hand dry; another remarked that the hand, after having
been previously dipped in water, when withdrawn was onl
dry in that part which had not been immersed; a third £
up the iron with the hand made hollow. The minute hairs
upon the inserted fingers had entirely disappeared; but the
nails were not injured, nor was any penetration of heat through
the nails remarked. The hand when withdrawn had a slight

at Avestad in Sweden, saw a workman, for a small reward, take melted
copper with the bare hand from a crucible and throw it against the wall.
This confirms his statement, as also some other facts which Boutigny him.
self mentions in his memoir, that the phaenomenon mentioned has long been
known, especially among people engaged in the arts.-Poggendorff.

empyreumatic odour, which was stronger when there were
warts upon it; but in no case was there the slightest burning
sensation, or even a disagreeable sensation of heat. Hence
certain minor operations in surgery might be performed with
least pain by placing the foot in a bath of red-hot iron. Lastly,
I made one other experiment, the result of which might have
been anticipated.
    I held the finger of a leathern glove, which I had well
wetted inside and had placed on a wooden rod, for nearly a
minute in the melted iron; on withdrawing it, the glove was
not only unburnt, but had only a temperature of about 132°
F. (I had not a thermometer with me). Conjectures and
theoretical views upon these remarkable phaenomena would
be premature without further experiments. I hope, however,
soon to be able to communicate some remarks upon them.

 Dec. 21, THE Bakerian Lecture was delivered by Professor Gra
   1849,         ham, F.R.S., “On the Diffusion of Liquids.”
    The apparatus used in studying the diffusion of salts and other
 substances into water was very simple. It consisted of an open
 phial to contain the solution of the salt to be diffused, which was
 entirely immersed in a large jar of pure water, so that the solution
 in the phial communicated freely with the latter. Phials cast in a
 mould of the capacity of four ounces of water, or more nearly 2000
 grains, were generally employed, which were ground down to a uni
 form height of 3-8 inches. The neck was 0.5 inch in depth, and the
 aperture or mouth of the phial 1:25 inch in diameter. The phial was
 filled up with the solution to be diffused till it reached the point of
 a pin dipping exactly 0.5 inch into the mouth of the bottle. This
 being the solution cell or bottle, and the external jar the “water
 jar,” the pair together form a “diffusion cell.” The diffusion was
  stopped, generally after seven or eight days, by closing the mouth
  of the phial with a plate of glass, and then raising it out of the
  water-jar. The quantity of salt which had found its way into the
  water-jar—the diffusion product as it was called—was then deter
  mined by evaporating to dryness.
     The characters of liquid diffusion were first examined in detail
  with reference to common salt.
     It was found, first, that with solutions containing 1, 2, 3 and 4
  per cent. of salt, the quantities which diffused out of the phials into
  the water of the jars, and were obtained by evaporating the latter,
  in a constant period of eight days, were as nearly in proportion to
  these numbers, as 1, 199, 3.01 and 4:00; and that in repetitions of

140                          Royal Society.
the experiments, the results did not vary more than 1-40th part.
The proportion of salt which diffused out in such experiments
amounted to about 1-8th of the whole.
   Secondly, that the proportion of salt diffused increases with the
temperature; an elevation of 80° Fahr. doubling the quantity of
chloride of sodium diffused in the same time.
   The diffusibility of a variety of substances was next compared,
a solution of 20 parts of the substance in 100 water being always
used. Some of the results were as follows, the quantities diffused
being expressed in grains: chloride of sodium 58.68, sulphate of
magnesia 27-42, sulphate of water 69.32, crystallized cane-sugar
26.74, starch-sugar 26'94, gum-arabic 13-24, albumen 3.03. The
low diffusibility of albumen is very remarkable, and the value of this
property in retaining the serous fluids within the blood-vessels at
once suggests itself. It was further observed, that common salt,
sugar and urea, added to the albumen under diffusion, diffused away
from the latter as readily as from their aqueous solutions. Urea
itself is as highly diffusible as chloride of sodium.
   In comparing the diffusion of salts dissolved in 10 times their
weight of water, it was found that isomorphous compounds generally
had an equal diffusibility, chloride of potassium corresponding with
chloride of ammonium, nitrate of potash with nitrate of ammonia,
and sulphate of magnesia with sulphate of zinc. The most remark
able circumstance is that these pairs are “equi-diffusive,” not for
chemically equivalent quantities, but for equal weights simply. The
acids differed greatly in diffusibility, nitric acid being nearly four
times more diffusive than phospholic acid; but these substances
also fell into groups, nitric and hydrochloric acids appearing to be
equally diffusive; so also acetic and sulphuric acids. Soluble sub
salts and the ammoniated salts of the metals present a surprisingly
low diffusibility; the quantities diffused in similar circumstances
of the three salts, sulphate of ammonia, sulphate of copper, and the
blue ammonio-sulphate of copper being very nearly as 8, 4 and 1.
   When two salts are mixed in the solution-cell, they diffuse out
into the water atmosphere separately and independently of each
other, according to their individual diffusibilities. This is quite ana
logous to what happens when mixed gases are diffused into air. An
important consequence is, that in liquid diffusion we have a new
method of separation or analysis for many soluble bodies, quite ana
logous in principle to the separation of unequally volatile substances
in the process of distillation.     Thus, it was shown that chlorides
diffuse out from sulphates and carbonates, and salts of potash from
salts of soda; and that from sea-water the salts of soda diffuse out    *
into pure water faster than the salts of magnesia. The latter cir
cumstance was applied to explain the discordant results which have
been obtained by different chemists in the analyses of the water of
the Dead Sea, taken near the surface; the different salts diffusing
up into the sheet of fresh water, with which the lake is periodically

   It was further shown that chemical decompositions may be pro

duced by liquid diffusion; the constituents of a double salt of so
much stability as common alum being separated, and the sulphate of
potash diffusing in the largest proportion. In fact the diffusive force
is one of great energy, and quite as capable of breaking up com
pounds as the unequal volatility of their constituents. Many empiri
cal operations in the chemical arts, it was said, have their foundation
in such decompositions.
    Again, one salt, such as nitrate of potash, will diffuse into a solu
tion of another salt, such as nitrate of ammonia, as rapidly as into
pure water; the salts appearing mutually diffusible, as gases are
known to be.
    Lastly, the diffusibilities of the salts into water, like those of the
gases into air, appear to be connected by simple numerical relations.
These relations are best observed when dilute solutions of the salts
are diffused from the solution-cell, such as 4, 2 or even 1 per cent.
of salt. The quantities diffused in the same time from 4 per cent.
solutions of the three salts, carbonate of potash, sulphate of potash
and sulphate of ammonia, were 10:25, 10:57 and 10:51 grains re
spectively; and a similar approach to equality was observed in the
 1, 2, and 63 per cent. solutions of the same salts. It also held at
 different temperatures. The acetate of potash appeared to coincide
 in diffusibility with the same group, and so did the ferrocyanide of
potassium. The nitrate of potash, chlorate of potash, nitrate of am
 monia, chloride of potassium and chloride of ammonium formed an
 other equi-diffusive group. The times in which an equal amount of
 diffusion took place in these two groups appear to be as 1 for the
 second to 1.4142 for the first, or as 1 to the square root of 2. Now
 in gases, the squares of the times of equal diffusion are the densities
 of the gases. The relation between the sulphate of potash and nitrate
 of potash groups would therefore fall, to be referred to the diffusion
 molecule or diffusion vapour of the first group having a density re
 presented by 2, while that of the second group is represented by 1.
 • The corresponding salts of soda appeared to fall into a nitrate and
 sulphate group also, which have the same relation to each other as
 the potash salts.
     The relation of the salts of potash to those of soda, in times of
 equal diffusibility, appeared to be as the square root of 2 to the square
 root of 3; which gives the relation in density of their diffusion mo
 lecules, as 2 to 3. Hydrate of potash and sulphate of magnesia were
 less fully examined, but the first presented sensibly double the dif
  fusibility of sulphate of potash, and four times the diffusibility of the
  sulphate of magnesia. If these times are all squared, the following
  remarkable ratios are obtained for the densities of the diffusion mo
  lecules of these different salts, each of which is the type of a class of
  salts, hydrate of potash 1, nitrate of potash 2, sulphate of potash 4,
  sulphate of magnesia 16, with nitrate of soda 3 and sulphate of soda 6.
     In conclusion, it was observed, that it is these diffusion molecules
  of the salts which are concerned in solubility, and not the Daltonian
  atoms or equivalents of chemical combination; and the application
  was indicated of the knowledge of the diffusibilities of different sub
  stances to a proper study of endosmose.

   Dec. 14, 1849.—The Astronomer Royal gave an oral statement,
illustrated by models and diagrams, “On the Method of observing
and recording Transits, lately introduced in America; and on some
other connected subjects.”
   The Americans of the United States, although late in the field of
astronomical enterprise, have now taken up that science with their
characteristic energy, and have already shown their ability to instruct
their former masters. The method of observing which it is the ob
ject of this lecture to explain, was apparently suggested at first by
the obvious practicability of applying the Galvanic Telegraph (so
extensively used in America) to the determination of differences of
terrestrial longitude; and it was first used for the differences of
longitudes of the cities Louisville, Cincinnati, and Pittsburg. It ap
pears that this first application of the principle is entirely due to Dr.
Locke of Cincinnati.      It became, however, evident that the same
method might be used conveniently for recording the observations
made at one or at several instruments in the same observatory; and
Professor Mitchell, also of Cincinnati, actually prepared an apparatus
at the Observatory at Cincinnati, and with it made observations,
specimens of which have been sent to individuals in this country.
 One of these specimens was exhibited by the Astronomer Royal to
 the meeting. Between the systems of Dr. Locke and Professor
 Mitchell there is one radical difference, namely, in the principles of
 giving the signal of observation; in the principles of recording the
 signal there is also a difference, but this difference is not essential,
 and there appears to be no reason why the same method of making
 the record should not be used in both systems.        It will perhaps be
 most convenient to begin by describing the methods of making the
                                                                          k
 record, which are, or may be, common to both systems.
    The general principle of the methods, as regards the act of the
 observer, and its difference from the act in the ordinary observation
 of transits, is the following:-In ordinary observations the observer
 listens to the beat of a clock while he views the heavenly bodies
 passing across the wires; and he combines the two senses of hear
 ing and sight (usually by noticing the place of the body at each
 beat of the clock) in such a manner as to be enabled to compute
 mentally the fraction of the second when the object passes each
 wire, and he then writes down the time in an observing-book. In
 these new methods the observer has no clock near him, or at least
 none to which he listens; he observes with his eye the appulse of
 the object to the wire, and at that instant he touches an index, or
 key, with his finger; and this touch makes, by means of a galvanic
 current, an impression upon some recording apparatus (perhaps at a
 great distance), by which the fact and the time of the observation
 are registered. He writes nothing, except perhaps the name of the
 object observed.
    The method adopted by Dr. Locke was that of interrupted indented
 lines, produced by the pressure of a point or style (effected by a gal

                      Royal Astronomical Society.                    143
vanic magnet whose current is interrupted occasionally) upon a fillet
of paper, which is drawn by machinery with a nearly uniform speed
under the style. With this apparatus it is evident that a signal
almost instantaneous in duration can be given; either by supposing
the ordinary state of the apparatus to be that of exerting a pressure
on the style, and giving the signal by interrupting the galvanic
current; or by supposing that in the ordinary state of the apparatus
no pressure is exerted, and that the signal is given by completing
the galvanic circuit, which animates the magnet and creates an in
stantaneous pressure. In the first of these forms the record will ex
hibit the appearance of long lines interrupted by very short intervals;
in the second it will have the appearance of punctured dots, with
wide spaces between them.        Now, as no reliance whatever can be
placed on the uniformity of speed of the machinery which draws the
fillet, it is necessary to make such connexion of the apparatus with
a trustworthy clock, that the seconds (or other uniform intervals) of
the clock shall be recorded in the same manner upon the same fillet.
If this be effected by the same galvanic communication and the same
magnet, then, in the first case (or that in which the ordinary state
is that of pressure on the style), the record will consist of an indented
line, interrupted at short and sensibly equal intervals corresponding
to the seconds marked by the clock, and interrupted also at other
points corresponding to those instants at which the observer has, by
a voluntary effort, interrupted the galvanic circuit in order to give a
signal. This is the method adopted by Dr. Locke. In the second
case (where in the ordinary state no pressure is exerted), there will
be a series of punctured dots at sensibly equal intervals corresponding
to the seconds of the clock, and, mingled with these, there will be
the dots corresponding to the instants at which the observer has
completed the galvanic circuit. This is the method adopted by
 Professor Mitchell.
    In either of these methods there is no difficulty in producing such
a variation, repetition, or omission, of the clock-signals, as will di
 stinctly mark the beginnings of minutes, of every five minutes, &c.
    Dr. Locke appears to have been induced to adopt the method of
registering by interrupting the circuit (which in its ordinary state
was complete), by the following consideration:—His object was to
record upon one moving fillet of paper at Cincinnati the observations
 made at three stations (Louisville, Cincinnati, and Pittsburg), and
also the seconds of the clock. He remarked, then, that the interrup
 tion of the circuit for any one place would interrupt it for all; and
 therefore, at whatever place the signal of observation was made by
 interruption of circuit, the corresponding interruption would neces
 sarily be made in the indented line on the fillet of paper. But he
 remarked also that the connexion of the parts of the circuit at one
 place would not effect the connexion for all; and he appears to have
 inferred that, if a single wire only were used extending along all the
 stations, it would be impossible to use it by the method of completing
 the circuit for signal, and that, in fact, a separate wire would be ne
 cessary for each separate station. This inference, as the Astronomer

 144                 Royal Astronomical Society.
 Royal showed by diagrams, is incorrect. If the battery and the re
 cording apparatus are near together, then it is only necessary to have
 a single trunk-wire passing by all the stations (including the clock
 as one); and to have a branch-wire passing through the recording
apparatus to the battery, and a communication from the other end
of the battery to the ground; and also to have a branch-wire through
each station to the ground, interrupted in its ordinary state, but ad
mitting of connexion at the will of the observer, or by the motion of
the clock. Then, at whatever place the observer completes the con
nexion with the ground, the galvanic circuit through the recording
apparatus is completed. Or, in the most unfavourable case (which
is never likely to occur), of the battery at one extreme station, and
the recording apparatus at the other extreme station, it is only ne
cessary to have one trunk-wire proceeding from the battery through
all the stations, and another trunk-wire parallel to the first proceeding
from the recording apparatus through all the stations; then, at
whatever station the connexion between these two trunk-wires (pro
perly furnished with small branch-wires) is made by the observer,
the circuit through the recording apparatus is completed.
   The method of recording by the use of a fillet of paper, strictly
speaking, is used only by Dr. Locke. The equivalent method used
by Professor Mitchell is, to cause a circular disc to revolve with a
smooth and nearly uniform motion (by means of a Fraunhofer's
regulator), upon which disc the impressions of the style form a
dotted circle; then, at the end of each revolution, a tooth upon the
axis of the disc takes hold of a fixed rack and moves the travelling
frame, which carries the centre of the disc, through a small space,
so that the traces of the succeeding circle are prevented from mixing
with those of the preceding circle. Professor Mitchell alludes to the
practicability of using a cylinder which turns upon a screw axis, so
that the traces will be made in a perpetual spiral; and there can be
little doubt that this construction would be preferable to that of the
circular disc.    Among other reasons, the habitual estimation, or the
measure, of the fractions of the seconds, would probably be more
accurate where the length corresponding to a second is uniform than
where it varies from one circle to another, as it does on the circular
disc.
   The momentary interruption of the circuit in Dr. Locke's method,
or the momentary completion in Professor Mitchell's method, for the
register of observations, is made by touching a key nearly similar to
that of a musical instrument. This key may be attached to the ob
serving chair or to the astronomical instrument. Dr. Locke has not,
however, fully described the mechanism by which he makes his clock
interrupt the circuit. Professor Mitchell describes the action of his
clock in the following manner:—A delicate fibre attached to the
pendulum of the clock acts upon a “cruciform” lever [probably a
rectangular or “bell-crank” lever], and thus, in every double swing
of the pendulum, allows a metallic point to dip into a cup of quick
silver, and to complete the galvanic circuit. Thus, in Professor
Mitchell's register, the clock-dots are made at every two seconds.

                     Royal Astronomical Society.                      14.5
Professor Mitchell has found it convenient to use, for the seconds
record, a pen or style different from that which is used for the ob
servation-record.     He does not mention whether he uses for the
seconds-record a battery different from that used for the observation
record; but this appears necessary to prevent the confusion which
might arise in the register on making observations exactly at the
second of time; for the completion of the battery-circuit by one wire
would probably interfere with the efficiency of the circuit through
the other wire.
   The Astronomer Royal does not hesitate to express his preference
of Professor Mitchell's form of register to Dr. Locke's.
   The practicability of this method of recording observations being
fully established, it then becomes an important question for the ob
serving astronomer, whether this method is or is not more accurate
than the usual method of observing by the combination of eye and
ear. The question is, really, whether the connexion between the
nerves of the eye and of the finger is or is not closer than that between
the nerves of the eye and of the ear: it is purely a physiological
question, which can be settled only by experience. Professor Mitchell
has investigated it in the following manner. Extracting from the
printed Greenwich Observations a number of transits of a Coronae
and comparing their intervals with the intervals as established from
observations of the pole-star, he has obtained a measure of what may
be called Greenwich Irregularities. Using the same process for the
observations recorded by the Galvanic Register, he has obtained a
measure of Cincinnati Irregularities. The magnitude of the latter is
only about one-fourth of that of the former. The Astronomer Royal
suggested that a portion of this difference might be owing to the
difference in the state of the two atmospheres, the atmosphere of
England being perhaps comparatively unfavourable to accurate ob
servation. The result of Professor Mitchell's comparison is, however,
very encouraging as regards the probable success of the method.
   One important advantage of this method would be the contraction
of the time of observing a transit. Instead of using wires 12* or 15°
apart, intervals of 2" will be amply sufficient. Advantage may be
taken of this, either for the observation of numerous objects, or for
observation over numerous wires. One inconvenience of the method,
however, is, the trouble of translating the graphical registers into
numbers. Another inconvenience, of great weight, is the extent of
recording surface that will be required, unless the recording ma
chinery be very frequently disengaged, and its records (to a certain
degree, not essentially injurious, but troublesome) be rendered dis
continuous. In the Royal Observatory of Greenwich it is by no
means uncommon to have trains of interrupted observations ex
tending over twelve hours, or even a longer time, at once. An
unbroken series of time-marks of 12 hours in Dr. Locke's method,
allowing 1 inch to each second, would require 3600 feet of paper
fillet; in Professor Mitchell's method, allowing # inch for each second,
and I's inch between successive lines of dots, it would require a
sheet':f 1440 square inches of paper.

   The Astronomer Royal then stated that the possible advantages
of this method appeared so great that he had begun to contemplate
the practicability of adopting it in the Royal Observatory. One
reason exists there which probably exists nowhere else, namely, the
regularity of use of the Altitude and Azimuth Instrument by the
method of transits, and the necessity of referring these transits (with
the smallest possible uncertainty on personal equation) to the same
clock to which the meridional transits are referred.       In adopting
Professor Mitchell's general method, he would propose to record the
observations upon a cylinder, perhaps revolving upon a screw-axis.
It is proper to remark, that this screw-axis may be so mounted upon
friction-wheels that the friction would be quite imperceptible. The
friction-wheels must not have their planes transverse to the axis, but
in such a position that their edges follow the threads of the screw ;
and, supposing that there are two friction-wheels at each end, one
of the four must be fixed in place, and the others must be mounted
on frames which have a small hinge-motion in the direction perpen
dicular to the planes of the wheels. Or, instead of using the screw
motion, the frame which supports the axis of the cylinder may run
upon a railway, along which it will be carried by rack-and-pinion
mechanism, receiving its movement from the clock-work.         The mo
 tion of the cylinder may be given by a toothed wheel on one end,
which works in a stiff pinion, long enough to admit the toothed
wheel to slide along it through a space equal to the length of the
cylinder.
    In using this cylindrical record, it is obvious that great conve
nience would be gained if the movement of the cylinder could be
made so perfectly uniform that it could be adopted as the transit
clock.   Then the second-registers could be made on it by the same
clock which moves it (either by galvanic contact or mechanically),
and their places would bear a constant relation to the lines parallel
to the axis of the cylinder. The Astronomer Royal, therefore, urged
 strongly the importance of improvements of the centrifugal or coni
 cal-pendulum clock, as the only instrument yet made which is able
 to do heavy work with smooth motion, and with an accuracy at
present so great as to make it probable that, with due modification,
 the greatest accuracy may be obtained. Setting aside the consi
 deration of Fraunhofer's clock, as an instrument which, for pur
 poses like these, is rude, the Astronomer Royal stated that, as he
believed, the first efficient conical-pendulum clock was that made by
 Mr. Sheepshanks, in which the expansion of the balls to a certain
 angle produces suddenly a friction which, as soon as it amounts to
 an equivalent to the maintaining power, prevents further acceleration.
Theoretically, the speed of this clock depends in a very small degree
 on the maintaining power. In order to remedy this small defect,
 the Astronomer Royal had introduced the use of water power (by
the modern form of Barker's mill cr reaction engine) as the moving
force, and had regulated the supply of water by Sieman's chronome
tric governor. The principle of this governor may be used in various
 forms; the following, perhaps, will serve to explain it most clearly.

      Suppose the last wheel of the moving-train to be a beveled wheel
      whose plane is horizontal, carried by a vertical spindle; and suppose
      the spindle of the centrifugal balls to be above the moving-train
      spindle, in the same vertical line, but separate, and carrying a be
      veled wheel similar to the other, but in the opposite position; and
      suppose the connexion between these two beveled wheels to be
      made by an intermediate beveled wheel, whose plane is vertical, and
      whose axis passes between the two; the train-spindle and the ball
      spindle will evidently rotate in opposite directions. The axis of the
      intermediate wheel must not be fixed, but must be capable of turning
      in a horizontal plane, and it must be pulled by a weight (acting by
      a line over a pulley, or a right-angled lever), in the direction of
      turning the ball-spindle; it must also be connected with the water
      valve in such a way that the same pull will tend to open the water
      valve.   It is evident now that, while the axis of the intermediate
      wheel is free to move, the force driving the beveled wheel of the
      ball-spindle is rigorously uniform, and is equal to half the weight
      which pulls the axis of the intermediate wheel. If the moving power
      is suddenly increased, the immediate effect of this increase is, not to
      accelerate the ball-spindle, but to drive the intermediate wheel in
      such a manner that its axis lifts the pulling-weight, and partially
      closes the water-valve. An opposite motion takes place if the moving
      power is suddenly diminished.      In this manner the water-valve is
      maintained in that state which supplies the force that exactly pro
      duces a determinate moving power upon the ball-spindle.
         In some localities it may be difficult to obtain the proper supply
      of water, and in some there may be danger of obstruction by frost.
      The Astronomer Royal had, therefore, endeavoured to effect the
      same object by the use of weights. By a remontoir-train the uni
      formity of rotation of the balls might undoubtedly be secured; but
      then the motion of the primary wheels of the train would be inter
      mittent. The following plan, however, appears to the Astronomer
      Royal to be perfect.      Let the arrangement of the three beveled
|8    wheels and the pulling-weight be exactly the same as that above
At    described, but let the train spindle carry a broad flat disc, whose
Il,   plane is horizontal: upon this let a lever press by a definite projec
      tion from its lower side, and on the upper side of the lever let there
lf    be a sliding weight (as a ball running in a groove); let the spindle
hê    of the intermediate beveled wheel command the place of this ball
Wy    by a fork projecting downwards, loosely including it; and let the
aim   tendency of the pulling weight be to draw this ball towards or over
  to  the fulcrum of the lever, so as to diminish the pressure of its definite
i00.  projection upon the flat disc. Then, if the moving force is suddenly
      increased, its immediate effect will be to drive the intermediate
ge:
tect, wheel in such a direction as to push the running ball further along
 (by  the lever, and thus to increase the pressure of its projection upon
wing  the flat revolving disc, and to produce a friction which will absorb
Ome"  the excess of power.
rious    There are still two practical defects which it is desirable to re
      InOVe.

148                Royal Astronomical Society.
   The first is, the amount of friction in the rotation of the balls,
which, indeed, is so great, that in the clock-work used for equatoreal
motion it consumes by far the greater part of the power. In the
shape in which Sieman's regulator is usually applied to steam-engines,
with one ball revolving by a rod whose support is a ball-and-socket
joint, the friction is intolerably great. When balls are mounted on
a vertical spindle, the friction, although much diminished, is still far
too great. The Astronomer Royal had therefore directed his
thoughts to the mounting of the conical pendulum, so as greatly to
diminish the friction.    In the summer of 1846 he chanced to see at
the Gewerbe Aufstellung of Wiesbaden" a beautiful centrifugal-ball
clock, intended for a drawing-room. The maker had acutely re
marked that the circular motion might be resolved into two rectan
gular motions, and that each of these might be produced by the vi
bratory motion of a knife-edge. The pendulum, therefore, vibrated
immediately by a knife-edge upon concave agates carried by a small
frame, and this frame itself was furnished with knife-edges in the
direction transversal to the former, which vibrated upon concave
agates carried by the fixed frame of the clock. The pendulum thus
moved with so much freedom that it was kept in conical vibration
by a small maintaining power, acting ultimately by a light radial arm
to maintain the rotation. The arc of expansion was determined (as
in ordinary pendulums) merely by the resistance of the air.
   This motion on knife-edges is liable to the same objections as the
use of knife-edges for clock-pendulums. The Astronomer Royal
therefore proposes to substitute for them a mounting by springs.
The pendulum is immediately supported by two springs from a frame,
and this frame is itself supported from the fixed parts of the clock
frame by two springs whose relative position is transversal to that
of the former, and whose plane of vibration is transversal to that of
the former; the form of the intermediate frame being such that, when
the pendulum hangs in a vertical position, the upper ends of the
four springs will be in one horizontal plane, and the lower ends
will also be in one horizontal plane. A model of this mounting was
exhibited.   The motion is most satisfactory; the pendulum revolves
many times before the diameter of its circle is diminished to one-half.
In the complete clock-work the power of the train is to act on this
by a radial arm.
   The second defect, which will only be sensible when the mecha
nism has received these improvements (but of the distinct effect of
which the Astronomer Royal has no doubt), is the want of compen
sation for the thermal expansion of the pendulum rod. Supposing
the limiting arc of vibration determined by rotation within a ring.
   * The mechanical talent of inland Germany, having had little employ
ment in the construction of powerful engines or manufacturing machinery,
appears to have developed itself in the invention of clock-work. The
Museum in the Schloss of Gotha contains a remarkable collection of
clocks embodying every conceivable device. None, however, has appeared
to the Astronomer Royal so remarkable for the accuracy of its mechanical
conception as that which is described in the text.

the contact of the rod with which produces the friction that prevents
further acceleration, the Astronomer Royal proposes the following
simple construction. The ring is to be of brass, and is to be car
ried in two or more points of its circumference by horizontal bars,
each bar being supported at the extremity furthest from the ring by
an iron pillar, and at some point between the iron pillar and the ring
by a brass pillar; the pendulum rod and all other parts of the frame
being of iron. The expansion of the brass ring, and its elevation by
the effect of the different expansion of the two pillars carrying each
horizontal bar, will both contribute (and may be made to do so to
any assignable degeee) to permit the greater angular expansion of
the conical motion which is necessary for isochronism when the pen
dulum rod is lengthened by heat. [It is well known that the time
of rotation of the conical pendulum depends only on the vertical de
pression of the ball below the horizontal plane passing through the
centre of motion.]
    It may, however, be thought preferable to employ a mercurial
pendulum of the ordinary construction as regards compensation,
revolving in a very small circle, whose diameter is perhaps equal to
the usual arc of vibration of a common clock pendulum, and whose
dimensions are limited only by the resistance of the air. The radial
arm ought to act on a slender spike at the bottom of the mercury
cistern. The pulling-weight would be very light, but the efficiency
of the regulation would not be diminished by that circumstance.
No ring would be necessary, except as a safety-guard, to prevent
the machinery from running wild on any accidental excursion of
the pendulum beyond the end of the radial arm.
   The Astronomer Royal then remarked that, considering the pro
blem of smooth and accurate motion as being now much nearer to
its solution than it had formerly been, it might be a question whether,
supposing a sidereal clock made on these principles to be mounted
at the Royal Observatory, it should be used in communicating
motion to a solar clock. It might by some persons be thought ad
vantageous, even now, that the drop of the signal-ball (at 1h Green
wich mean solar time) should be effected by clock-machinery; and
it is quite within possibility that a time-signal may be sent from the
Royal Observatory to different parts of the kingdom at certain mean
solar hours every day, by a galvanic current regulated by clock-ma
chinery. Whether it would be advisable that this should be done

be a question for consideration at the proper time; but, at all events,
the Astronomer Royal desired to show that the problem is practi
cally possible to an astonishing degree of accuracy. Dr. Henderson,
of Newferry near Birkenhead, had communicated to the Astronomer
Royal, and had permitted him to make known to the Society, the
following numbers for the teeth of wheels. If there be three spin
dles, Nos. 1, 2 and 3, No. 1 revolving in a mean solar day of 24
hours, or 86,400 solar seconds, and if No. 1 carries a wheel of 247
teeth working in a wheel of 331 teeth on No. 2, and if No. 2 also
carries a wheel of 43 teeth working in a wheel of 32 teeth on No. 3,

 teeth working in a wheel of 133 teeth on No. 3, and if No. 3 also

 then No. 4 will revolve in 23h 56" 4*09235. The length of the side
 real day adopted in the Nautical Almanac is 23" 56" 4*0906. The
 approximations to it obtained above are very remarkable. By reversing
 the same train of wheels, accurate motion corresponding to sidereal
 time will be made to generate motion corresponding with the same
 degree of approximation to mean solar time.
    A Method of Correcting the Errors due to the Forms of the Pivots
 of a Transit Instrument.      By Professor Challis.
    The method proposed by the author requires the solution of the
 following problem:—Having drawn from a selected point of the
 middle wire of the telescope, situated near where the transits are
 usually taken, a straight line to the optical centre of the object
 glass, it is required to find, independently of the forms of the pivots,
 the small angle made by this line with the plane of the meridian for
 any position of the telescope.     The solution of this problem may be
 effected by employing Bohnenberger's collimating eye-piece in con
junction with the method of measuring by micrometer-microscopes
 the positions of two dots at the extremities of the pivots, first sug
 gested by the Astronomer Royal and applied by him in testing the
 forms of the pivots of the new altitude and azimuth instrument at the
 Greenwich Observatory. The collimating eye-piece gives the angle
 (a) which the line of collimation makes with the meridian plane
 when the telescope is directed to the nadir. If y, y, be the vertical
 microscope readings for bisections of the dots in this position of the
 telescope, y', y's be the vertical microscope readings, and v', v', the
 horizontal microscope readings for bisections of the dots, when the
 telescope is pointed to an angular distance, 2, from the zenith south
 ward, and # be the small angle required, then
       #=-

D being the distance between the dots, and h and k certain con
stants, by means of which the readings of the two microscopes are
referred to the same vertical and horizontal planes. The constant k
is found by measuring the difference of altitude of the dots in re
versed positions of the instrument, the telescope being directed to
the nadir, and at the same time noting by the collimating eye-piece
the change of inclination of the line of collimation to the vertical
caused by the reversion. The correction to be applied to an ob
served time of transit across the middle wire to reduce it to the time
of meridian transit    #x      cosec N.P.D.    Hence h may be found
by two consecutive transits of Polaris. These constants being
known, the angle # may be calculated for zenith distances separated
by intervals of 5°, and extending from-90° to +90°. The differences
between these values of # and the values of the same angle which

supposition that the pivots are perfectly cylindrical, are certain func
tions of z, which may be assumed to remain constant throughout

being formed, in which the argument is the north polar distance, any
observed time of transit is first to be corrected by a quantity derived
by interpolation from this table, and then the remaining reduction
to meridian transit may be effected, by obtaining the collimation,
level, and azimuth errors, and applying corrections on account of
them, by the ordinary processes.

  DR. BIALLOBLOTZKY’s Jou RNEY To Discove R THE sources
                             OF THE NILE.
      R. BEKE has recently addressed to the subscribers to Dr. Bial
        loblotzky's projected exploratory journey into Eastern Africa, a
circular letter, announcing that he has remitted to that traveller, who
is now in Egypt, the funds necessary for enabling him to return
home, and submitting to them a general and final statement of the
sums received by him and of their appropriation.
   Dr. Beke adds that the labours of the Church Missonaries stationed
at Rabbai Empia, near Mombás, seem likely to result in the realiza
tion of the views as to the geography of Eastern Africa, which were
enunciated by him in the year 1846, and which Dr. Bialloblotzky's
expedition was intended to verify.
   Already has the Rev. Mr. Rebmann, in his several exploratory
journeys, discovered, in about 3° 40' S. lat. and 36° E. long., a lofty
mountain, named Kilimandjáro, whose summit is covered with per
petual snow, and obtained information respecting a region further in
the interior, called Uniamési, or “the country of the Moon;” and he
has further ascertained the existence, in Uniamési, of a large lake,
which is not (as has been supposed) identical with Nyassi or “the
Sea”—the great lake of Southern Africa, commonly known as lake
Marávi—but from its name, Usámbiro, is apparently the Lake Zambre
of the Portuguese of the 16th and 17th centuries.
   On the other hand, the Egyptian expeditions for exploring the
Upper Nile have ascended the river as far as the fourth parallel of
north latitude, where they have found it to be still a very large stream,
about 2000 feet in breadth during the rains; and as the country of
Uniamési (or Mono-Moézi) may be approximatively placed in 2° to 4°
 S. lat. and 29° to 34° E. long., the head of the Nile would, by its
course being extended only 300 or 400 miles beyond the extreme
point reached by the Egyptian expeditions, be brought near if not
into this country of Uniamési.
    Should it really be the case that the Nile rises in the snow-capped
 Kilimandjáro or other similar mountains, in the vicinity of the lake
in “the country of the Moon,” the fact would be almost literally in

accordance with the assertions made 1700 years ago by the geo
grapher Claudius Ptolemy of Alexandria, that the sources of the
Nile are in the Mountains of the Moon, and that the lakes of that
river receive the snows of those mountains.
   According to the latest intelligence received from the Missionaries,
Mr. Rebmann had set out on the 5th of April last for Uniamési and
the lake there; so that we may confidently anticipate the speedy so
lution of the great problem of geography—Nili quarere caput.
      oN THE ESTIMATION OF THE WEIGHT OF ANTIMONY.
                            BY M. H. ROSE.
    Antimonious acid (oxide of antimony Sb--3O) may be estimated
in a mode analogous to arsenious acid, by means of a solution of gold.
This method requires, however, more precautions than the determi
nation of arsenious acid. For, at the same time that the gold is re
duced, antimonic acid is separated, which when it has once been pre
cipitated, is very difficultly soluble in hydrochloric acid; this preci
pitation must therefore be prevented by the previous addition of a
 great excess of hydrochloric acid.
    Separation of Antimony from Tin.—The author has already pro
 posed a method for the separation of these two metals: this consists
 in eliminating the antimony in the form of antimoniate of soda by
 means of water, from a solution of tin in hydrate of soda. As, how
 ever, antimoniate of soda is not perfectly insoluble in water, this method
 does not give perfectly accurate results; a more precise one consists
 in the separation of antimoniate of soda from stannate of soda by
 means of dilute alcohol.
    When an alloy of these two metals is to be separated, the first step
 to be taken, is that of completely oxidizing both by nitric acid.
 The acids obtained, from which the nitric acid is to be expelled by
 gently heating them, are to be fused in a silver crucible with hydrate
 of soda.  The fused mass is moistened with water, and then alcohol
is to be added; dilute alcohol is to be used for washing the anti
moniate of soda.
    The alcoholic solution of stannate of soda is exposed to a gentle
heat to expel the greater part of the alcohol, then diluted with water,
 and saturated with dilute sulphuric acid, and lastly the tin is to be
 precipitated in the state of sulphuret by means of hydrosulphuric
 acid, and then to be converted into oxide of tin.
    The antimoniate of soda is dissolved in a mixture of hydrochloric
 and tartaric acids, and the antimony is precipitated from the solution
 by hydrosulphuric acid gas in the form of sulphuret of antimony.
    Separation of Antimony from Tin and Arsenic.—The metals are
oxidized by nitric acid, the oxidized mass is evaporated to dryness,
and then fused in a silver crucible with hydrate of soda. The fused
mass is diffused in water and treated with dilute alcohol.         Antimo
niate of soda remains, which does not dissolve, washed with dilute
alcohol, and is afterwards dissolved in a mixture of hydrochloric and

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.               153
tartaric acids; from this solution the antimony is precipitated in the
form of sulphuret by hydrosulphuric acid gas.
    It is hardly necessary to expel by heat the alcohol from the solution
from which the antimoniate of soda has been separated; it is to be
saturated with hydrochloric acid, and without filtering the arseniate
of tin which is formed, a current of hydrosulphuric acid gas is to be
passed into it.
     Separation of Antimonious and Antimonic Acids.—These two acids
 may be quantitatively determined when they occur together in so
 lution in hydrochloric acid, by a solution of gold. This solution of
 gold is a good substance for discovering the existence of antimonious
 acid in the presence of a great excess of antimonic acid; but solution
 of nitrate of silver is a still more sensible reagent for discovering an
 timonious acid. If to a solution of antimonic acid in hydrate of
 potash, a solution of nitrate of silver be added, an intense black pre
 cipitate is obtained. This precipitate is not soluble in ammonia;
 but it takes this substance from oxide of silver which has been pre
 cipitated by an excess of solution of potash; when a solution of nitrate
 of silver is added to one of antimoniate of potash, a white precipitate
 of antimoniate of silver is obtained, with a yellowish tint. If the
  solution contains free potash, the precipitate of oxide of silver, simul
  taneously formed, is brown. The two precipitates are completely
 insoluble in ammonia.        If, on the other hand, the solution contains
  but a small quantity of antimonious acid, there remains, when the
  precipitate is treated with ammonia, a black precipitate which does
  not dissolve.—L'Institut, Decembre 26, 1849.
  on THE AssocIATION OF SILVER wiTH METALLIC MINERALs,
      AND METHODS OF EXTRACTING IT,              BY MM, MALAGUTI AND
      DUROCHER.
      In a former memoir the authors showed that silver exists in many
  metallic sulphurets, in which its presence had not been suspected,
  and they are now able to state that most of them contain silver, even
  when not coming from situations in which this metal is extracted.
  Thus of more than two hundred specimens examined, only about
  one-twentieth contained no silver. Many indeed contained traces
  only, and there would have been some uncertainty if the usual methods
  of assaying had not been modified.
      It was soon discovered that the humid process is totally inappli
  cable in such researches; litharge was then prepared almost without
  silver, and the purity of the fluxes and the other reagents employed,
  was ascertained.     Afterwards the conditions under which the fusions
   should be performed, so asto lose as little as possible, were determined,
   and they ascertained that buttons of silver, which weighed the six
   teenth of a milligramme, did not disappear in cupellation, even when
   allied with 30 grammes of lead.
      In the experiments performed on the roasting of various sulphurets,
   the authors were surprised on finding that silver contained in blendes
   would lose more than half by sublimation. In certain cases this metal

 154           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
 thereforevolatilizes much more readily than was supposed; it incrusted
 the surfaces of the apparatus employed; the same happens to the
 silver in roasting galenas; this fact explains an important metallurgic
 fact, which is, that notwithstanding the precautions taken to collect
 pulverulent cadmium in the condensation chambers, there is always
 a considerable loss of silver which is carried up, and fixed on the sur
 face of the apparatus, that it cannot be detached; this was shown
 to be the case by experiments.
    Silver is unequally diffused in the various metallic compounds:
 thus oxides and saline combinations are always poorer than sulphurets,
 and among the latter, the compounds with a radical of iron are gene
 rally less rich in silver than those of lead, copper and zinc.     These
 remarks on the unequal distribution of silver in natural substances,
 are moreover confirmed by what passes in the operations in the dry
 way, whether performed in the laboratory or metallurgic establish
 mentS.
    The universal diffusion of silver in the mineral kingdom induces
 the belief that other metals are perhaps as widely disseminated in
 nature; this is already known to be the case with iron. With this
 view the authors examined crystalline minerals possessing all the
 characters of purity. Twelve specimens of galena, besides silver,
 contained very sensible quantities of iron, copper and zinc.
    In order to ascertain the state in which silver is associated in small
 quantity in various metallic minerals, and especially in sulphurets,
sulphoarseniurets, and sulphoantimoniurets, such reagents were first
employed as were supposed capable of acting upon metallic silver,
and not upon its sulphuret, especially when it is combined with other
metallic sulphurets. Neither liquid chlorine, bichloride of copper,
nor persulphate of iron gave very positive results; mercury yielded
more precise indications: of thirty-eight specimens operated upon,
and of which some were considerably rich, eleven only yielded to
mercury a part of their silver.     The comparison of results deduced
from experiments made under similar conditions upon substances into
which metallic silver or its sulphuret had been in various ways intro
duced, led to the conclusion that the silver, probably, does not exist
in the same state in all sulphurets, containing small quantities of it,
but that it is most frequently combined in the state of sulphuret with
the substance which it accompanies.
   The authors have completed their preceding experiments, demon
strating that metallic sulphurets cannot contain silver in the state of
chloride or bromide; and they have noticed some remarkable reactions
occurring between chlorides and sulphurets. The authors divide
these into three groups:—1st, bimolecular sulphurets, such as those
of zinc, cadmium, lead, &c.; 2ndly, sulphurets possessing several
molecules of sulphur, and capable of parting with some of it, bisul
phuret of tinfor example, 3rdly, sulphurets not saturated with sulphur
and susceptible of combining with it, such as the protosulphuret of
copper.
   The first react upon the chloride of silver by double decomposition;
the second undergo partial reduction, becoming protosulphuret; the

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.              155
last partly reduce the chloride of silver, and also act upon it by double
decomposition.
   The arseniurets, sulpharseniurets and sulphantimoniurets, placed
in the same circumstances, produce upon the chloride of silver an
action resembling that of the sulphurets.
   These different bodies were added to chloride of silver dissolved in
ammonia, and sometimes in hydrosulphite of soda; but it was found
that the presence of the solvent produced no other effect than that
of accelerating the phaenomenon, and rendering observation of it more
commodious, but it did not alter the essential conditions of it.
   It is remarkable to observe that the decomposition produced by
the sulphurets, arseniurets, &c., is often as complete as if the opera
tion was conducted on bodies dissolved in water. As examples of this
may be cited, native sulphuret of copper, arseniuret of antimony,
arsenical cobalt, arsenical nickel, &c. Certain sulphurets, though but
few, do not act; such for example are the sulphuret of mercury and
gray cobalt, which in this respect differs much from gray nickel.
Metallic iron resembles it in this respect, that it does not precipitate,
or but very slightly, silver from solution in the form of concentrated
ammoniacal chloride, or even in the form of nitrate.
   The power of sulphurets to decompose chloride of silver is gene
rally more marked in those which act by way of reduction than in
those which produce double decomposition; moreover this power
appears to have relation to the electro-chemical state of the metals.
It must also be added, that various minerals belonging to the same
species possess decomposing powers varying according to their dif
ferent composition, crystalline form, density and cohesion.
   Bromide of silver, put into contact with metallic sulphurets, offer
the same phaenomena of decomposition as the chloride. In short, all
these facts appear to depend upon a general law of the reactions of
the sulphurets on the chlorides, and of insoluble on soluble salts.
Moreover, the authors find that these reactions are produced in the
dry as well as in the humid way: thus galena decomposes chloride
of silver in fusion; blende was found to detain the vapour of this
chloride and to convert it into sulphuret of silver. The same vapour
is also decomposed with the assistance of heat by quartz, felspar,
argil and silicates in general.
   The reactions of sulphurets on chlorides, produced under such va
rious circumstances, evidently possess a general character, and the
observation of various metalliferous deposits offers additional confir
mation of it; for the chloride and bromide of silver do not occur
among the same metallic sulphurets, but in the upper parts of veins,
which have been altered and oxidized by the influence of external
causes. The authors also deduce from their experiments, the ex
planation of certain geological phaenomena; for example, the con
centration which the mineral of native and sulphuret of silver of the
veins of Konigsberg has undergone; a mineral which occurs agglo
merated by schistose bands impregnated with various metallic sul
phurets, as iron and copper pyrites, blende and galena.—Comptes
Rendus, Decembre 10, 1849.

oN THE PRESENCE OF LEAD, CoPPER, AND SILVER IN SEA
    WATER, AND OF THE LAST METAL IN ORGANIZED BEINGS.
    BY MM. MALAGUTI, DUROCHER AND SARSEAU.
   The authors decided on making researches       on the above subject
by the fact, to which two of them had already     drawn the attention of
the Academy, that silver is widely diffused in    metallic minerals. For
example, in blendes and pyrites its presence       is very common; its
absence from galenas is an exception. But as salt water by long
action is capable of converting these substances into chlorides, which
it dissolves, the author inquired whether sea-water might not contain
these metals, which in the form of sulphurets it either washes or
covers in the earth. Such were the motives for research : they were
not, however, undertaken till after having dispelled every kind of
fallacy, by a minute examination of the reagents and recipients to
be employed.
   The authors proved the presence of silver in the water of the
ocean by two different methods; it was taken at a distance of some
leagues from the coast of St. Malo, and the results were compared by
researches as to this metal in the fucus of the same latitude.     Of all
those which the authors examined, the F serratus and ceramoides were
                                             :, whilst the sea-water
the richest; their ash contained at least 100,000
contained but a little more than £.
    If the water of the sea is argentiferous, the common salt and arti
ficial products derived from it ought also to be so; and, in fact, ex
periment proved this to be the case. Common salt, common muriatic
acid, and artificial soda contain minute quantities of silver. Does,
however, the generality of the fact depend upon a constant law, or
on a collection of variable causes 7
   The authors sought to solve this question by examining the sal
gem of Lorraine, which very probably represents the ancient seas:
it was fortunately found to contain silver, and hence the authors
conclude that the presence of this metal in the waters of the ocean
depends upon a constant law.
   Never losing sight of the point from which they set out, the
authors inquired whether terrestrial plants might not assimilate, by
means of their roots, the silver which in the state of solution might
be presented to them by subterranean waters. This water, mineral
ized by many salts, and among others by chlorides, would be en
riched with silver by its action on the metallic sulphurets with which
it would meet in its course.     The examination of ashes derived from
a mixed heap of different kinds left no doubt of the presence of silver
in different vegetable tissues; this fact indicated another, that of the
presence of this same metal in the animal oeconomy. This the
authors conceive themselves able to state, from experimenting on
considerable quantities of ox blood.
   Lastly, it remained to be determined whether additional evidence
of the extreme diffusion of silver, and its independence of every acci
dental or inherent cause in the modern world, could not be obtained

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.              157
by researches on ancient vegetables. The ashes of coal were ex
amined, and the authors state that the presence of silver in them
was not so satisfactorily demonstrated as in the ashes of modern
vegetables.
   After many useless attempts, the authors gave up the direct
search for lead and copper in sea-water; but they feel convinced
that it is to be found. By examining several species of fucus, they
found in their ashes : of lead and a little copper : this proves
that if the quantity of these two metals in sea-water is so minute as
to escape detection by reagents, it is not sufficiently so to escape the
assimilating power of plants.
    To recapitulate the principal facts to which the authors call the
attention of the Academy; they are the presence of silver in sea
water, in sal-gem, and in organized beings; the presence of lead
and copper in certain species of fucus, and consequently in the me
dium in which these plants live.—Comptes Rendus, Decembre 26,

           OBSERVATIONS ON THE ESTIMATION OF LIME.
                      BY M. ALWARO REYNOSO.
    Lime is one of the substances which chemists have occasion
most frequently to estimate the quantity of; and as this is always
effected in the state of oxalate of lime, it is important to know all the
properties of this salt, in order to avoid the errors which analysis
 would otherwise occasion.
    With this view the author has undertaken some experiments on
 the action of soluble salts, capable of becoming insoluble oxalates by
 reacting on oxalate of lime.
    Oxalate of lime is converted by the influence of a soluble salt of
 copper, as the chloride, sulphate and nitrate, into oxalate of copper.
The presence of lime has been ascertained in the liquor separated
 from the oxalate of copper formed. The precipitate formed by mix
 ing one equivalent of chloride of calcium with one equivalent of
 oxalate of ammonia dissolves in chloride of copper when poured into
 it at once; but by long standing, agitation, or boiling the liquor, a
 precipitate is formed, which is shown by analysis to be oxalate of
 copper; when the chloride of copper is gradually added, the oxalate
 of lime is converted into oxalate of copper, and there is at the same
 time formed a soluble salt of lime : the oxalate of copper precipitates,
 and is no longer redissolved by an excess of chloride of copper.
    The fact of the solution of oxalate of lime in chloride of copper,
 and the subsequent precipitation of oxalate of copper, seems to be
 analogous to what happens if phosphate of ammonia and magnesia is
 prepared when a large quantity of hydrochlorate of ammonia is pre
 sent. This property does not belong exclusively to chloride of cop
 per; since other salts, as chloride of calcium, hydrochlorate of am
 monia and chloride of sodium, equally retard the precipitation of the
 oxide of copper.
     Oxalate of lime, when a large quantity of some salts is present,

1.58           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
as chloride of sodium, chloride of calcium and hydrochlorate of am
monia, dissolves in the chloride of copper, even when the latter is
added by drops. Nevertheless in this case, the vibrations occasioned
by the formation and precipitation of oxalate of copper should be as
much as possible avoided, when it ceases to dissolve in the excess of
the salt of copper; this precipitate is, however, formed after a certain
time.
   When excess of oxalate of ammonia is poured into chloride of
calcium, and a salt of copper is afterwards added, no solution takes
place. A precipitate of oxalate of copper is obtained, and a soluble
salt of lime remains in the liquor; but if this experiment be made in
presence of an excess of hydrochlorate of ammonia, the oxalate of
copper does not immediately precipitate, and the solution remains
clear for some time.
   Oxalate of lime, boiled with soluble salts of silver, lead, cadmium,
zinc, nickel, cobalt, strontia and barytes, undergoes double decom
position; so that a soluble salt of lime remains in solution, and the
oxalates of these metals are precipitated.
   Thus oxalate of lime is decomposed by all the soluble salts of
metals capable of forming insoluble oxalates and soluble salts of lime.
The decomposition takes place more readily, as the equivalent of the
metal which replaces the lime is higher.
   The author proposes to extend this inquiry to all the oxalates,
and to examine in a more general point of view the action of soluble
upon insoluble salts.—Comptes Rendus, Novembre 12, 1849.
     ON THE PRESENCE OF HIPPURIC ACID IN THE BLOOD.
               BY MM. F. VERDEIL AND CH. DOLFIJSS.
   The authors state in a note to the Academy, that they have dis
covered hippuric acid in the blood of the ox. The blood upon which
their experiments were performed was obtained by themselves at the
slaughter-house; the experiments were repeated on the blood of
many oxen, and hippuric acid was always found to be present. It
was perfectly isolated from the blood, and its properties carefully
studied. Not having obtained enough of the substance to submit it
to an elementary analysis, they satisfied themselves that this sub
stance was similar to the hippuric acid found in the urine of herbi
vorous animals, by the form of the crystals, as shown by the mi
croscope, their insolubility in cold, and their solubility in hot
water, alcohol and aether: this substance fuses by heat, exhaling the
 characteristic odour of benzoin. The process which the authors

XXII. On the connevion of Atmospheric Electricity with the
   Condensation of Vapour. By WILLIAM RADCLIFF BIRT*.
Ti:        intimate connexion which appears to subsist between
       the quantity of water diffused or suspended in the atmo
sphere, and the electric tension as exhibited by an atmosphe
rical conductor, renders it not only interesting but important
to trace either theoretically, or by means of experiment, the
process of the formation of cloud and its resolution into rain,
and the development of electricity as connected with each of
these processes.
   It is not my intention in the present paper to detail any new
experiments, nor to bring before the reader the results of any
recent investigations on this interesting subject, further than
as they may incidentally throw light on any remarks which
it may be found necessary to indulge in, in prosecuting the
object now proposed. I shall consequently place before the
reader, so far as my knowledge extends, what has been already
written on the subject; and I must therefore claim his indul
gence, especially in a work like this, for treading beaten ground,
and presenting nothing novel to his notice. The office I pro
pose to myself is that of a lens, which, concentrating the scat
tered rays of light, renders them more powerfully efficient in
illuminating in some cases obscure objects.
   The first writer I shall quote is John Read of Knightsbridge.
In his work on atmospheric electricity published in 1793, at
page 22 he has this remark relative to the relation of air to
electricity: “I have no idea, much less suppose, that any,
even the least quantity of electricity does ever come from air
itself; for there is reason to think, that air as air, independent
of the other substances, is unable to furnish any particle of
                    * Communicated by the Author.
   Phil. Mag. S. 3. Vol. 36. No. 242. March 1850.           M

  162 Mr. W. R. Birt on the connexion of Atmospheric Electricity
 this fluid; and I conjecture that pure air and electricity are
 actually incapable of uniting; and therefore it is that air is
 never known to attract, absorb, nor conduct electricity, but in
 proportion to the conducting substances with which it happens
 to be occasionally mixed: nor is air excitable of electricity by
 any means that is yet known; therefore air does not appear
 to be either an electric or a conducting body.
    “It is in consequence of these peculiar properties of air
 that it is found to insulate the electric fluid more perfectly
 than any other substance.”
    In the above extract we are informed of the perfect indif
..ference of air to electricity, whether we regard the latter as a
 fluid, or adopt the more modern view of its being a force
 brought into play by heat, friction, &c. Keeping steadily in
 mind this perfect indifference, the following extract presents
 us with a mode by which the electricity, or regarding it at
 present as a force, “the electric force,” is conveyed from one
 portion of the atmosphere to another:—
    “The electricity rises invisibly from the earth concealed in
 the aqueous vapour; and as the vapour ascends higher and
 higher into cooler air, it becomes more condensed, by which
 the electricity which it contains will become more condensed
 also", insomuch that it will now display its energy; and in
 whatever direction it moves, it is sure to move actively, ani
 mated with a penetrating and expansive force; for in this state
proper instruments will easily accumulate and detain it, so as
to render it visible.”
    In this paragraph Read says “the electricity rises invisibly
from the earth concealed in the aqueous vapour;” in other
words, each particle of vapour as it rises from the earth is
electrified (from what source we do not now stop to inquire),
or is capable, when placed in a proper situation, of exhibiting
that force which we are in the habit of terming “electric.”
It may be well here to contemplate each particle of vapour as
surrounded by pure air, through which, as air, the electric
force will not pass, i. e. the force cannot be communicated
through it unless it is of sufficient tension to “strike” through
the space to another conducting body. Now if by any means
heat is abstracted from the vapour particles, or they pass into
a stratum of cold air, they become condensed, i. e. they are
reduced in size, contemplating each individual drop, or several
run together and produce visible vapour; in both cases the
   * It is well known that if equal quantities of electricity be imparted to
two unequal insulated conductors, the electricity on the least surface will
become more intense than on the largest. Electrified vapour is also sub
ject to this law. [J. Read.]

                with the Condensation of Vapour.              163
surface over which the electric force was originally spread is
reduced, so that it is by condensation confined to a smaller
surface, and consequently ready to exert itself with greater
energy, in other words, its tension is increased. If under
these circumstances a substance capable of receiving and con
ducting the force is brought into contact with the vapour, the
latter parts with its charge, or so much of it as is necessary to
maintain an equilibrium between it and such bodies as we
have just alluded to.
   We have here presented to our notice two important par
ticulars connected with the ascent of electrified vapour in the
process of evaporation—its insulation by the surrounding air,
and the increase of electric tension upon its condensation. In
connexion with the insulation of the electrified vapour, or as
Howard more correctly terms it, “suspended water (not
vapour, for that is a gas and therefore a non-conductor),”
Howard, in his Climate of London, vol. i. p. 148, has this im
portant passage:–
   “We can scarcely imagine a body more perfectly INSU
LATED than the first particle of water, which separating from
vapour that has ascended into the higher atmosphere, begins
to obey the law of gravity. There are two sources from
whence such a particle may obtain an electric charge, viz. the
surrounding AIR, and the vapour out of which it was formed;
and which MAY (though in itself non-electric) afford to the
water, now reduced many hundred fold in volume, A REAL Posi
TIVE CHARGE.”
   [The words printed in small capitals were scored by Mr.
Howard, those in italics by myself—W. R. B.]
   It may be remarked in passing, that the views of these
authors as to the source of the electric force differ. Read
regards the force as rising from the earth. Howard conceives
the vapour or aqueous gas to be destitute of electric force, but
to exhibit it, or rather to receive a charge on its condensation
and resumption of the form of water.
   We have in the foregoing extract brought clearly before
the mind a single drop of water positively electrified and per
fectly insulated. Keeping this insulated electrified drop of
water in view, Mr. Howard points out to us the manner in
which its electric tension may be, and most probably is, in
creased. In his Introduction, page lxiv, in speaking of the
formation of the cumulus, he says, “On these considerations
we are obliged to admit as a cooperating cause of the increase
of this cloud, that sort of attraction which large insulated con
ducting masses exercise when charged, on the smaller ones which
lie within their influence,” viz. “to throw the small one into an

164 Mr.W. R. Birt on the connevion of Atmospheric Electricity
opposite state and then attract it.” This passage strikingly
illustrates the increase of the electric tension by the increase
of the size of the drop, not simply by the attraction of aggre
gation alone, but by the larger drops, considered as insulated
conductors, throwing the smaller drops into an opposite state
and then attracting them; so that in addition to the attraction
of aggregation, by which the drops have a tendency to coalesce,
the electrical attraction alluded to by Howard has a tendency
to increase the size of the larger drops, or rather to produce
 “an agglomeration of many minute and feebly electrified glo
bules into one rain-drop.” “Thus,” as Howard says in the
passage which we have already quoted, “the drops of which
a cumulus consists may become larger the longer it is sus
pended, and the electricity stronger from the comparative di
minution of surface.”    It must, however, be understood, that
the larger drops thus formed are not rain-drops in the proper
acceptation of the term,the cumulus never affording rain unless
a disturbance of its electrical state takes place.              -
   Under the circumstances above referred to, the cumulus
and its particles of suspended water are regarded as charged
conductors bearing, not transmitting, the electric force from
one portion of the atmosphere to another. In this as well as
the other processes that have been referred to, rain does not
enter as a product. The remarks, however, of Mr. Howard
on the first formation of rain are so extremely apposite, that
in tracing the electrical action which we are capable of recog
nizing in the atmosphere, I shall freely avail myself of them;
but as the paragraphs are rather long, I must content myself
with a mere reference to the pages in which they occur.
   In pages 149 and 150, vol. i. of the Climate of London,
 Mr. Howard speaks of the first formation of rain in connexion
with a double mode of the formation of cloud; viz. the conden
sation of vapour by refrigeration in the higher regions of the
atmosphere, and the production of cumuloid masses by the
condensation in the lower, of the vapour immediately evapo
rated from the surface of the earth.       In connexion with the
first mode, and in accordance with the former extracts, each
particle of cloud, each minute drop of water thus separated is
positively charged; and by each (thus positively charged)
obeying the law of gravitation, the whole subside to a region
in which they remain suspended, forming in that region a
visible haze. Now I presume, from what Mr. Howard has said
on the formation of cirrus, and his comparison of it to a trans
mitting or imperfect conductor, carrying the electric force from
one portion of the atmosphere to another at a great distance
over the intervening surface of the earth (Introduction, page

                with the Condensation of Vapour.              165
lxvii and lxviii), that the resolution of this haze into the two
diverse modifications (taking these, of course, as types of two
distinct classes of clouds), cirrus and cirrostratus, depends
entirely on the electric state of the circumambient air. If the
equilibrium between the two masses of atmosphere, either su
perposed or on the same level and at a great distance from
each other, is disturbed, the particles of water separated by
condensation immediately partake (as suggested) of the nature
of conductors, and are then drawn out into fine lines or pencils
of condensed vapour, which transmit the electric force from
one portion of the atmosphere to the other, until in some cases
the equilibrium is restored. Thus cirrus is formed. On the
other hand, if there is not such a disturbance of the electric
state of the atmosphere as here contemplated, but the charged
particles of water gradually subside so as ultimately to form,
from the accumulated haze, a thin extended sheet of cloud,
seen through which the heavenly bodies appear with increasing
dimness, the larger luminaries being not unfrequently sur
rounded by well-defined halos, then the cirrostratus is formed.
In the former instance, the production of cirrus, while the
electric force is in process of transmission from one portion of
atmosphere to another, rain is not produced. When the equi
librium is restored, and the fine lines of cirri cease to transmit
the electric force, the small orbicular masses of cirrocumulus
are produced; and it may be that not only each particle may
retain its charge and sustain the character of an insulated
conductor, but the congeries of particles of water forming the
orbicular mass itself may possess such a character; the mass,
as in the case of the cumulus, being an insulated conductor,
 possessing such an amount of electric tension as is necessary
 to preserve its independence among the other orbicular masses
 forming the entire cloud; each orbicular mass being consi
 dered as a component part thereof, just as each particle of
 water is a component part of a cumulus. According as these
 congeries of clouds may exist in dry or moist air, so evapora
 tion or condensation may take place on their surfaces. . In
 dry air they would gradually disappear; in moist air they
 would not only augment in size, but their electric tension might
 be so modified as to produce electric attraction, by which they
 might pass into the modification of cirrostratus.
    In the foregoing remarks we have contemplated the passage
 of the condensed vapour in the higher and middle regions of
 the atmosphere, through the successive stages of cirrus and
 cirrocumulus to cirrostratus. Still keeping in mind the
 essential character of cirrus, and viewing its progress without
 a restoration of the equilibrium, we may inquire into the result

166 Mr. W. R. Birt on the connexion of Atmospheric Electricity
produced under such circumstances. In either case, whether
it be a direct formation of cirrostratus from haze, or a second
ary formation of this cloud from cirrus, the more perfect in
sulation of the charged aqueous particles which obtains in the
cases of cumulus and cirrocumulus is not present. In fact
the cirrostratus is a cloud more or less prevalent in a moist
state of the atmosphere; and in contrasting its formation from
cirrus with the formation of cirrocumulus from cirrus, it
would appear that in a drier atmosphere, when cirrus has
ceased to transmit the electric force, cirrocumulus results;
while in a moister atmosphere the cirrus gradually subsides
into cirrostratus. This origin of cirrostratus may be traced
long after the cloud is decidedly formed, by the striated ap
pearance which it presents to the eye when the moon is seen
behind it.    Mr. Howard remarks, that “when the cirrostratus
is prevalent, the lower atmosphere is usually pretty much charged
with dew or haze, and therefore in a state to conduct an elec
tric charge to the earth.”
   From what has preceded, we are enabled to gather, that in
the case which Mr. Howard has suggested in pages 149 and
150, the general state of the atmosphere was sufficiently moist
to favour the production of cirrostratus from the haze resulting
from the subsidence of the particles of water in the higher
regions of the atmosphere. We may now pass on to the
electrical effects consequent on the production of this sheet of
haze, or its resulting sheet of cirrostratus. Mr. Howard re
gards the effect as the production of a negative charge in a
lower stratum of the atmosphere; he says, “As soon as a
sufficiently dense straTUM of these particles is formed, we
have the suPERINDUCING CAUSE at the region m, m, m, by
which the lower air may be rendered NEGATIVE; and the ac
cumulation of such a haze before rain is not a matter of sup
position only, but of long observation.” In immediate con
nexion with this remark of Howard, it may not be inappro
priate to mention, that during my late discussion of the elec
trical observations at Kew, I found that in most of the in
stances in which negative electricity was observed at Kew,
cirrostratus was observed at Greenwich.
   We now turn to the consideration of the production of the
cumuloid masses by the condensation in the lower atmosphere
of the aqueous vapour emitted by the heated earth. In con
nexion with this, Mr. Howard appears to regard three strata
of the atmosphere as contemporaneously existing:—1st. The
region of cirrostratus of course containing much aqueous va
pour in a condensed state, this region possessing (or rather
the cloud suspended in it) a positive charge; 2nd, the region

                with the Condensation of Vapour.               167
immediately below it electrified negatively, the depth of this
stratum depending upon the thickness or density of the bed
of haze above; and 3rd, the lowest stratum possessing the
usual positive charge of the atmosphere. It is in this lower
stratum that Mr. Howard considers the cumuloid masses
to be formed; and while the negative stratum remains sus
pended between the superior and inferior positively electrified
strata, the only result is a simple union of the cumulus below
with the cirrostratus above, forming the compound modifica
tion cumulostratus. During this process no rain falls; the
reason Mr. Howard appears to regard as the absence of a
transmission of the electric force; for he says, “The effect of the
superinducing charge on such cloud may produce either the
CUMULosTRATUS, which appears to be a sIMPLE UNION of
clouds, or the NIMBUS, which is A UNION wiTH TRANSMIssion
of electricity.” And it further appears from Mr. Howard’s
remarks, that while a stratum positively charged is interposed
between the earth and the negative stratum, rain is not pro
duced; but the moment the negative stratum reaches the earth,
and the cumuloid masses are enveloped and lose their positive
charge in it, “they then attract and are attracted by the po
sitive haze (query cirrostratus) above, and the first drops of
rain are [thus] formed,” the cloud produced being a nimbus.
“This rain opens an immediate communication with the earth;
the positive electricity, which before rendered the particles
buoyant, STREAMs Down ALONG witH THE RAIN AND THRouGH
IT; and the shower is propagated in all directions till the whole
mass of cloud is brought into action.” It is worthy of remark,
that generally before a shower an atmospherical conductor
indicates the presence of negative electricity.
   Mr. Howard appears to view the mode in which rain con
ducts electricity to the earth under two aspects:—1st. “The
individual drops may receive an intense charge at the moment
of their formation and during their fall through the cloud,
which charge they bring to the ground.” Throughout the
whole of Mr. Howard’s reasoning, the great increase of ten
sion consequent on the increase in the size of the drops from the
agglomeration of the minute particles of water separated by
condensation is very prominent. Under ordinary circum
stances the intense charge of each drop is brought to the
ground; but if the quantity of electricity is increased in a
greater proportion than the surface of each drop over which
it is spread, then in the very act of descending to the earth
the tension may be so far increased that the electric force
may separate from each drop, to seek either the surface of the
cloud or of the newly-formed descending body of rain, and

168 Mr.W. R. Birt on the connexion of Atmospheric Electricity
an electric discharge may take place. 2nd. Mr. Howard also
regards the descending body of rain as a conducting medium:
he says, “the whole aggregate of floating, uniting, and falling
drops from the very summit of the cloud to the ground, may
form one immense conductor.”         He further remarks: “On
the supposition that a sudden local shower is AN ATMosPHE
RICAL CONDUCTOR WITH ITS FOOT ON THE EARTH, we are
able to assign a satisfactory origin and use to the spreading
crown, which is frequently seen above it, and in which we
 may discern an arrangement, tending from every side towards
 the dense part where the rain is formed, in a manner not re
quired by the simple law of gravity. These rectilinear or
hairy portions are the collecting points of the conductor formed
in the positive haze in consequence of the destruction of the
equilibrium [of its charge], which necessarily gives rise to a
flow of the electricity towards the conductor.”
   Upon reviewing the successive steps in the development of
 cloud and rain, from the first formation of the minute water
particle with its feeble electric charge, to the torrent-pouring
nimbus with its violent electric discharge, we have particularly
to trace the formation of this cloud in a portion of atmosphere
bounded above by a sheet of cirrostratus positively electrified,
which rests on a stratum of air negatively electrified, this ne
gative state being induced by the action of the positive cirro
stratus, which at this time is highly charged and ready to pre
cipitate, the clouds below being negatively electrified by in
duction.    The atmospheric conductors are also at this time
negatively electrified, in common with other bodies on or near
the earth. This (according to Howard’s remarks) appears to
be the moment when the nimbus is formed; the disturbance,
which had been produced very gradually, now makes itself di
stinctly felt; the masses of cumulus, originally positive, by the
superior energy of the cirrostratus, are more or less thrown
into a negative state; electrical attraction between the cirro
stratus and cumulus rapidly takes place, and is accompanied
by the agglomeration of the minute particles of water forming
the clouds; rain immediately descends, which, if the electric
tension either of the cloud or of the descending rain-drops is
not too intense, becomes a conducting medium, and opens an
electrical communication with the earth; but if the charge of
the cloud, on the other hand, becomes so high as to result in
a violent detonation, either before or coincident with the for
mation of rain, or the rain-drops themselves are incapable of
retaining the charge received by them at the time of their for
mation, then we have with the nimbus all the phaenomena of
a thunder-shower.

                 with the Condensation of Vapour.                 169
   Mr. Howard, in his remarks on the formation of nimbus
(Introduction, page lxxi), a cloud very closely allied to the
cumulostratus, expresses himself in almost the precise words
of the Committee of the Royal Society”. “The cirri, also,
which so frequently stretch from the superior sheet upwards
and resemble erected hairs, carry so much the appearance of
temporary conductors of the electricity extricated by the sudden
union of its minute drops into the vastly larger ones that form
the rain, that one is in a manner compelled, when viewing the
phaenomenon, to indulge a little in electrical speculation.” The
sudden agglomeration alluded to by the Committee is here
unmistakeable; and it would appear from the course of rea
soning developed in the preceding extracts, that the greater
manifestation of the electrical attraction—noticed under the
head of “formation of cumulus”—consequent upon the coa
lescence or union of the cumulus with the cirrostratus, which
is generally crowned with cirrus, is most probably—especially
when combined with the pressure, in the lower part of the
cloud, of the rising; and the deposition on its upper surface
of the descending vapour—the occasion of the disturbance of
the electrical state of the cumulus by which the rain is pro
duced. We have, in fact, the entire process beautifully pre
sented to our notice, commencing with the incipient separa
tion of the earliest drops of water by the agency of a dimi
nished temperature from the vapour rising above the vapour
plane, which drops are feebly electrified and more or less per
fectly insulated; the process terminating with the sudden ag
glomeration of these minute and feebly electrified drops into
the vastly larger ones that form rain, by which the electric
tension may be, and doubtless is, so enormously increased,
that the electric state of the cloud and of bodies in its imme
diate neighbourhood are extensively disturbed; so that if the
superabundant electricity should not be carried off by the
conducting or rather transmitting crown of cirri, as suggested
 by Howard, the exhibition of electrical phaenomena, as thunder
 and lightning, the stroke being given either by the cloud or
 the rain, generally follows. The intermediate steps appear to
 be governed by the “two grand predisposing causes—a falling
 temperature and the influx of vapour.” Should these not be
 sufficient in their extent, either above or below, to produce a
formation of cirrus or an increase of cumulus, the individuals
 of the latter modification gradually evaporate as evening ap
 proaches, and generally give place to a serene and tranquil
 night; but if both these classes of cloud form rapidly, cirro
 stratus generally shows itself, electrical action is called more

170        Mr. W. R. Birt on Atmospheric Electricity.
energetically into play, and upon the formation of cumulo
stratus and nimbus, the rain is produced in the manner above
indicated.
   Throughout the whole of the preceding remarks there is
one point presented to our notice with peculiar prominence,
viz. the development of the electric force in the act, more or
less, of the condensation of vapour. The entire process of
nubification appears to be intimately connected with this de
velopment, and the different modifications of clouds entirely
dependent on the presence or absence of a disturbed electrical
state, not only when the condensation is effected, but when
no previous disturbed state exists it may actually be brought
about by the condensation of vapour. It may not be too
much to say, that the electricity observed in the atmosphere
is principally due to, and the product of condensed vapour.
We would of course not regard the condensation of vapour
(if the preceding conjectures be correct) as the only source of
atmospheric electricity; but we are inclined to regard it as by
far the most productive; and it now only remains to connect
the foregoing conjectures and reasoning with such experiments
as may be calculated to throw some light on the production
of the electric force by condensation.
   Mr. Reuben Phillips has lately detailed in the Philosophical
 Magazine some very interesting experiments on the electricity
of condensation. In one experiment a jet of water was passed
through a jet of steam in such a way that the electricity of
the water should not affect that of the steam, the water only
falling on the wire-gauze of the collector; a negative charge
was obtained until the force became sufficiently strong to
effect a change in the kind of electricity; in other words, the
jet of water exhibited precisely the same effect as the steam
alone. Mr. Phillips attributes this to the drops of water col
lecting negative electricity from the steam: he says, “The
negative charge given to the screen was I think only produced
by the drops of water collecting negative electricity from the
steam, much in the same way as the wire-gauze did *.”
   We here see the drops of water regarded in the light of
insulated (?) conductors projected into the midst of condensed
vapour. Each particle of this vapour is electrified negatively;
and as the particles of water either come in contact with or
sufficiently near to receive the charge of the particles of va
pour, the charge passes to the water-drops, and through the
medium of the screen affects the electrometer.             It would be
very interesting to know, if with a given pressure of steam,
such, for instance, as would produce the greatest negative
            * Page 106 of the present volume of this Journal.

Prof. P. Tardy on a New Equation in Hydrodynamics.           171
tension, the passage of a jet of water properly guarded so as
to give no electrical indications would increase the tension; in
other words, would the condensation or running together of
the vapour particles cause an increase of tension in the way
suggested by the Committee of Physics of the Royal Society?
   Mr. Phillips's experiment, that bears more particularly on
the point in question, is the mixture of steam and water in a
tin pipe. When the steam was introduced alone, no electrical
effects were exhibited; and when the water was introduced
alone, there were also no electrical effects; but when they
were mixed, a positive charge was indicated by the electro
meter.    The experiment was thus varied: on one occasion
the steam was first introduced; and upon the jet of water
being projected among the particles of steam, the mixture
was electrified positively: on the other occasion the water was
first introduced; and upon the jet of steam being projected
into the tin pipe, the mixture was also electrified positively.
These two experiments appear to me to be conclusive on the
subject of the development of the electric force by condensa
tion alone, and become a link in the chain of evidence by
which nearly all the varied, beautiful, grand and terrific phae
nomena of the atmosphere are bound together. This one
simple but efficient mode of the development of the electric
force appears to be fully capable of accounting, if not for the
whole, for the greater portion of the phaenomena of atmo
spheric electricity.

 XXIII. Some Observations on a New Equation in Hydrody
         namics. By Professor P. TARDY of Messina%.
 I HAVE lately seen an article by Professor Challis in the
       Number of the Philosophical Magazine for last June
(Supplement), “On certain points relating to the Theory of
 Fluid Motion,” in which, in reply to a communication of M.
 Bertrand to the French Academy of Sciences, he returns to
 his favourite argument for the truth and necessity of a new
 equation in hydrodynamics. At the same time he does me
 the honour of mentioning my name, and answering an objec
 tion which I made to his analysis for the case of the motion in
 space of two dimensions.
    I must premise that when I wrote my memoir on the move
 ment of fluids (Sopra alcuni Punti della Teoria del Moto de'
 Liquidi, Firenze 1847), Ihad no knowledge of Professor Challis's
                  * Communicated by the Author.

172            Prof. P. Tardy's Observations on a
original papers inserted in the Cambridge Philosophical
Transactions and in the Philosophical Magazine, and was
only aware of a brief extract of some of his results given in
Webster's Theory of Fluids. I have subsequently endea
voured to peruse the many hydrodynamical memoirs of Pro
fessor Challis, and I am obliged to confess that I have found
nothing in them that could      £ my first opinion,
me dissent from M. Bertrand’s assertions.

                                                     I wish for the
moment merely to offer some remarks on the new equation
alleged to be necessary.
   The learned Professor having established by elementary
considerations the equation

a, y, z, ds the differential of the arc of the line of motion, and
r and r" the principal radii of curvature at the same point of
the surface normal to the directions of motion, has repeatedly
asserted that this equation could not be derived from the two
known equations

 (according to the notation employed by him), and that therefore
another general equation was requisite, from the combination
of which with equation (2.) equation (1.) may result. This is
the only argument I have been able to find in the writings of
Professor Challis for the necessity of a third equation, and
he even confesses that he knows no other use for it but that of
deducing equation (1.). (Phil. Mag., vol. xxxiii. No. 223.)
   Now to investigate this, he assumes that there always will
             l
be a factor; capable of rendering integrable the expression
                                     •     -                       -

which is the new equation he contends for.
    In his reply, Professor Challis, contradicting his former
assertions, states, without further explanation, that the use of
equation (7.), which he had already employed, is not abso
lutely necessary for arriving at the equation (1.). Thus falls to
the ground his chief argument for the necessity of a new
general equation. And in fact it is easy to convince oneself
that the equation (1.) is only an analytical transformation of
 (2.). From equation (4.) we have

after which the passage from (2.) to (1.) presents no difficulty.
Having thus shown that the equation (6.) or (7.) is not neces
sary, it remains to be examined whether it is true.
   Nor can Professor Challis say that, having employed the
equation (7.) in combination with that of continuity, and having
thus arrived at a true consequence, viz. at the equation (1.),
the truth of (7.) is in this manner established; because on
examining his calculation, it is easy to perceive that a com
pensation of errors has taken place; and, indeed, as A is a
quantity that disappears from the final result, it was indifferent
to have substituted a false value of it.        This will more di
stinctly appear if we take the expression

     &c. X” &c. ..., because all the terms which contain A and

its differential coefficients evidently destroy each other.
   I shall begin by observing that Professor Challis ought to
have shown that the equation
         dv     dw         dw – du         du      dv
      “\d: " Ay ) +(#            #) +*(# #)              =0
is always satisfied in order that udw--vdy+wdz should become
integrable by a factor. Moreover in his last communication
he explains what the equation (6.) means; but he does not
assign any new and valid reason for the passage from (5.)
to (6.). We were already well-acquainted with that signifi
cation; but we desired to know how he could show that the
particles of the fluid which are on the surface \, =0 must re
main on it during successive instants. Nay, if the motion is
steady, and we add only an absolute constant in the integration
of (4.), and therefore take   #=0,     is it not evidently absurd
to affirm that the particles of the fluid move along the surface
to which the directions of their motion were normal?             In
general it is known that, in order that the particles of the fluid
may always remain on a surface p(x, y, z, t) =0, it is neces

 sary that the time should disappear from this equation when
 ever for the coordinates ar, y, z are substituted their expres
 sions formed with the initial values a, b, c, and the time t, as
 Lagrange first noticed. Now as y is supposed to contain an
 arbitrary function of t, it is clear that this cannot be the case.
 Besides, if the equation (7.) be exact, as we can augment the
 partial differential coefficient  #   by an arbitrary function of the
 time x(t), it would follow that

 to be homogeneous and incompressible, and of a density p=1,

 The two equations (2.) and (3.) are both satisfied, and the
latter gives

   I have anxiously searched in the memoirs of Professor
 Challis for an instance of applying the new equation, and I

 found the following example. If

Jore verified.  I can scarcely conceive how such an illogical
 process has escaped the sagacity of the learned Professor.
 And indeed what does Professor Challis do but take the value
 of x from the equation (7.),

XXIV. On the Deportment of Crystalline Bodies between the
  poles of a Magnet. By JoHN TYNDALL and HERMANN
   KNOBLAUCH*.
Th: results        obtained by Professor Plücker of Bonn, in
       his investigations upon crystals, induced us early in the
month of November last to commence a series of researches
in connexion with this subject. Our inquiries, so far as they
at present reach, form the subject of this paper.
   After a long series of trials, not necessary to be recapitu
lated here, we arrived at the persuasion that no safe inference
could be drawn from experiments made with full crystals. It
appeared necessary to examine the forces attributed to cry
stalline bodies in detail, one at a time, removing as far as pos
sible all influences likely to interfere with the simple action of
this one.                  -
   To attain this object we experimented with cubes: we had
one cut from tourmaline, in such a manner that the optical
axis of the crystal ran parallel to four sides of the cube; on
suspending it between the poles and closing the circuit, the
optical axis set itself strongly equatorial; thus corroborating
the law of Plücker, which affirms that the optical axes of ne
gative crystals are repelled. When, however, the same cube
was hung with the optical axis vertical, the influence of that
axis being thus destroyed, a preference was shown to one of
the diagonals of the horizontal face of the cube, not to be ex
plained by the law mentioned; this preference was more stri
kingly exhibited in the case of the following two crystals.
   A cube of beryl, cut similarly to the tourmaline, being hung
with its optical axis vertical, one diagonal of its horizontal face
set itself axial; only one diagonal could maintain this position,
the other was repelled. In dichroite this phaenomenon was
very strikingly exhibited; when hung with the middle line of
the optical axes vertical, one diagonal assumed the axial posi
tion; if, however, the circuit was closed when the other dia
gonal chanced to lie from pole to pole, the latter seemed to
experience a repulsive shock, sufficient to make the cube spin
several times round upon its axis.
                   * Communicated by the Authors.

      of Crystalline Bodies between the poles of a Magnet, 179
   We do not see any possibility of referring this election of a
particular diagonal to the influence exerted by the optical axis,
at least in the case of beryl.
   To ascertain the exact nature of this influence, we had re
course to discs, cut so that the optical axis of the crystal lay
as a diameter in the plane of each. In this way the influence
of mere form was totally annulled, and the pure action of the
optical axis, if such existed, might be observed.
   Our first discs, five in number, were taken from a semi
transparent crystal of Iceland spar, and lay at various angles
to the sides thereof.     In all these cases the law of Plücker
was strictly verified, the optical axis being always repelled.
   Four discs and one square were next taken from two trans
parent crystals of the spar, and suspended successively between
the poles. We were by no means prepared for the reply
given to these experiments; in each of the five cases the optical
axis set itself distinctly axial.
   The balance sheet of our inquiries up to the present time is
this: out of eleven crystals of Iceland spar examined as above,
five have obeyed the law of Plücker, while six have contra
dicted that law.
   In determining whether the optical axis will be repelled or
not, it is not necessary to cut the crystals in the manner de
scribed. A thin rhomb cloven from the crystal and ground
into the shape of a disc, will decide the question. If it belong
to the class whose optical axis is repelled, the line bisecting
the acute angles of the rhomb will set itself axial; if to the
other class, the same line will set itself equatorial.
   Discs thus prepared form undoubtedly the purest means of
investigating this question. The rhomb itself, however, with
out being ground into a disc, affords us sufficient intelligence
as to the class of the crystal to which it belongs. Is its optical
axis repelled, then the long diagonal of the rhomb will incline
to the axial position; is the optical axis attracted, the long
diagonal will stand nearly equatorial.
     he same adherence of the diagonal to the axial or equa
torial position continues after a thin bar containing the dia
gonal has been severed from the rhomb. For example, a
bar containing the short diagonal of that class whose optical
axis is attracted, will stand nearly axial. This fact is perhaps
worthy of notice: if Iceland spar be diamagnetic, as Prof.
Plücker asserts, and if the optical axis be repelled, what is it
that overcomes the united action of both in the case of this
diagonal? The projection of the optical axis lies in the same
direction as the bar; both therefore work together, and both
strive, in virtue of the two properties mentioned, to attain the
                                  N 2

 180 Messrs. J. Tyndall and H. Knoblauch on the Deportment
 equatorial position: they do not attain it, however; the bar
 stands almost axial.
     The question, “Is the substance magnetic or diamagnetic?”
 necessarily lay at the threshold of all attempts to explain these
   haenomena. To answer this question by experimenting with
 the full crystal was impossible, as a diamagnetic crystal, it is
 well known, can set itself axially. This being evidently owing
 to some hidden property of the crystalline structure, we
 thought it might be destroyed by reducing the mass to powder.
 Portions of crystals of each class were finely pounded in an
 agate mortar; by the addition of a little distilled water the
 powder was made into a paste, from which small bars were
 constructed and carefully dried. On being hung between the
 excited poles, those whose optical axes were repelled stood
 equatorial, the others axial.
    Adopting the plan already followed by Faraday, we next
 brought the two classes of crystals to the test of a single pole.
 At first, little bits of crystal were attached to the cocoon
 thread by means of a soft sticky kind of wax; the presence of
 this, however, was found to interfere with the purity of the
 experiment, and it was therefore abandoned; fine silver wire
 was next tried and also found ineligible; we next hung a straw
 horizontally, into each end of which a bit of crystal was thrust;
 but the straw was diamagnetic, and permitted no safe conclu
 sion. Common white taper-wax was at length found exactly
 suited to our purpose; it must, however, be handled with
 clean fingers, and even thus very little; after two or three
suspensions it invariably showed signs of magnetism. We
chose long thin bars of crystal and hung them vertically, thus
bringing the wax so far above the poles, that, on examination,
it showed not the slightest trace of magnetism or diamag
netism. A former remark explains why this vertical hanging
is to be preferred to horizontal; in the latter case, a rotation
towards the pole, easily mistaken for an attraction, and diffi
cult to distinguish from it, might occur with a diamagnetic
body; hung vertically, however, it could be distinctly seen
whether the mass of the crystal was attracted or repelled.
The results here delivered were in harmony with those already
mentioned: those whose optical axes were attracted, were
attracted; those whose optical axes were repelled, were re
pelled.
    Anxious to investigate this difference of action to the bot
toin, we chose two perfectly pure and transparent crystals
from each class, and submitted them to chemical analysis.
An experienced mineralogist was unable to detect the slightest
visible difference between these crystals; the analysis, how

      of Crystalline Bodies between the poles of a Magnet. 181
ever, showed that those whose optical axes were attracted
contained protoxide of iron in considerable quantity, while
those whose optical axes were repelled contained no trace of
this metal.
    Here, then, we have two crystals perfectly alike in optical
respects, but chemically different; the change in the position
of the optical axis between the poles being doubtless due to
this difference. This seems to reduce that position to a mere
function, so to speak, of the chemical nature of the substance.
Could a salt of iron be introduced as an isomorphic substitute
for some other constituent in the whole class of diamagnetic
crystals, it is exceedingly probable that the position of the
optical axis between the poles would in most of these cases be
reversed, and this without in the slightest degree interfering
with the optical properties of the crystal. It is even likely
that Nature, as in the case before us, furnishes many examples
of this isomorphic substitution. If this be true, then the po
sition of the optical axis between the poles is a mere accident,
and the introduction of it can only serve to render this already
difficult subject unnecessarily complex.
    On bringing a circular disc of gutta percha, which, in its
manufacture, appeared to have a fibrous structure imparted to
it, between the excited poles, the direction of these fibres set
itself strongly axial. This action was so decided, that a par
allelogram, three-quarters of an inch long and half as wide,
with the fibres crossing it transversely, set itself stiffly equa
torial. This can by no means be referred to the distance of
the parallelogram from the poles, or to any other of those
circumstances by which diamagnetic action is said to be ex
hibited; our voltaic power varied from one to twenty cells of
Bunsen's battery, but the result remained specifically constant;
further, on being hung edgeways, the parallelogram stood
strongly magnetic; and when one pole was removed, the
whole mass was attracted by the other.
    Whence, then, this apparent diamagnetism of the gutta
percha? The answer to this question will perhaps throw a
light upon the complicated phaenomena exhibited by crystals
generally. The equatorial position of the gutta percha is
manifestly due to the comparative facility with which the mag
netic force can act in the direction of the fibre.    Let us sup
pose the parallelogram suspended, and the circuit closed;
every point of its substance is now affected, but not with equal
 force in all directions; in the direction of the fibre the action
is strongest, and may be represented by the longer diameter
of an egg, in the centre of which the point may be imagined.
All lines drawn from this centre to the shell will represent the

182          On the Deportment of Crystalline Bodies.
amount of the magnetic force in their various directions. On
this assumption the equatorial position is readily explained;
and the necessity of the parallelogram, when hung edgeways,
to set itself axial, is also manifest.
   As may be expected, when the parallelogram is made very
long in comparison to its width, the long diameter of our hy
pothetical egg is overpowered by the united action of a number
of short ones, and the oblong stands axial.
   We have succeeded in obtaining analogous results with
ivory, which, though diamagnetic, can be so cut that it stands
almost axial. The anomaly is explained by reference to the
 structure of the tooth, which modifies, in certain directions,
 the diamagnetic power. By attending to these circumstances,
 we have been able, with these two substances, gutta percha
 and ivory, to imitate almost all the experiments which we have
 made with both classes of crystals.
    If we suppose the shorter diameter of an ellipse to coincide
 with the straight line formed by the intersection of any two
 surfaces of cleavage, and the ellipse to rotate around this dia
meter, an oblate spheroid will be the result. Conceive lines
drawn through the centre of this figure and terminated by the
 surface, to represent the amount of magnetic or diamagnetic
 force in the direction of these lines, and we have an hypothesis
 of magnetic or diamagnetic action within the crystal, sufficient,
 not only to account for every fact noticed in this paper, but
 for numerous others, the discussion of which we refer to a
 future occasion.
    Extending this principle to the intersections of the three
 surfaces of cleavage, we obtain a resultant which falls in the
 direction of the principal axis of the crystal, or of the optical
 axis. The position of that resultant between the poles will
 depend solely upon the magnetism or diamagnetism of the
 crystal, and in nowise upon the fact of its being negative or
 positive, as asserted by Professor Plücker.
    It is highly improbable that our representative spheroid
 will be of a constant shape in all crystals: in the case of gutta
 percha we assumed it formed by the rotation of a     £
 round its longer axis, or what is commonly called prolate; in
 the case of Iceland spar it is oblate; in common iron it would
 be a sphere, as here the magnetic force appears to act equally
 in all directions. Every crystal will doubtless modify it in a
 manner peculiar to its own substance and structure. Future
 experiments will perhaps enable us, in many cases, to deter
 mine the numerical values of the long and short diameters of
 these spheroids.
    From these considerations it would follow, that M. Plücker,

       On a Method for computing Magnetic Declination.        183
in attempting to refer the facts observed by Mr. Faraday' to
the optical axis, inverts the right course of proceeding; the
attraction or repulsion of this axis being a secondary result,
depending first of all upon the magnetism or diamagnetism
of the substance, and secondly upon the manner in which
either force is modified by the peculiar structure of the crystal.
    The conducting power, so to speak, of Iceland spar for
both magnetism and diamagnetism appears to be in directions
perpendicular to the lines of cleavage. If these views be cor
rect, the optical axis can no longer be regarded as the prime
agent in the production of the phaenomena which we have
been considering; we shall no longer seek the explanation of
new facts in the hypotheses of new forces, but rather in modi
fications of the old.

XXV. Further Illustrations of a Method for computing Mag
   netic Declination, on the principle proposed by Professor
   Gauss. By SAMUEL BEswickf.
IN     my former communication I gave two illustrations of a
     new method whereby the mean declinations at Greenwich
and St. Helena, for the past year 1849, were computed with
the utmost exactitude. But the utility of this new method
consists, not only in its simplicity and precision, but also in
its applicability to all places in the two hemispheres, and to
all epochs, past, present, and to come. To obtain the decli
nation all over the world, at an epoch so distant as the time
of Columbus (see the first illustration), or of one hundred, or
even one thousand years in the future, there needs no addi
tional data, nor any alteration in the method: there are only
the same number of items: and the result is obtained equally
easy, and in the same time, as if the declination was being
obtained for the present year.       Time and place make no dif
ference in the length or nature of the computation.
   If, therefore, this paper be favoured with the attention of
the Committee appointed to conduct the co-operation of the
British Association in the system of Simultaneous Magnetical
and Meteorological Observations, I trust they will kindly notice,
not only the above observations, but also the following ad
vantageous characteristic of this new method over all others,
viz. to compute the declination all over the world, for any
epoch, however remote the time may be, not a single observa

184      Mr. S. Beswick's further Illustrations of a Method
tion of any kind is required. The two accompanying illustra
tions are intended as proof of its advantageous superiority in
this particular. Colonel Sabine has kindly reminded me of
the grand desideratum in this department of science, for the
accomplishment of which enormous labours have been under
taken, and considerable sums of money annually expended,
that “the chief difficulty in any empirical formula would be
to adapt it to different epochs.” I have thought it necessary,
in consequence of this remindal,—and with a view to the com
plete exposition of the method I propose, and to the clear
understanding of the important practical advantages it offers
over all others,—to present a few general explanatory remarks,
accompanied with two distinct proofs of its application to dif
ferent epochs. Which proofs are intended to show, that this
“chief difficulty’ is completely removed; indeed so completely,
that not a single item would be added to the process, nor even
altered in its form, whether the epoch was three years in the
past, or three hundred years in the future.
    I am desirous of recording a matter of considerable import
ance in this paper, to which I solicit the kind attention of
the gentlemen forming the Committee for Simultaneous Mag
netical and Meteorological Observations referred to above.
The obvious failure of all previous methods, after the interval
of a few years, mainly results from a quarter which, up to the
present time, is not even suspected. It is this—the southern
magnetic point of convergence of the horizontal force, or pole,
does not revolve from east to west, as hitherto supposed; on the
contrary, both poles move in the same direction from west to
east.    Hence, if the numerical coefficients of Prof. Gauss’s
general theory be reconstructed—the necessity of which is
suggested by Colonel Sabine",—it can never become available
for practical purposes, except for the time being, in conse
quence of this fundamental error. Every formula should be
 required to prove its utility by its application to successive
epochs of 50 or 100 years interval for 300 years past, before
 it be relied on in its applications to the future. Should this
test be admitted, then my investigations into this matter enable
 me to state, that the general formula of Gauss, and of all
 others which suppose a revolution of the southern magnetic
pole from E. to W., will prove, during the test, an entire
failure. I would respectfully suggest to the Committee of
 Observation, that every method be required to fulfill the de
 mands of this test.
    We will now try the merits of our own method by this rule;
 and, in so doing, we wish to be followed by all others pro

posing to compute magnetic declination. The epochs selected
are the years 1492 and 1722 : the first is 357 years in the
past, and the latter 127 years. The epoch of 1492 refers to
the celebrated discovery of the magnetic line of no declination,
during the first voyage of Columbus; and the epoch of 1722
refers to Graham’s excellent observations on the declination
of the needle at London. The epochs are as memorable as
any in the history of terrestrial magnetism, and are as widely
distant from each other, and from the present, as any which
can be selected for the trial we propose.
   In the first place, we will state the data on which we ground
the adaptation of our method to different epochs. The data
simply consist in discovering the annual velocity of the north
and south magnetic poles; for when this is obtained, their situa
tion at any given epoch is easily found, by multiplying the
annual velocity of each by the number of years intervening
between the epoch and a given year (1849), when their rela
tive situation is known. After a long and almost hopeless
investigation, I have ascertained the velocity in longitude of
the north magnetic pole to be double that of the magnetic
pole in the southern hemisphere, and that both have had a
diminishing velocity, with occasional exceptions*, since the
epoch of 1492. The rule for computing the velocity and
situation of the two poles is as follows:—Commencing with the
year 1460, multiply the whole interval between that year and
1849 (389 years) by seventeen minutes; and for every success
ive diminution of 60 years in that interval, lessen the multi
plying number one minute, as in the following table. The
fixed epoch by which the interval is determined is the past
year 1849.

   This table is only for the north magnetic pole; in all       cases
the multiplying number for the south magnetic pole              must
be one-half the multiplying number for the opposite             pole.
The mean positions of the two magnetic poles for the            fixed
epoch 1849, are as follows:

North Pole of the Earth, read at the Nineteenth Annual Meeting of the

        North magnetic pole, lat. 70° 0': west long. 91° 0'.
        South magnetic pole, lat. 75° 5': east long. 155° 0'.
     In taking the epoch of 1492, we shall have an interval of
  357 years, which, multiplied by the rate of revolution in lon
  gitude of each magnetic pole for that epoch, namely, 16#
  minutes annually for the northern, and 8} minutes annually
  for the southern, will give 98° 10' for the former, and 49° 5'
  for the latter: hence, if the magnetic poles be removed back
  wards in west longitude by so much as the amounts stated
 above, we shall then have their relative positions for the year
  1492 as follows:–
  1849, N. M. pole, W.long.91° 0' : S.M. pole, E. long. 155° 0'
                                98° 10'                       49°   5'
  1492, N.M.pole, W.long. 189° 10' : S.M.pole, E. long. 105° 55
     This preliminary is all which is necessary for the adaptation
  of our method to any given epoch, past or to come. In the
 present case it is applied to one of the most memorable in
  nautical astronomy—the discovery of the line without mag
 netic variation. The merit of this discovery belongs to Chris
 topher Columbus, who crossed it whilst on his celebrated first
  voyage for the discovery of a western route to the Indies. We
  think it would be advisable for the Committee of Magnetical
  Observation to make this epoch the test of all methods pro
 posing to compute magnetic declination; for the question
 naturally presents itself—how shall we best prove a method
 but by its application to the recorded observations of the past;
 and what observation is more memorable than the one here
 proposed? This eminent navigator has recorded the position
 of this line in the year of his first voyage, September 25, 1492,
 in the following words:—
    “23° west of the island of Corvo, the magnetic variation
 changed and passed from N.E. to N.W.”
     We propose to test our method by trying whether it will
Jind this line in the same spot at the time stated. An explana
 tion of the process having been fully stated in the former
 article, it is useless to give a repetition in the present instance.
 It will be observed, however, that corresponding items with
 those previously given are here arranged under corresponding
numbers.

which is the mean west declination on the Atlantic for the
year 1492. It may be objected—Columbus affirms there was
no declination, whilst your method gives 3 minutes. Suppose
we grant this, it is only an error of 3 minutes in 357 years, or
# a second annually; an amount so small, that in ordinary
practice even the whole would be scarcely noticed. But,
reader, this error does not exist.     These three minutes show
the mean declination for the whole year; in other words, it
is the declination for about the middle of the year—say June:
and as the diminution was then going on at the rate of sixteen
and a half minutes per year, the three minutes would just have
vanished at the close of the month of September. Accordingly
Columbus discovered the line when passing this spot on the
25th of September. Hence there is not even a second of dif
ference between the observation and our calculation, though
it involves so great an interval as 357 years. The next illus
tration is for the epoch of 1722, involving an interval of 127
years. In this instance we shall not go through the whole
computation, but merely state the result as given in item 13.

 AT the close of my last paper on the Theory of the Tides,
        I expressed an intention of examining the terms of the
second order, considering that there might be some among
them which might produce a sensible effect. This I have now
done, but do not find any so large as I had anticipated; still
they may be sufficiently     £     to have a sensible effect on the
largest of the variable terms in the coefficients, and ought
therefore to be noticed.

the terms depending on u, v2, ui, vi may be negative portions
of the displacements.
   We now proceed to find the terms depending upon the
argument 2(?–62), and first as they result from ui, vi.

the tide at any place whatever, we must conclude that a, is
very much less than this quantity, and therefore that the above
terms, including a”, in their coefficients, may be neglected.
   In finding the terms which result from combining us, v,
with uo, vo, we must observe that the terms of a and T do not
contain ar, and that we must not employ the differentials of
these quantities relative to the time; thus we shall easily find

    XXVII. On the Nitroprussides, a New Class of Salts.
            By Dr. LYoN PLAYFAIR, F.R.S., F.C.S.*
"IN an inquiry into the constitution of the prussides, I found
        it necessary to examine into the somewhat anomalous
action of nitric acid on the yellow prusside of potassium. This
examination has led to the discovery of a singular class of
compounds, which form the subject of the present memoir.
   The previous knowledge on the action of nitric acid on the
prussides may be summed up very briefly. Thomson* ex
amined the gases produced during the action, and recognized

them to be nitrogen, cyanogen, nitric oxide, and carbonic acid,
while the residue was believed to consist of pernitrate of iron
and nitrate of potash. Döbereiner" remarked that previous
to the complete decomposition of the prussides, a strong coffee
coloured liquid was produced, which, after neutralization, pre
cipitated protosalts of iron of a dark blue colour. Gmelint,
to whom chemistry was already indebted for important disco
veries in the prussides, observed that the coffee-coloured liquid
noticed by Döbereiner was rendered of a magnificent purple
or blue colour on the addition of an alkaline sulphide. The
same fact was noted by Mr. Mercert of Oakenshaw, without
his being aware that it had already been remarked by Gmelin.
Campbell $, in repeating Gmelin's experiment, threw out the
intelligent suggestion that the purple colour might be due to
the production of a sulphuret of nitrogen, which Gregory |
had already remarked produced an amethystine colour when
mixed with an alcoholic solution of potash. Smee", in an
examination of the action of nitric acid on the prussides,
observes that ferridcyanide is produced, nitric oxide being
evolved.
    I am not aware of any further knowledge on this subject;
and as it is far from being sufficiently extended, a new exami
nation was desirable.
    2. When dissolved ferrocyanide of potassium is digested
with diluted nitric acid, a coffee-coloured liquid is produced,
 having the characters ascribed to it by Döbereiner and Gmelin.
 The addition of this acid solution to sulphide of potassium dis
solved in water causes a precipitation of sulphur and the pro
duction of various colours, from a pink to a violet or blue
 shade. When the acid liquid is neutralized with potash, it
 immediately produces the most intense purple coloration with
 a soluble sulphide *. The action of nitric acid on the pounded
 salt is similar, but much more violent than that experienced
 with the solution.      Nitric oxide is at first evolved, but it soon
 ceases if the mixture be kept cool, and it is followed by the
 copious escape of cyanogen gas, accompanied by hydrocyanic
 acid, and a gas of peculiar pungency, apparently hydrated
 cyanic acid; more or less nitrogen and carbonic acid are also

  ** The intensity and beauty of this coloration render the nitroprussides
the most sensible of all tests for the presence of the minutest trace of a
soluble sulphide. The presence of quantities insensible to ordinary tests is
at once strongly exhibited by the use of this colouring agent.

                       a New Class of Salts.                  199
 found in the escaping gases. The dark red solution remain
 ing after the action, deposits, on cooling, abundance of nitrate
 of potash, and, under the most favourable circumstances, about
 5 per cent. of a peculiar white substance, afterwards to be de
 scribed. The red-coloured solution now precipitates proto
salts of iron of a dark blue colour, or if it has been heated for
a short time, or even stood in the cold for some days, of a dark
green, and sometimes of a slate colour. A dark green preci
pitate is also produced on the addition of salts of copper. The
same precipitates are obtained from the neutralized as from
the acid solution. Such were the preliminary observations
made on repeating Döbereiner's experiment.
   One important fact was observed in this preliminary trial,
viz. that nitric oxide disappeared during the action, and in
fact only occurred when the transformation was so violent as
to escape control. This gas was therefore probably one im
portant cause of the change, and it therefore became necessary
to examine its action on the cyanides, as a more simple means
of eliciting its mode of action.
   3. The first obvious experiment was to ascertain whether
cyanide of potassium charged with nitric oxide would produce
prussides exerting the remarkable colouring action on the sul
phides. Nitric oxide is in fact readily absorbed by cyanide
of potassium, the solution becoming red-coloured and depo
siting a black substance resembling paracyanogen. This red
coloured solution did not of itself give any colour when mixed
with a sulphide. It was now converted into a prusside by the
addition of protosulphate of iron. The resulting prusside was
now found to strike a magnificent purple colour with a soluble
sulphide. The same coloration was obtained when a prusside
was made from common cyanide of potassium added to a solu
tion of protosulphate of iron, through which nitric oxide had
been passed. It was obvious from these experiments that
nitric oxide was one of the great causes of the change experi
enced by the prusside.
   4. The action of nitric oxide on the prussides themselves
was now examined.       It was found that nitric oxide could be
passed through a solution of ferrocyanide of potassium with
out producing any sensible change, But when the prusside
was mixed with sufficient acid to take up its alkaline base, it
was now found that nitric oxide was freely absorbed by this
mixture when heated, though not in the cold; and that the
resulting liquid exhibited the strong coloration of sulphides.
Ferrocyanide of lead, or any other ferrocyanide, gave, when
mixed with strong acids, a similar result. It was therefore
obvious that the peculiar compound might be obtained from

200             Dr. Playfair on the Nitroprussides,
pure hydroferrocyanic acid. The latter acid was prepared
from prusside of lead by sulphuretted hydrogen, the excess
of the latter being removed by the addition of a little more
lead salt. The filtered ferrocyanic acid was found to suffer
no change when exposed to the action of nitric oxide in the
 cold; but when the solution was kept in a water-bath and the
gas led through it, a change was observed. This, however,
at first merely consisted in the transformation of ferrocyanic
to ferridcyanic acid,—
      4(Fe Cy^+2H)+NO’=2(Fe Cy^+3H)+2HO+N.
 Until this change was completed not the least coloration
took place on mixing the acid liquid with a sulphide. When,
however, the acid no longer gave prussian blue with perchlo
ride of iron, it began to assume a red colour, continuing to
evolve a gas, and it now exhibited, after neutralization, the
peculiar coloration with sulphides. It now gave a blue pre
cipitate with protosulphate of iron, like ordinary ferridcyanic
acid. This blue precipitate became paler in colour as the gas
continued to stream through the hot solution, until finally the
addition of the iron salt gave a precipitate of a clear salmon
colour. Here then was the acid” of the new compounds, and
its salts were obtained by neutralization with the respective
bases. This process was a great step in the inquiry, because
it enabled the distinctive characters of the nitroprussides to
be determined. At the same time it was not fitted to procure
the salts in sufficiently large quantities for examination. By
showing however what was to be looked for, it enabled a more
complete examination to be made of the products of oxidation
of the prussides by nitric acid, with a view to the separation
of the nitroprussides from the ferridcyanides, with which they
were obviously mixed.
    5. It was observed that the oxidized prusside required a
very small quantity of protosulphate of iron for its complete
precipitation. One double equivalent of ferrocyanide of potas
sium (Fe"Cy"+4K) was oxidized with 3 equivs. of nitric acid
diluted with its own volume of water.           The dark red, almost
black liquid, was diluted with water and treated with a known
quantity of sulphate of iron dissolved in water. Prussian blue
was formed, but it remained in solution, forming a dark blue
soluble fluid, of great beauty and intensity. When the added
sulphate of iron amounted to one equivalent, that is to one
fourth of the potassium originally in the prusside, the prussian
   * On neutralizing this nitroprussic acid with carbonates, the resulting
salts were found to be accompanied by a nitrate, although the nitric oxide
had previously been passed through water in a washing-bottle.

                      a New Class of Salts.                  201
blue became insoluble and was thrown on a filter and washed.
It was obvious from this experiment that there must be a
potassium salt in combination with the prussian blue, because
the quantity of iron salt added was quite insufficient to unite
with the iron and cyanogen of the radical. This idea was
confirmed by finding that 2 equivs. of sulphate of copper were
required to effect the precipitation, which I equiv. of sulphate
of iron had effectually done. To separate the potassium salt
present in the latter case, the precipitated prussian blue, after
being washed with cold water, was mixed with water and
boiled.    The whole was now thrown on a filter, and a solu
tion of a fine ruby-red colour passed through. This solution
£ a salmon-coloured precipitate with a protosalt of iron.
   his precipitate does not readily occur in an acid liquid, and
hence the addition of the iron salt to the original oxidized
solution does not effect a complete precipitation, the filtrate
from it being yellow from dissolved nitroprusside of iron.
There being always some nitroprusside of iron along with the
prussian blue, the simple treatment with hot water does not
wholly oeconomise the products, as it only separates the salt of
potassium. The mixture may therefore be decomposed by
caustic potash, which, added in sufficient quantity, forms per
oxide of iron, and ferrocyanide instead of ferridcyanide,—
    (Fe"Cy^+3K)+KO+2FeO=2(FeCy^+2K)+Fe2O3.
The ferrocyanide may now be separated from the nitroprus
side, either by precipitation by alcohol, or by the addition of
 nitrate of lead. These plans were not however so advantage
 ous as the simple means of separation given above. That
 method was followed for some time until the examination of
 the nitroprussides threw some light on their properties and
 composition; it was then found that a process yielding a much
 larger product of the new compound might be invented. The
 following study was therefore made of the products arising
 from the oxidation of the prussides by nitric acid. The
 knowledge thus obtained led, as was expected, to a very oeco
 nomical and simple means of obtaining the nitroprussides in
 large quantities.
    6. As nitric oxide was one of the most important means of
 producing the conversion of prussides into nitroprussides, it
 was necessary to operate so as to prevent its escape. This
 was done by keeping the mixture of acid and prusside well
 cooled at the first part of the action. Nitric oxide is almost
 always evolved at first, but it soon diminishes to nothing as
 the action proceeds. A copious evolution of gas takes place.
 The escaping gas burns with the characteristic purple flame

202            Dr. Playfair on the Nitroprussides,
of cyanogen. Led through protosulphate of iron, after the
 first violent action has ceased, no blackening is perceived,
 so that nitric oxide has ceased to be evolved.          Led into
 caustic barytes, carbonate of barytes is precipitated, and
the solution is found to contain cyanide of barium and cyanate
of barytes. When the gas is collected over mercury and
potash is thrown into the tube containing it, a portion of gas
 still remains unabsorbed and is easily recognized as nitrogen.
 When the escaping gas is led into water it is dissolved in
considerable quantity, and the water now smells strongly of
cyanogen and of a peculiar pungent gas, which appears to be
hydrated cyanic acid. The gas treated with ammonia deposits
azulmic acid, and the usual products of the transformation of
cyanogen. The following process is found best adapted for
the preparation of the nitroprusside. Nitric acid of commerce
is diluted with its own bulk of water, and the quantity of it
necessary to neutralize 53.3 grs. of carbonate of soda (1 equiv.)
is ascertained by the alkalimeter. This quantity denotes
 l  ' of acid.
      errocyanide of potassium is now reduced to powder and
is placed in a convenient vessel, and for every 422 grs. of the
salt used (that is for 1 equiv. Fe°Cy", 4K+6HO)5 equivs. of
the acid are employed. This quantity of acid is found to
produce an oeconomical result, but it is very remarkable that
one-fifth of the quantity, or 1 equiv., is sufficient to convert a
large portion of the prusside into nitroprusside. This is the
more remarkable, because there are four available equivalents
of potassium, and it was to be expected that nitrate of potash
would be produced. This however is not the case, 1 equiv.
of nitric acid effecting oxidation to a considerable extent on a
double equivalent of yellow prusside. The five equivalents
of acid mentioned above are at once poured on the prusside,
as the cooling effect of the whole reduces the violence of the
action. The mixture assumes a milky appearance, but soon
the salt dissolves with a brownish-red colour like coffee, the
mixture of gases already described being freely evolved.
When the solution is complete, it is found to contain ferrid
cyanide of potassium mixed with a nitroprusside and nitrate
of potash. It is now removed into a bolt-head and digested
in the water-bath. It continues to evolve gas, and after a
time it no longer yields prussian blue with sulphate of iron,
but forms a dark green or a slate-coloured precipitate. The
solution is now removed from the water-bath and is allowed
to cool, during which abundance of nitrate of potash crystal
lizes out, and always more or less of a peculiar white substance.
The dark coffee-coloured mother-liquor is now neutralized

                          a New Class of Salts.                          203
with carbonate of soda or carbonate of potash, according as
salts of sodium or potassium are desired. The neutralized
solution shows the presence of iron existing as a base, for
prussian blue is precipitated on the addition of a prusside.
The neutral solution is now boiled, and it deposits generally
a green precipitate, though occasionally one of a brown co
lour; and the filtrate is found to be of a dark ruby-red, con
taining only nitroprusside of the base employed and a nitrate.
The latter is separated by crystallization in the manner pointed
out under the respective salts. Nitroprusside of sodium, being
most easily prepared, is recommended as the product of the
process here given.
    Some practical difficulties may be mentioned so as to pre
vent disappointment in the preparation. A carbonate of and
not the caustic alkali should be employed in the neutraliza
 tion. When the latter is used, the solution of nitroprusside
 is apt to be mixed with ferrocyanide. When this takes place
an addition of acid serves to remove the impurity, as some of
 the precipitated oxide of iron is dissolved, and forming prus
sian blue with the ferrocyanide, removes it from the solution.
 This impurity may also be removed by the addition of nitrate
of lead, which precipitates the prusside but not the nitroprus
side; or it may be taken away by the gradual addition of sul
phate of iron, which removes the ferrocyanide before precipi
tating the nitroprusside. When the quantity last added pre
cipitates the solution of a salmon colour, the impurity has
been removed *.
    Red prusside (ferridcyanide) of potassium may be used in
 the preparation exactly as described for the yellow prusside.
    7. The following experiments were made in order to ascer
 tain approximatively how much nitroprusside was formed by
 the process now described. 105.5 grs. crystallized ferrocy
 anide of potassium were digested with 13 equiv. of nitric acid.
 After digestion the liquid was neutralized with carbonate of
 soda and boiled, the resulting green precipitate being collected
on a weighed filter. The filtrate was precipitated by a salt
of copper, and the nitroprusside of copper was collected and
weighed.
    It was found by various trials that perfectly uniform results
 could not be obtained, the amount and even the composition
 of the precipitate+ on boiling varying with the conditions of
    * It is perhaps needless to remark, that when the ruby-red solution free
 from prussides has been obtained by any of the processes above described,
 it may be used at once for the precipitation of the insoluble nitroprussides.
    f The composition of the precipitates varies considerably. If on neu
 tralizing the acid solution an excess of alkali be added, the addition of an

204              Dr. Playfair on the Nitroprussides,
the preparation. The two following experiments may be
taken as giving mean results :
    1...105.5 grs, yellow prusside gave 8.275 green precipitate,
yielding on incineration 7.95 grs. peroxide of iron; the filtrate
gave 48.90 grs. nitroprusside of copper.
    II. 105.5 grs. yellow prusside gave 8-32 grs, green precipi
tate, yielding by calculation 6:30 grs. peroxide of iron; the
filtrate gave 46:12 grs. nitroprusside of copper.
    Taking the mean of the two experiments, 105.5 grs., or
one-fourth of the double equivalent of yellow prusside, yield
8.297 grs. green precipitate containing 4.984 grs. iron; the
filtrate yields 47-51 grs. nitroprusside of copper. But before
drawing deductions, it is necessary to know the composition
of the green precipitate. It consists of a mixture of prussian
blue, nitroprusside and peroxide of iron, this mixture not
being constant. However, to take a special case as an
example, -
    22:26 grs., calcined and treated with nitrate of ammonia,
gave 13.62 grs. peroxide of iron, or 42-83 per cent. of metallic
11'OI),
    9:49 grs. burned with oxide of copper gave 4 13 grs. car
bonic acid and 0.96 gr. water; the carbon is therefore 11.87
per cent, the water 10:11.
    35.02 grs. treated by caustic potash, gave, when neutralized
by acetic acid, a red filtrate, from which the ferrocyanide of
potassium was precipitated by alcohol; the filtrate from this
had all the properties of nitroprusside of potassium, and gave
by precipitation with sulphate of copper 13.98 grs. nitroprus
side of copper, equal to 13:24 grs. nitroprusside of iron, or
37.80 per cent.
   The reactions in the preparation of the nitroprusside may
now be approximatively explained.
    By reference to the ascertained composition of the nitro
prussides, it will be seen that the 47-51 grs. of the copper
nitroprusside obtained from the 105.5 grs. of yellow prusside,
are equal to 35-69 grs. anhydrous nitroprussic acid: this
quantity contains 9:66 grs. of iron. Now 14 grs. iron were
present in the yellow prusside used, so that about two-thirds
acid gives a slaty precipitate, which consists mainly of oxide of iron mixed
with prussian blue. Under somewhat similar conditions, I believe, though
on this subject I am not certain, the precipitate on boiling, instead of being
green, is brown, like oxide of iron. On washing and exposure to the air
it becomes green.
   In an experiment where this precipitate came, 105.5 grs. yellow prusside
gave 5-83 grs. of a brown precipitate, and 50.66 grs. of nitroprusside of
copper. In another experiment with a like quantity, 4.755 grs. of the
brown precipitate were obtained.

                        a New Class of Salts.                       205
of the iron have been converted into nitroprussic acid. The
other third is in the green precipitate, which was found to
contain 4'98 iron; if it had been one-third it should have been
4'66; of this quantity 1:19 is as nitroprusside of iron, and
therefore 0.59 as nitroprussic acid. Hence we have out of the
14 grs. iron present in the ferrocyanide 10:25 grs. converted
into nitroprussic acid, or very nearly three-fourths; the re
maining one-fourth is partly as prussian blue and oxide of
iron, and partly as the basic iron in the nitroprusside of iron.
   The quantity of carbon or of cyanogen converted into nitro
prusside has now to be examined. The 47-51, grs. copper
nitroprusside contain 9.93 grs. of carbon, that in the nitro
prusside of iron of the green precipitate would amount to
0-60, hence the carbon converted into nitroprussic acid is
10:53. There were 3 equivs. or 18 grs. of carbon in the yel
low prusside, of which about 1: equiv. has been converted
into nitroprusside; of the remaining 7# grs. carbon or 16.2
grs. cyanogen, about 0.38 gr. carbon or 0.823 gr. cyanogen
remain in the green precipitate as a cyanide, the remainder
escaping as a gas. It is true that the results here given only
form a rude approximation, but they denote sufficiently the
final, though not all the intermediate changes which occur; the
ultimate action may be expressed by the following equation:—
 8(FeCys-H2K)+19(HO, NO”)=16(KO, NO")+(Fe Cy”
      3NO+5H)+FeCy + Fe O*4-2H Cy+9Cy+12HO.
   Thus 8 equivs. ferrocyanide of potassium lose their potash
by 16 equivs. of nitric acid, and the hydroferrocyanic acid
formed is oxidized at the expense of 3 equivs. nitric acid, the
3 equivs. of nitrous oxide thus formed entering into the con
stitution of nitroprussic acid, 12 equivs. of water being formed
by the oxidation. Of the cyanogen, 12 equivs. remain in the
nitroprussic acid, 2 equivs. escape as hydrocyanic acid, 9
equivs. as cyanogen, and 1 equiv. remains united with iron as
a cyanide. This scheme would require 10.04 grs. of the iron
experimented on to be converted into nitroprussic acid, and
direct experiment gave 10.2 grs. We should indeed find
1.8 gr. cyanogen in the cyanide of iron*, whereas only 0.823
gr. cyanogen was found in this state; but when we consider
the small quantity present and the variable nature of prussian
blues, such a discordance is not fatal to the correctness of an
explanation, which is only given as an approximation.
   8. It has already been mentioned that carbonic acid was
  * The empirical formula Fe Cy represents the actual proportion of iron
and cyanogen in certain prussian blues, although the elements are not
arranged according to this simple expression.

2O6             Dr. Playfair on the Nitroprussides,
one of the products evolved as a gas. This acid scarcely
appears at all when the quantity of nitric acid used is only 1
equiv. for every 4 equivs. of potassium in the prusside. On
the contrary, it is a very marked product when 5 equivs. are
employed. Precisely under the same circumstances that the
carbonic acid is least in quantity, does the peculiar white sub
stance, already referred to, augment; and when the carbonic
acid is greatest, as when five equivalents of nitric acid are
used, then scarcely any of the white substance is observed.
The carbonic acid is therefore obviously a product of the
oxidation of the white substance. Five per cent. of the white
substance were obtained when one equivalent of nitric acid
was used to oxidize an amount of yellow prusside containing
4 equivs. of potassium; to ensure this, the largest quantity
obtained by experiment, the action of the acid on the prusside
must be as subdued as possible. The white substance is
found with the nitrate of potash, which has deposited from
the oxidized liquid, and is separated from it by the solution
of the latter in water. The white substance is scarcely at all
soluble in cold water, and therefore may be collected and
purified by repeated solutions in boiling water, in which it is
only very sparingly soluble, and deposits itself, on cooling of
the solution, as a white crystalline precipitate. It may also
be sublimed without change between two watch-glasses. The
following analyses of this white substance show its composition.
Analyses I. II. were made upon a specimen purified by sub
limation; III. IV. upon a specimen purified by solution.

    The carbon is to the nitrogen as 2: 1, or in the same pro
portion as cyanogen. In fact the formula Cy+2HO cor
rectly represents the composition, and the substance may be
supposed to be formed by the union of cyanogen in its nascent
state with 2 equivs. of water. When this white substance is
treated with acids, it is converted into oxalic acid and am
monia. This fact, together with the analysis, proves it to be
Ovamide”. Its occurrence in a process of oxidation is very
surprising, and perhaps may throw some doubts on the theo
retical composition ascribed to it, 2CO+NH”. There is
little doubt that this substance is the same as that observed by
Vauquelint in a watery solution of cyanogen, which however
was not analysed by him. The description which he gives
applies closely to oxamide. Wöhlert also observed two sub
stances in a watery solution of cyanogen, one of which may
be this body. The appearance of carbonic acid is now ex
plained, as it is obviously due to an oxidation of the oxalic
acid produced by the transformation of the oxamide.
      SECTION II.—General remarks on the Nitroprussides.
    9. The nitroprussides are salts with characters so decided,
that they cannot be confounded with any known series of
compounds. They are generally highly coloured—the salts
of potassium, ammonium, sodium, barium, calcium and lead
being of a dark red or ruby colour; they are readily soluble
in water, and communicate a dark red colour to the solution.
Alcohol does not precipitate these salts from their solutions.
The soluble nitroprussides crystallize readily, yielding large
and well-defined crystals. The nitroprussides of copper, zinc,
iron, nickel, cobalt and silver, are either wholly or nearly in
soluble.
    The following table exhibits some of the characteristic re
actions of a soluble nitroprusside:—

by the addition of water.

Caustic alkalies ..................        orange colour.
   The beautiful colour immediately produced on the addition
of a soluble sulphide, is a most marked character of the nitro
prussides. This purple coloration is most intense, and enables
the detection of the most minute quantity of either reagent.
As a test for the presence of sulphides it is wonderfully useful,
enabling minute quantities of them to be found in circum
stances where the ordinary means of testing altogether fails to
denote their presence. This purple coloration is however
only transitory, the compound soon breaking up into various
substances, among which, hydrocyanic acid, ammonia, ni
trogen, oxide of iron, a ferrocyanide, a sulphocyanide and a
hyponitrite may be recognized.
   The soluble nitroprussides are decomposed when sulphu
retted hydrogen is passed through them, oxide of iron, prus
sian blue, sulphur, a ferrocyanide, and a peculiar sulphur
compound being among the products of decomposition.
   The alkalies decompose the soluble nitroprussides when
their solutions are mixed together and boiled. The products
of the transformation in this case are oxide of iron, nitrogen,
a ferrocyanide and a hyponitrite. An excess of ammonia,
even in the cold, gradually decomposes the nitroprussides,
nitrogen gas being evolved, and a peculiar uncrystallizable
black compound remains as the result of the decomposition.
   Sulphurous acid, the sulphites and hyposulphites exert no
apparent action on the nitroprussides. They are however
wholly decomposed by boiling them with concentrated sul
phuric acid; during this decomposition, the peculiar purple
colour due to sulphides is observed.
   Chlorine does not produce any change when passed through
solutions of the nitroprussides.
   Prussian blue dissolves in an excess of some of the nitro
prussides, forming a beautiful blue solution; when the prussian
blue is in excess, it is able, under certain circumstances (see
§ 5), to remove the soluble nitroprusside from solution, but
it again yields it up to boiling though not to cold water.
   Some of the nitroprussides are very permanent and suffer
no change in solution, either by exposure to the air or by the

                      a New Class of Salts.                  209
action of heat. Several, on the contrary, especially nitro
prussic acid, the nitroprussides of barium, calcium and am
monium, decompose partially, either when their solutions are
long kept, or speedily when they are boiled. Some of the
products of decomposition are dissolved by the still undecom
posed nitroprusside, and cannot be again separated from them
by crystallization.
   After this general idea of the habits of the nitroprussides,
their individual salts and their transformations may be more
easily studied.
                        Nitroprussic Acid.
   10. This acid may be obtained in solution by decomposing
nitroprusside of silver with an equivalent quantity of hydro
chloric acid, or by precipitating nitroprusside of barium with
an equivalent quantity of sulphuric acid. It may also be ob
tained, but in a less pure state, by precipitating nitroprusside
of potassium dissolved in a small quantity of water, and diluted
with several times its volume of alcohol, with an alcoholic
solution of tartaric acid, the quantity of the latter being just
sufficient to form bitartrate of potash with the potassium; but
as the acid dissolves some of the latter salt, this process does
not yield a pure product.
   A dark red-coloured solution, strongly acid, is obtained by
these methods. AEther does not precipitate the acid as it does
ferrocyanic acid. Soon however the solution begins to form
hydrocyanic acid, and either to deposit oxide of iron or to
hold iron in solution, which may be detected by a prusside.
When this change has taken place, evaporation in vacuo over
sulphuric acid yields crystals of the acid, which is however
found to contain a small quantity of an impurity, probably of
a cyanide of iron, which cannot be separated by crystallization,
or any other of the numerous methods tried. The amount of
this impurity is from 2 to 3 per cent. This crystalline acid
belongs to the oblique system, and its crystals are described
and measured in a further part of this paper, together with
its analyses. It possesses all the properties of nitroprussic
acid, and only differs by containing this small quantity of im
purity. The perfectly pure acid in crystals has not been ob
tained, notwithstanding very many efforts to obtain this desi
rable result.
                     Nitroprusside of Sodium.
   11. This salt is the most readily procured, in a crystallized
state, of all the nitroprussides; it may be obtained by decom
posing the nitroprussides of copper or iron by means of soda,

filtering from the oxides of these metals and evaporating the
solution by a gentle heat. When prepared from the iron salt,
it is apt to contain a little iron in excess.
    Nitroprusside of sodium is however most easily prepared
in the following manner:–1 equiv. of yellow prusside of
potassium is digested with 5 equivs. nitric acid, as described in
page 202, until the solution precipitates salts of protoxide of
iron of a slate colour.        It is now neutralized with carbonate
of soda, both solutions being employed cold. The neutralized
 liquid is now boiled, and the green precipitate is separated by
 filtration from the dark red-coloured solution.              This is then
 evaporated down and again filtered from a brown precipitate
which falls during evaporation. The nitrates of soda and
   otash are allowed to crystallize out.
     The dark red solution is now evaporated on the sand-bath,
 and during evaporation prismatic crystals separate from the
 hot solution.      These are removed, dissolved in water, and
 again crystallized by allowing the solution to cool. The reason
 of taking the crystals from the hot solution in the first instance
 is to obtain them uncontaminated with the nitrates, which are
 more soluble in hot water than this nitroprusside. By this
 process any quantity of the nitroprusside of sodium may be
 obtained in fine large ruby-coloured crystals.
     Properties.—This salt crystallizes in fine ruby-coloured
prisms, which have been measured by Prof. Miller.

     Nitroprusside of sodium resembles very much in appearance
 the ordinary red prusside of potassium when the latter salt is
 crystallized from alkaline solutions".
     Nitroprusside of sodium is not at all deliquescent, but is
    * Red prussiate of potash crystallizes more easily and with much greater
 beauty from alkaline than from neutral or acid solutions; the reason being
that the excess of alkali decomposes a small quantity of a green precipitate,
which crystallizes along with it.

very soluble in water, dissolving in 23 times its weight of water"
at 60°. It is still more soluble in hot water, but appears to
have a point of less solubility at a particular temperature, for
it may easily be crystallized by keeping its hot solution on the
sand-bath, while it may not do so on cooling.
    It is decomposed by mixing it with excess of alkali, and
suffers the singular transformations with sulphurets of the
alkaline metals which have been already alluded to. It un
dergoes no change in weight when heated to 212°, and there
fore does not lose water in the water-bath.
   The following analyses were made by heating the salt with
sulphuric acid, and estimating the iron as peroxide, the sodium
as sulphate of soda:—

   It is obvious that if the analyses would authorise 25 equivs.
of carbon instead of 24, a very much more simple formula
might be given. The mean proportion of iron to carbon is

                        a New Class of Salts.                 213
19:54: 2003, while the proportion, 5 equivs. : 25 equivs, or
1 : 5, would require 19:54: 20.93 of carbon. Throughout
all the salts, this less quantity of carbon refuses to enrol itself
in the simple proportion of 1 : 5, and necessitates the use of
the much more complex one of 5: 24. The above formula
may be expressed as Fe"Cy”3NO, 5Na+10HO.
                    Nitroprusside of Potassium.
   12. This salt may be obtained in several ways. 1. By
acting upon prusside of potassium with nitric acid, exactly as
described under nitroprusside of sodium, but the neutraliza
tion of the acid is effected by carbonate of potash, instead of
carbonate of soda as therein described. The nitrate of potash
is crystallized out and the mother-liquor is put in the hot
chamber to crystallize. 2. It may be prepared from the
nitroprusside of iron, or better from the copper salt, by de
composing it with caustic potash, care being taken to keep
the nitroprusside in excess.
   Properties.—This salt, from its great solubility, is somewhat
difficult to crystallize. It is apt to deposit in an amorphous
form; but this may be avoided by a little practice, and fine
large crystals may be obtained. These crystals belong to the
oblique system, and have been measured by Prof. Miller.

    According to this calculation the formula of the salt dried
at 212° is F*Cy”3NO, 5K+3 HO; the salt loses in the water

     13. This salt is obtained by decomposing nitroprusside of
 copper by caustic barytes, avoiding an excess of the latter.
 On filtration a dark red-coloured solution passes through.
 When evaporated under the air-pump, it forms fine large
 pyramidal crystals. The following measurements have been
 made by Prof. Miller of Cambridge:—

    This salt, out of a strong solution, also frequently crystal
lizes in flattened prisms; no doubt as a different hydrate.
    Nitroprusside of barium is of a dark red colour, is easily
soluble in water, and is not deliquescent. It deposits a brown
precipitate on boiling, resembling oxide of iron, but which, in
the specimen examined, also contained barytes. The salt,
after it has experienced this change, crystallizes in the same
form, but with impurities which cannot be separated by filtra
tion or crystallization. Analyses of this altered salt are given
in a subsequent part of this paper.
    The salt crystallized in the air-pump lost water in water
bath.
 20.415 grs. lost at 212° 3:110 grs. water = 15.233 per cent.
 24'455 grs. lost at 210° 3.648 grs. water = 14.917 per cent.
    The analyses were made by acting upon the salt by sul
phuric acid in the usual way.

   In the above analysis the proportion of carbon to the iron
is higher than obtained with the other salts, but the error is
usually on this side when chromate of lead, as in this instance,
is used in the combustion.         It will also be seen in a further
part of the paper, that a carbonaceous impurity, probably an
attached cyanide, not separable by crystallization, but removed
when it is converted into a silver salt, is produced when a so
lution of this salt is kept for some time, and it is possible that
a small portion may be present in the salt analysed. If we
could be assured of the absence of all impurity, which it will
be afterwards seen that it is difficult to believe from the vari
able composition of this salt, it is obvious that the above ana
lyses might be much more simply expressed by the following
 calculation:
                                                 Calculated.

   On the first formula the dried salt would be Fe"Cy”3NO,
5Ba+15HO, on the second Fe°Cy"NO, Ba2+6HO. The
water lost in the water-bath would in the first case correspond
to 20 equivs, in the latter case to 8 equivs.
                         Nitroprusside of Silver.
   14. This salt may be prepared by adding nitrate of silver
to any of the soluble nitroprussides.
   The colour of the salt varies according to its state of pre
''           from a fleshy white to a pale buff. When dry it
  as a flesh colour. It is insoluble in water, alcohol and nitric
acid. Hydrochloric acid decomposes it with the formation of
nitroprussic acid and chloride of silver.        The caustic alkalies
decompose it, as they do the soluble nitroprussides generally:

                       a New Class of Salts.                     217
ammonia dissolves nitroprusside of silver, but it soon deposits
white crystals, which are apt to be contaminated by oxide of
iron. These white shining crystals are a compound of the salt
with ammonia, and are quickly decomposed, even by water
alone, but very readily by water acidulated with nitric acid.
Ammonia is now found in solution and nitroprusside of silver
remains. If ammonia and nitroprusside of silver be boiled
together, total decomposition takes place.
    The salt was decomposed by sulphuric acid, the silver esti
mated as a chloride and the iron as peroxide. Each salt ana
lysed was prepared at different times.
    I. 14.788 grs. gave 2.749 grs. oxide of iron and 9.925 grs.
         chloride of silver.
   II. 22.838 grs. gave 4.220 Fe°O” and 15:18 AgCl.
 III. 16.675 grs. gave 3.115 Fe'O' and 11:09 AgCl.
 IV. 26.545 grs. gave 4,970 Fe'O” and 17.78 AgCl,
    The combustions were made in the usual way.
    I. 8:350 grs. gave 0.252 gr. water and 4:045 grs. carbonic
          acid.
   II. 8.385 grs. gave 0.234 HO and 4:150 CO2.
 III. 7.900 grs. gave 0.183 HO and 3.820 CO’.
  IV. 9.415 grs. gave 0-120 HO and 4.577 CO’.
     As this salt was well calculated to give correct knowledge
 with regard to the composition of the nitroprussides generally,
 the nitrogen was carefully determined by the three best pro
 cesses, viz. those of Dumas, Liebig and Bunsen.
     I. Quantitative estimation of nitrogen:—
             6-808 grs. salt gave 69 C.C. nitrogen gas,
  the thermometer being 7°7 C. and the barometer 30.094
 inches. This makes the nitrogen 19-299 per cent.
     II. Liebig's method:—
 Tubes. Wol. mixed gases. Wol. after absorption. Vol. of carbonic acid.
     1.          21-0             8°15                 12.85
     2.          18°4.            7.3                  1 1-1

     5.          13°3             5°35                   7.95
     6.          26.20             9.2                 17:0
                123°05           46-70                 76°35
     Hence the proportion of nitrogen to carbonic acid is as
  1 : 163. This, calculated on 13.288, the mean quantity of
  carbon, gives 19:02 per cent.

    With a quantity of hydrogen so small as that in the above
analysis, it is difficult to obtain accordant results in an organic
analysis. A portion of well-dried salt was therefore heated
in an F tube, to which a tube filled with chloride of calcium
was attached.
  5:375 grs. gave 0.085 gr, water, equal to 0-175 H. per cent.
 4'000 grs. gave 0.065 gr, water, equal to 0-180 H. per cent.
   It is therefore quite certain that the silver salt dried at 212°
still retains 1% per cent. of water. It loses however this water
at a higher heat and becomes anhydrous. The formula of
the silver salt is therefore Fe"Cy"3NO,Ag"+2HO.
                       Nitroprusside of Copper.
    15. This salt is obtained by adding a solution of a copper
salt to that of a nitroprusside. As it is insoluble in cold
water, and almost entirely so in hot, it may be washed to any
eXtent.
   It is of a pale green colour, which changes to slate colour
when exposed to light in the moist state. It is quite insoluble
in alcohol. It is decomposed by the caustic alkalies, first
passing into a dark brown basic nitroprusside, and then into
oxide of copper and a soluble nitroprusside.
   Nitroprusside of copper, dried in the hot chamber at about
100°Fahr., still lost weight in the water-bath.
     45.60 grs. lost in water-bath 4:525, or 9.922 per cent.
     25:12 grs, lost in water-bath 2:870, or 11:425 per cent.

    The analysis of the dried salt was made by decomposing it
with sulphuric acid, and estimating the two metals as oxides,
after separating them by sulphuretted hydrogen.
  I. 22.24 grs. gave 6'325 grs. oxide of copper and 6:515 per
          oxide of iron.
II. 21:00 grs. gave 6,018 CuO and 6'120 Fe'O'.
    The combustions were made with chromate of lead and
with oxide of copper.

           acid.

III. 9.887 grs. gave 0.330 HO and 7.694 CO’.
 IV. 11:507 grs. gave 0.320 HO and 8.936 CO”.
    The nitrogen was determined in three different ways.
    I. Dumas' quantitative method:—
6,226 grs. gave 98 CC. nitrogen gas. Barom. 30.105 inches.
         Therm. 8°.8 C.

   The formula of the copper salt is therefore Fe"Cy”3NO,
Cu5+ HO.
                        Nitroprusside of Iron.
   16. This salt is obtained by adding sulphate of the prot
oxide of iron to a soluble nitroprusside. When the solutions
are dilute the precipitate does not at first appear; as however
it is very sparingly soluble, it may be purified by washing
either with hot or cold water.
   This salt is a salmon-coloured precipitate, nearly though
not absolutely insoluble in water; it is more soluble in water
rendered acid by nitric acid. It is decomposed by caustic
alkalies, with the precipitation of oxide of iron and the forma
tion of a soluble nitroprusside. Before, however, being com
pletely decomposed, a dark-coloured basic nitroprusside of
iron is produced.
   A salt dried in the hot chamber, at a temperature about
90° Fahr., still lost water when exposed in the water bath:—
     14.162 grs. lost at 212° 2.890 grs, or 20.406 per cent.
     10.893 grs. lost at 212° 2'320 grs., or 21:298 per cent.
     17:500 grs. lost at 212° 3:545 grs., or 20.257 per cent.
   In the two first analyses given below, the iron was deter
mined by decomposing the salt by sulphuric acid, oxidizing
with nitric acid and precipitation by ammonia. The third
estimation was by calcination, a little nitrate of ammonia being
used to effect complete oxidation.
         I. 18.075 grs. gave 9.917 grs. peroxide of iron.
        II. 30.935 grs. gave 16:900 grs. peroxide of iron.
       III. 9.220 grs. gave 4.995 grs. peroxide of iron.
   The combustions were performed with chromate of lead.
      I. 7:218grs. gave 0.717 gr. water and 5.255 carbonic acid.
    II. 7.347grs. gave 0.810gr water and 5'360 carbonic acid.
   III. 6'360grs. gave 0.693 gr. water and 4.695 carbonic acid.
The nitrogen was determined by Dumas' quantitative method.
   5'427 grs. gave 86 CC. nitrogen gas, the thermometer being
48°7 Fahr. (9.4 Cent.) and the barometer 29.285 inches.

   17. This salt is prepared by precipitating one of the soluble
salts of zinc by a nitro-prusside. It is a salmon-coloured
precipitate, of a more fleshy colour than the iron salt. When
formed slowly, as when muriatic acid and zinc are made to act
on nitroprusside of soda, it is of a deep orange colour.
   Nitroprusside of zinc is very slightly soluble in cold water,
rather more so in hot water. In its behaviour to reagents it
acts exactly like the iron nitroprusside. It was analysed by de
composing it with sulphuric acid, separating the iron by suc
cinate of ammonia and determining the zinc as a carbonate.

XXVIII. On the Meteor which appeared on Monday, the 11th
   of February 1850, at about 10h 45m P.M. By JAMEs
   GLAISHER, Esq., F.R.S.
  To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,
TH: magnificent meteor which was seen all over England
       on the night of February 11, 1850, was so remarkable
in many respects, that I beg to send you the following par
ticulars of it.

222        Mr. J. Glaisher on the Meteor which appeared
    In consequence of the deception of the senses on the sudden
appearance of unusual objects, the short time of continuance
of this meteor, and the fact that in many cases the observa
tions were made by gentlemen unaccustomed to think upon
these subjects, I think it necessary to give all the accounts I
have received.
   As yet I have not heard that this body was seen south of
England, and the following are the accounts from different
places arranged in the order of latitude.
    I. From Wootton, three miles from the south coast, and
situated between Lymington and Christ Church. Thomas
 Falconer, Esq., says, “I had just retired to bed when the room
was first illuminated with a pale light, and instantly after
wards everything in it was visible; nor can I describe the
brilliancy of the light more than by saying, that a deaf and
dumb brother, who has been taught to speak many words,
rose from his bed and gave an alarm of fire. I was not able to
be quick enough to get to a window from which I might have
seen it, but there was most certainly not the slightest noise.”
   II. From Brighton. The Rev. J. Wharton favoured me
with the following:—
   “When the meteor exploded, it appeared to be about five
degrees west of north, and at an altitude of about 5° to 7°*
above the horizon, as I observed it at this place, top of Bruns
wick Square, Brighton. The light appeared of a very pale
bluish description and exceedingly brilliant; but I only caught
it at the moment of explosion, because it was previously behind
a layer of clouds.”
   III. From Southampton, I received the following from W.
Philip, Esq.:
   “About fifteen minutes to eleven on Monday night, as I was
walking through the High Street due north, I saw a large, as
it appeared to me, ball of fire somewhat exceeding the dimen
sions of a full-sized orange, and intensely bright towards its
edge, pass with great velocity from west to east, giving forth
a light equal to that of a vivid flash of lightning interrupted
occasionally by a few clouds, beyond which it passed and in
stantly disappeared. Its course was indicated by a bright
luminous appearance like a tail; besides which it also threw
off at right angles, as if by combustion, a number of white
sparks in appearance like stars. I suppose I saw it altogether
about two seconds, but did not hear any report when it dis
  ." It is likely that the view from this gentleman's house does not meet
with an unobstructed horizon, and that in reality the meteor was more
elevated than 7°.

            on Monday, the 11th of February, 1850.              223
appeared, though I listened, and was at the time favoured by
perfect stillness around. Although I mention that it was
larger than an orange, I do not intend that it was perfectly
round, as the edge appeared to be very jagged and irregular.
Some friends in the town who had retired to rest were also
alarmed by an unusual flood of light, which, at the same time
as I have noted, illuminated their bed-chambers.”
    IV. From Yeovil, Somersetshire. J. Hannane, Esq., fa
voured me with the following information:—
    “I saw on Monday, the eleventh instant, about half-past ten,
a brilliant meteor; it first appeared of a red colour like Mars,
but twice or three times its apparent magnitude; a little to the
west of north, at an angle as far as I can judge of about 60
degrees, rather more than less, its course was easterly, form
ing a slight curve; the tail and meteor increased in brilliancy
until I lost sight of it, owing to some houses intervening; but
the light, after I had lost the view of the meteor itself, increased
to that of the moon in a clear night when half-full.
    From a red it assumed a brilliant white light; and I think
it was not in one compact light, but rather like several lights
 together, as I was losing sight of it. The time that I first
 saw it, for I saw its commencement, until the reflexion of it
 was gone, may be about seven or eight seconds; the sky was
 not at all clouded in that direction. The day had been re
 markably wet and stormy, but it had cleared about nine
 o'clock or a little before.”
    V. From Uckfield. C. L. Prince, Esq. favoured me with
 a letter containing the following particulars:
    “A very large meteor passed over this place on Monday
night (11th inst.), and at a very low elevation, so that I can
not give you any idea of its path, further than its direction
was from N.W. to S.E., and it at last burst at an apparent
distance of four miles, making a rumbling noise like distant
thunder, and which was distinctly heard by persons indoors”.
 The light was most intense, and I could have read a small
 print very distinctly. It was of bluish colour, and the time of
 its appearance was about 10" 30" to 10" 40" P.M. I cannot
 say exactly. It was seen by many persons in this locality,
 and some of the country people were much frightened by it.
 There had been much rain (:51 inch) during the afternoon, and
 the night was densely overcast and dark.”
    VI. From Langport, Somersetshire, and for which I am
 obliged to Wm. Bond Paul, Esq.
    “I was fortunate to witness the splendid meteor which
                * This sound must have been a deception.

 224 Mr. J. Glaisher on the Meteor which appeared
occurred on the night of Monday the 11th instant, and I
beg to send you the following account, although an incom
plete one:—
   The time of its appearance was at about twenty minutes to
eleven P.M., London time; its course was from S.W. to N.E.
    Its colour was pale blue, but very brilliant.
    Its apparent magnitude was that of Venus when brightest;
a lady who was with me thought it much larger.
    Its duration was about three seconds.
   It proceeded very slowly, and a pale blue train was visible
behind it for many yards; after continuing its course for
some distance an explosion appeared to take place, upon
which it was immediately followed by three other globes in
the same direction; they were visible however for a very
short time only, and all disappeared simultaneously.
    I considered its path to be horizontal.
    Its distance from me was seemingly inconsiderable, and an
observer might easily have imagined the meteors to have been
 within a few hundred yards of him.
    Surrounding objects were rendered distinctly discernible.”
    VII. Bath. The following was copied from the Bath Chro
nicle of February 16.
    Meteor.—On Monday night last, shortly after half-past ten
o'clock, a meteor of great magnitude and brightness descended
in a direction nearly eastward of this city: on its first appear
ance it lighted up the whole visible horizon with an intense
glare equal to that of the most vivid and sustained lightning;
as it proceeded in its course, the colour of its light changed
from red to intense blue, and its explosion was unaccompanied
by any noise, but it appeared to dissipate in a shower of sparks.
Its apparent size was that of a globe, either eight or nine inches
in diameter, and it left a stream of fire in its course, occupying
some 25 degrees of the heavens. The weather was clear and
calm at the time, but the day had been squally with drenching
Tall].
   VIII. Royal Observatory, Greenwich. The following ob
servations were made by the Astronomer Royal —
   On the night of Monday, February 11, I was standing in
the Computing Room, at a distance of about 4 feet 6 inches
from the western wall of the room, and 3 feet 4 inches from
the pier between the central and western windows on the
north side of the room, with my eyes glancing downwards
to some papers on the table (I think my lamp was in the
window-seat of the west window), when my attention was at
tracted to a general light of strong yellow colour upon that
part of the sky which was seen through the western window.

             on Monday, the 11th of February 1850.            225
I raised my eyes and saw the sky most fully illuminated; the
form of the north-east dome and the walls near it (which had
been invisible before and were totally invisible afterwards, from
the room, while my lamp was in it) were brought out not only
distinctly but conspicuously, I think as well as if a large moon
had been behind the dome, but the colour of the light was so
different as to make comparison difficult. In an instant there
came in the direction from W.S.W. to E.N.E. a brilliant body
like a congreve rocket, followed by two others close behind it.
(I cannot assert that there were not more than two) in the
same path. The direction of their path was nearly horizontal,
but slightly rising, I think. The height above the top of the
dome was nearly equal to the semidiameter of the dome, I
think rather less.
    I think that the meteor passed my field at the western win
dow in less than 1s:5; and I saw nothing of it at the central
window. All was very thickly dark as before. My first im
pression was that it was a rocket; on a moment's considera
tion I saw that it was impossible that a rocket could have
such a nearly horizontal course except fired from the leads of
my own house. I then looked at my watch, and, allowing
as well as I could for the few seconds past, the watch time
 was 10h 42m 10s. By a comparison with the ball clock made
 immediately afterwards, the watch was 42s fast on Greenwich
 mean solar time.
    On going into the open air, I found that that part of the
sky, and the north generally to the height of 30° or 40°, was
 starlight, and that there were stars visible over head, but the
 south was clouded.
    From careful measurements afterwards, and calculation, its
 elevation at this part of its path was nearly 14° 58', and its
 azimuth 19° west of north.
    IX. Euston Square, London. George F. Burder, Esq.
 favoured me with a letter containing the following parti
 culars:
    “I was standing at a window facing E.N.E. in the night in
 Euston Square with the window open, observing an auroral
 light over the north horizon, when my attention was attracted
 by a sudden and brilliant illumination of the whole sky and
 of terrestrial objects. I cast my eyes in the direction from
 which its light appeared to proceed, and presently there came
 into view in N.N.W. (having been previously concealed
 by houses) a meteor of almost dazzling brightness, which,
 after traversing a certain further distance in the sky, instan
 taneously vanished. The point of its disappearance was
 about north or east of north, but certainly not so far east as
     Phil. Mag. S. 3. Vol. 36. No.242. March 1850.          Q

   226      Mr. J. Glaisher on the Meteor which appeared
    N.N.E. Its course appeared to me (in the part I saw) to be
    nearly parallel to the horizon, or rather inclining towards it;
    and its altitude I guessed roughly at twenty degrees. The
    appearance of the tail was totally unlike either of the illustra
    tions in the Illustrated London News,—it had rather the ap
    pearance of a compact sheet of flame thrown behind by the
    rapidity of the motion, commencing with the diameter of the
    head and tapering to a point at the extremity:—in fact just
. . such as would be produced by throwing an ignited tow-ball
    into the air. I saw no fragments or sparks thrown off in its
    course, or anything like bursting at its disappearance; it seemed
    to me simply to go out, and that instantaneously. I heard no
    explosion or noise of any kind. The time of its occurrence I
    made about 10h 41m 30s P.M. Greenwich time, and I can
    speak pretty confidently within about half a minute, but not
    nearer. The whole duration of the phaenomenon was pro
    bably between 2 and 3 seconds; the part of its course which
    I actually saw (from N.N.W. to about north by east) may
    have occupied half that time. The whole of the sky visible
    from the window at which I stood was free from cloud, ex
    cept a few slight streaks of haze radiating from a point in
    N.E. I am not sure that these may not have been auroral
    streaks. The appearance over the north horizon was clearly
    auroral and not haze, for a Lyrae shone brightly through the
    thickest of it.”
       At my request Mr. Burder took the trouble to measure the
    height of its apparent elevation, as well as he could call it to
    mind. The following is a copy of his second letter:—
       “Having at hand a quadrant which I am in the habit of
    using, attached to a small telescope, I thought it unnecessary
    to put in practice the suggestions you offer for ascertaining
    the altitude of the meteor. I therefore adopted the following
    plan for recalling, as accurately as possible, the original im
    pression. This evening, the sky being clear, I stationed my
    self in precisely the same position that I occupied when I saw
    the meteor, and at the same hour, and endeavoured to trace,
    as near as possible, from recollection its course in the heavens.
    In this I was assisted by the stars, having observed at the time,
    in a general way, its position in relation to the principal stars   .
    in the neighbourhood. I then fixed upon a star which seemed
    to the best of my judgement to correspond in altitude with the
    point at which the meteor disappeared, and directing the te
    lescope thereto, found the altitude to be about 23°.              -
       “I think therefore if I say that it disappeared at that altitude
    and at a point in the azimuth about 10° east of north, I shall
    not be very far wrong.”

             on Monday, the 11th of February 1850.            227
    X. From Regent's Park, as observed by J. R. Hind, Esq.
    “I saw the meteor for a moment, but being unfavourably
placed at the time, I could only see that it moved from below
a Persei towards & Cassiopeia, near which star it must have
been when I lost sight of it. The appearance of its light was
such, that in my idea no doubt can be entertained but that
it was of electrical origin; it moved precisely in the direction
in which the wind was blowing at the time. About us, the
houses, &c. were as well seen as by daylight, when the sun is
shining brightly. The meteor occurred at 10h 39" mean time.”
   XI. From Enstone, Oxon. The Rev. J. Jordan, the Vicar,
in a letter to the Astronomer Royal, says,—
    “That he had been in bed about ten minutes, when, it being
then about a quarter before eleven, a flash of light appeared
upon the window, increasing in intensity as it continued; its
permanence of several seconds, proved it not to be lightning:
some time after the light had disappeared, a sound was heard
as of a dreadful explosion, which shook the window of the
room and the whole of the house. The sound was utterly
unlike thunder, even when taking effect upon any object.
    “The next morning, the noise of the explosion, as well as
the light which had been seen, were in every one's mouth;
several thinking, as I had done, that some persons had come
under their windows with a dark lanthorn. My own servants
were greatly alarmed, and believed that a violent entry had
been made into the house, mistaking the explosion for the
falling of a heavy shutter.
    “Upon further inquiry, reports were given of an extraordi
nary ball of fire having been seen in the air; and learning
that one young man had seen it under peculiar advantageous
circumstances, I went with him to the spot where he had seen
it, and had from his mouth the following details:—He had
gone out with a lanthorn to cut some hay from a rick, and
having set the lanthorn on the ground, was in the act of using
the knife and cutting the hay, when he found himself in a
blaze of light.   His first fear was that from negligence he had
set the rick on fire, and he turned to look for his lanthorn,
when as he turned, his eye was caught by a large ball of fire
of a bluish light in the sky. It was moving steadily along
when it burst out with sparks of fire, and continued to do so
until it went down. It moved along directly in front of him,
so that he could distinctly point out to me its path, which was
about a third in height from the horizon to the zenith, in di
rection nearly due north and south, and in length full one
third of that part of the circle of the sky along which it was
moving.     Having thus seen    & he was left for the instant, so

228       Mr. J. Glaisher on the Meteor which appeared
great was the change, in total darkness; but turning to his
knife in the hay, he finished cutting what he wanted, took it
up with his lanthorn, went round two sides of the rick (a
small one), opened a door into a loft, threw the hay up
into the loft, shut the door and fastened it, and then went
round the stable to a gate into the stable-yard; as he reached
this gate he heard the explosion which everyone else had
heard, and calculated that it must have been at least a minute
and a half, perhaps two minutes, from the time the light dis
appeared to his hearing the sound. I judged the time between
my losing sight of the light and hearing the sound to have
been the same, and as also do many others, who both saw the
light and heard the sound.
 -  “The sound was heard distinctly and loudly everywhere, and
in every house around here. Some hearing it, fancied that
 barrels had burst in their cellars, and got up and went down
to see; others fancied that a door or shutter was broken open
 and thrown down, and also got up to see; the alarm was
general, so loud was the noise, and so peculiar the sound
as differing from that of thunder. One young man sat read
ing after being left by a few friends who had been practising
 music, and a large drum that stood near him with the sticks
 upon the head of it, was so affected by the sound that the
 drumsticks were slightly raised by its reverberation.”
     XII. Hampstead Road.          From the Illustrated London
 News of Feb. 16, 1850.
     “I was an eye-witness of a splendid meteor on the night of
 Monday the 11th instant, at twenty minutes to eleven o’clock.
 It first appeared like a star, about four times as large as Venus,
 with a dull golden lustre, and rapidly increased in brightness
 till it became a white light, resembling an immense diamond,
 and put forth a tail like a waving blade of red flame; which,
 as it proceeded, either disappeared or was lost in the increased
 brightness of the head, which at last shone so brilliantly as to
light up the whole atmosphere. The light certainly far ex
 ceeded that of the full moon; it then became suddenly extin
 guished; it evidently displayed the process of combustion. I
 first saw it somewhere a little above the Pleiades, and it
 descended obliquely towards the north, and disappeared above
 the lower part of Cassiopoeia. I think its greatest length was
 about 2°; the length of its visible path about 15° or 20°; and
 the time it was visible three or four seconds. I thought the
 last I saw of the meteor as the light vanished was a red spot,
 but it disappeared instantaneously. I looked round at the
 clock directly it had disappeared, and it was exactly twenty
 minutes to eleven.

             on Monday, the 11th of February 1850.             229
    XIII. From Hampstead, as taken from the Illustrated
London News of Feb. 16, 1850.
    “Last evening I saw a most extraordinary meteor, of which
I send you a sketch * as it appeared over Hampstead. A
straight black cloud extended from south to north, and the
stars on either side of this cloud were unusually brilliant. When
the phaenomenon alluded to occurred, it issued from about
S.W., and appeared to travel slowly in a direction about
N.N.E. On its first emerging from its hiding-place it was a
clear white light; about midway of its flight it assumed the
brilliant yellow of the light produced in the combustion of
sodium; and before it departed its colour was of that peculiar
pink colour of potassium when burning.
   Feb 11, 1850.                         RoBERT LoNGBoTToM.”
    XIV. From Brompton Hospital of Consumption, as ex
tracted from the Illustrated London News of Feb. 16, 1850.
    “The brilliant meteor which passed over the metropolis on
Monday night, had a singular effect on the numerous patients
in the several wards of this hospital. It appeared to rise im
mediately at the back of the new chapel now erecting in con
nexion with the institution, and rushing over the hospital,
diffused a light of the most fearful intensity. To those only
slightly acquainted with meteorological phaenomena, the sight
was alarming; but to the naturally timid the effect was most
distressing. The shock was felt so severely by the matron of
the establishment, that a severe fit of illness supervened, from
which it is to be regretted that on Thursday she had scarcely
recovered.”
    XV. Dr. Lee, at Hartwell, says that the meteor was not
 seen there, but that its light was, and the report was heard.
 Mr. Samuel Horton at Hartwell says that he heard that
 William Miller, a watchman at Dinton, which is situated at
about two miles from Hartwell, saw the meteor, and from him
he learnt the following particulars:—“That about a quarter
 to eleven o’clock on Monday evening, February 11, he ob
 served something like a great mass of fire in the heavens in
 the west, having a long tail; and the mass was as large as the
 full moon, but giving a great deal more light; it passed along
the sky from west to east, gradually decreasing in height in
its progress. It lasted, he thinks, about two or three minutes
before it exploded, and then it had the appearance of a rocket;
when it burst, a report like thunder followed about two or
three minutes after the light was gone; and he says that he
                 * The sketch is engraved in the paper.

230      Mr. J. Glaisher on the Meteor which appeared
thinks the thunder came from the north; there was no cloud
to be seen at the time, and the air was very calm.”
   XVI. From Bromham, near Bedford.             The Rev. J. S.
Goodall, the Vicar, favoured me with a letter containing the
following particulars:—
   “Not only was the meteor of the most startling brilliancy,
but the roar of the detonation was heard and proved to be of a
most peculiar description—not like that of thunder above the
earth, but as it were upon the ground or even under it; thus
of those of whom I have had any communication upon the
 subject, some say it was quite like a luggage-train emerging
 from a tunnel; others like heavy fire-engines going full-speed
 along a road pitched with pebbles. To all persons the
 vibratory noise seemed close at hand; and persons have told
 me of their dashing from the centre of the road thinking they
 should be run over, and others who were at home were fully
 persuaded that fire-engines had driven into their yard. One
 servant of a friend of mine cried outright. In my own house
 alarm possessed us in various ways; I myself have the misfor
 tune to be very deaf, and rarely hear thunder, though alive to
 the vibratory motion which accompanies it. On the night of
 the 11th of July I was writing in my study, when on a sudden
 I felt the table and floor shake very perceptibly, at the same
 moment my dogs came running in and out yelling most pite
 ously. On going upstairs I found all in dismay, not so much
 at the glare of light (that was said to be unequal to twenty
 moon lamps in the room, and continuing for full half a mi
 nute) as from the dreadful crash and rumbling, which they all
 said was not thunder: from the red colour of the globular
 ball and the silver streams of light which followed it, I sup
 pose there can be little doubt of its being one of the class of
 Aérolite.”
    XVII. From Rugby, the account I received was more
 particular, and for which I am obliged to the Rev. H.
 Highton, M.A.                         -
    “1. Time. The school clock struck 10h 45m immediately
 after the explosion was heard. I suspect it was a few minutes
 fast by Greenwich time.
    “2. The light quite obscured the gas-light. Some say they
 could have read the smallest print by it. Some compare it
 to a strong sun-light. . All speak of its similarity to the elec
 tric light in colour and vividness.
    “3. Direction.     From W. to E., or W.N.W. to E.S.E.
 through the zenith. It exploded so soon after reaching the
 Zenith, that the fragments are described as appearing to fall
 a few yards off.

             on Monday, the 11th of February 1850.             231
   “4. Duration of the light, about twenty seconds.
   “5. The explosion was like that of a rocket; and fragments
are described as being seen falling, though not luminous.
   “6. The detonation was heard from seventy to ninety se
conds after the explosion—I think not less than ninety. The
noise was like that of the crash of a falling building, or, as one
person describes it, as though a quantity of horses had broken
loose and were galloping about.
   “The duration of time is estimated by the spaces walked
over by persons walking, between the appearance of the light,
its explosion, and the sound being heard.”
   XVIII. From Birmingham. Edward Wheeler, Esq. fa
voured me with the following particulars:—
   “I beg to offer you a description of the beautiful meteor
which I saw here on Monday night, Feb. 11.
   “In walking directly west, at twenty minutes to eleven, along
Great Hampton Street (which is sixty feet wide), the road
became so illuminated as to allow a pin to be seen.
   “Thinking it was occasioned through the aurora borealis, I
instantly turned towards the north, and saw a colour the most
brilliant (about two feet wide and twenty feet long) falling
rapidly from the zenith towards the south, displaying the gor
geous colours of the iris, and throwing out towards the head
some pink and light blue fragments, which became altogether
extinguished behind the buildings opposite to me, of which a
sketch is now made for you.
   “Just afterwards, in meeting a man and his wife, they seemed
to be much alarmed.”
   XIX. Near Wolverhampton.          From the Illustrated Lon
don News of Feb. 16, 1850.
   “Allow me to briefly notice the appearance last night
(Feb. 11) of a peculiarly large and brilliant meteor. After a
stormy day of wind and rain, the latter ceased at sunset, but
the former at the same time increased for a short space, and
then gradually lulled. The night became calm and clear,
with a few clouds on the horizon, and the stars shone with
remarkable brightness. At a little before eleven o’clock I
was struck by the sudden appearance of a brilliant light
resembling a continued gleam of lightning, but which, on
looking up, was found to proceed from an elongated lumi
nous ball, falling rapidly from the zenith towards the eastern
horizon. It appeared like a mass of molten metal, but little
smaller than the moon’s disc, and comparatively at a short
distance from my place of observation. The light given off
was intense, and rendered the whole landscape distinctly
visible. When approaching the earth it seemed to burst,

232      Mr. J. Glaisher on the Meteor which appeared
but without noise. A shower of luminous fragments, like
 red-hot stones, was discharged, or rather fell through, but
 were soon extinguished. The whole phaenomenon was vi
 sible, as well as I could judge, for about sixty seconds. In
 general appearance it more resembled what is usually under
 stood by a meteor, but its magnitude and apparent nearness
 were remarkable. Had it however exploded with detonation,
 I should have supposed it to be an aerolite.”
    XX. From Carrington, near Nottingham. J. K. Sewell,
 Esq., in a letter to the Astronomer Royal, says
    “At about 45 minutes past 10 o’clock on the night of Mon
 day the 11th inst., when descending the hill into Nottingham,
from the north my attention was suddenly attracted by a
bright light, apparently equal to that of a full moon in a clear sky,
 which brilliantly illuminated every object around. On raising
my eyes to ascertain the cause of so unusual an appearance, I
beheld a most splendid meteor, apparently very near and
crossing my path in a direction from about S.W. to N.E. It
was descending. Its colour was that of the flame of potas
sium on the surface of water, and of intense brilliancy. Its
length was about 2° 30'. Its head was whiter than its central,
which looked like a brilliant pink flame.           It was visible to
me during three or four seconds, and just before it disappeared
seemed to be nearly poised in the air, but near to the earth,
and emitted numerous red sparks from the end of its tail. No
sound was audible.”
   At the request of the Astronomer Royal, Mr. Sewell went
again to the spot where he was when he saw the meteor,
taking with him a quadrant to measure such altitudes as he
could best recollect, and a compass to take the bearing, and
the following is the additional information furnished.
    “Placing myself on the spot from which I saw the meteor, I
found that the direction of my path exactly corresponded
with that of the magnetic meridian *, consequently differing
from that of the terrestrial meridian by the amount of the
variation of the compass. On raising the quadrant as nearly
as possible to the position in which the meteor first became
visible to me, I found that its elevation must have been 13°;
this agrees with the opinion of a friend with whom I was
when the meteor was seen, and who kindly assisted me in
endeavouring to fix its position.”
   XXI. Blakeney, Norfolk, as extracted from the Illustrated
London News of Feb. 16, 1850.
   “As I was driving home last night at twenty minutes to
           * The variation of the compass was 23° 20' nearly.

              on Monday, the 11th of February 1850.                     233
eleven, I saw a very large meteor under Orion’s Belt, and
midway between that and the horizon. Its appearance was
instantaneous, and lasted about thirty seconds, emitting a most
brilliant light, which had at the period of its great intensity
a bluish tinge. So intense was the light, that I was enabled
to see the very smallest objects with perfect distinctness. The
course of the meteor was from north to south.*, and it appeared
to be not less than twenty feet in length, and contracted and
expanded with the greatest rapidity, giving me the idea of an
enormous flaming umbrella, which was open and shut alter
nately. The quarter of the sky in which it appeared was
covered with black clouds.”
   XXII. My next information was from Hull, the following
particulars being furnished by William Lawton, Esq.
    “The meteor appeared at 20 minutes to eleven o’clock; and
when I first saw it (which was not at the moment of its first
appearance), it was 5° N.E. of Sirius, advancing to the E.S.E.
in the direction of the stars # and 15 Argüs, near which it
exploded at an altitude of 12°, and at about 15° west of the
meridian.
    “Its light was intense and dazzling in the extreme, and
created in my mind the impression of being a body in course
of explosion throughout its whole course; its size seemed to be
about half the diameter of the moon.
    “I noted the time and its path immediately after its disap
pearance, and with all the care the circumstances would per
mit, with the view of enabling myself and others to ascertain
the length of its path and distance from the earth at the time
of bursting.
    “I heard no report or noise of any kind. There was a
slight tinge of blue in its light, which far exceeded that of the
full moon.”
   The position of the meteor at the time of explosion, being
near 15 Argus, is well-marked; at the time of observation the
star was near the meridian, and was 11° high at Hull; there
fore 12°, as stated above, must be very near the truth.
    XXIII. I shall conclude with one account more, which I
have received from John Douglas, Esq., of Raby Castle
Gardens, Standrop, Durham.
    “At about fifteen minutes to eleven, at Raby, I was ap
proaching the castle from S.E., when suddenly the whole
surrounding atmosphere appeared brilliantly illuminated; my
first impulse was hastily to survey the castle, thinking that
   * This traveller, I think, must have been deceived in the direction of the
meteor, probably by the windings of the road.

234. Mr. J. Glaisher on the Meteor of February 11, 1850.
 some part of the building might have taken fire; this occupied
a second or two of time. Guided by a similar impulse, I
 wheeled round, and luckily I was just in time to observe
what appeared to be an exploding ball of fire, similar in ap
pearance to the representation in the London Newspaper, of
 the meteor as seen from the Fulham Road. To me it ap
peared to be falling in an easterly direction, at an angle of
about 25° to the horizon. The meteor seemed to be suddenly
extinguished in a clump of trees a little distance off, and to
 the S.E. of where I stood: as near as I can judge, the illumina
 tion lasted about 6". The whole surrounding landscape was
 rendered distinctly visible. One of the Duke's huntsmen,
 who was about 100 paces from me when the meteor first ap
 peared, and who ran up to me in great agitation, said that he
 could see my person as distinctly as if it had been noonday.”
    These are all the accounts I have seen upon this body,
which must have been of considerable magnitude to have
yielded light sufficient to illuminate every place situated within
the distance of 200 miles of it. I hope yet to receive more
information, as its course is by no means clear. The observer
at Yeovil says that he saw its commencement, at an altitude
of 60° fully, but he has omitted to state the direction in which
he was looking. At Bath it is stated to have been eastward
of the city; if both these accounts be correct, the meteor, if
visible so soon, must have been vertical over parts of Wilt
shire and Gloucestershire, but this does not seem to have been
the case from the accounts from other places; I shall, there
fore, not proceed to inquire into its true path, its figure, or
its magnitude at present, but confine myself to an investiga
tion of its distance from the earth at the time of its explosion.
   The best data we have for this determination are from the
observations of the Astronomer Royal at Greenwich, of the
Rev. H. Highton at Rugby, and of William Lawton, Esq.
at Hull.    Assuming that the chord distance from Greenwich
to Rugby is 86 miles, and that from Rugby to Hull is 105
miles, and that the radius of the earth is 20,970,260 feet; that
the altitude of the meteor at Greenwich was 14° 53' above the
north horizon, and that at Hull was 12° above the south ho
rizon, and that the meteor was vertical at Rugby,–the ex
plosion took place at the distance of 23.2 miles from the earth,
from the observations at Greenwich and Rugby, and at the
distance of 23.3 miles from those of Hull and Rugby.
   After a careful review of all the particulars, I shall give
some additional results in another paper.

       XXIX. Professor PowFLL and Dr. WHEWELL.
  To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,
IN a paper lately published by me among               the Memoirs of
      the Oxford Ashmolean Society entitled “On Necessary
and Contingent Truth,” I have entered somewhat on the
questions which have been so much discussed as to the origin
of our ideas and foundation of our reasonings in mathematical
and mechanical science; and in so doing have, of course, ad
verted, as their importance justly demands, to the speculations
of Dr. Whewell on these points. I find, however, by a letter
which I have since received from that eminent writer, that in
the reference I make throughout my paper to his opinions I
have unfortunately mistaken them, in ascribing to him the
belief in innate, inherent, or intuitive ideas; or (as at p. 6) in
“ideas dependent upon intuitive conviction.” Such belief,
Dr. Whewell, in his letter to me, distinctly disclaims. He
has spoken of certain “fundamental ideas” appropriate to
different branches of science, but has nowhere discussed the
question of their origin; contending only that they are results
of the active, not of the passive constitution of the mind.
   I am anxious therefore to take the opportunity afforded by
your Journal to express my regret at having been led into a
misconception of Dr. Whewell’s meaning; while I rejoice to
find that, by the explanation thus given, the difference between
the views which I have upheld and those of Dr. Whewell is
materially diminished.
                        I remain,
                                   Very truly yours,              -

 Nov. 26,  ON      the Dynamical Theory of Diffraction.    By Professor
  1849.           Stokes.                         -
    The problem of diffraction is treated mathematically by conceiving
 each wave of a series incident on a small aperture, or passing the
 edge of a diffracting body, broken up on arriving at the aperture or
 diffracting edge, regarding each element of the wave as the centre
 of an elementary disturbance, which diverges spherically from that
 element, and finding by integration the aggregate disturbance at any
 point in front of the primary wave. With the exception of one case
                                                *

236               Cambridge Philosophical Society.
of diffraction, which will be mentioned further on, the illumination
in front of an aperture is insensible except in the immediate neigh
bourhood of a normal to the primary wave drawn through a point
in the aperture. Consequently we are only concerned with the law
of disturbance in that part of a secondary wave which lies very near
the normal to the primary wave; the nature of the disturbance in
other directions does not affect the result, since the secondary waves
neutralize each other by interference. Now it has been shown by
others, by indirect methods, that if c be the coefficient of vibration
in the incident light, dS an element of the area of the aperture, r the
radius of a secondary wave diverging from dS, A the wave length,
the coefficient of vibration in the secondary wave will      be'.7"
                                                                    and
the phase of vibration must be accelerated by a quarter of an undula
tion; or in other words,   # must be subtracted from the retardation
due to the radius r. These results, however, according to what has
been already remarked, only apply to that portion of a secondary
wave which lies immediately about the normal to the primary. The
object of the author in this paper was to determine, on purely dyna
mical principles, the law of disturbance in any direction in a se
condary wave.                                       -               -
   The author has treated the aether as an elastic solid; and as such
it must be treated in considering light, if the theory of transverse
vibrations be not rejected. The object which he had in view re
quired the solution, in the first instance, of the following problem;—
to determine the disturbance at any point of an elastic medium, and
at any time, due to a given small arbitrary disturbance confined to
a finite portion of the medium. This problem was solved long ago
by Poisson; but the author has given a totally different solution of
it, which appears to be in some respects simpler than Poisson’s. In
the course of the solution, the author was led incidentally to the fol
lowing very general dynamical theorem.
   Let any material system whatsoever, in which the forces acting
depend only on the positions of the particles, be slightly disturbed
from a position of equilibrium, and then left to itself: then the part
of the disturbance at any time which depends on the initial displace
ments will be got from that which depends on the initial velocities
by differentiating with respect to the time, and replacing the arbi
trary functions, or arbitrary constants, which express the initial ve
locities by those which express the corresponding initial displace
ments.    Particular cases of this theorem are of frequent occurrence,
but the author is not aware of any writing in which the theorem is
enunciated in all its generality.
   The problem above-mentioned has been applied by the author to
the case of diffraction in the following manner. Conceive a series
of plane-waves of plane-polarized light propagated in a direction
perpendicular to a fixed mathematical plane P. According to the
principle of the superposition of small motions, we have a perfect
right to consider the disturbance of the aether in front of the plane

                  Cambridge Philosophical Society.                   237
P as the resultant of the elementary disturbances corresponding to
the several elements of P. Let it be required to determine the dis
turbance which corresponds to an elementary portion only of the
plane P. In this consists the whole of the dynamical part of the
theory of diffraction, if we except the case of diffraction at the com
mon surface of two different media; the rest is a mere question of
integration. Let the time t be divided into equal intervals, each
equal to T. The disturbance which is propagated across the plane
P during the first interval T occupies a layer of the medium having
a thickness vr, if v be the velocity of propagation, and consists of a
certain velocity and a certain displacement. By the problem above
mentioned, we can find by itself the effect of the disturbance which
occupies so much only of this layer as corresponds to a given element
dS of P. By doing the same for the 2nd, 3rd, &c. intervals r, and
then making the number of such intervals increase and their magni
tude decrease indefinitely, we shall get the effect of the disturbance
which is continually transmitted across dS.         The result is a little
complicated, but is much simplified when certain terms are neg
lected which are only sensible when the radius of the secondary
wave is comparable with X, and which are wholly insensible in the
physical applications of the problem. The result thus simplified
may be enunciated as follows:—In the enunciation, the term
 diffracted ray is used to denote the disturbance in an elementary
portion of a secondary wave, diverging in a given direction from the
centre; the plane containing the incident and diffracted rays will
be called the plane of diffraction, the supplement of the angle be
tween these two rays the angle of diffraction, and the plane passing
through a ray of plane-polarized light and containing the direction
of vibration the plane of vibration.
    The incident ray being plane-polarized, each diffracted ray will
 be plane-polarized, and the plane of polarization will be determined
 by the following law:—The plane of vibration of the diffracted ray is
parallel to the direction of vibration of the incident ray. The direction

 gration the disturbance which corresponds to the whole of the plane
 P, the disturbance in front is the same as if the wave had not been
 supposed broken up, and no disturbance is propagated backwards.
    The law obtained for determining the position of the plane of po
 larization of the diffracted ray seems to lead to a crucial experiment
 for deciding between the two rival theories between the directions of
 vibration in plane-polarized light.     Suppose the incident light po
 larized by transmission through a Nicol's prism mounted in a gra
 duated instrument, and let the diffracted light be analysed in a similar
 manner. By means of the graduation of the polarizer, we can turn
 the plane of polarization of the incident ray, and consequently the
 plane of vibration, which is either parallel or perpendicular to the
 plane of polarization, round through equal angles of say 5° or 10°
 at a time. According to theory, the planes of vibration of the dif
 fracted ray will not be distributed uniformly, but will be crowded
 towards the perpendicular to the plane of diffraction. But experi
 ment will enable us to decide whether the planes of polarization are
 crowded towards the plane of diffraction or towards the perpendicular
 to the plane of diffraction, and we shall accordingly be led to con
 clude, either that the vibrations are perpendicular, or that they are
 parallel to the plane of polarization.
    In ordinary cases of diffraction, the illumination, in consequence
 of interference, is insensible beyond a small angle of diffraction. It
 is only by means of a fine grating that we can procure light of con
 siderable intensity that has been diffracted at a large angle. The
 author has been enabled to perform the experiment, or rather a mo
 dification of it, by the kindness of his friends Professors Miller and
 O’Brien; of whom the former lent him a fine glass-grating, con
 sisting of a glass plate on which parallel and equidistant lines had
 been ruled with a diamond at the rate of 1300 to the inch, and the
 latter lent him the graduated instruments required. The theory
 does not quite meet the case of a glass-grating, in which the diffrac
 tion takes place at the common surface of two media, but it leads to
 a definite result on each of the two extreme suppositions:—1st, that
 the diffraction takes place before the light reaches the grooves; 2nd,
 that it takes place after the light has passed them; and the results are
 very different according as one or other of the two rival theories is
 adopted.     In the principal experiments, the plane of the plate was
 placed perpendicular to the incident light, and the light observed
 was that which had been diffracted by transmission through the
 plate. The angle of diffraction, by which is meant the angle mea
 sured in air, ranged in the different experiments from about 20° to
 60°. The result obtained was, that when the grooved face was
 turned towards the eye, there was a very sensible crowding of the
 planes of polarization of the diffracted light towards the plane of
 diffraction. When the grooved face was turned towards the incident
 light, there was a considerable crowding in the same direction, much
 more than in the other case. Since the effect of refraction, con

                  Cambridge Philosophical Society.                    239
sidered apart from diffraction, would be to crowd the planes in the
contrary direction, the result seemed decisive in favour of Fresnel's
hypothesis, that the vibrations are perpendicular to the plane of po
larization.   On the other hypothesis, diffraction would have con
spired with refraction to produce a large crowding in a direction
contrary to that in which the observed crowding took place. The
amount of crowding, in both positions of the plate, was nearly what
would be given by theory, on adopting Fresnel's hypothesis, and
supposing that the diffraction took place before the light reached the
grooves, but appeared in both cases little less. The difference, how
ever, was comprised within the limits of uncertainty depending upon
the errors of observation and the error in the assumed value of the
refractive index of the glass plate.
   December 10.—Impact on Elastic Beams. By Homersham Cox,
Esq., B.A., Jesus College.
   Among the experiments instituted by the Royal Commission ap
pointed to inquire respecting the use of iron in railway structure,
was a series relating to impact on beams. These experiments were
undertaken by Professor Hodgkinson, and were conducted in the
following manner. The two ends of the beam were fixed in a hori
zontal position, and the blow was given against one of its vertical
sides in a horizontal direction. The instrument for giving the blow
was a heavy iron ball, hanging down, when at rest, from a point of
suspension vertically above the centre of the beam. The ball was
raised through different arcs, and after descending by its own gra
vity, struck the beam. The deflection corresponding to different arcs
of descent were carefully noted by a graduated scale.
   The object of the present paper is to show that the results might
have been predicted by known theoretical principles with consider
able precision and confidence. The problem is divided into two
parts:— 1st, to estimate the amount of velocity lost by the ball at
the first instant of collision; 2nd, to ascertain the effect of the elastic
forces of the beam in destroying the vis viva which the whole system
has immediately after collision. In the first part of the investigation,
a general formula, derived from the combination of D'Alembert's
principle and that of virtual velocities, is given for the motion of
any material system subject to impact. The requisite geometrical
condition required for the application of this general formula to the
present case is obtained by the assumption, that immediately after
impact the form of the beam is a gradual and tolerably uniform curve,
such as, for example, the elastic curve of equilibrium. In this way
it is determined that about one-half the inertia of the beam is ef
fectively applied at the instant of collision to retard the ball.
   The vis viva of the whole system thus computed is destroyed by
the elastic forces of the beam developed by deflection. These, in
the second part of the problem, are assumed to vary as the amount
of central deflection. By the principle of vis viva a formula is easily
obtained, connecting the amount of total deflection with the vis viva
of the system immediately after collision.
   Tables are given in which the theoretical and experimental results

240           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
are compared. The correspondence is of the closest and most satis
factory nature. Indeed the theoretical result generally differs less
from the mean of several experiments than those experiments differ
among themselves. Both in the theoretical and experimental in
quiries, every possible variation of the elements of the investigation
—the relative masses of the beam and ball—the velocity of the latter
—the rigidity and dimensions of the former—have been included.

                  METEORITE IN NORTH CAROLINA.
ON the authority of a         communication from J. H. Gibbon, Esq.,
       of the Branch Mint of the United States at Charlotte, North
Carolina, we give a condensed view of facts regarding a fall of me
teoric masses in that state, not having room for the less important
details.
   On Wednesday, the 31st of October, 1849, at 3 o'clock P.M.,
several persons in the town of Charlotte were astonished, and not a
few were exceedingly terrified, by a sudden explosion, followed at
short intervals by two other reports, and by a rumbling in the air to
the east and south.
   The sounds were distinct, and continued more than half a minute;
they were imputed by some to thunder; but there were no clouds,
the evening was calm and mild like the Indian summer, and only a
mist was seen in the eastern horizon; nor were the impressions of
 others better founded, that the explosions were due to the blasting
of rocks on a railroad: but sheriff Alexander having once before
witnessed the explosion of a meteor, justly traced the detonation to
that cause.
   The negroes, who are very acute observers of sounds in the open
air, denied the thunder, and an old fisherman said that the reports
were like those of three pieces of heavy artillery followed by the
base-drum.      Horses both in harness and under the saddle started
 with alarm.
    Inquiry began to be made for fallen stones, and on Monday a
 servant of the Mint brought in a report from the county of Cabaras,
 twenty-five miles distant, that there were notices stuck up on the
 trees, inviting people to come and see “a wonderful rock that had
 fallen from the skies on the plantation of Mr. Hiram Post.”
    Mr. Gibbon of the Mint, with Dr. Andrews, travelled twenty-one
 miles, and partly at night by torch-light, to see “the large mass of
 metallic rock.” They found placed in a conspicuous position upon a
 barrel elevated upon a post”, “a bluish gritty rock,” of irregular
 form, eight inches long, six broad and four thick, bearing marks in
 spots, of recent fracture, but otherwise black as if it had been exposed
    * With laudable liberality and caution joined, the worthy proprietor of
 the boom which had fallen on his land—had annexed a written notice
“Gentlemen, sirs—please not to break this rock, which fell from the skies,
 and weighs 194 pounds.—HIRAM PosT.”

to heat and smoke, the black colour being relieved where the crust
had been broken, and a little of the clayey soil in which it was buried
in its descent still adhered to it.   It had the curved indentations
usual in meteorites, as if it had been soft and had yielded to impres
sions; and lustrous metallic points appeared through the ground co
lour, which had generally a bluish slaty appearance, but no such
rock was known in the neighbourhood. Mr. Post took the travellers
by torch-light to see the place where the mass fell. He was at the
time in company with a young man on horseback; they heard over
head a whizzing sound; the whole atmosphere appeared to be in
commotion; they compared the sound to that of chain shot, or of
platoon firing. Nothing was visible; but their attention being di
rected by the sound towards a large pine-tree east of them, they
heard the stone strike “with a dull, heavy jar of the ground,” while
the dog, in terror, crouched at his master's feet.
   Mr. Post (in his peculiar language) had sighted the sound, and
his negro man ploughing in a field had done the same from a dif
ferent direction, and by ranging with the aid of these intersecting
lines, they the next morning found the stone, which had splintered
a pine log lying on the ground; by sounding with a sharp stick in
the hole made by the stone in its fall, they soon found it, and extri
cated it from its hiding-place, which was ten inches below the sur
face; the dried leaves which had been “driven about by the per
cussion,” aided in discovering the spot, about three hundred yards
from the place where Mr. Post had stood at the moment of the fall,
which was in the woods, but there were no marks on the trees,
although the impression was that numerous small bodies had fallen,
“making a noise like hot rocks thrown into the water.”
   Mr. Gibbon and his companion viewed the place both by torch and
daylight, and were convinced of the accuracy of the statement.
   The people of the vicinity imagined that a rock had been thrown
up from a volcano or from blasting, or had come from the moon, and
were not easily persuaded that it could be formed in the atmosphere.
   As is usual in cases of extraordinary celestial phaenomena, some
were terrified by the supposed approach of the day of judgement, or
of war, or some other dire calamity; and a militia colonel, in a spirit
quite professional, said that “there must be war in heaven, for they
were throwing rocks.”
   At the request of Dr. Andrews, the stone was diverted from another
destination, in favour of Prof. Charles U. Shepard, of the Medical
College of South Carolina at Charleston, from whom we learn that
at a recent date the specimen had not yet reached him.
   In due time we shall have the result of his scientific examination;
but from the circumstances we have no hesitation in admitting this
case as genuine: the facts are perfectly familiar to hundreds on re
cord, and in many particulars are in accordance with the remarkable
event of this nature which happened in Weston, Connecticut, in
December, 1807, and with which the senior editor of this Journal,
with his college colleague, Prof. Kingsley, was at the time familiar.
There is no room to discuss theories, but we feel fully assured that

aérolites are not formed in our atmosphere, are not projected from
terrestrial or lunar volcanoes, but have a foreign origin, giving us the
only reports of the physical constitution of other worlds which have
ever reached our earth.
    By an additional communication from J. H. Gibbon, Esq., dated
 November 29, 1849, it is rendered probable that “luminous mate
rials were seen advancing from several points in the atmosphere
towards a common centre, where a solid mass of heated metal (ma
terials) exploded and was violently projected in different directions
 to the earth.”
    It is stated also that there was a distinct appearance of a single
 fiery elongated body, like iron raised to a white heat, sparkling
in its passage from west to east, rising like a rocket but not verti
cally, and passing through the air with a long white streak or tail
following a denser body in the form of a ball of fire".
    Still it is to be observed, that neither the fire-ball nor any light was
seen by many who heard the successive reports and the fall of the
stones, and the rumbling “like loaded wagons jolting down a rocky
hillf;” but this is no way extraordinary, as it was daytime, with a
clear sky, and those only would see the fire-ball who were looking in
the proper direction at the time “when it was in its most ardent
state.” At the explosion, the meteor was about 45° high.
    The estimation of time between the disappearance of the light and
the arrival of the sound was very different, as made by different per
sons, at several minutes, even as high as five. The latter supposition
would make the meteor almost extra-atmospheric, but doubtless the
period of five minutes is much too high, and we infer that the meteor,
like that at Weston, was fully within the atmosphere, and probably
not over fifteen or twenty miles from the earth when it exploded. It
was seen through 250 miles from the line of Virginia, to Sumpter
district in South Carolina, and from east to west it was seen through
sixty miles.—Silliman's Journal, January 1850.

   The gold the past season has turned out much better than was
expected. Many rich deposits in all parts of the mines have been
opened. On the middle fork of the Rio de los Americanos, two men
recently dug & 28,000 in two months. I saw a portion of it in
lumps of the size of hen's eggs, and larger. The Mariposa has
yielded several similar prizes, and so has the Mokelemnes. But for
these few fortunate diggers, there are thousands who scarce earn
a dollar a day. From the best information I can get, industrious
workers have not averaged more than eight or ten dollars a day—
some estimate it much lower; multitudes do not pay expenses, par
ticularly clerks, professional men, and others unaccustomed to hard
work.
   The gold has at last been discovered in place—in veins penetrating
quartz beds—on the Mokelemnes, and in the vicinity of the Mari
posa and one or two other places.     I have this from gentlemen who
have seen the veins, and who are reliable witnesses.      These veins
are of course not worked yet, as it is more profitable to dig the wash
gold.    One of these veins has been “denounced” (as it is termed)
under the Mexican laws, by Mr. Fremont. The working of the
innumerable rich veins, which undoubtedly will be opened in the
mountains, will constitute an immense and profitable mining business
for centuries. I have no fear that the gold, as many imagine, will
all be dug out in a year or two.—Silliman's Journal, January 1850.
            ON THE OIL OF ELEMI.        BY M. H. DEVILLE,
   The author states that M. de Bonastre subjected the resin of elemi
to distillation with water and obtained an oily principle, respecting
which he merely stated that it had been produced.
   Some time since Mr. Stenhouse published a series of experiments
on the oils of olibanum and elemi.
   There are several varieties of elemi which differ from each other
in consistence and the quantity of ligneous matter accidentally and
intimately intermixed. This resin is sometimes as soft as thick
honey, and at other times solid and hard, according to the degree of
alteration which it has undergone by exposure to the air. It will
therefore be readily conceived that the quantities of oil of elemipro
duced by distilling the resin may vary, as proved by the numbers of
Mr. Stenhouse, M. De Bonastre and the author's, very considerably.
Some specimens of elemi of good quality yielded M. Deville more
than 13 per cent. of oil.

 oil is a colourless liquid of great limpidity and fluidity, and a pleasant
 odour; its density at about 52°F. is 0.849; its mean index of re
 fraction is 1:4719 at 56°; that is to say, it is the same as that of oil
 of turpentine and the greater number of its isomeric compounds. Its
 rotary power is 90°30, it is consequently one of the substances
 which turns most strongly to the left.
    Its boiling-point is remarkably fixed (which, the author remarks,
 all essential oils do not possess), and is about 345° F. under a pres
 sure of 755 millimetres.           M. Deville found the oil of elemi, like Mr.
 Stenhouse, to be similarly composed with the oil of turpentine,
 lemons, &c. :

and the other liquid. Both have the same composition, and are iso

   The quantity of hydrochloric acid absorbed by oil of elemi is con
siderable, amounting to 47.7 per cent. of the weight of the oil; and
in order to obtain the crystallized camphor, the current of gas must
be continued long after the period at which the saturation appears
to be complete. The matter is then liquid, but the solid camphor
is readily deposited after the excess of acid has escaped by exposure
to the air. The rotation of this camphor is nil, like that of its isomer,
camphor of lemons.—Ann, de Ch. et de Phys., Septembre 1849.

     ACTION OF NITRIC ACID ON R HUBARB.                    B.Y. M. GA ROT.
   It results from the author's experiments, that when one part of
rhubarb is treated with four parts of nitric acid, there remains
a peculiar substance unacted upon by the acid, amounting to 8 or
10 per cent. in indigenous rhubarb, and 15 to 20 per cent. in foreign.
   This matter, to which it is proposed to give the name of erythrosin,
is yellow when obtained from indigenous rhubarb, and orange

coloured from foreign rhubarb. It is totally soluble in alcohol and
aether, which by evaporation leave rhabarbaric or erythrosic acid.
forming with the alkalies red or purple compounds applicable to the
arts and to pharmacy. After drying, it has the appearance of ag
glomerated powder of rhubarb; when beaten in a mortar, the par
ticles flatten and acquire a strong shining appearance. This substance
is perfectly tasteless, the odour slightly aromatic and nitrous, pro
bably owing to the presence of a little nitric acid, which repeated
washings are incapable of separating.
   When heated in a glass tube, abundant yellow vapours of rha
barbaric acid are produced, which soon condense into a yellowish
film in the tube, leaving a white residue of lime, which is stronger
in foreign erythrosin than in indigenous.
   Water has but little action on erythrosin; it becomes merely
slightly yellow; but if it be heated to ebullition, it acquires a reddish
amber tint, and becomes slightly acid. This acidity appears to be
owing to a small quantity of nitric acid, unremoved by repeated
washings; for it cannot be attributed to rhabarbaric acid, the quan
tity of which is very small. When evaporated to a certain extent,
the liquor deposits gelatinous matter, which has all the characters of
pectin.                                                             -
   When cold, alcohol acts but slightly on erythrosin, acquiring
merely an amber tint; but if it be boiled, the colour deepens and
acquires the reddish tint of Malaga wine. It requires seven or eight
times boiling to deprive erythrosin of all soluble matter. The first
and last washings redden litmus paper.
   As evaporation proceeds, alcohol deposits yellowish flocculi, pel
licles of a crystalline appearance forming on the surface: but cry
stals do not form on cooling; a dry product can be obtained only
by evaporation to dryness. This so obtained has the form of gra
nular pulverulent matter, of a brownish yellow colour, and somewhat
resembling Spanish snuff in appearance: its smell is slightly aro
matic; its taste rather acid and mucilaginous, but not at all like that
of rhubarb.
   This matter, when repeatedly treated with aether and heated,
totally dissolves; by evaporation a sulphur-coloured granular sub
stance is obtained, which has a slightly aromatic odour, and the
surface of which, by exposure to the air, acquires an orange tint: it
possesses all the physical and the principal chemical characters attri
buted to rhabarbaric acid by Brandes, and to rhabarbarin by Geiger.
   Indigenous and foreign rhubarb yielded perfectly similar products,
excepting that indigenous rhubarb gave most. Of two samples tried,
the foreign gave 60 per cent. and the indigenous 85 per cent. of
erythrosin; but this did not occur in all cases.
   When a gramme of erythrosin is added to half a gramme of pot
ash dissolved in fifteen grammes of water, the liquor soon becomes
of a reddish purple colour, which is more or less intense according
to the kind of rhubarb employed; some days are required to com
plete the operation. Its colouring power is so great, that one
gramme of erythrosin is sufficient to impart a more brilliant colour

power, then Chinese, and lastly indigenous rhubarb; but the last
 mentioned affords the most brilliant colour as a dye.—Journ. de

                          BY M. C. ZWENGER.
    Cholestrine is readily decomposed by concentrated phosphoric acid.
The products of this decomposition, like those obtained by the action
of sulphuric acid, are solid and well-defined carburetted hydrogens;
but by their physical properties they are clearly distinguished from
those obtained with sulphuric acid.
    When one part of cholestrine is treated with six or eight parts of
concentrated phosphoricacid, and the mixture is evaporated till its tem
perature reaches 278°F., the fusing point of cholestrine, this substance
is completely decomposed. On the cooling of the fused mass, which
must not have its temperature increased, a matter is obtained which
has lost all crystalline appearance, and contains two carburetted
hydrogens, cholesteron and cholestearon; these two carburets are
separated by boiling alcohol, which dissolves the cholesteron. After
purification by repeated crystallizations from absolute alcohol, this
substance is obtained in brilliant rhombic prisms which fuse at 154°F.
At a higher temperature the cholesteron boils, and may be distilled
almost unaltered. It burns with a sooty flame; nitric acid oxidizes
it, and sulphuric acid renders it of a red colour. It is insoluble in
water, slightly soluble in cold alcohol, more soluble in it when con
centrated and boiling, and very soluble in aether.           Its mean compo
sition is—

   Cholestearon is obtained in boiling the residue which has been ex
hausted by alcohol in aether. By cooling and evaporation of the
aethereal solution, the new carburetted hydrogen is deposited in the
form of a crystalline mass, which is readily purified by repeated so
lution in aether.
   Cholestearon crystallizes from its aethereal solution in white silky
needles, forming an interwoven mass. It dissolves with difficulty
in aether, very slightly in alcohol, and not at all in water. Its proper
solvents are the fixed oils. It fuses at about 347°F. At a higher
temperature it distils, undergoing alteration. It burns with a sooty

It is consequently isomeric with cholesteron.—Journ. de Pharm. et

XXXII. Additional Observations on the Meteor of February 11,
   1850, and Deduction of the Results from all the Observations.
   By JAMES GLAISHER, Esq., F.R.S., F.R.A.S., and of the
   Royal Observatory, Greenwich.*
IN my previous paper upon the meteor of February 11,
      1850, I gave all the accounts I had then received upon
it. Since that time I have been favoured with many more on
the same subject; and several gentlemen have been kind
enough to revisit their places of observation, and to take such
measures as to confirm the accuracy of their first accounts or
to correct them.    I have thus been enabled to form a better
judgement of the path, &c. of the meteor. I shall first give
the results of my inquiries: it will be found that some are
contradictory, but I have been fearful to omit them, as by so
doing I might pass over facts which may become valuable.
   The numbering of the accounts are in continuation of those
in the preceding paper.
   XXIV. Penzance, Cornwall. George Davies, Esq., Com
mander R.N., Coast Guard Service,        £         me with the
following:
   “Being out on duty, and about half-way between this place
and St. Ives, my attention was arrested by the meteor, and
the exclamation of the mounted guard who accompanied me
of ‘Good God! what’s that?” The night being here some
what misty, the meteor did not present that definite rocket
like appearance described by others, but of an immense glo
bular expansion of flame seen at a great altitude in the north,
and taking its course from N.W. to S.W., dissolving with a
momentary increased brilliancy. No report was heard. It was
visible from 15s to 20s, and the time was about 11" 45" P.M.”
                  * Communicated by the Author.
   Phil. Mag. S. 3. Vol. 36. No. 243. April 1850.        S

250       Mr. J. Glaisher's additional Observations on
   I requested Commander Davies to measure the altitude,
and he sent me the following letter:—
    XXV. “I think if I were to say anything as to the altitude
of the meteor in degrees from the horizon, I might only in
correctly disturb your calculations, as I was in fact at its ap
pearance in a sort of brown study, and aroused from it by
the ejaculation of my mounted guard, more alive to the bril
liant effect than observant of the object itself: what I said as
to its great altitude would have been more correctly rendered
by “great distance, inferred mostly from the absence of any
heard report here. I wrote in haste (as I was so far behind
hand), merely to let you know that it was at all seen so far
west, and think that mere fact will lead you to deductions
more correct than any real data I can give. I have no copy
of what I wrote, but think you will find that I said from S.E.
to N.W. as its direction; and that was my impression, for
we were facing very nearly north, and the mounted guard
says that it was from ‘rather the back of his right shoulder to
the front of his left; though, as I said before, you will do
better to consider our observations as simply confined to its
intense illuminative effect at this extreme west point.”
    XXVI. From a Lady at East Budleigh, a private commu
nication to myself.
    “I reside within two or three miles of Budleigh Salterton,
a small watering-place close to the sea, between Sidmouth and
Exmouth. Having heard that the meteor had been seen at
Budleigh Salterton, I have been anxious to obtain information
about it; and yesterday I saw a sailor belonging to the Coast
Guard who, I heard, had seen it.       I found out this man, and
requested him to describe the appearance of the phaenomenon.
 He said he was on duty on the evening of the 11th of Fe
bruary, and about half-past ten o’clock he suddenly observed
a brilliant light, which made every object as clear as the day
 light; he turned round to see from whence this proceeded,
 and saw passing on through the sky a bar of light, bright and
 red, from whence quantities of sparks issued from each side
 and behind: it appeared about a yard in length, and narrow.
 There was some cloud between him and the meteor, yet he
 saw it most distinctly for a second: he believes it passed not
 smoothly, but as if impelled with a sort of jerking movement,
 he said such as a steam-carriage has; its progress was towards
 the east in a downward slanting direction; a hill concealed
 its further progress. He soon met another sailor of the Coast
 Guard from Exmouth. They immediately talked of what they
 had just seen, agreeing, that although having been very many
 years at sea, they had never seen anything like it. The Ex

                  the Meteor of February 11, 1850.                     251
mouth man said he saw it when it burst from the sky first. I
saw also the father of a young man in Budleigh who saw the
meteor, and described it as a bar of light, emitting sparks
about a yard long. This young man was in bed, and seeing
suddenly a brilliant light, looked out of window and saw what
occasioned it.”
    XXVII. Yeovil, Somersetshire.               Second communication
from J. Hannane, Esq.
    “I find, on further examination, that I have made a great
error in representing the altitude of the meteor as 60 degrees,
for I find, by testing the point by a theodolite, that the alti
tude of its first appearance was 36 degrees only, and it was
8 or 9 degrees west of north. I was looking towards the north
at the time, being I believe endeavouring to find the polar
star. How I came to reckon the angle at 60 degrees, was
from having always assumed the ridge of the house over
which it appeared, which is 41 feet high, as presenting
that angle where I was standing, being a distance of 76
feet, which of course was an error.                 The course of the
meteor was left to right. I lost sight of it finally behind a
chimney, and then it was at the altitude of 22 degrees, and
east of north 35 degrees". These have been taken by the in
Strument.
    “Since   £               above, I have taken the bearings by
compass only with a neighbour, who also saw it in another
part of the town; the elevation is much the same as I
noted, but its point of disappearance also behind houses gives
20 degrees east of north. The meteor must have travelled
considerably east of north, or I could not have seen its re
flected light from the roof of a house near, unless it was from
 the atmosphere itself reflecting it.
     “The great distance it travelled will perhaps account for
 its gradually increasing in size, as, if it originated over the
 Bristol Channel, it would have come nearer to this part of the
 kingdom. No explosion was heard in the neighbourhood.”
    XXVIII. Langport, Somersetshire. Second communica
 tion from William Bond Paul, Esq.
     “In accordance with the desire you expressed in your
 letter of 26th ult, I have visited the spot from which I saw
 the meteor of the night of February 11, and have taken the
 altitude and azimuth of the supposed place at which I first
 observed it, and that at which it disappeared.
     “The observations are as follows, viz.:
    * The variation of the compass at Yeovil is 23°20' nearly; therefore the
azimuth was 11° 40' E. of N.
                                    S 2

252       Mr. J. Glaisher's additional Observations on
   “Altitude of point where first seen was 56 degrees", and
its azimuth was N.N.E.
   “Altitude of point where last seen was 10 degrees, and its
azimuth was N.E.
   “I should state that I think the meteor must have pro
ceeded some way on its course before I noticed it; for, if I
recollect rightly, it was issuing from behind a dark cloud
when I first saw it.                                           -
   “The direction in which I was travelling was N.W.
   “I much regret that I cannot vouch for the correctness of
my observations, as they have been made entirely from me
mory, for unfortunately I did not note at the time any fixed
object. I trust however that they may be of some little ser
vice to you.
   “I did not hear the report occasioned by its explosion.
    “A lady, a relation of mine, informs me that she was going
from Cardiff towards St. Nicholas in Glamorganshire, when
her attention was attracted by the meteor; but to be enabled
to see it, she was obliged to turn herself half round, as it was
behind her, and apparently in the direction of Llandaff. I
therefore conclude it must have originated north of Cardiff
at least. She states that it appeared to her to exhibit a variety
 of beautiful and brilliant colours.”
    XXIX. Bristol. Favoured by Robert Boyd, Esq., M.D.
    “Happening to be walking home on Monday last about
 half-past ten o’clock P.M., I suddenly observed a bright blaze
 of light, which illuminated the whole atmosphere. On look
 ing instantly round to ascertain its cause, I saw falling in a
 north-easterly direction, at an angle of about 10 degrees from
 the perpendicular, what was apparently a ball of fire having a
 bright luminous tail covering a space of about 15 degrees. It
 disappeared behind the New Villas opposite Vyvian Terrace.
 Though I heard no explosion or passing sound, I am much
 inclined to think it was an aérolite, from its apparent proxi
 mity and its great illuminating power, and not one of those
 luminous meteors termed falling stars, which are so often seen
 in the month of November.”
    XXX. Bristol. Second communication from Dr. Boyd.
    “I went to the spot where I observed the meteor with a
 mariner's compass, and found that the part where I first ob
 served the meteor bore N.E. by N.T, and the point where it
 disappeared behind the houses opposite Vyvian Terrace bore
 N.E. by Et, thus making two points of the compass through
   * This altitude is much too great.
   + The variation of the compass at Bristol is about 23° 25'; hence the

                  the Meteor of February 11, 1850.                     253
which the meteor passed. As regards the altitude, I took a
carpenter's square rule, to which I attached a plumb-line and
a pair of compasses, the leg of which was fixed along the level
of the upper horizontal line of the square, and found that the
point where the meteor first appeared, according to my recol
lection, was at an angle from the horizontal line about 40
degrees; the point where it disappeared behind the houses
bore an angle of 5 degrees” above the horizontal line; thus the
space through which the meteor passed my eye was 35 de
grees. From where I stood to the back of the houses where
I lost sight of it was about 250 yards, and the height of the
top of the houses above where I stood was about 35 feet.
   “I have inquired of different parties, but have learnt no
thing except from Mr. Leach, proprietor of the Bristol Times
newspaper, whom I accidentally saw in his office when calling
there. He told me that when going home along St James's
Place, Kingsdown, Bristol, a retired quiet street running by
the map due north-east, he saw the meteor suddenly appear
over the houses on the east side, as if rising, and then disap
pear behind the houses on the other side of the street.
    “The meteor seemed to cross the street obliquely, and just
as it was disappearing it burst into many small luminous
bodies, then into again smaller, which again burst into others.
He (though the spot was perfectly quiet and retired) did not
hear any noise of explosion. He told me, however, that a
person residing at Brislington, three miles east of Bristol on
 the Bath road, told him he heard a slight sound. I was
 anxious to get from Mr. Leach further particulars, as they
seemed to me most important; but the above were all I could
collect. The meteor certainly passed to the north of Bristol.”
   XXXI. Reading, favoured by the Rev. Charles Joseph
Goodhart.
    “I was coming down Castle Hill in this town, and the
meteor burst upon me all at once on the opposite side of the
way, so that I was able to measure its path by the houses
opposite. This, as nearly as I can tell, subtended an angle
of about 35 degrees, and I should think at an altitude from 25°
to 30°. Its length I should have guessed at about 1° 30', but
azimuth of the meteor at the time of its first appearance was about 10°
E. of N., and at its last appearance about 33° E. of N. The difference
between these values is one point, and not two, as mentioned above. I
fear the values are not correct.
   * This altitude is certainly incorrect. With the azimuth of 10° E. of
N., the line of direction of the meteor is cut nearly over Kidderminster.
From the given altitude of 40°, its distance from the earth at this time
would be fifty-eight miles, which from other observations is too great.

254.        Mr. J. Glaisher's additional Observations on
in this I may not be accurate. Its breadth struck me as
about that of Venus at her greatest brilliancy, so that it ap
peared as a line of light such as would arise from the length
ening of that planet to the same extent. Its head might be a
little larger, but not much; its colour was a dull red. When
it burst I felt sure that the fragments described parabolic
curves, and I did not notice that any one of these returned
upon its path. Its path was perfectly straight, and slightly
inclined to the horizon.
    “It appeared as I stood as nearly as possible to the N.W.,
 and its apparent motion was from S.W to S.E. I did not
 test its light by anything, but it quite startled me. I should
not have said its continuance exceeded 4 seconds.                 I think it
 was hardly as much.”                                                     -
    At my request Mr. Goodhart again went to the spot, and
 took the altitudes and azimuths of the points to the best of his
 recollection. The following is the additional information :
    XXXII. Second communication from the Rev. C. J. Good
 hart.
     “I am sorry I did not take more pains to certify my state
 ments before I sent them to you. I have now done so; but
 the distance of time renders me unable to give you the certain
 information I could wish, though the observations I have
 made today are, I believe, approximate to the truth. The
 measurements I have made may be thoroughly depended
 upon, but the precise spots I can only state within limits. I
 am not sure to within two or three paces of my own position
 on the hill, and the limits therefore at the first point of sight,
 and at the point of explosion, are for the former 28° to 35°*
 west of the north point, and for the latter 2° to 10°* east of it.
     “These measurements were obtained by the comparison
  of two compasses with the meridian line. The altitude of the
  former point (where first seen) was not greater than 26°; this
  I think I am sure of; it might not be more than 23° or 24°;
 and the altitude of the point of explosion I place at 16°, or
 perhaps a little higher, but not I believe lower.
     “These I have obtained by measuring the angles between
 the lines of sight and a plumb-line.”
     XXXIII. Euston Square, London. Third communica
  tion from G. F. Burder, Esq.
     “There is one point, however, in which I think it worth
    * The variation of the compass at Reading is about 22° 50'. I do not
  know the value used in deducing the above values, but they do not seem
  to be right; we may conclude, however, that at its first appearance it was
  situated at an angle of about 39° west of the place of explosion.

                  the Meteor of February 11, 1850.                    255
while to say another word, inasmuch as the accidental cir
cumstances of my position rendered this particular point a
matter of absolute certainty. At the time of the occur
rence of the meteor the pole-star formed so ready a standard
of comparison, that any great error in estimating its position
in azimuth would have been impossible; indeed I may say
that I am confident it passed the north line".”
    XXXIV. Enstone, Oxon. Second communication, in a
letter to the Astronomer Royal, from the Rev. J. Jordan.
    “In the case of the young man referred to in my former
letter, I have obtained, and subjoin for you, the measures sent
with this, and which I took by first placing a long pole to
the point of the heavens you indicated, fixing that, and then
by means of a carpenter's level with plumb-line attached to
it, taking the measure of the lines forming the right anglef.
This observation was made at Church Enstone, in the county
of Oxford. The following observations I have made today
at Little Tew, a village just two miles north of this place—
Enstone. My informant is a very intelligent young farmer,
named Mr. J. Kimber; and his account is exceedingly good
and accurate. He relates that on the night in question he
was riding slowly home, and having lately attended some lec
tures on astronomy at Chipping Norton, the sky being at the
time brilliant with stars, he was looking up and admiring them,
and reflecting on parts of the lecture, when suddenly he saw
what seemed to him at first a star of the smallest magnitude
fall from the sky and descend rapidly, as if it were about to
come down upon himself, when suddenly it turned off at an
angle, took a horizontal course, exploded into about eight or
 ten bright globules, and disappeared. Its appearance was
grand and brilliant in the extreme, delineating its path in the
 heavens distinctly by a long trail of light, and illuminating the
whole scene so as to enable him distinctly to observe and note
in his mind its whole course. I accompanied him to the spot
 where he witnessed all this, and in a manner precisely similar
to that described above, I took measures of the altitudes of
 three points; that when it was first seen, that when its path
 seemed to become horizontal, and lastly at its explosioni.”
   * The meteor does not seem to have reached the meridian of London
from all the other accounts.
   + From these measures the altitude at explosion was 45°.
    # From these measures the altitude on its first appearance was 62° 17',
and both the other altitudes were 45°.
   These altitudes are all too great; they make the meteor when first seen
 at a distance from the earth exceeding 100 miles, and at the point of ex
plosion at about 60 miles.

256       Mr. J. Glaisher's additional Observations on
   XXXV. Padbury, Buckinghamshire, as copied from the
 Times of February 14.
   “At a quarter before 11 o'clock last night I first observed
the meteor coming from the north-west; it did not appear at
this time much larger than falling stars usually are; but it
continued its course, every moment increasing in brightness,
exhibiting a tail of a blue colour and which was remarkably
vivid, until it had reached the east, when it exploded into
thousands of brilliant coruscations and disappeared. After
an interval of about 90 seconds it was followed by a loud clap
of thunder, of a very peculiar crackling nature, of long dura
tion, which passed off into the north-east.”
   XXXVI. Deddington. Miss Ellen B. Faulkner favoured
me with the following communication:
   “As I was fortunate enough to be an observer of the splen
did meteor seen on Monday night, Feb. 11th, at a quarter be
fore 11 o'clock, and believing that some account of it would
prove interesting to those who did not witness the phaenomenon
at this place, I send you the following account; but as the
garden in which I was standing at the time I saw it was a
small one, and surrounded by high walls, I was unable to see
its close, although I distinctly saw the commencement of it, as
my face was directed to that part of the heavens in which it
first appeared, which was W.S.W., and it fell E.N.E. The
appearance it first assumed was that of a luminous body much
larger than the planet Jupiter, and it rapidly increased in size
and brightness as it approached nearer to the earth, leaving be
hind it as it passed through the heavens a brilliant trail of light.
The form of it when descending was conical, the narrow end
throwing out several streaks of extreme brilliancy; as it ap
proached the north it made a wavy motion similar to that of
a snake.
   “When I first observed it the colour was yellow, but just
before it began to descend it became blue, and emitted a light
so great that the smallest object was discernible. As it dis
appeared from my sight, the broader end was I believe larger
than the moon’s disc.    The whole time the meteor lasted was
about 40 seconds, and four or five minutes after, while stand
ing in the same position, I heard a report something like that
of a cannon when at a great distance. I believe the sound
came from the northern part of the heavens. Persons who
heard the report at Banbury, a town six miles from Ded
dington, describe it to have been as loud as thunder when at
no great distance. At the time the meteor appeared the stars
shone very brilliantly, and the evening was particularly clear,
but the whole of the day had been wet and stormy.”

    XXXVII. Deddington.               Miss Faulkner's second com
munication.
    “It is with mixed pleasure and hesitation I comply with
your request concerning the altitude and azimuth of the me
teor. My surprise was so great at its first appearance, that
I am unable to give so correct an account as I could wish, as
I did not mark its path till now, and have therefore done it
from recollection; had I noticed it directly after I saw it, I
should feel more sure that it would be correct, but I think
from the position of the buildings it may be depended on.
    “The place on which I stood was unfavourable for seein
its close, a high wall being on the eastern side of me; ''
think, from the time it kept in my sight, that the explosion
of the meteor must have taken place immediately after it dis
appeared from view.
    “The noise of the report was very like that produced by
the rolling of barrels along the pavement; this idea occurred
to several others, who described it to me in a similar manner,
particularly at Worton, three miles west of Deddington, where
the clergyman of that place informed me it shook his house.
    “A person who happened to be on Edge Hill, said that the
light emitted was so strong, that it enabled him to see the
sheep in the fields most distinctly for a great distance round.
    “The azimuth of the meteor on its first appearance was
68° W. of N., and when I lost sight of it was 82° E. of N.”
    XXXVIII. Bedford. Through the kindness of S. C.
Whitbread, Esq., Henry John Dodwell, Esq., sent me the fol
lowing:
    “With regard to the elevation of the meteor of Feb. 11,
I should think its altitude was 60° when I first saw it.                  I
have taken the bearings of the road accurately by compass,
and find that the meteor passed from N.N.W. to S.S.Et. I
   * At my request Miss Faulkner had the distances measured from her eye
(as she stood when she saw the meteor) to the parts of the walls over
which she saw it appear and disappear, and the heights at the top
of the walls above these parts. These distances are, from her eye to the
western wall, 25.5 feet, and to the eastern wall 6 feet; the height of the
top of the former wall above this horizontal line was 13.75 feet, and of
the latter was 3.65 feet. Hence the altitude of the top of the wall, over
which point she first saw the meteor, was 28° 20', and therefore the height
of the meteor when first seen must have exceeded fifty miles considerably.
The altitude of the point on the wall behind which the meteor descended
was 31° 19'; hence the height of the meteor at this time was less than
thirty miles.
   f The variation of the compass at Bedford is 22°52'; hence the azimuth
of meteor when first seen was 453° W. of N., and when last seen was 453°
E. of S. At the time of sending this to press, I have not received any
answer to my request, to have accurate measures taken.

258        Mr. J. Glaisher's additional Observations on
 can have no doubt as to the place it occupied when I saw it,
 as the point is determined by the space between two particu
 lar houses.    The noise that I heard afterwards was within, I
 should certainly say, one minute after the explosion. Mr.
 Whitbread, with great reason, suspects that I was not in a fit
 state to determine this; but I was not really alarmed till I
 heard the report, which was very loud and continued, and
 which was the chief cause of terror, happening with the most
 brilliant starlight. I however was collected enough to observe
 my watch, and I was in a hurry to reach home. The distance
 I walked between the explosion and the first rumbling of the
 report was about 80 to 100 yards. I usually walk at the rate
 of four miles an hour, and according to this calculation the
 meteor when it exploded was about thirteen miles from me.”
    XXXIX. Rugby. Second communication from the Rev.
 H. Highton.
    “The account which I gave you before of the meteor of
 Feb. 11th, was obtained by taking down the accounts of such
persons who in different parts of the town were walking at
that time, and afterwards going myself and stepping the di
 stances, which were accurately given me, together with an
 estimate of the pace they were walking at.
    “Since that, however, I have gone over the ground in
company with each, making them point out as nearly as pos
sible the points at which the meteor appeared to them to
be. This more careful process leads to the following material
alterations from my former account:
    “1. Though they told me that it passed straight over head,
yet I find that was not the case, but that it passed from W.
to E. at an angle of about 20° below the zenith, or 70° above
the southern horizon.
    “2. The time during which the light lasted was at least
 50 seconds. The person who told me that he kept walk
ing fast without stopping, through a space taking only 20 se
conds to walk, must have been mistaken, and stopped on his
way unconsciously to look at it. The duration, measured by
the space walked over by the other person, was at least
 50 seconds, and might have been 70 seconds.
    “3. The point of the explosion was nearly due S.E.”
(reckoning the magnetic and not the true meridian), and at an
angle of about 20° from the horizon; so that it must have
been at a very considerable distance from Rugby. This was
what the narrator had called at first ‘a few yards.’
  * The variation of the compass at Rugby is 23° 15'; therefore the
azimuth was 68° 15' E, of S.                       -

                the Meteor of February 11, 1850.              259
   “4. The distance of time between the explosion and the
detonation was at least 90 seconds, and probably between 90
seconds and 100 seconds.
   “This may be considered as accurately ascertained. I
have taken so great pains in getting the people to walk over
the ground with me and point exactly where each circum
stance took place, that you may consider these statements as
fair approximations to the truth.”
   XL. Rugby. Third communication from the Rev. H.
Highton.
   “You may fully rely on it that the point of explosion was
nearly due magnetic S.E.; the south end of needle standing
at 0°, the reading of the circle where it is cut by the line join
ing the eye; centre of compass and the point of explosion of
meteor is 45° or 135° from the west end of needle.            The
points observed by three observers are so plain and well
defined, that there is no room for more than a few degrees of
error.
    “The duration of light was certainly not less than 50 se
conds; for a young man walking with his mother marked
carefully, and by unmistakeable marks, the points where they
were when the light first appeared, and again where they
were when it exploded. If you were to see the places, you
could perceive that they could not be mistaken; and the space
could not be walked over by them in less than 50 seconds,
though it might have taken more.
    “The time between explosion and detonation is equally
well marked as not less than 90 seconds and probably not
more than 100 seconds.
    “The direction may be more doubtful, but it was probably
in a line running parallel with a line from west to east, at an
 altitude of about 70° above the S.S.W. horizon, as seen up a
 street running N.N.E. and S.S.W. If you come here I will
 show you the points, and you will see there can be no mis
 take about these points, which I tell you are clear.”
    XLI. Prestwood, Stourbridge, as copied from the Times
 of February 14th.
    “Yesterday evening, at about half-past ten o'clock, I was
 observing the peculiar clearness of the atmosphere, the
 weather having rapidly changed from stormy rain, which had
 prevailed throughout the day, to that brilliancy of sky which
 usually betokens, at this season, frost; when suddenly I was
 almost bereft of sight by the appearance of a magnificent me
 teor, which made its appearance in a westerly direction, and
 passing rapidly across the zenith, exploded in the east at

260       Mr. J. Glaisher's additional Observations on
about 15° above the horizon. It was followed by a luminous
tail of extraordinary length and brilliancy, and the disc of its
nucleus appeared to be nearly half the diameter of the moon
when full.    Fire-balls of a bluish colour fell from the tail in
profusion.
    “Some idea may be formed of the intense light cast from
it, when I state that I could discern nothing whatever for
several minutes after; indeed, many families in the neighbour
hood, sitting in well-lighted rooms, where there were apertures
or crevices through the shutters, were alarmed, and went out
completely terrified.                 “G. THoMPsoN, Jun.”
    XLII. Castle Donnington, lat. 52° 51' 23", and long.
1° 18'42" W. of Greenwich.       The Rev. Kirke Swann.
    “At the time the meteor appeared I was in a room with
out any artificial light, my eyes directed to a window not ob
scured by curtains or blinds.
    “The aspect 74° E. of true S. or E.S.E. 6° E. The sky
was quite free from clouds in this aspect.
    “The window was suddenly illuminated by a faint light of
a pale bluish colour. The light became somewhat red, and
rapidly increased to a brightness, which, from many conside
rations, is not over-estimated, if we say it was almost as bright
as daylight when the sun is at the horizon.
    “When the light had continued about 5 seconds (by a
 rough estimation) I drew near to the window. The meteor
 : then entering my field of view at the top of the win
  OW.
    “Its motion in azimuth was too small to be perceived, but
its altitude rapidly diminished; that is, its apparent motion
 was that of vertical descent.
    “Its azimuth was from 35° to 40° E. of S.
    “At the altitude of about 30° it divided into about six
parts, all of small size, but of most intense brightness. These
fell through about 5° of altitude (or rather more), and then
instantly all was darkness.
    “This was about 2 seconds after it entered my view at the
top of the window, which makes the whole duration about
7 seconds by a very rough estimation. No sound was heard
by any one here.”
    XLIII. Castle Donnington. Second communication.
    “A person out of doors informs me that the whole sky was
cloudless; but when the light was over, a bank of black clouds
rose very rapidly from the horizon in N.W. to N.N.W., and
covered the sky in a few minutes after the meteor. The wind
at the time was S.W.

                  the Meteor of February 11, 1850.                       261
   “It is necessary to say how these altitudes and azimuths
are obtained.
    “Placing myself nearly in the position I was in when I saw
the meteor, I took the altitude and azimuth of the place I be
lieve it to have occupied on the windows by instruments.
    “The place of this meteor could not be taken, as is usual
with meteors, by noticing what stars it was near, for its bright
ness obliterated all, even Jupiter. I estimated its position
with respect to a Leonis, Jupiter and a Hydrae, by looking,
directly it was dark again, in the right direction as nearly as
I could; and I have also £ it since by noticing the
sun, moon and Jupiter when they have occupied nearly the
same position on my window.
    “It may be worth while to say what is the extent to which
error in the position is probable.
    “The meteor certainly entered my field of view at the alti
tude 40°, that of the top of the window; and its end was at
the altitude of about 25°. It is quite certain it was more than
20°, and nearly certain that it was not more than 25°.
    “The altitude which is most important is the bursting
point.
    “30°* is the altitude at which the bodies were first per
ceived to be separate; there is little doubt here; the error
could not exceed 3° each way.
    “But as no change was perceived in the motion of the me
 teor at the time of bursting, either in velocity or direction, it
 is probable that it divided 2° or 3° higher than when it was
perceived to consist of about six bodies.
    “These bodies spread very little laterally. They appeared
 to divide, by the apparent motion of some being quicker than
 that of others.
    “There can be little error in saying that no motion in azi
 muth was perceived, for the perpendicular divisions of the
 window would guide the eye.
     “The azimuth is less important than the altitude; this
 is fortunate, since the probability of error in azimuth is greater
 than in altitude; for a little variation in the position of a body
 at 30° elevation makes a great variation in the azimuth, and
 also the certainty of a few inches in the place where I stood,
 affects the azimuth, but not the altitude.            I think however it
 could not be at a greater distance from the true S. than 40°
 or less than 35°.”
    * The accounts from Castle Donnington were received shortly before
 this paper was prepared for the press, and therefore have scarcely influenced
 me in the following discussion of the results. The altitudes seem to be too
 high. I have requested them to be remeasured, but I have not received
 any further information at the time of sending the MSS. away.

262      Mr. J. Glaisher's additional Observations on
   XLIV. Near Chester. The Rev. Henry Linthwaite, B.A.
   “As I was riding home on the night of Monday the 11th,
about a quarter before eleven o'clock, with two friends, our
attention was excited by the instantaneous appearance of a
very bright meteor, which illuminated for a few seconds every
object around us.                     -
   “Its altitude was about 60°, and it appeared to pass through
a distance of 18°, as near as I could judge. Its position was
nearly south, and its direction almost perpendicularly towards
the earth, but slightly inclined eastwards. The colour of the
head resembled that of the moon, but was brighter, and gra
dually deepened into a very beautiful rose-pink. It appeared
to be extinguished or hidden behind a large cloud; no sparks
from it were visible. The time of its path was not less than
4 or 5 seconds. I called on Dr. Moffatt, and communicated
these particulars to him on Tuesday, the day following, and
pointed out to him the exact position in the heavens where
the meteor was visible.”
   This account was sent to me by Dr. Moffatt with his usual
monthly meteorological report, and at my request the follow
ing measures were taken:—
   “We have done our best to ascertain the altitude and
azimuth of the meteor as it was seen by the Rev. Henry
Linthwaite on the 11th of February at 10h 45m P.M. His
memory, with regard to the locality of the meteor, has been
assisted by a recollection of its relative position to certain stars
in Orion, Auriga and Gemini; and as our observations have
been made about a month after the appearance of the meteor,
we did not omit taking into consideration the difference in the
hour (about two hours earlier) of the culminating of these
constellations.
   “Mr. Linthwaite was seated sideways to the object when
he first saw its light, so it must have travelled some distance
before he saw the body; but at the time he first perceived it,
it appears that it was equidistant from the foot of Auriga and
the right arm and club of Orion, from which it pursued a
course towards Gemini, where it was lost from view behind
a large dark cloud which extended from N.E. to N.
   “Its altitude at its first appearance was thus found to be
55° 36'; and when lost behind the cloud it was at an altitude
of 42°54', and azimuth about 18° E, of S.”
   XLV. St. Cuthbert's College, Ushaw, Durham. Com
municated in a letter to R. C. Carrington, Esq., of the Ob
servatory at Durham, from the Rev. John Gillow.
   “I shall be glad to furnish the meagre data that I have
been able to collect respecting the meteor seen here on the

                the Meteor of February 11, 1850.            263
11th inst. It was seen by four of the Professors, viz. the Rev.
Michael Gibson, the Rev. John Gibson, the Rev. Robert
Gradwell, and the Rev. Chas. Gillow. These gentlemen
were at the time entering the gates of the College Lodge in a
closed carriage. The Rev. John Gibson was the first to per
ceive it, and called the attention of the others to “a meteor.’
It was at about a quarter before 11 P.M., was visible about 30
seconds; it left a train of light in its path, and terminated
with an explosion, shooting forth brilliant coloured scintilla
tions of red and purple in the manner of a rocket. This ap
pearance made all conclude that it was a rocket sent up from
Brancepeth.
    “The night was very clear, but as they supposed it was
only a rocket, they took no care to note its position by the
stars. To obtain a rough calculation of its position, I have
requested them separately to direct the telescope of the theo
dolite to the place where, as far as could be recollected, it
seemed to each one.       The Rev. M. Gibson directed it to
5° 17' altitude and 13° 15' azimuth, eastward of the south;
the Rev. R. Gradwell to 5° 20' altitude and 5° 15' azimuth;
and the Rev. John Gibson to 6° 48' altitude, and described
its path as being from 5° 52' azimuth west to 5° 15' azimuth
east, beginning at a lower altitude of about 2°. This gentle
man had the best view and saw it the longest, but it may have
been visible a few seconds before it attracted his notice.
    “It seems to me very remarkable, but all agree in saying
that the scintillations after the explosion seemed to fall. I
am of opinion that imagination must have aided this concep
tion. Its whole appearance was very like that of a rocket,
but of extraordinary brilliancy.”
   These are all the accounts I have received giving informa
tion upon this body, and I now proceed to discuss them, with
the view of determining its distance, path, velocity, &c.
 1. Determination of the spot over which the Meteor was vertical
                     on its first appearance.
   The observations available for this determination are those
of J. Hannane, Esq., at Yeovil; of Miss Faulkner at Ded
dington; and of the Rev. H. Linthwaite at Chester. Of
these observers, the most favourably situated was Mr. Han
nane, who at the time was looking at that part of the sky
where it appeared, searching for the pole-star, and saw the
meteor burst out in a position 8° or 9° W. of N. Miss Faulk
ner was well situated, being in a small garden, and looking at
the time towards that part of the heavens whose azimuth was

 264        Mr. J. Glaisher's additional Observations on
 62° W. of N. Mr. Linthwaite was riding in the direction of
 E. and W., and did not see its first appearance, but its change
 of azimuth at this moment was small, and the interval of time
 was so short, that the estimated azimuth (nearly S.) must
 be near the truth. These lines intersect each other very
 nearly over a spot at about thirteen miles east of Montgomery.
 This meteor, therefore, seems to have been vertical at this
 spot, or nearly so, and to have been first seen there in a state
 of ignition.
            2. Determination of the Path of the Meteor.
    From this spot it proceeded over Shropshire and Warwick
 shire, including the southern boundary of Staffordshire, from
 thence over Northamptonshire to Bedfordshire. In its course
 it passed the zenith of Stourbridge nearly, a little south of
 Coventry, north of Warwick, and south of Northampton,
 Rugby and Bedford.
 3. Determination of the spot over which the Meteor was vertical
                             at its explosion.
    The observations available for this determination are the
 following:-                                       O
             At Brighton its azimuth was 5 W. of N.
             At Greenwich             • * *      19 W. of N.
             At Deddington            • *-       82 E. of N.
             At Rugby                 •-         68 E. of S.
             At Castle Donnington ... 40 E. of S.*
    The intersection of these lines is at a spot very near to
Biggleswade, and I have finally decided that the most pro
bable place over which the meteor was at its explosion is si
tuated at about 1.3 mile from Biggleswade, and bearing 18°
S. of E.
4. Determination of the distance of the Meteor from the earth
                         on its first appearance.
    The data for this determination are the following:—
    At Yeovil its altitude was 36°, as measured by a theodolite.
At Chester its estimated altitude at the time of observation
was 60°, after the lapse of a month it was determined by
measurement to be 55° 36'. The distance from Yeovil is 117
miles, and from Chester is 463 miles.                 Hence, from the
observation at Yeovil, the distance from the earth was 88
   * In account XXII. at Hull it is stated that the meteor exploded about
15° W. of the meridian. As the right ascension of 15 Argus is 8" 1", and
the sidereal time was 8h 9", the star had passed the meridian of Hull when
the observation was made by a few minutes only, therefore its azimuth was
very small.

                   the Meteor of February 11, 1850.                       265
miles; from the Chester observation, with the first estimated
altitude, it was 82 miles, and from the measured altitude it
was 76 miles. I think the observation at Yeovil is entitled to
double the weight of that at Chester, particularly as the latter
observer was riding in the direction of east and west, and
he had to turn his head to see the meteor. The meteor, there
fore, at the time of its first appearance, was at about the di
stance of 84 miles from the earth.
5. Determination of the Distances of the Meteor from the earth
                      at different parts in its path.
    At Chester, the Rev. H. Linthwaite lost sight of the me
teor at a point 18° E. of S., and at an altitude of 42°54'.
    This azimuth intersects the line of direction of the meteor
at a point about 8 miles west of Kidderminster, and at the
distance of 51 miles from Chester.              Hence its distance from
the earth at this time was 48 miles.
    At Yeovil, the observer lost sight of the meteor behind a
 chimney, whose azimuth was 11° 40' E. of N. This azimuth
 intersects the line of direction at a point 7 miles E. by N.
 nearly from Stourbridge, and at a distance of 99 miles from
 Yeovil.     Hence its distance at this time was 42 miles*.
    At Reading, the observer first saw the meteor between 5°
 and 8° W. of N. Assuming that this azimuth met the line of
 direction at a point about 5 miles S.W. of Northampton, at
 the distance of about 533 miles from Reading, with the esti
 mated angle of 26°, its height at this time was 25 miles.
     At Langport, the observer lost sight of the meteor when it
 was at an altitude of 10°, bearing N.E. This azimuth inter
 sects the line of direction about 7 miles W. of Bedford, and
 distant from Langport 111 miles.               Hence the height of the
 meteor at this time was 23 miles.
 6. Determination of the Height of the Meteor at the time of its
                                   explosion.
     The data we have for this determination are the following:
     At Euston Square, distance 40 miles, the altitude measured
 was 23°.
    * At Hampstead Road, in account XII., the observer saw the meteor
 shortly after its commencement, a little above the Pleiades, the altitude
 of which was 32°. Assuming the altitude of the meteor at this time as 33°,
 its distance from the earth was 60 miles.
    At the same place the meteor disappeared near the lower part of the
 constellation of Cassiopoeia, or above an altitude of 25°, and azimuth 36° W.
 of N., hence its height at this time was about 24 miles.
    In account X, Mr. Hind observed the meteor pass from below a Persei
 to a Cassiopoeia. Assuming its altitudes at these times to be 373° and 28%"
 respectively, with azimuths 60°, and 36° W. of N., the heights were 83
 miles and 28 miles respectively.

7. Determination of the height of the parts of the Meteor while
                     luminous after explosion.
    The data we have for this determination are the observa
tions of the Astronomer Royal at Greenwich, and those of the
 Rev. J. Wharton at Brighton.                          -     - -
    At Greenwich, distance 44 miles, the altitude of the bodies
was 14° 53'.                          -       -   -
    At Brighton, distance 88 miles, the altitude of the bodies
was 7°.
    Hence the height of the luminous bodies at this time from
both these observations was 10 miles.
8. Determination of the real size of the Meteor at the time of
                           its explosion.
    I cannot pretend to determine this point with any great
precision, it having been so differently represented by the dif
ferent observers. The data we have for this determination are
the following:
    1st. I shall confine myself to the description of those ob
servers who were    £ within or about 50 miles of the place
of explosion.
   At Hampstead Road it was about four times as large as
Venus.

                  the Meteor of February 11, 1850,               267
     Near Hartwell it was as large as the full moon.
    At Deddington its appearance at first was much larger than
 Jupiter, and when lost sight of its diameter was greater than
 that of the moon.
    2nd. The following descriptions are by observers who were
 situated between 50 and 100 miles of the place of the explo
 Slon :
    At Prestwood its disc appeared to be about one-half the
 size of the moon.
    At Bath, a ball 8 or 9 inches in diameter.
 l  £rmingham, a column           2 feet in width and 20 feet in
  ength.                     -                                  .
    At Carrington, an elongated luminous ball, smaller than
 the moon.
    At Blakeney, Norfolk, it was 20 feet in length.
    At Southampton, a full-sized orange.
    3rd. At places exceeding the distance of 100 miles:—
    At Yeovil, two or three times the size of Mars.
    At Langport, equal to Venus when brightest.
    At Hull, one-half the size of the moon.
    At Sidmouth, a bar of light a yard in length.
    At Bristol, a ball of fire.
    At Penzance, an immense globular expanse of flame.
    There is little doubt that its dazzling brightness has caused
 some deception, and as imagination may have helped to en
 large the object, it perhaps will be better to take the smaller
 estimations generally. It seems, however, that at the distance
 of 50 miles it was compared in apparent size to that of the
full moon; had it been so large, its diameter would have been
 about 2500 feet.                                              *  -
    In the second set of estimations it was compared to a ball
8 or 9 inches in diameter; to a ball smaller than the moon;
 to a disc about one-half the size of the moon; and to a full
 sized orange; and in the third set to one-half the size of the
moon. It is difficult to understand so as to make use of some
of the comparisons; it is exceedingly doubtful to what size
 to refer a ball 8 or 9 inches in diameter; the full moon ap
pears to different persons of different sizes; some will say she
is 6 inches in diameter, and others will say she equals 12 inches.
Let us give some allowance for imagination, and the best re
sult at which I can arrive is, that at about 100 miles distance
the meteor subtended an angle of about 12" of arc, and if
so, its real diameter was about 1800 feet.        Where the ac
counts are so vague, the most moderate calculations are most
likely to be true; I therefore consider the diameter of the
body to have been from 1800 feet to 2000 feet.

268      Mr. J. Glaisher's additional Observations on
       9. On the Report at the explosion of the Meteor.
   At Bromham, near Bedford, the noise of the detonation was
described as a roar, and it was heard by everybody, both by
those who saw the meteor as well as by those who did not.
   At Cardington, near Bedford, Mrs. Whitbread, in a letter
written before hearing of the meteor, says, “that at a quarter
before 11 o'clock she heard a tremendous rushing, rumbling
noise, that all the servants heard it, and some saw a great
glare of light.”
   At Enstone a dreadful explosion was heard by everybody.
At Hartwell there was a report like thunder.
   At Rugby the noise was that like the crash of a falling
building.
   At Deddington the noise was heard as the report of a can
non at a great distance. At Banbury, a report as loud as
thunder.
   The sound at the time of explosion must have been very
great to have been heard at places exceeding 50 miles, and
compared there to loud thunder, &c.
10. On the estimated interval of time between the explosion and
                        hearing the report.
   At Bedford about 1m; at Enstone about 2"; at Hartwell
2" or 3"; at Rugby 90s to 100s; at Bromham 1" to 2"; and
at Deddington 4" to 5". These values are discordant.
       11. On the Brilliancy of the Light of the Meteor.
   The extreme brilliancy of the light is mentioned in every
account, from Penzance to Durham. Usually it was described
as intensely brilliant; and at places near whose zenith it passed,
it was most brilliant. Some persons compared it to strong
sunlight; and even at places where the sky was covered with
black clouds, as at Blakeney, the light was described as being
so brilliant as to fully illuminate every object. Indeed its bril
liancy may be judged from the fact, that the observer at
 Raby Castle (at the distance of 180 miles) at first thought that
some part of the building was on fire.
                 12. On the Colour of the Meteor.
   At Brighton, Uckfield, Langport, Enstone, and at Hull, it
was described as bluish; at Yeovil it was first red like Mars,
then changed to a brilliant white light. At Bath it was first
red and then blue. At Greenwich it was of a strong yellow
colour; and at Lewisham, as observed by Mrs. Glaisher, it
 was of a yellow colour. At Hampstead Road it appeared as

                the Meteor of February 11, 1850.             269
of a dull golden lustre; at Hampstead it was first white, then
yellow, and then pink. At Birmingham it was described as
of the gorgeous colours of the Iris. At Carrington, pink and
white; at Chester, first a pale yellow, or of silvery brightness,
then deepened into a beautiful rose-pink; and at Reading of
a dull red.
   The differences of colour are doubtless attributable to the
circumstances under which the observer has viewed the me
teor: in some cases marshy land or a river has intervened,
and in others the meteor may have been seen from high land
with a clear atmosphere.
            13. The Time of Visibility of the Meteor.
   The observer at Chester lost sight of the meteor in 48 or
5s, it being at this time over a place a few miles west of the
zenith of Kidderminster.     The observer at Yeovil saw it from
its commencement till he lost sight of it when in the zenith of
a place a few miles east of Stourbridge, after an interval of 7s
or 8s.   These two accounts are accordant.      The observer at
Langport saw the meteor at about the time the observer at
Yeovil lost sight of it, and it disappeared from his view in
3 seconds, when the meteor was a few miles west of Bedford,
or at about 1s in time before its explosion. These times
together make up an interval of about 11 seconds, from the
time of its first appearance to the time of its explosion.
   The observer at Southampton saw it for 28. At Euston
Square the time of duration was estimated as 2° or 3s. At
Enstone a permanence of light of several seconds was noticed.
At Hampstead Road the time it was visible was 3s or 4°. At
Bromham the light continued full half a minute. At Rugby,
by account XVII, the duration of light was 20 seconds; and
by account XXXIX. it was 50 seconds. At Wolverhampton,
the time, as near as could be judged, was 60 seconds; at Car
rington it was visible 3 or 4'; at Raby Castle 6s; at Brix
worth half a minute, as furnished by the Rev. C. F. Watkins,
the Vicar. At Durham it was visible 30 seconds; and at Ded
dington the time was estimated as 40 seconds. These inter
vals of time are very discordant, and in some cases imagina
tion must totally have misled the observers.
               14. On the Velocity of the Meteor.
   In regard to its velocity it was certainly great; in judging
of it, we may neglect entirely the diurnal motion of the earth,
and if we suppose for a moment, that the earth did not move
in its orbit during the time of its continuance, estimated at
11 seconds, then it passed fully at the rate of 15 miles in one

270 Mr. J. Glaisher on the Meteor of February 11, 1850.
second, but as the meteor was moving in the order of planet
ary motion nearly, this motion has to be increased by that of
the orbital motion of the earth, which makes the real velocity
of the meteor to have been greater than 30 miles in one se
cond, which seems almost incredible.
         15. On the Absolute Times of its Appearance.
   We are totally dependent for our knowledge of this upon
the observations of the Astronomer Royal. He saw the
meteor after explosion at 10h 41m 28° Greenwich mean solar
time; and allowing 12* or 13s for the interval of time from its
commencement to the time of observation of the Astronomer
Royal, we have 10h 41", 16* + Greenwich mean time for its
commencement, and 10h 41m 27s + for the time of its ex
plosion.
               16. On the Tail or Train of Light.
   This was variously described by the different observers.
At Southampton it was mentioned as a luminous appear
ance; at Yeovil, as a tail; at Langport, a pale blue train;
at Euston Square, a compact sheet of flame; at Hampstead
Road, a waving blade of red flame; at Hampstead, a long
tail; at Rugby, an elongated luminous ball; at Carrington,
head and tail 2}" in length; at Deddington, a brilliant tail
of light; at Bristol, a tail 15° in length; at Reading, the
breadth of Venus extended into a line; at Prestwood, a lu
minous tail of extraordinary length and brilliancy.       In a
recent letter I have received from the Rev. J. Jordan, he
says that Mr. Kimber was most favourably situated, there
not being a single obstacle of any kind; and he says there
was certainly no tail, but merely the trail of light depicting
its path.             -                                         -
   1.  seems, however, certain, both from the general ac
counts, and from sketches which have been furnished to me of
its appearance, that there was a stream of light of great bril
liancy, of many miles in length.
   17. On the Curve described by the Meteor, and concluding
                            Remarks.
   During the first part of the progress of this meteor it very
rapidly descended obliquely £ the earth, in such man
ner, that at first it was between 80 and 90 miles from the
earth, and less than 50 miles distant within 4 seconds or
5 seconds afterwards, the two places over which it was ver
tical at these times being separated by about 17 miles; it then
decreased less rapidly till—

                Dr. Playfair on the Nitroprussides.           271
    When over a place about 37 miles from the first-mentioned
 place, its distance from the earth was 42 miles.
    When over a place about 80 miles from the first-mentioned
place, its distance from the earth was 25 miles.
    When over a place about 90 miles from the first-mentioned
 place, its distance from the earth was 23 miles.
    When over a place about 110 miles from the first-mentioned
 place, its distance from the earth was 19 miles, when it ex
 ploded.
    The curve described by the meteor was that of the para
 bola, as will be seen by laying the above numbers, or their
 complements, to 84 miles, upon a line of abscissa.
    After the explosion, the luminous bodies were seen till they
 were within 10 miles of the earth. The report accompanying
the explosion was so great, that I am inclined to believe that
the substance of the meteor was of a firm texture, broken
into many pieces by the extraordinary expansion of an elastic
fluid; if so, its particles would fly off in all directions; some
 would describe parabolic curves, as mentioned by the Rev.
 C. J. Goodhart; some would continue to move with acce
lerated force in the same direction, and some would fall ver
 tically.  It seems probable that some parts of this body may
have reached the ground within a few miles round Biggles
wade. It seems certain that this meteor must have come
 from the regions of space far beyond the influence of our va
 pours; and this fact, together with its extreme velocity, and
the intensity of the light, are circumstances more conformable
to a solid than to a gaseous substance.

     XXXIII. On the Nitroprussides, a New Class of Salts.
            By Dr. LYoN PLAYFAIR, F.R.S., F.C.S.
                       [Continued from p. 221.]
SECTION III.—Changes experienced by certain Nitroprussides
             when their solutions are heated or kept.
18.   SP': of the nitroprussides, especially nitroprussic
           acid, nitroprussides of ammonium, barium and cal
cium, deposit either prussian blue or oxide of iron when their
solutions are heated or are kept for some time. The residual
liquid, after evaporation, yields crystals of the same shape and
exactly of the same properties as before. Analysis however

272            Dr. Playfair on the Nitroprussides,
shows that some change has resulted in their composition,
for the iron or electro-negative metal is now in greater than
atomic proportion to the electro-positive metal. The pro
portion of carbon is also somewhat different. Still the dif
ference in composition is not very considerable, although
decidedly marked; it is not however sufficient to cause any
obvious alteration in their general properties. In fact there
is an attached impurity, probably a cyanide of iron, which
cannot now be removed by crystallization, precipitation, di
gestion with nitric acid, or any of the ordinary means of pu
rification. This impurity, if it be one, remains so obstinately
attached that all methods of purification have quite failed to
remove it.    This circumstance, before it was understood, had
thrown the greatest difficulties in the way of the inquiry, and pro
tracted it to a most tedious length by preventing the attainment
of accordant results. It is to prevent the like inconvenience
to those who repeat these experiments that this section of the
paper is specially devoted. Attention has previously been
drawn to the fact, that the nitroprussides form chemical com
pounds with the cyanides of iron. This seems to be a case
of the same kind, but of more ultimate union. The impurity
or chemically attached cyanide in this case appears to be
FeCy”, or perhaps FeCy-- H Cy, judging from analysis only,
for its separation has not been accomplished. The proportion
in which it is present is very small, generally only 2(FeCy”)
to 7 equivs. of a nitroprusside, or if it be a chemical com
pound, 7(Fe°Cy”3NO+5R)--Fe"Cy". Still as the cry
stalline form and all the properties of the nitroprussides re
main unchanged, we can scarcely view its presence in any
other light than as an impurity. Several of the nitroprussides,
viz. nitroprussic acid and the nitroprussides of ammonium and
calcium, have not yet been obtained free from this impurity,
and are therefore described in this section.
                        Nitroprussic Acid.
   19. The mode of preparation of this acid has been already
described at page 209. It is however most readily prepared
from nitroprusside of silver by adding to it as much hydro
chloric acid as suffices to form chloride of silver with the silver
in the salt. The dark red solution thus obtained soon evolves
hydrocyanic acid, even in the cold, and after a time prusside
of potassium indicates the presence of iron in solution. If the
solution be heated, it deposits abundance of a brown precipi
tate resembling oxide of iron. When the latter is separated
by filtration, and the solution is evaporated in vacuo over sul

phuric acid, crystals are formed and may be separated; they
must be dried over sulphuric acid, as they are exceedingly
deliquescent. These crystals belong to the oblique system,
but on account of their excessive tendency to deliquesce, it is
difficult to measure their angles with accordant results. The
angles between normals to the only faces which gave re
sults to be depended on, are stated by Prof. Miller to be as
follows:--                                  c
                 ec
                 e'c'

                 ee   106 6
    It will be seen that the equality of the angles ec and ec' is a
tolerably certain indication that the crystals belong to the ob
 lique system.
    The acid made by the action of hydrochloric acid on nitro
 prusside of siver, and evaporated over sulphuric acid in the
 cold, crystallized (light being excluded) without the deposition
 of oxide of iron, but the smell of hydrocyanic acid, accom
 panied by a peculiar pungent smell, was strongly perceptible.
 Analysis shows that these crystals are the same as those ob
 tained from a boiled solution.
    Properties of the Crystallized Acid.—The crystallized acid
 is of a dark red colour, and has a very acid reaction, the cry
 stals being generally flattened and of tolerable size. They are
 quite as deliquescent as chloride of calcium. They dissolve
 to a large extent in water, and are also soluble in alcohol and
 in aether. They may be dried in the water-bath without
 change, but their aqueous solution cannot be boiled without
 decomposition.
    The following analyses were made on crystals obtained from
 a boiled solution, and were dried at 212°.      The acid was that
 made by the action of hydrochloric acid on the silver salt.
  Nos. I. II. and III. were preparations made at distinct times.
     The iron was determined by calcination and by treating the
 residual oxide with nitrate of ammonia.
       I. 2.345 grs. gave 0-800 gr. peroxide of iron.
      II. 3.915 grs. gave 1.325 gr, peroxide of iron.
     III. 3'580 grs. gave 1.220 gr. peroxide of iron.
  The combustions were made in the usual way.
       I. 7.720 grs. gave 7:005 grs. CO and 1.175 gr. HO.
      II. 10.810 grs. gave 9.880 grs. CO and 1.665 gr. HO.
     III. 4.385 grs. gave 3.980 grs. CO" and 0.700 gr. HO.

     The calculated result, especially as regards the hydrogen,
 is not sufficiently close to be the true expression of the ana
 lysis, but it is here given to show how far the acid differs from
 pure nitroprussic acid. It is indeed probable that the acid
 dried at 212° only contains 10 equivs. of water.
     The acid is so remarkably deliquescent that it is very diffi
 cult to ascertain how much the crystals lose in the water-bath.
 The following analysis of the salt dried in vacuo over sulphuric
acid shows     £          state of hydration. The sample analysed
had never been heated, even in solution, so that it evaporated
without the deposition of oxide of iron. Still the oxide was
detected in the mother-liquor by ferrocyanide of potassium.

    A silver salt made from the well-crystallized acid showed
that the iron was in excess, and that the carbon was in the
usual proportion (see pp. 280, 281). The analyses of these
silver salts are given further on, in order to avoid repetition.

to that place.
                  Nitroprusside of Ammonium.
   20. When ammonia is added to an excess of nitroprusside
of iron the latter is decomposed, oxide of iron being precipi
tated, but during the action nitrogen gas is evolved. If the
red-coloured £ caused by filtration be evaporated in
the air-pump, a difficultly crystallizable salt is obtained, which
very readily decomposes, turning blue in the water-bath, and
even when dried over sulphuric acid in vacuo. This salt is
probably the true nitroprusside of ammonium, but it has not
been obtained pure for analysis. If a solution of this salt be
heated, prussian blue is deposited, and the filtered dark-red
liquid, being evaporated by a gentle heat, now crystallizes in
a warm place very readily, and in fine large red crystals,
which are so dark as to be almost of a black colour.        These
have been measured by Prof. Miller; they are prismatic, but
the angles given are only approximative, the faces of the
crystal examined being imperfect.

   The ammonium per cent. from the amount of platinum salt
is 13-872.
   It is obvious that there is little hydrogen as water, for the
greatest part is required to make up the ammonium (13.872
per cent requires 3-08 hydrogen). Reserving, as in the other
cases, the discussion as to the cause of difference between this
salt and the prue nitroprusside, it will be convenient to give
the calculation for nitroprusside of ammonium, of which the
formula would be Fe"Cy”3NO, 5NH4+2HO.

better with the above formula minus 2 equivs. of water; the
hydrogen by the latter would be 3:28 per cent.
                    Nitroprusside of Calcium.
   21. To prepare this salt, nitroprusside of iron or of copper
is decomposed by milk of lime, the nitroprusside being kept
in decided excess.    A dark red solution is obtained, which
on evaporation, even at a gentle heat, deposits prussian blue.
When sufficiently concentrated the solution yields crystals
of a dark red colour, and of considerable lustre. The crystals

    It will be seen that this salt belongs to the class which has
 dissolved some of the cyanide of iron resulting from its partial
 decomposition, and that therefore the electro-positive metal
 is in too small quantity. Allowing for this impurity, which
 cannot be removed, it is probable that the pure nitroprusside
 of calcium has the formula Fe" Cy”3NO, Ca”--5HO. The
 loss of water in the water-bath corresponds to 15 equivs, which
 ought to have given the loss as 17 per cent. In one experi
 ment it lost 17:44 per cent., in another 18:26. We may con
 clude that the formula of the crystallized salt is Fe" Cy”3NO,
 Ca” +2OHO.

                   Altered Nitroprusside of Barium.
      22. When a solution of nitroprusside of barium is boiled,
  it deposits a brown precipitate containing both iron and
 barium *. The solution now crystallizes either in pyramidal
 or in prismatic crystals, that is, in the first state when cry
 stallized slowly, in the second when deposited quickly from
 a hot solution.      It is now found that the salt is inconstant in
 composition, different preparations giving very discordant
 results. The salt is however peculiarly difficult to dry, having
 to be kept in the water-bath for days before it ceases to lose
 weight; it abstracts water when dried most speedily from the
 atmosphere.
     It is found that the carbon is increased in a marked degree.

    In this case the salt lost no more in the water-bath, although
£ was to have been expected from its larger quantity of
  ydrogen.
    In all these cases the specimens were excellently crystallized,
and yet there is a greater or less quantity of a foreign sub
stance prevailing in all, and producing results so very dis
cordant. In the first two portions analysed the barium is to
the carbon (37.01 : 17-79) almost exactly as 1 equiv.: 5; equivs,
and the iron is to the carbon, sensibly though not so exactly,
in the same proportion. In analysis VI, the iron is to the
carbon as 28: 33-7, or rather more than 1 : 5}, while the
barium is to the carbon as 1 : 6. Again, in analyses IV. and
W., the iron is to the carbon as 1 : 5, and the barium to the
same element 1 : 53.                                    -
... Finally, it will be seen further on that the silver salt made
from these altered salts of barium do not contain this excess
of carbon. The filtrate from the silver salts yields on evapo
ration and incineration a small quantity of a black ash, but
the quantity being so small the nature of the substance could
not be ascertained. We can scarcely suppose that it is a
ferrocyanide, because we should have expected to have it
precipitated by nitrate of silver, even though it could not be
recognized by its usual tests. It would be useless without
further information to speculate upon the probable nature of
the impurity. Sufficient however has been shown to prove
that the most complicated results may attend the analysis of
specimens of nitroprusside of barium prepared from solutions
which have been heated and thus partially decomposed.

280              Dr. Playfair on the Nitroprussides,
                    Altered Nitroprusside of Sodium.
    23. The previous analyses of the crystallized nitroprussic
acid and of the nitroprussides of ammonium and barium, and
the composition of the silver salts prepared from them, show
a want of accordance between the iron in the electro-negative
constituent and the metal in the electro-positive one. The
iron in all these cases is about a half per cent. in excess,
therefore not sufficient to be considered as being in atomic pro
portion. It was thought, from the very distinct crystallization
of the sodium salt, that this excess might not accompany it if
prepared from the respective silver salts of the above com
pounds. Accordingly the silver salt was decomposed by an
equivalent quantity of hydrochloric acid. The resulting solu
tion was neutralized with carbonate of soda and crystallized.
Analyses I. and II. were made on a salt thus prepared from
crystallized nitroprusside of barium. Analysis III. on a salt
similarly made from nitroprusside of ammonium. Again, when
we referred to the action of caustic soda on the nitroprussides,
it was obvious that by using a less quantity of the alkali than
sufficed to effect the complete decomposition, a nitroprusside
with a similar impurity in solution was to be expected.
    Analysis IV. was made on a specimen thus prepared, and
 its accuracy is confirmed by a future analysis of a silver salt.

    It will be seen from these analyses that the excess of iron
still remains, and this is further confirmed by silver salts again
made from them and analysed. It will also be observed that

 in specimen IV. we have the same remarkable increase in
 carbon as observed in the barium salt; the sodium is to the
 carbon as 1 : 5}, which is exactly the proportion found in the
 latter salt; but this excess of carbon does not go down with
 a silver salt made from it.

    24. To save unnecessary repetition, the numerous analyses
 made of the silver salts are here brought together, although
 it might have been more distinct to have introduced them
 under the respective salts from which they were made. The
 reason for converting them into silver salts was, that from the
high atomic weight of silver and its accuracy of determination,
 the atomic accordance or disagreement between it and the
iron could more readily be perceived.
    Analyses I. II. and III. were made on three different pre
parations of silver salt made from three different specimens
of crystallized nitroprussic acid, by adding the latter to nitrate
of silver.
    Analysis IV. was made upon a portion of II. treated on
sand-bath with strong nitric acid in the hope of dissolving out
the excess of iron. A very small quantity of iron was detected
in solution by prusside of potassium.
    Analysis V. was made on the silver salt prepared from cry
stallized nitroprusside of ammonium.
    Analyses VI. and VII. from silver salt precipitated from
crystallized nitroprusside of barium, which contained 17.96
grs. of carbon, or in which the barium was to the carbon as
1 : 54.
   Analysis VIII. On previous silver salt digested on the
sand-bath with strong nitric acid to dissolve out excess of
11"On.
   Analysis IX. On silver salt made from the crystallized
sodium salt (No. 2) containing 19.91 grs. carbon.
   Analysis X. Silver salt prepared from sodium salt (No. 4)
containing 21:59 carbon, or in which the sodium was to the
carbon as 1 : 5}. In order if possible to remove the excess
of iron, the salt was first precipitated by sulphate of copper
and washed, the copper salt was now decomposed by soda
and crystallized, and the silver salt was precipitated from this
newly-crystallized portion.

    If we assume the mean iron, 13:36, to represent the true
 quantity, then the silver to correspond to it in atomic propor
 tion should have been 51:53, whereas there is only 48.78.
 Hence there is 0.72 of iron in excess over the equivalent
 quantity; this excess corresponds to T'ath of an equivalent.
 Again, supposing the carbon to be in the same proportion to
 the silver as in the nitroprussides, there should have been 13-0,
 so that there is an excess of 0.64.           The excess of iron and of
 carbon is therefore almost exactly as 1 equiv.: 4 equivs, or
 viewing the carbon as representing cyanogen as 1 : 2. On
 this view the amount of impurity in the silver salt is 2:10 per

    In the previous calculation the cyanide supposed to be pre
sent is Fe Cy”; this only denotes the proportion of iron to
the cyanogen; it is possible though less probable that it might
be 2(Fe Cy + HCy). In this case we might suppose the ana
lysed silver salts to contain this cyanide somewhat in the fol
lowing proportion: 7 equivs. nitroprusside to 1 equiv. of the
supposed cyanide.         On this supposition the calculated and
actual numbers would be as follows:—

   It is not however to be supposed that this cyanide is present
as a chemical compound in the above proportion, as the dif
ferences in the analyses show that it occurs in varying and not
very definite proportions.
   It would indeed appear that the barium and sodium nitro
prusside contained a body in which the iron and cyanogen are
in the same proportion as in ferrocyanogen (Fe Cy”). But as
the silver salt precipitated from them does not contain an
excess of carbon, it can scarcely be supposed that this would
not be precipitated. But in fact there are no data further
than the mere ultimate analyses upon which reasoning can be
founded with regard to this dissolved and combined foreign
substance in the partially decomposed nitroprussides. ...As
however all their essential characters and their crystalline
form remain altogether unaltered, we cannot view the foreign
substances as more than accidental.

XXXIV. On the Velocity of the Electrical Wave or Current
   through a Metallic Circuit. By O. M, MITCHEL, Director
   of the Cincinnati Observatory".
T:        machinery now in use in the Cincinnati Observatory,
      for the conversion of time into space, furnishes the means
of executing the most delicate experiments in the record of
minute fractions of time.     The sidereal clock is made to re
cord its beats on a metallic disc, revolving beneath a steel
recording pen fixed in position. The disc which carries the
metal plate is made to revolve with uniform velocity, and
receives the stroke of the recording pen without affecting its
motion. A second pen, situated directly opposite the first, is
placed under the control of the observer at the transit or
other instrument, and gives him the means of recording any
observed phaenomenon with all the accuracy with which the
eye can seize the instant of its occurrence.
    On the completion of this machinery, several months since,
my attention was called to the velocity of electrical currents
in their passage along the telegraphic wires and through the
ground, as being involved in the determination of differences
of longitude by signals, transmitted telegraphically.
    On the evening of the 12th of November, a series of expe
riments was performed at the Observatory, to determine the
velocity of the electrical wave in its passage along the tele
graphic wires. The long circuit involved in these experi
ments was formed as follows:–
    From the main battery in the O’Rielly Telegraph Office,
Cincinnati, along one wire to the observatory, a distance of
one mile; thence, by the continuation of the same wire, to
 Pittsburg; thence, returning on a second wire, to the obser
vatory; thence, through the receiving magnet, to a ground
wire; thence, one mile, through the ground, to the main bat
tery in Cincinnati.
    The following is the plan on which the experiments were
conducted. The sidereal clock was so arranged that its pen
dulum closed a local circuit, operating on the time-pen and
recording the alternate clock-beats or seconds, on a metal
plate placed on the revolving disc already described. This
connexion remained unchanged during the entire course of
the experiments, and this pen is called hereafter the standard
Apen.
    A receiving magnet was made to close a short local circuit
(equal in power and length to the former), which operated on
the observation pen, causing it to strike its point into the metal
   * From the American Astronomical Journal, No. 2, December 13, 1849.

 Mr. O. M. Mitchel on the Velocity of the Electrical Wave. 285
plate. This receiving magnet was operated on in two modes,
at the pleasure of the experimenter, as follows:—
    1. By a local circuit, which was closed by the metallic
 handle of the standard pen.
   2. By the long circuit before described, passing to and from
 Pittsburg, a distance of 607 miles, along the wires.
   By these connexions, it will be seen that the clock-beats
were directly recorded by the standard pen. They were also
recorded by the variable pen (as I shall designate the second
one), moved by the standard pen, closing either a short local
circuit through the receiving magnet, or the long Pittsburg
circuit, through the same receiving magnet,-this receiving
 magnet, as before stated, closing the local circuit operating
on the variable pen.
   The standard pen record was followed by the variable pen
record, at an interval in time equal to the armature time of
the standard pen, increased by the armature time of the re
ceiving magnet, increased by the wave time of the fluid in .
passing through the short circuit and receiving magnet, this
last being of course insensible. This statement applies when
the variable pen is driven by the short local circuit.
   When the long circuit operates on the receiving magnet,
and through this on the variable pen, then the standard pen
is followed by the variable pen at an interval identical with
the preceding, increased by the time required by the electrical
wave or current for traversing the wires 607 miles.
   This statement is only true on the following conditions,
VIZs
   1. The intensity of the local circuit and the long circuit
must be reduced to equality.
   2. The adjustment of the receiving magnet must be con
stant, and its pass must be reduced to a minimum.
   These two conditions being fulfilled, in case the two pens
are so adjusted to each other in position that a straight line
joining any two corresponding dots struck by them on a disc
at rest will pass through the centre of the disc, then the in
terval between the records of the two pens driven by a short
and long circuit, diminished by the interval between the re
cords when the variable pen is driven by a short circuit, will
exhibit the time occupied by the wave in traversing the di
stance of 607 miles through the wires.
   I will now proceed to show the importance of fulfilling
strictly these three conditions:—
   1. To adjust to equality the intensity of the long and short
circuits operating through the receiving magnet upon the va
riable pen.

286        Mr. O. M. Mitchel on the Velocity of the
   2. To reduce the pass of the receiving magnet to a mini
mum, and to keep it unchanged.
   3. To adjust the recording pens to exact radiation of records,
the disc being quiescent.
   To ascertain the effect of intensity and pass, the following
experiments were performed. The connexions having been
made as above described, four circumferences of second-dots
were recorded by the two pens, under the following circum
Stances :
   No. 1. The pass of the receiving magnet a minimum.
   No. 2. The pass of the receiving magnet a maximum.
   No. 3. The battery reduced to one-half its former power,
the pass a maximum.
   No. 4. The reduced battery, the pass a minimum.
   On circumference No. 1,-minimum pass, and strong bat
tery,—the variable pen fell behind the standard pen 08.091 on
a mean of many measures. The uniformity of these records
and the accuracy of the measures are best exhibited by the
measures themselves. I give as a specimen the first ten mea
sures out of thirty:—
             S
             0-091            0-091            O-092
             0-092            0-091            0-09]
             0-090            O'O90             .ao,
             0-090            ()°092   Mean 0.091
   On circumference No. 2,-maximum working pass, strong
battery,–the same interval became O*2628.
   Circumference No. 3,-battery reduced one-half, maximum
pass,—the same interval measured 0*310.
   Circumference No. 4,-weak battery, pass a minimum,
same interval measured 0°-104.
   From these experiments, it becomes manifest that the adjust
ment of the receiving magnet may give variations of record
far greater than the anticipated value of wave time on the
longest available circuit. It is further shown, that the effect
of different intensities is such as to entail an error so great as
to render all experiments useless, from which this effect is not
strictly eliminated.
   Two difficulties were now to be overcome.         The batteries
must be reduced to equality, and the evidence of that equality
must be obtained. The following plan was adopted to accom
plish these objects. The handles of the recording pens are
flexible, and vibrate at every stroke of the pen. Half the
length of this vibration is the armature time, as I will show
hereafter. Now the armature time was found to depend on
the intensity of the currents which operated on the receiving

  Electrical Wave or Current through a Metallic Circuit. 287
magnet. The local battery was therefore increased or de
creased in power until the armature time, as recorded by the
two circuits, was identical in value;—the pen being so adjusted
that the primary dot was always followed by the second, or
vibrating dot, which was distinctly recorded by the pen in
every record made.
   These difficulties being thus overcome, the pens were ad
justed to produce radiating dots, the disc being quiescent. It
was subsequently found that this adjustment was imperfect to
eleven thousandths of a second of time on the greatest circum
ference recorded. The absolute space was laid off on all the
remaining circumferences, and, being accurately measured,
gives the required correction.
   All the arrangements having been perfected, the local con
nexions were placed in the care of Mr. Henry Twitchell,
while it was assisted in the distant connexions by Mr. Stager,
of the O'Rielly Telegraph Office, Cincinnati.
   The evening was fair and calm, warm for the season. Mr.
Stager reported the line in admirable working order. The
receiving magnet was adjusted to its minimum working pass,
and the long and short circuit batteries were pronounced equal
in strength, by the equality of the recorded armature times.
   At 9h 58" the pens fell together on the metal plate, the va
riable pen being operated on by the long circuit. I watched
the disc to see that the records were perfectly made. The
dots came down in the most beautiful manner, and the record
was engraved on the metal with exquisite delicacy. At the
close of the first circumference of dots, occupying exactly sixty
seconds, notice was given to change; and, at the word, the
long circuit was thrown off, and the local short circuit took
its place. This change was so skilfully accomplished by Mr.
Stager, that not a second was lost.
   In this way five complete circumferences were recorded,—
three with the long, and two with the short circuit. The ear
could sometimes with difficulty recognize the change from
long to short; but after many trials it was found that this .
organ could not with certainty be relied on. The conversion
of time into space on the disc gave us, however, the opportu
nity of bringing a high magnifying power to bear upon the
reading of the delicate records.
   Mr. Twitchell has completed all the measures with the in
strument contrived by me for measuring small angular spaces.
It can be read down to the thousandth of a second of time.
The disc performed in the most admirable manner during the
entire experiment, the records radiating from its centre, and
demonstrating the uniformity of its motion.
   I present the measures of circumferences Nos. 1 and 2, to

are due, doubtless, to want of absolute uniformity in the con
nexions. The variations are, however, very slight, and dis
appear in the mean of a group of thirty observations. The
measures follow.

and through different media. May not the velocity through
the ground vary with the direction of the current,-whether
east and west, or north and south ?
     I place great confidence in these results, as every care was
taken to eliminate all possible sources of error. Every mag
net in use was in the observatory, and all the connexions and
adjustments were under my own eye.
     The adjustment of the receiving magnetwas unaltered during
the experiment, and no change occurred for more than thirty
minutes after the experiments were finished.                  Each of the
pens recorded, in every instance, the armature time in the
distance from the primary to the vibratory dot. One-half this
record was shown to be the armature time, as follows:—
     The variable pen could not begin to descend until the
standard pen was down. Hence, considering the armature
time of the receiving magnet as insensible (as it was), with a
short circuit the interval of the two records would be equal to
the armature time of the standard pen. This interval, being
measured, was found to be exactly one-half the interval be
tween the primary and vibratory dot of the standard pen.
     The length of this article forbids me to go into further de
tail. In case further particulars are desired, it will give me
pleasure to furnish them by correspondence, or by a further

provided that in the expression for the true modulus M (which
may be seen at p. 435 of the preceding volume of this Journal)
both the undetermined signs are taken as positive. Let M,
p, q, r be called the ELEMENTs of the tessarine t; then, if M',
p', q, r be the elements of t', and M", p", q", r" those of t';
and, further, if t, t', and t” be connected by the relation
tt'=t", the following equations will hold between the elements
of the product and of the factors; viz.
    q" cosp"= {1-(q, q')} cosp cosp'-(1-(r, r")} sin p sin p',
    r" sin p"= {1-(q, r")} cos p sin p' + (1-(q'r)} cosp' sin p,
    (1-q") cosp"=(q, q') cosp cos p'-(r, r") sing sin p',
    (1–r") sin p"=(q, r') cosp sin p' + (g', r) cos p' sin p,
 where (a, b) denotes a + b–2ab. The above four equations will
 readily be verified by a comparison with those which I gave
 (at p. 437 of vol. xxxiii. of the Phil. Mag. S. 3) as connecting
the constituents of the product with those of the factors; add
the first and the third of them together, and we have
          cos p"= cosp cos p'-sin psin p' = cos(p+p'),                     (a.)
 whence, calling p the true amplitude of t, we infer that the
true amplitude of the product of two tessarines is the sum
of the true amplitudes of the factors. And we might have
inferred the same thing by adding the second and fourth of
 the above equations, which would have given us
                          sin p"= sin (p+p'). . . . . . (b.)
    The combination of (a.) and (b.) shows us, however, that,
rejecting circumferences, p"= p + p is the only relation between
p, p', and p". It will be remembered, in the above investiga
tion, that M"= MM'.
    I may add that these relations, both between the moduli and
the amplitudes of systems of tessarines, may be readily arrived
at by combining the reasoning of paragraphs 10 to 12 of the
Rev. Professor Charles Graves's paper on Triple Algebra at
pp. 119–126 of vol. xxxiv. of this Journal+, with that used by
   * In the same Number (Phil. Mag, for February 1849) I have given
(see pp. 132-135) a “Solution of Two Geometrical Problems,” by means
of a Uniaxal Geometry. The rationale of the virtual solution is clear and
logical. Let it be required to find a point situate at a distance a from a
given point (the origin, for instance), and fulfilling certain (specified) con
ditions. In Uniaxal Geometry the solution proceeds by supposing the
required point to be situate in the primary axis or are—as to which latter
term see Phil. Mag. S. 3. vol. xxxiv. pp. 408,409. And on this suppo
sition we find for the distance of the required from the given point an ex
pression of the form

 Royal Irish Academy, where he establishes similar relations

             On the Derivation of the word Theodolite.
    Professor De Morgan has (see Phil. Mag. S. 3. vol. xxviii.
 pp. 287-289) upon this subject offered some remarks which
 attracted my attention to the point, and induced me to make
 a conjecture as to the derivation, which I communicated to
 the Mechanics' Magazine". Mr. De Morgan's remarks have
 given an interest to the topic; and to this Journal, as the most
 fitting place, I have ventured to transmit these comments
 upon his remarks.
    The question whether the word theodolite is derived from
alidade entails upon us (not necessarily perhaps, but suffi
 ciently) the consideration of the point (1) whether the instru
 ment called alidade or alhidada is peculiar to the theodolite;
and this latter point again conducts to the further question (2),
 whether the albidada differs from what is termed in the Panto
metria the “index with sightes.”
    It will be convenient to consider the latter question first.
 Let us turn to “The. 22. Chapter.” of the “fyrst Booke”
 (Longimetra) of the Pantometria (edition of 1571). This
chapter treats of “The making of an Instrument named the
 Geometricall square.” And, among other instructions, we are
 told “..., forget not to haue an index, not with commune
sightes, but thus, ...” Then follow directions for their con
 struction, and we are informed respecting the index that “it
hath place in the cètre, and there made to tarry, so that with
ease it may be turned from the first to any pointe.” . This is
the “index with sightes” as it is afterwards expressly called
in chapter 29 of the Longimetra. And, if there be any differ
ence between this index with sightes and an alidade, it must
consist in this,—that the index has one extremity fixed to the
centre of the circle of which a quadrant is employed, while
the alidade, which may be regarded as a double index, has its
centre fixed to the centre of the circle to which it appertains.
In effect, if not precisely in form, the index must be a revol
ving radius, and the alidade a revolving diameter; each fur
nished with “sightes.” Mr. De Morgan, in his paper above
and if A*-i-B”=a” (or a”—C*, as the case may be), we see that the point so
determined will be situate at a distance a from the given one, though not
in the AxE. But, this last condition not being essential to the inquiry, the
virtual solution is complete. This is the theory of the Wirtual Solution.
   * See pp. 159, 160 of vol. xlv. (No. 1201) of that work.

  Mr. J. Cockle on the Derivation of the word Theodolite. 293
referred to, applies the term alidade to a revolving diameter.
At least, such seems to be the effect of his statement, that “A
ruler with sights, travelling upon a graduated circle, was a
constituent part of various astronomical instruments imported
into Europe from the East, and was accompanied by the
Arabic term alhidada to express it:” combined with a remark
in the paragraph preceding that statement. But it will be
observed that it is only by implication (if, indeed, at all) that
Mr. De Morgan excludes the application of the term alidade
to a revolving radius, and, consequently, without contradicting
his high authority, I may express a doubt whether any more
is essential to the definition of an alidade than that it is a ruler
with sights travelling on a circle or portion of a circle, and
that it is as applicable to a revolving radius as to a revolving
diameter. It is true that, in chapter 29 of Longimetra, the
term “index with sightes” is used with reference to the
“square Geometricall,” and “Alhidada’’ with reference to
“Theodelitus;” but then the words “er* index with sightes”
immediately follow the word “alhidada,” and would rather
seem to show that the expressions are synonymous. Why,
then, are they apparently distinguished in the manner just
mentioned? It may be said, because the alhidada is a double
index, whose diversity from the single one is manifested by
the first plate to chap. 29, where the alidade occupies the
right, and the index the left-hand side. But on the other side
it may be urged, and perhaps not without effect, that, although
the word “Theodelitus” occurs before that chapter, yet the
term “alhidada” does not; and further, that the more com
plicated nature of the “instrument Topographicall” described
in chap. 29 renders the use of the word alhidada necessary,
in order to distinguish the index of the theodolite from that
of the square, and that it is only for convenience and distinct
ness that it is there used.
   The view contained in the preceding paragraph appears to
be confirmed by a consideration arising upon the first of the
points above alluded to. It will be found that the chapter 27
of Longimetra (“The composition of the instrument called
Theodelitus”) contains no mention whatever of the term ali
dade.    We are told that “The index of that instrument with
the sightes, &c. are not unlike to that whiche the square
hath: . .” No peculiarity of its index is adverted to either in
 that or in the succeeding (28th) chapter, in which the “index”
is mentioned no less than three times.           Add to this, that the
theodelitus may (Long. chap. 27 and 28) be semicircular, in
 which case a single index would be used, and the alidade
 (even if it meant a double index) would cease to be identified
              * Sic in original. Probably a misprint for or?

 294    Mr. J. Cockle on Light under the action of Magnetism.
 with the instrument; and that other instruments into whose
 construction circles entered—such as Astrolabes—would also
 be furnished with alidades, and we may perhaps be justified
 in entertaining some doubt as to the connexion of the words
 theodolite and alidade.
    It will be noticed that Bourne’s “Treasure for Travailers,”
 cited by Mr. De Morgan, was published in 1578, seven years
 after the first edition of the Pantometria, in which, so far as I
 am aware, the term athelida does not occur. Might not the
 term theodelitus, which was prior in point of publication, sug
 gest athelida?
    Adopting, as I do, Professor De Morgan's view, that theo
 delitus is an adjective or a participle, I think that fact favour
 able to my own derivation. The graduation of the instrument
 appears to be its principal feature in the eye of the writer of
 the Pantometria. “It is,” he says, “but a circle divided,” . .
  “or a semicircle parted. .” Now if we pass from 68eAös,
 68eAigo to the Doric or AEolic forms obeX0s, 66eAigo, we have
 in the word odelited the very expression of a graduated instru
 ment. The prefix The may either be a redundancy, or con
 nected with 6edouau, in which latter case the instrument
 would be described as a graduated seer, or, what would be
 equivalent, a seer of graduations or angles. The graduation
 may, as a criterion, be liable to as much ambiguity as the
 being furnished with an alidade, but it provides us with a
 singular approximation in sound and meaning.

 xxviii. p. 477) belongs, we have a striking instance incentrifugal
Jorce. Conceive a particle attached to a fixed point by an in
 extensible string, and revolving round the point. The tension
 of the string depends upon the velocity of the particle in the
 direction of its motion—which is always perpendicular to the
 string. This induced me to enter into some investigations on
 the subject, which I discontinued; for I found that some re
 searches of Mr. O'Brien (in this Journal, vol. xxv. pp. 326–
 334) might be adapted to the same end. If (Ib. p. 381) we

that it would seem that those results exclude the idea of there
being anything like friction between the particles of the lumi
niferous aether and those of the glass. At least they would
do so if the equations held for any considerable portion of the
path of the ray—if they did not hold they might, it seems to
me, be made to furnish a measure of the friction, and so aid
us in forming a mechanical theory.

XXXVI. On a new Equation in Hydrodynamics, in Reply to
    Professor P. Tardy. By the Rev. J. CHALLIS, M.A., F.R.S.,
   F.R.A.S., Plumian Professor of Astronomy in the University
   of Cambridge*.
TH: observations          communicated by Professor P. Tardy
       of Messina to the March Number of the Philosophical
Magazine, on a new equation which I have asserted to be ne
cessary to complete the analytical principles of hydrodynamics,
proceed evidently from a mathematician who is well able to
discuss this difficult question, and have received from me the
most careful consideration. I shall endeavour to reply to
them as nearly as possible in the order in which they occur in
Professor Tardy’s communication.
    In the first place, I fully admit that Professor Tardy has
proved that the equation
                 do
                 dt , d.ds         ('      )=

may be obtained without making use of my new equation, viz.
               #+x(#####)=0.

                                                    e  e   e   (2.)
 I arrived at (1.) after first eliminating x by means of (2.) from
the equations
                     – d'. ...—, d\, ...-, d".
                   u=%7:       v=x:        w=x:
 but I did not remark, what indeed the process sufficiently in
 dicated, that the result was independent of the value of x em
 ployed, and I concluded erroneously that (2.) was necessary
                    * Communicated by the Author.

 296     Prof. Challis on a new Equation in Hydrodynamics,
 for obtaining (1.). It must, however, be observed, that Pro
 fessor Tardy assumes the existence of the function A, without
 which it would not be possible to arrive at the equation (1.),
 which is admitted to be a true equation, and yet he has not
 shown in what way that function may be found. There
 can be no doubt that it is a discoverable quantity; and since
the number of recognized equations is only equal to the num
 ber of the other unknown quantities, it follows that another
equation is necessary to make up the requisite number of
equations. Consequently the necessity for a new equation
results from Professor Tardy’s reasoning.
    Respecting equation (1.) I have further to remark, that it
is not, as Professor Tardy states it to be, merely an analytical
transformation of the equation
          de - d.fu , d:to      d.pw -
          dt    dr       #++=0                . . . . . (8)
for in that case such a function as A would not be required
for deducing it. It differs from (3.) by containing an explicit
expression of the principle, that the directions of motion in
any given element at any time are normals to a continuous
surface, which principle is tacitly adopted when we assume
that the differential calculus is applicable to the consideration
of fluid motion. The equation (1.) cannot be obtained without
expressly taking account of surfaces of displacement, the con
sideration of which has usually been omitted by writers on
hydrodynamics.
   I admit also that the reasoning which Professor Tardy is
unable to appreciate, viz. that by which I derive the equation
(2.) from fundamental principles, requires further elucidation;
and I will now endeavour to place it in a clearer light. Let
it be granted that the directions of motion in any given ele
ment of the fluid at any time are normals to a continuous sur
face. Then, l, being an unknown function of the co-ordinates
and the time, it follows from this principle that u, v and w
are respectively in the proportion of    #. #.    and  #    or, A
being another unknown function of the co-ordinates and the
time, that
                      d/,         d/,        d/,
                w = A +,   v=x:        w=x:
Hence
                    (a)=#dr:#dy+#dz.
Thus the right-hand side of this equality is integrable in con

                in Reply to Professor P. Tardy.                297
sequence of the adoption of the principle just enunciated, so
that there is no occasion for the application of the criterion
of integrability by a factor.     Now, as is well known, one fun
damental hydrodynamical equation rests on the principle that
the mass of a given element in motion continues from one in
stant to the next to be the same. That is, if p da dy dz be
the mass of the element, this equation of continuity is
                           8.pdxdydz=0,
the symbols of operation 3 and d being independent of each
other, and the former having reference to time as well as space.
This equation is equivalent to (3.). In an analogous manner,
another fundamental equation rests on the principle that a cer
tain geometrical condition, viz. that the directions of motion
in a given element are normals to a continuous surface, con
tinues from one instant to the next.         That condition is ana
lytically expressed by the equation
                               (d))=0,
and the second equation of continuity consequently is
                             8. (dy)=0, . . . . . . (4.)
the symbols 8 and d being used in the manner stated above.

 By adding to this the analogous expressions for        *# dy and

and supposing the arbitrary function of the time to be included
in V, we have the equation (2.) which it was required to deduce.
    It may here be remarked, that the equation (5.) may be
put under the form
                          d!
                          #)    +X(t)=0.
 Whence, by integration,
an equation which applies to a given element.        Hence since
 C is a quantity altogether arbitrary, it cannot be affirmed that
W has necessarily the same value at the same time for different
 elements. Again, if 8x, 89, 82 be the variations of the co-ordi
nates at a given time from the point a y2 to any point indefi
nitely near, we have
                       _ dy         dily     dily
                   (8))= # ** #y+ #82.
 Hence integrating along an arbitrary line,
               v=V(x, 3', 2', t) +\V-V(a, b, c, t),
V being the value of p at the arbitrary point abc at the given
 time. This equation gives the value of W, at the point ayz;
 but as this value contains the arbitrary quantity V-V(a,b,c,t),
 it cannot be affirmed that y has necessarily the same value at
 the same time for any other point of space. From these two
 results we may conclude that the value of p is in no respect
 limited by the investigation which has conducted to the equa
 tion (2.).
    I am quite at a loss to understand how any statement made
 by me in the Supplementary Number of the Philosophical
 Magazine for last June, should have led Professor Tardy to
 suppose that, according to my views, “the particles of the
 fluid which are on the surface y=0 remain on it during suc
 cessive instants.” I distinctly affirmed, what the preceding
 investigation has perhaps made more apparent, that the new
 equation “expresses the condition that the directions of the

                in Reply to Professor P. Tardy.             299
motion in a given element are in successive instants normals
to surfaces of continued curvature.” The condition stated in
other words is, that a continuous surface of displacement may
be drawn through a given element in each of its successive
positions. This law is just as conceivable in steady motion,
in which the surfaces of displacement are fixed in space, as in
instances of motion in which they are not fixed.
   I come now to the argument by which Professor Tardy
obtains a peculiar form of , by assuming that
                       R2             R2

                                 R2

 But, this being the value of    #  & is not the value of #  and

 as my investigation has regard only to the value of 5, it
 is not chargeable with the consequences of the particular
 assumption, that another quantity renders udv-H vay--wdz
 integrable simultaneously with     #    Such assumption may be
 admissible and the consequences true, but they have no bearing
 upon the question at issue; besides which, I have anticipated
 this argument by proving already, that the investigation which
 conducted to equation (2.) in no respects limits the value of p.
    Next follows an example which is thought to show evidently
 the inconsistency of the new equation. The result which I
 am called upon to justify is a legitimate deduction from my
 equation; and as Professor Tardy finds no fault with it,
 neither do I. The meaning of the result I take to be this.
 The two equations
                       *-*.3/+" +X(t) =0,
           log ay+(t–1)– 1) &:***3y – X()       x(t) –

300      Prof. Challis on a new Equation in Hydrodynamics,
serve to determine x and y as functions of the arbitrary
quantity x(t). These values, substituted in the equations
ti-y(t+1), v=x(t+1), show that the velocities are functions
of the same arbitrary quantity. Hence the proposed instance
is one of constrained motion, possible under given circum
StanceS.                                                    •
   The above interpretation will perhaps be made plainer by
taking a simpler example. Let u=ma, v=-my, the fluid
being incompressible and no force acting. Then it follows
from the equations * =# =– £, that the lines of motion
                       v    dy       3/           -
are rectangular hyperbolas, and consequently, by mere geo
metrical considerations, that the lines of displacement are
also rectangular hyperbolas of which the general equation is
a”—y*-a”=0.          Hence the equation y=0 becomes
                        y = x*—y°4-x(t)=0.
 Hence
              d!,             -o- dy
                           dy :=2a,
               dt =x(t), da:         d.V –    a
                                         = -2), A= *_ : - -
                                                      dy    :
                                                      da:
 Consequently the new equation becomes for this instance,
                       2'(t)+2m(x^+y”)=0.
 These two equations show that this is also an instance of con
 strained motion. I have remarked in the Cambridge Philo
 sophical Transactions, vol. viii. part 1 (Art. 3 of my paper on
 a new Hydrodynamical Equation), that from the value of the
 pressure p, to which this example leads, viz.
                       p=f()–: ("+y),
 it follows, by putting p=0, that the boundary of the fluid is
 at all times circular, a result incompatible with the hyper
 bolic lines of motion.     This contradiction, I have asserted,
 and still assert, proves the insufficiency of the recognized hy
 drodynamical equations. The contradiction is removed by
 using the new equation. I think Professor Tardy would find
 it difficult to show how, in the instance he has selected, sup
 posing W=0, the boundary can at all times be a rectangular
 hyperbola.
     Further to illustrate this point, let us take another instance.
 Let
                ?/ = # p(r), v=#20),        r*=x^+y”.
 Then plainly
                        w=a^+y^+x(t)=0,

                                                   dx.
Hence the equation (2.) becomes for this instance

                          •0)=–#9.
In this case the two equations do not determine particular
values of a and y, the motion not being entirely arbitrary, but
such as may arise from the mutual action of the parts of the
fluid on each other. While, according to the first equation,
the lines of displacement are concentric circles, the second
equation shows that the velocity at a given instant varies in
versely as the distance from the centre.
   The “illogical process” by which I have obtained the
value of A in the example in which u= mx and v= -my, has
been employed in several other instances in the same paper,
and has always conducted to a correct result. I confess, how
ever, that it contains the same fault as that which Professor
Tardy has pointed out in the investigation of equation (1.),
viz. that of needlessly introducing the equation (2.). When
u, v, w are given explicitly, it is possible to obtain the general
equation of the lines of motion, and by consequence the general
equation of the surfaces of displacement, by geometrical
reasoning. In such instances, therefore, J may be supposed
to be given, and A may be at once inferred from one of the
expressions,
                         to          w         w
                        d:          dip       d'U'
                        da:         dy        d2
This, in fact, is what I have virtually done, the equation (2.)
not being really made use of
   Professor Tardy has justly criticized the assumption ds=
dr=dr'. This assumption can be made only after proving that
the trajectory of the surfaces of displacement is either mo
mentarily or permanently a straight line. On the supposition
that udz--vdy+wdz=(dp), it may be shown as follows, by
means of the equation (2.), that the orthogonal trajectory is
rectilinear.  Since udv-Hvdy+wdz=(dp)=A(d)), it is plain

 302      Prof. Challis on a new Equation in Hydrodynamics.
 that x is some function of p and t.             Hence equation (2.)
 becomes
                       dily            dy”      o.
                       at + F(Q,t)      ds? =0;
 and consequently l, is a function of s and t. The equation
 W=0 is therefore equivalent to s–f(t), which equation cannot
 be true of all the lines of motion unless they are rectilinear.
 Hence when uda + vdy +wdz is an exact differential, it is
 allowable to say that ds=dr=dr'; and thus the equations
                      V=    Q(t)  and V =   *(t),
                             rr'             7.
 applying respectively to motion in three and in two dimen
 sions of space, are legitimately inferred from the equation
                      dV            1    1
                      # + w(#)=0.
 As, however, these results have been obtained prior to the
consideration of any particular instance of motion, they can
 only relate to the general law of the unconstrained action of
 the parts of the fluid on each other. In maintaining this
 result, I am far from asserting that instances of curvilinear
 motion may not take place under given arbitrary circum
 stances, when uda' +vdy +wdz is an exact differential.
    I have now adverted to all the points of any moment con
tained in Professor Tardy’s communication. While I admit
that Professor Tardy has detected faults in my reasoning, I
maintain that nothing has been urged which in the slightest
degree invalidates the new equation; but, on the contrary,
that the correction of these errors, pardonable perhaps in a
new field of research, has only served more effectually to
establish the truth of that equation.

         XXXVII. On the Electricity of Condensation.
                   By REUBEN PHILLIPs, Esq.
  To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,
 I   FIND I have not been sufficiently explicit in giving my
      views of the forces concerned in the production of the
electricity of condensation, and I perceive this from the ques
tion put by Mr. Birt, page 171 of the last Number of the
Philosophical Magazine, namely, “Would the condensation or
running together of the vapour particles cause an increase of
tension?” Or as the question may be put, Is the electric ten
sion really observed in experiments of the electricity of con
densation only equal to, or less than, that of the electric ten
sion of the molecules when first condensed?
   It is shown (11.) that a jet of steam escaping into the air
acts on a magnet like an electric current, and (26, 29.) suffi
ciently shows this effect to be occasioned by the condensation
of steam, and for the reasons detailed (32.) these electric cur
rents must be of a discontinuous molecular nature: or in
other words, we have one set of particles positive and the
other negative, with currents between them; unless, indeed,
we suppose the resistance to the currents to be nothing, in
which case the phaenomenon would be entirely detached from
what I have called the electricity of condensation. I have
found that when drops of water are driven through this mag
netic jet of steam (55, 56, &c.), the drops become powerfully
electrified positively, at the same time the steam and water
together may be very neutral, as in some experiments with
the gun-barrel (58.), and could doubtless be made as nearly
neutral as we please; therefore the particles of water being
positive, another set of particles must have an equivalent ne
gative charge. It is, I think, impossible for the drops of water
to have become charged in any other way than by taking on
themselves some of the positive electricity previously belonging
to the particles concerned in producing the magnetic effect.
Thus it is seen that the addition of drops of water to the con
densing steam has only altered the general state of affairs by
effecting a sort of separation between the positive and negative
particles.
   It now remains to point out that the electric tension derived
from these aqueous drops is much higher than that of the
positive molecules from which the charge was obtained.
   The electric charge communicated to the electrometer by
the steam in such experiments as those of (52, 56.) was so
strong, that although I have not performed the experiment,

 304     Mr. R. Phillips on the Electricity of Condensation.
 I have no doubt a spark can be obtained; that is, the elec
 tricity is powerful enough to pass from particle to particle
 through a visible interval of air. But the electricity so ex
 isted in the condensed vapour before the positive electricity
 passed to the drops of water, that the positive and negative
 particles were separated by an insensible space; from which
 it follows, that the electricity must then have been much
 weaker; and this increase of tension can, as it appears to me,
 only have taken place “in the way suggested by the Com
 mittee of Physics of the Royal Society.”
    But it may perhaps seem that this exalted tension is pro
 duced rather by the running together of the electrified drops
 of water than of the vapour particles; however, it must be
observed, that the combination of two or more drops of the
electrified water into one mass, so as to produce a diminished
surface, is electrically equivalent to an approximation of the
minute vapour particles which they contain, and on which we
may imagine for this purpose the charge to exist.
     t immediately appears from the foregoing, that the simple
formation of cloud cannot generate any electrical force ex
terior to the cloud, as the positive and negative forces which
it may contain (for the electro-current of condensation shows
that after a time they may neutralize each other) must balance
one another; and it can only be when the positive particles
are removed from the negative by the carrying action of rain,
that the static electric force is developed. It is, however, very
possible that a cloud may collect and condense the general
electricity of the atmosphere, or it may by specific induction
cause the inductric action of the heavens to be concentrated
under the cloud.     It is, I think, from one or both of these
causes that Mr. Birt's remark must be explained, “that ge
nerally before a shower an atmospherical conductor indicates
the presence of negative electricity.” (Phil. Mag., vol. xxxvi.
p. 167.) And with regard to the subject of nubification, I
would remark that the negative as well as the positive elec
tricity of condensation must be equally considered.
    I will now state some new experimental results at which I
have arrived bearing on this subject. I find that saline matter,
which when discharged with the steam readily extinguishes
the ordinary frictional electricity of steam, does not prevent
the boiler from becoming positive as before (70.), and that
some water must escape with the steam in order that the
boiler may become positive. I think these experiments will
demand that we regard the positive state of the boiler and the
negative state of the steam as produced by the friction of steam
on the wetted surface of the orifice of the jet. I have also

             Sir W. Rowan Hamilton on Quaternions.              305
 ascertained that a current of steam passing through the tin
 pipe simultaneously with a current of drops of water produces
 no electricity of condensation, provided the air is not admitted
 at the same time. This result is, as far as the electricity of
 condensation is concerned, similar to those of (89.), in which
 the necessity of a good supply of air is fully seen.
     I do not here give the details of the above experiments,
 being willing that they should form part of a paper which I
 hope shortly to communicate.

 XXXVIII. On Quaternions, or on a New System of Imaginaries

    M.R.I.A., F.R.A.S., Corresponding Member of the Insti
    tute of France, &c., Andrews’ Professor of Astronomy in the
     University of Dublin, and Royal Astronomer of Ireland.
                    [Continued from vol. xxxv, p. 204.]
 88.   Ti:       writer desires to put on record, in this place,
            the following enunciations of one or two other theo
rems, out of many to which the quaternion analysis has con
ducted him, respecting the inscription of gauche polygons in
surfaces of the second order; without yet entering on any
fuller account of that analysis itself, than what is given or
suggested in some of the preceding articles. See the Num
bers of the Philosophical Magazine for August and September
1849. And in the first place he will here transcribe the me
morandum of a communication, hitherto unprinted, which was
sent by him, in the month last mentioned, to the Mathematical
and Physical Section of the Meeting of the British Association
at Birmingham.
    89. Conceive that any rectilinear (but generally gauche)
polygon of n sides, BB, B2. B,-i, has been inscribed in any
surface of the second order; and that n fixed points, A1, A2,
... An, not on that surface, have been assumed on its n success
ive sides, namely A1 on BB1, A2 on BiB2, &c. Take then at
pleasure any point P upon the same surface, and draw the
chords PAP1, PIAgP, ... Pn-1A, P, passing respectively through
the n fixed points (A). Again, begin with P, and draw,
through the same n points (A), n other successive chords,
PnA1Pati, Pn+1A2Pn+2, ... Pan-1A, Pan. Again begin with Pan,
and draw in like manner the n chords, Pan Al P2n+1, P2n+1A2P2n+2,
... Pan-1A,P3n. Then one or other of the two following

  306        Sir W. Rowan Hamilton on Quaternions.
  Theorems will hold good, according as the number n is odd
  Or even.
     Theorem I. If n be odd, and if we draw two tangent planes
  to the surface at the points P, Pan, meeting the two new chords,
  PPon, P, Pan, respectively, in two new points, R, R'; then the
  three points BRR' shall be situated on one straight line.
     Theorem II. If n be even, and if we describe two pairs of
 plane conics on the surface, each conic being determined by
  the condition of passing through three points thereon, as follows:
 the first pair of conics passing through BPP2n, and PnP2, P3, ;
 and the second pair through BP.P., and PP, P2,; it will then
 be possible to trace, on the same surface, two other plane conics,
 of which the first shall touch the two conics of the first pair, at
 the two points B and P, ; while the second new conic shall touch
 the two conics of the second pair, at the two points B and Pan.
    90. With respect to the first of the two theorems thus com
 municated, it may be noticed now, that it gives an easy mode
 of resolving the following Problem, analogous to a celebrated
 problem in plane conics:—To find the two (real or imaginary)
 polygons, BBB, ...B,-, and B'B'B'... B'n-1, with any given odd
 number n of sides, which can be inscribed in a given surface
 of the second order, so that their n successive sides, namely
 BB1, BiB2, ... for one polygon, and B'B'i, B'B'2, ... for the other
 polygon thus inscribed, shall pass respectively through n given
 points A1, A2, ... An, which are not themselves situated upon
 the surface. For we have only to assume at pleasure any
 point P upon that surface, and to deduce thence the two non
 superficial points lately called R and R', by the construction
 assigned in the theorem; since by then joining the two points
 thus found, the joining line RR' will cut the given surface of the
 second order in the two (real or imaginary) points, B, B', which
 are adapted to be, respectively, the first corners of the two poly
gons required.—That there are (in general) two such (real or
imaginary) polygons, when the number of sides is odd, had been
previously inferred by the writer, from the quaternion analysis
which he employed. Indeed, it may have been perceived to
be, through geometrical deformation, a consequence of what
was stated in § XIV. of article 87 of this series of papers on
Quaternions, for the particular case of the ellipsoid, in the
Philosophical Magazine for September 1849. See also the
account, in the Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy, of
the author's communication to that body, at the meeting of
June 25th, 1849; in which account, indeed, will be found
(among many others) both the theorems of the preceding
article 89; the second of those theorems being however there
enunciated under a metric, rather than under a graphic form.

Jan. 11,  ON      the Phaenomena attending the disappearance of Sa
  1850.         turn's Ring. By the Rev. W. R. Dawes.
   “The interesting phaenomena attending the disappearance of
Saturn's ring in 1848, can scarcely have failed to attract the atten
tion of the possessors of powerful telescopes in this country; but
none, I believe, of the observations made have been presented to the
Astronomical Society. From Professor Bond, however, a paper
appears in the Monthly Notices for November 1849, containing ob
servations made on Saturn with Merz's large refractor at Cambridge,
U.S.; and also some inferences which he deduces from them.
   “My own refractor (then at Cranbrook) being employed on a
regular series of micrometrical observations, was only occasionally
turned on the planet. What was noticed, however, was usually
recorded at the time in my observatory journal, though without any
intention of publication; for it was imagined that the results of ob
servations with far more powerful telescopes, reflecting and refracting,
would doubtless appear in the Monthly Notices, and render my own
superfluous. On a perusal of Professor Bond's paper, however, I
find that I have noticed several interesting particulars not alluded to
by him; and also that the deductions I have drawn from some of
the phaenomena observed by both of us differ greatly from his. I
therefore beg to present to the Society the following extracts from
my journal, with some remarks upon them.
   “‘1848, June 30. Saturn. Power 252. The ansa of the ring
are not quite invisible. They are of a deep coppery tinge; and on the
following arm is a faint satellite. I get an occasional glimpse of a
similar appearance on the preceding arm, but cannot decidedly verify
it. The planet is more than 24 hours east of the meridian. On
looking again carefully with powers 252 and 163, I cannot be cer
tain of either of the points upon the ring; for the ring itself seems
brighter in those parts; and I question whether it be not a small
portion of the ring which reflects more light. On estimating care
fully, I find the part must be about the extremity of the inner ring,
which is its brightest part.
   “‘July 15. The ring is visible, with the two dots [bright points]
on it as before.                  -
   “‘August 9.       Occasionally an exceedingly faint dusky red line
extends on each side of the shadow on the ball [being the arms of
the ring].
   “‘August 20. The shadow of the ring on the ball is very nar
row. The arms of the ring not visible.
   “‘Sept. 1. Power 163. Excessively narrow shadow of the ring
on the ball. Belts strong, especially the two parallel ones in the
northern hemisphere.      No trace of the ring.
   “‘Sept. 2.      11" G.M.T.    Power 163.      The ring is visible as an

  308                   Royal Astronomical Society.
  excessively narrow line of nearly the same colour as the planet. The
  Nautical Almanac gives Sept. 3 as the time of its reappearance. No
  shadow on the ball.                    -
     “‘Sept. 3.     Power 188 [an equiconvex single lens]. The ring
 is bright, though rather duller in colour than the planet.        There is
 a dusky line about the same degree of shade as the belts (which are
 strong to-night), crossing the ball precisely in the line of the ring.
 It is very different from the shadow of the ring. Is it the ring itself,
 which, being less bright than the planet, is visible on the ball; as
 Jupiter's third and fourth satellites are visible on his disc as they
 transit over it? Night fine. Enceladus very well seen, and watched
 nearly up to the preceding arm.
     “‘Sept. 4.     Ring much brighter than last night. The dusky
 shade across the ball is visible, but not so distinct as it was last
 night. The following arm appears decidedly longer than the pre
 ceding one.’
    “A few days after the last observation, I went to Starfield on a
 visit to Mr. Lassell, and on every opportunity that offered observed
 Saturn with his powerful 20-foot reflector.       The following are some
 of the memoranda entered in my journal.
    “‘Sept. 12. 11h 20" M.T. The ring is the finest line imagi
 nable, yet of a pretty clear bright planetary colour.
    “‘Sept. 13.      No ring visible, nor shadow.
    “‘Sept. 14. No ring visible. There is a very narrow dusky line
 [on the ball] just south of the bright equatoreal region.
    “‘Sept. 19. The ring is just visible when the planet is best
 seen. [It was frequently noticed to-night during the series of ob
 servations which placed beyond doubt the satellite nature of Hy
perion.]
    “The subsequent observations were made after my return to
 Camden Lodge, Cranbrook, with my 8:#-foot achromatic.
    “‘Oct. 6.     No decided appearance of the ring on either side.
 9h 45", Tethys has occulted Enceladus. The planet is exquisitely
seen.    The line across the ball is very sharply defined and black,
though I thought not quite uniformly so; the northern edge appear
ing blacker than the southern.       [The obscure surface is now turned
towards the earth.]
    “‘Oct. 11. The arms of the ring are frequently visible, especially
that on the following side, which is far more steadily seen than the
other.
   “‘Oct. 26.      Exquisite vision.    Glimpses of a division in the dark
shade on the ball.
   “‘Oct. 30.      I have several times this evening received the im
pression of the dark line across the ball being divided by an ex
cessively fine line of light, perhaps a trifle north of its middle. Most
frequently suspected with powers 323 and 460.
   “‘llh 30".       Enceladus is at the end of the following arm very
nearly. There is a pretty bright dot on the following arm, and a
similar one on the preceding arm *.
   * The night of Oct. 30 was very fine. Enceladus was bright with power

                      Royal Astronomical Society.                      309
   “‘Nov. 21.       Very fine night.    Enceladus was seen the instant
the object was brought into the field of the double-image micrometer,
power 435; and when the image was divided, the two points were
still distinctly visible; proving that the telescope will show a lucid
point of half the brightness of Enceladus. The dark shade [on the
ball] is occasionally seen divided by a bright and excessively narrow
line.   The planet bears 460 very well.
    “‘Dec. 5. The ring is curiously broken into portions, which
look almost like small satellites. Occasionally the planet is very
well seen.
    “‘Dec. 20. The ring is obvious enough, but is broken, especially
on the following side.
    “‘Dec. 21. The ring is reduced to a very fine line, occasionally
appearing broken, but sometimes entire. The eastern arm is not
quite so bright as the western.                                         -
    “‘1849, Jan. 6. The ring is scarcely ever visible, but occasion
ally in the best moments it may be traced nearly or perhaps quite
to the extremity. But some portions of it are brighter than others.”
    “At this time the earth was elevated about half a degree to the
north above the plane of the ring; the sun being about 1°.8 to the
south of that plane. On the 19th, the earth passed from the north
ern to the southern side of the plane of the ring; and the bright
surface became visible. Cloudy weather precluded observations till
the 22nd.
    “‘Jan. 22, 7" 12".       Titan is in contact with the southern side
of the following arm, and about two-thirds of its length from the
edge of the planet. The ring is bright, though narrow. It is very
much brighter in two places similarly situated on each arm; and they
coincide with the extremities of the inner and outer ring.’
    “Titan was distinguishable from the brighter parts noticed when
observed at 7" 12".      It afterwards came into coincidence with those
on the following arm as it moved along it.”
                                  Remarks.
    “1. From the observations above detailed, it is obvious that when
the obscure side of the ring is turned towards the earth, it is not in
 visible with moderate optical power. It also appears that its visi
bility diminished as the earth approached its plane, and its edge, con
 sequently, was turned directly towards us. This is proved by the
increased difficulty of seeing it with my refractor on Aug. 9, com
pared with July 15; between which dates the minor axis of the ring
had considerably diminished; by its invisibility on Aug. 20 and
 Sept. 1, when the earth was very nearly in the plane of the ring;
and by the increasing facility with which it was observed between
 Oct. 11 and the end of November, during which interval the minor
 460, and was easily watched nearly up to contact with the following arm
 of the ring. Its distance from the planet’s centre was measured with the
 parallel-wire micrometer under slight illumination of the field. At 7h 16"
 30' G. M.T. the distance was 34"-40 by four observations. With 460 and
 658 the two bright satellites of Uranus were steadily seen.

310                   Royal Astronomical Society.
axis had increased. And it is still more conclusively shown by the
total invisibility of the ring even with Mr. Lassell's 20-foot reflector
on Sept. 13, when both the earth and the sun were very nearly in
the plane of the ring, and consequently the sun's light would be re
flected from its edge with scarcely any obliquity.
    “Hence it may be inferred that the edge of the ring reflects ex
tremely little light, and that the visibility of the ring, when its
obscure side is turned towards the earth, does not arise from the
sun's light reflected from the edge, but from a feeble illumination of
the obscure surface; and that it is this surface only which is seen
and not the edge.
    “This conclusion is supported by the appearance of bright points in
some parts of the ring when obscurely visible; those points remain
ing stationary, and not partaking of the rotation of the ring. That
inequalities should exist on the edge of the ring so large as to appear
like satellites, even with a moderate telescope, when the edge itself,
though directly turned towards us and fully illuminated, was quite
invisible with a reflector of 24 inches aperture (whose illuminating
power is about equal to that of an achromatic refractor of 17 inches
aperture), seems to be quite inadmissible.
    “It may be inferred, therefore, that the appearance of bright
points in the unilluminated ring arises from the greater reflective
power of some portions of its surface; the exterior portion of the
inner ring being usually the largest and brightest of all, and visible
on both arms at equal distances from the ball. The brightness of
 these points was not always precisely the same on each side; at
some times the eastern, and at other times the western, appearing
the brighter. This may readily be accounted for by supposing that
the ring, at a given distance from its centre, may not possess the
 same degree of reflective power throughout its whole circuit: indeed,
 it is scarcely probable that it should; and the observed fact is in
 perfect harmony with the rotation of the ring, which the stationary
 appearance of irregularities on the edge can scarcely be.
    “2. The inquiry is interesting, Whence is the light derived which
 renders the obscure surface of the ring visible?
    “On this subject Sir W. Herschel says (in a paper read before
 the Royal Society, Nov. 12, 1789), ‘I may venture to say, that the
 ring cannot possibly disappear on account of its thinness; since,
 either from its edge, or the sides, even if it were square on the
 corners, it must always expose to our sight some part which is illu
 minated by the rays of the sun; and that this is plainly the case we
 may conclude from its being visible in any telescopes during the
 time when others of less light had lost it, and when evidently we
 were turned towards the unenlightened side; so that we must either
 see the rounded part of the enlightened edge, or else the reflexion
 of the light of Saturn upon the side of the darkened ring, as we see
 the reflected light of the earth on the dark part of the new moon. I
 will, however, not decide which of the two may be the case, espe
 cially as there are very strong reasons to induce us to think that the
 edge of the ring is of such a nature as not to reflect much light.”

                          Royal Institution.                       311
   “Relinquishing, then, the idea of the visibility of the mere edge
of the ring (whether from its extreme thinness or its unreflective
nature), it may be asked, “Do the appearances warrant the conclu
sion, that the obscure surface is rendered visible by the reflexion to
us of the light reflected upon it by Saturn ?’
   “If this were the case, might we not reasonably expect that its
colour would be somewhat similar to that of the obscure portion of
the moon as enlightened by the earth? It is, however, of a totally
different hue, and strongly resembles the tarnished copper colour
frequently assumed by the moon under a total eclipse.      May it not
also be fairly questioned whether the ring would be so brilliantly
illuminated by the reflected light of Saturn (which must fall but
feebly on the half of the ring furthest from the sun), as to cause
small portions of it to rival in brightness the satellites themselves
illuminated by the direct rays of the sun; the brightest points of the
ring (the eastern and western extremities) receiving reflected light
from one half only of the illuminated surface of Saturn, which would
be seen from them as a half-moon ?
   “I would venture, therefore, to suggest that the illumination of
the obscure surface of the ring arises from the refraction of the sun's
light through an atmosphere surrounding each of the rings, and thus
throwing a pretty strong twilight upon them. During the whole
time that the obscure surface was turned towards the earth, the sun
was not more than two degrees below its plane; and during the
period embraced by the observations, the depression scarcely ever
amounted to one degree. A very moderate density of atmosphere,
therefore, might suffice to produce considerable illumination of the
obscure surface; much greater, probably, than the reflected light of
Saturn could give, and of a far ruddier tinge, more nearly resembling
that of our western sky shortly after sunset.
   “3. It was occasionally observed, and on Oct. 6 it is recorded,
that the dark shade on the ball was not uniformly black, its northern
portion being blacker than the southern. On three unusually fine
nights, viz. Oct. 26, Oct. 30, and Nov. 21, this shade was seen to
be divided through its whole length into two parts by an excessively
fine bright line. After scrutinising the object for a long time with
high powers, I remained perfectly convinced of the fact, which I can
account for only by supposing that the northern and blacker portion
was the shadow of the ring cast by the sun upon the ball; that the
somewhat lighter shade was the ring itself seen projected upon Sa
turn; and that the bright line between the two was a portion of the
equatoreal regions of the planet. The relative situations of the dif
ferent bodies at the time renders, I think, such an explanation pro
bable.”
                        ROYAL INSTITUTION,
   March 15, 1850.—The Astronomer Royal “On the present State
and Prospects of the Science of Terrestrial Magnetism.”
   The Lecturer commenced with remarking, that the subject of his

312                        Royal Institution.
lecture would not be the exhibition of new and successful experi
ments, but the indication of trains of scientific research, in which at
present all is doubtful and difficult, and in which the only light
which seems likely to guide us may possibly lead us in the wrong
direction. He then pointed out the difference, as it appears to be
usually understood, between knon ledge and science, that the former
of these terms implies only the collection and careful arrangement
of accurately observed facts, while the latter implies in all cases the
idea of causation, and usually a reference to mechanical causes of a
simple kind, whose complexity of action depends upon the specialities
of distance, mass, &c. of the bodies upon which they act. This di
stinction was illustrated by the state of astronomy, which before the
time of Newton was merely a collection of empirical rules, and after
that time became a science (the most perfect that is known) by re
ference of movements to gravitation as a mechanical cause; and by
the theory of light, which before Fresnel's time was a collection of
facts only, but after that time, when the facts were explained by
undulations (which are necessarily the effect of mechanical laws),
became a true science. The same distinction was applied to the
collections of statistical facts and the science of political oeconomy,
the moral causes in this science being analogous to the mechanical
 causes in the physical sciences. In these cases it was not to be sup
 posed, nor was it possible, that we had come to the first cause;
 every general cause to which we could refer might itself be the sub
ject of a more general cause: it suffices for us that we have gone
 as far back as perhaps our nature permits. Applying these views to
 terrestrial magnetism, it was to be said that terrestrial magnetism is
 not at present a science; and the particular object of this lecture
 was to point out what efforts had been made to bring it to the state
 of a science, and in what direction we ought probably now to direct
 our efforts, and with what prospect of success.
    Passing over the notorious fact of the direction of the magnetic
 needle, the lecturer showed, by simple experiments, that terrestrial
 magnetism is not an absolute, but a directive force (having no ten
 dency to move the magnet bodily, either north or south), and that
 the poles of opposite nature of two magnets attract each other, and
 that the poles of similar nature repel each other: and he insisted on
 the advantage of using terms like austral and boreal, not too closely
 connected with north and south, to express the kinds of magnetism
 residing in the south and north poles of the earth, considered as a
 magnet, and in the north and south poles of a free needle. He then
 pointed out that the observation of the time of vibration of a magnet
 might be made subservient to the determination of the proportion of
 the magnitudes of the horizontal magnetic force at different points of
 the earth; and expressed his regret that the mathematical character
 of Gauss's beautiful and most valuable method for forming an abso
 lute measure of the force, entirely independent of the     magnet em
 ployed, prevented him from offering it to the audience. The dip or
 inclination of the needle was then described, and its general law (the

                           Royal Institution.                        313
 austral pole dipping in north magnetic latitudes, and the boreal pole
 dipping in south magnetic latitudes) was explained. It was also
 shown experimentally that this is generally analogous to what hap
 pens when a small magnet is subject to the action of a large one;
 and, theoretically, that this is a consequence of the attractions and
 repulsions of poles (the magnitude of the forces being inversely as
 the square of the distance,—a law which from various considera
 tions is established with the utmost certainty). He adverted to the
 mechanical composition of forces, and showed that, from the dip
 and the horizontal force, the whole magnetic force might be found.
 And he stated that, on approaching the magnetic poles of the earth,
 namely, those points to which (as observed at no great distance) the
 needle converges on all sides, and on approaching which, the direct
 ive force becomes smaller to evanescence, and the dipping-needle
 dips more and more till it is vertical, the whole magnetic force does
  not diminish, but increases nearly to its maximum.
     Then were pointed out the construction of Gauss's bifilar magnet,
 in which the magnet is strained to a position at right angles to that
 of the free magnet, by the torsion of position of its two suspending
 threads, and every change in the magnitude of the horizontal mag
 netic force is shown by the position of the magnet, which is pulled
 more or less in opposition to the torsion;—and the construction of
  Lloyd's vertical-force magnet, in which a magnetical bar, mounted
 like a scale-beam, is loaded to a position of horizontality, and every
 change of the vertical part of the magnetic force is shown by the
  position of the magnet, which is inclined more or less in opposition
  to the preponderating weight.
     Allusion was then made to the organized system of observations
  of magnets at every five minutes of Göttingen time on certain days
  in the year (Sundays), first established by Gauss, with the assistance
  principally of students of the German universities, but afterwards
  extended to other parts of Europe; and to the enormous extension
  of the system, principally by the Russian and the British Govern
  ments and the East India Company, over every part of the world
  (the simultaneity of observations and the use of Göttingen time being
  retained throughout, but the days of the five-minute observations
  being changed from Sundays to week-days); and to the Magnetical
- Expeditions which, with the establishment of distant magnetic ob
  servatories, constitute a mational enterprise inferior to nothing but
  the French expeditions of the last century, and to the perfection of
  the organization and the improvements in the instruments and the
  mode of using them, especially at sea, which has been introduced
  by Col. Sabine.
     The lecturer then pointed out the general character of the results.
  As regards the mean or average determinations (omitting the slow
  or secular changes, and deferring for a moment the rapid changes),
  nearly all collectors of results for declination, from the time of Hal
  ley, had conceived the existence of four magnetic poles —two (the
  Hudson's Bay pole and the Australian pole) having been nearly

reached by voyagers; and two (the Siberian pole and the Cape Horn
pole) being only inferred from the convergence of the directions of
the needle. It had, however, been shown by M. Gauss that a theo
retical investigation which would give as one of its consequences this
convergence of directions would also negative the existence of the
supposed poles; and on the whole the lecturer expressed himself
as now doubtful of the existence of those poles. He expressed his
regret that an idea long ago explained by Prof. Christie had not been
followed out, namely, of the preparation of charts showing the lines
perpendicular to the direction of the needle. A chart of the entire
magnetic force was exhibited; and the general fact of no dip near
the equator, and increasing dips of the austral end of the needle in
the north, and the boreal end in the south, was again mentioned.
   The next class of facts mentioned was the diurnal variation :
that in northern latitudes the austral end of the horizontal needle
points furthest to the east at about eight in the morning, and furthest
to the west at about two in the afternoon.        In southern latitudes
the change is in the opposite direction; and in low latitudes, as at
St. Helena (Col. Sabine), and on the Red Sea (M. d'Abbadie) the
change has the north-latitude character during the north-latitude
summer, and the opposite character during the opposite season.
The horizontal and vertical forces generally increase from morning
to evening.
   The third class of facts was the momentary changes first brought
to light by the observations of the German Magnetische Verein
(above-mentioned). These had appeared to the lecturer so import
ant, that, principally for the better recording of them, he had brought
before the British Association the importance of recommending to
the Government to hold out the prospect of pecuniary reward to the
inventors of effective self-registering apparatus. The Government
had liberally responded to the application, and the consequence was,
that most beautiful and effective photographic self-registering appa
ratus, constructed respectively by Mr. Brooke and Mr. Ronalds,
had been combined with the free magnet, the bifilar magnet, and the
vertical-force magnet, and had now been brought into daily use at
the Royal Observatory of Greenwich, and at Toronto; and that
their use appeared likely to extend. The general fact exhibited by
the five-minute observations and by the photograph record is this:—
The changes of direction of the horizontal needle and of the hori
zontal and vertical forces are incessant, and as examined at any one
place appear most capricious. But if compared at several neigh
bouring places, for instance not exceeding 500 miles apart, they
are found to be exactly similar: if the distance be increased, the
similarity diminishes; and if places be selected spread all over the
globe, it is usually found that a large disturbance at one place is
accompanied by large disturbances at the other places, in which
however it is difficult to trace the relation of the contemporaneous
movements at the different places. Diagrams exhibiting these phae
nomena were placed before the meeting. The lecturer pointed out

                            Royal Institution.                      315
one instance as strikingly showing how these phaenomena appeared
to indicate a distinct localization of their cause.    Thus there were
two disturbances of horizontal force at five stations (Catharinenburg,
St. Petersburg, Greenwich, Göttingen, Milan), occurring at an in
terval of about a quarter of an hour; one of them showed increase
of force at all the stations, the other showed decrease at the two first
named stations and increase at the others; it appeared evident here,
that the cause of the first was exterior to Europe, and the cause of
the second was within Europe.
    The division of the subject to which the lecturer then came was
the cause of these phaenomena. He illustrated by a model Hansteen's
conception of two large magnets within the earth, stating that he
understood it to be put forward only as an imaginary construction,
generally (but not very accurately) representing the facts, but not to
be taken for a representation of a real state of things. He then
adverted to Gauss's beautiful and general investigation of the effects
 of a magnetic earth, supposing that every part of it was magnetic
 in every conceivable variety of manner and degree; and stated that,
 by proper adaptation of certain constants in this general theory (a
 theory which it is totally impossible to express in ordinary language),
 all the recorded observations of the mean positions of the magnets
 might be well represented. But M. Gauss had stated the following
 as one consequence of the theory:—Supposing that every part of
 the earth has equal magnetism in the most favourable direction for
 producing the known effects with the smallest expense of power,
 then the quantity of magnetism in one cubic metre of the earth is
 equal to the magnetism of eight of the best steel magnets weighing
 1 lb. each. This, in the lecturer's opinion, made the whole theory
 difficult to be received.
     Connected with the theory of general magnetism of the earth, is
  Canton's explanation of the diurnal inequality. He supposed that
 if there were, near the equator, two magnets in north and south
 positions, one more east and the other more west than England, the
 rising sun would heat the eastern magnet, and thus (by a law which
  applies to steel magnets) would diminish its magnetic power, and
  the effect of the western magnet would then turn the English needle
  to a position verging more to the north-west and south-east, until
  the two magnets were equally heated.
     The lecturer then exhibited experimentally CErsted's discovery,
  that a simple helix of wire, through which a galvanic current passes,
  possesses all the properties of a bar-magnet, its opposite ends ex
  erting opposite effects upon one pole of a magnet, and these effects
  being reversed upon testing it on the other pole of the magnet.
  From this it followed naturally, that a model of a sphere surrounded
  by a spherical helix carrying a galvanic current would nearly re
  present the condition of magnetism upon the earth,-and Barlow's
  experiment to that effect was exhibited: and it was shown that its
  action on a free dipping-needle is generally similar to the earth's
  action. He then adverted to Lubeck's discovery-that the applica
                                     Y 2

 316                        Royal Institution.
 tion of heat to the point of junction of two different metals (as
 bismuth and antimony, or bismuth and copper) creates a galvanic
 action, as is shown by connecting wires with the two ends of the
 united metals and forming a circuit; and observed that here we
 seemed to have in nature a cause which might explain the origin of
 terrestrial magnetism. Attention was then called to the general
 similarity of Sabine's lines of equal magnetic intensity with Hum
 boldt's lines of equal temperature, the lecturer remarking, that a
 much greater similarity would have been seen if he had been able
 to display a chart of lines perpendicular to the direction of horizontal
 magnetism, as proposed by Professor Christie. Allusion was then
 made to the very remarkable experiment by Professor Christie, in
 which a disc of bismuth being surrounded by a ring of copper, and
 heat being applied to the edge of the copper, an extraordinary
 amount of magnetism was developed; two poles, austral and boreal,
 being produced at certain points on one surface, and poles of
 opposite character (separated from these by the thickness of the
 bismuth only) on the opposite surface. Professor Christie had en
 deavoured to extend this experiment to the case of a spherical
 copper shell filled with bismuth, and heated generally at the equator,
 but more particularly at one point; and the results appeared as far
 as they went to correspond well with the state of terrestrial mag
 netism, but the difficulty of insuring a good union between the
 copper and the bismuth (a difficulty which perhaps might now be
 overcome by electrotyping) had made the results somewhat un
certain.
    The lecturer then remarked that, for the advancement of the truly
 scientific part of this inquiry, it does not appear that we have need
 of any new Expeditions or of any further accumulation of observa
 tions made on the present plan. We have already vast collections
 of observations which will be useless till they are published, and
 which cannot be properly considered in a few years. But it is
probable that the discussion of them will suggest new instruments
of observation, more especially if (as is his own opinion) great im
portance shall be thought due to the small disturbances. Already
he had thought that in every fixed observatory eye-observations
ought to be abandoned, and photographic self-registration to be
substituted for it: and he now thought that it would be necessary
so to improve the magnets that they may be sensible to more rapid
disturbances, and so to improve the photographic paper that a mo
mentary beam of light may make an impression upon it. But any
suggestions as to the course to be pursued in tracing the causes of
magnetism must be guided by the opinion of the person who under
took the inquiry. The lecturer's own belief is, that thermo-elec
tricity is the fundamental cause: and in this belief he expressed his
opinion that the importance of experimental investigation of the
laws of thermo-electric magnetism, where broad surfaces of different
metals are in contact, is paramount to every other. An experimenter
might commence with Christie's valuable experiments, and extend

                          Royal Institution.                      317
them as the results should seem to guide him. Too great im
portance cannot be attached to experiments as distinguished from
observations. Thus, it may truly be said that the discovery of gra
vitation is founded rather upon the experiments of Galileo and the
purely mechanical deductions from them, than upon the observations
of the planets, which alone would never have led to it. Still, how
ever, our knowledge derived from experiment must be combined
with the observations: and now the question is, with what class of
observations shall we begin? Shall we attempt to explain the mean
state of magnetism,-or the diurnal inequalities,—or the capricious
inequalities? In the lecturer's opinion, this choice would depend
very much upon our judgement whether all these were to be ascribed
to causes of the same class or of different classes.    He believed
himself that the causes of all were the same, varied in their effects
only by the specialities of the circumstances under which they acted.
They do not differ more than a broken sea among rocks differs from
a smooth swell in the open ocean;—they do not differ more than
the trade wind, the monsoon, the land and sea breezes, the variable
winds, and the tornadoes differ: yet no one doubts that these are
due to general causes of the same kind, modified by assignable
specialities of circumstance. If, then, it were supposed that the
causes of these classes of magnetic phaenomena were the same, the
class upon which he would propose to fix is the capricious disturb
ances. In the other classes we probably see, at any one time,
only the result of an infinity of combined operations; in this, we
see nature acting under the simplest circumstances. The compara
tive minuteness and obscurity of these phaenomena is no argument
against their efficiency for the scientific inquiry. The general laws
of ordinary light had been known for centuries to many persons:
the facts of depolarization are not known to one in a million, and
have not been computed by one in a hundred millions; yet it is
upon these that the undulatory theory of light in general is founded.
It would probably be found then, that the successful course would
be to confine the examination to a single momentary disturbance
which could be traced well through all the magnetic observatories
in the world (the instance to which the attention of the audience
had been previously directed, showed the absolute necessity of
limiting the disturbance to the shortest time possible),—and with
such lights as experiment could give to determine by some mathe
matical process the locality of the disturbing cause. But no rule
could be given for the process to be used. This only we might
predict with certainty, that the investigation would be long and
troublesome; but such investigations are not without their redeeming
pleasure, and no title in philosophy could be too high for him who
should bring the investigation to a successful end.

           NoTICE of A METEOR.          BY J. WALLIS, ESQ.
      To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
                                            338 Albany Road, Camberwell,
     GENTLEMEN,                                     March 4, 1850.
     N Friday the 22nd of February, at thirteen minutes before mid
     night, I saw in the S.S.E. by S., at about the altitude of 15°, a
large bright meteor, whose apparent diameter was equal to that of the
moon. It was visible during three or four seconds, while describing
about seven or eight degrees, nearly perpendicularly downward.
Its globular form was well-defined, and the anterior portion remained
permanently so, while the hinder portion separated into numerous
fragments, leaving evanescent streaks of a dull red colour for several
degrees on the sky. My eye was fortunately directed to the place
where it originated, so that I traced the whole of its course. But
for the presence of the moon, which was shining brilliantly at the
time, its illuminating power would have been very considerable. It
was intensely bright, of the electric blue colour. The form under
went some change in the vertical direction, being somewhat sud
denly elongated into an egg-shaped figure, the more obtuse end
foremost. The atmosphere being at the time free from cloud or
vapour, would account for the light being very local and circum
scribed.    I presume that in physical constitution it must have been
very much like the meteor recently described in the Pictorial Times
by the Astronomer Royal. The moon in the gibbous form afforded
me a ready object of comparison; its lustre was more vivid than the
 serene countenance of our ever-beautiful and admired satellite.
   I can easily imagine all the changes assumed in its track as re
 sulting from the rapid passage of a coherent liquid or gaseous body
 through a resisting medium. In perfect quiet I listened for more
 than a minute after its extinction, but heard no explosion.      Indeed,
 from the manner in which it finally broke up, might be inferred
 rather the idea that the luminous fragments were left detached from
 the general mass by the diminution of atmospheric pressure immedi
 ately behind it, than from an inherent force of explosion; for b
 the composition of such force with that common to the whole body,
 the fragments would have diverged in a direction more laterally, or
 across its path.    As we know not the distance of the meteor, we
 have no data from which to determine its velocity; but little doubt
 can exist that the compression of the air before it must have been
 very great. Mere spontaneous ignition of any aggregate of com
 bustible materials would produce only a radial divergency of its ele
 ments; hence a progressive motion of the whole points to some ex
 traneous source of attraction or impulse; and the velocity conse
 quent to or resulting from this may, by condensation of the air
 before it, elicit the heat in which its ignition originates. And this
 elevation of temperature may effect decompositions among its ele
 ments, which are attended with the observed evolution of their
 usually brilliant light.                I remain, &c.,

   NOTE BY A. H. H. ON THE SPHEROIDAL STATE OF BODIES.
                     COMMUNICATED BY W. R. H.
   The following account, which does not seem to be generally
known, may perhaps be of some interest in connexion with the dis
coveries of M. Boutigny and others relative to the spheroidal state
of fluids. The statement is extracted from the Dublin Philosophical
Journal (now out of print) for Feb.-November 1826, and appears to
have some resemblance to that of Boutigny.
   “INVENTIONs, 59.—Limits to the power of steam.—M. Clement
states, that in the conversion of water into steam, there is a certain
limit beyond which the elastic force of the steam cannot be increased,
however intense the heat applied. When this mechanist visited
England, he witnessed some experiments made by Mr. Perkins, who
has been so much employed in the construction of high-pressure
engines. Mr. Perkins, having procured a cast-iron boiler of very
great strength, applied an intense heat for the production of steam,
expecting a corresponding increase in the elasticity of the fluid. To
his great surprise, however, he found that after a certain degree, the
force of the steam, instead of increasing, diminished. M. Clement
thinks that this unexpected result may be thus accounted for:
the steam, when submitted to intense heat, repels the remaining
 water from the internal surface of the vessel, and keeping it sus
pended at a short distance from the heated metal, interrupts the
 change into the elastic state. Thus, he observes, drops of water
 will remain unchanged for some time on the surface of red-hot iron;
 but if they be struck with a hammer, they are immediately converted
 into steam, exploding with considerable force. Thus, also, steam
 engines may explode, though in good condition, and having the
 safety-valves acting freely. For if the temperature be lowered
 quickly after having been previously very high, the water, which
 according to this theory had been repelled from the internal surface
 of the boiler, is suddenly brought into contact with it, so that steam
 is produced in such quantities that it cannot pass off by the safety
 valve, and causes the vessel to burst.—Bullet. Un. 1826, No. 3.

                                     by M. H. ROSE.
   When organic substances are carbonized without the contact of air,
and we then treat them with water till it ceases to dissolve anything,
hydrochloric acid often extracts from the charcoal exhausted by water,
a notable quantity of potash and soda and earthy phosphates; the

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.            321
alkaline phosphates having formed with the earthy phosphates, double
salts which are insoluble in water but soluble in acids.
   Ammoniaco-magnesian phosphate is the only known double earthy
phosphate insoluble in water. But double salts which are absolutely
analogous may be formed with potash, soda, and even lithia, either
with magnesia or lime.
   When the phosphate of lime or magnesia is fused with an excess
of an alkaline carbonate, a double salt is formed. But by this pro
cess it is not obtained pure, because the excess of the alkaline car
bonate always effects partial decomposition. The higher the tempe
rature is raised, the more complete is the fusion and the larger is the
quantity of earthy phosphates decomposed. With an atom of phos
phate of magnesia mixed with an atom of potash or soda, complete
decomposition may be effected; but with phosphate of lime this is
not the case; the cause is, that the decomposition of the double salt
of the alkaline phosphate, and phosphate of lime, is effected with
difficulty by the alkaline carbonate.
    But when the earths are intimately mixed with a small proportion
of alkaline carbonate and heated, so that the mass neither fuses nor
sinks, all the carbonic acid is expelled from the alkali, and it is then
not possible to extract the alkali completely from the calcined mass
by water either cold or hot.
    It is difficult to obtain this compound in a state of great purity.
This depends partly on the quantity of carbonate of potash employed.
If it be too small, the compound obtained is mixed with too much
earthy phosphate; if too much be used, the decomposition is but
slight, and the compound contains a larger or smaller proportion of
earthy carbonate. The composition of the compound partly depends
also upon the degree of washing, which modifies it more or less con
siderably.
    Make a very intimate mixture of an atom of earthy pyrophosphate
with an atom of an alkaline carbonate, and heat the mixture till it
ceases to lose weight. The calcined mass is then neither fused nor
sunk; it is to be heated for some time in water, and washed with it
boiling.
    The compounds obtained yield by analysis greater or less approxi
mations to a combination of two atoms of earth, one atom of alkali
 and one atom of phosphoric acid; so that the proportion of oxygen
 of the bases approximates that of the phosphorus in the proportion
 of 3 to 5.
    In the greater number of cases the washing requires much time,
 and in some it seems interminable; it appears, therefore, that the
 alkali is obstinately retained; but a large proportion, and frequently
 the greater part, may be separated from the earthy phosphate by
 prolonged washings.
    In these cases, the alkali removed by washing is replaced by an
 equivalent of water; so that a compound, washed for a long time
 with hot water, is partly constituted of the original compound which
 is not decomposed, and partly of a new combination of two atoms of
 earth, one atom of water, and one atom of phosphoric acid, these
 compounds existing either mixed or chemically combined.

  322            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
    If excess of the alkaline carbonate be used in the preparation of
 the compound, and the earthy phosphate is fused, the washed com
 pound which results is mixed with a greater or smaller proportion
 of earthy carbonate. The compounds which were prepared and
 analysed were the following:—
    1. Phosphate of potash and lime (KO+2CaO +POs).
    2. Phosphate of soda and lime (NaO +2CaO + PO%).
    3. Phosphate of potash and strontia (KO+2Sr0+PO').
    4. Phosphate of soda and strontia (NaO +2Sr0+P04).
    These salts are transformed, by washing, into a compound which
 nearly approaches the combination
                2(Na+SrO+PO") + (HO+2SrO+POs).
    5. Phosphate of potash and barytes (KO+2BaO +PO').
    6. Phosphate of soda and barytes (NaO +2BaO + PO").
    These two combinations, especially that of potash, do not seem
 susceptible of being obtained pure. Among all the compounds of
 phosphate of soda with the alkaline earths, the phosphate of barytes
 is mostly, though not completely decomposed, by treatment with the
 alkaline carbonate; but on treatment with water, part of the alkali
 in the insoluble double salt is easily replaced by an equivalent of
 Water.
    7. Phosphate of potash and magnesia (KO+2MgO+POs).
    8. Phosphate of soda and magnesia (NaO +2MgO+P04).
    These two compounds should be washed with ammonia water; in
 spite of this precaution, however, a great part of the alkali, espe
 cially in the latter, is replaced by water.
    9. Phosphate of lithia and lime (LiO+2CaO + PO").
    If earthy pyrophosphates be calcined with the metallic chlorides
 of the alkalies, the chlorine is expelled from them by the interven
 tion of moist air, in the form of hydrochloric acid gas, and compounds
 are formed analogous to those which have been described.
    But if the earthy phosphates are contained at the same time as
 the alkalies in acid solutions, the first may be precipitated by am
 monia, without the precipitate containing any fixed alkali.        The
 compound described cannot therefore be formed in the humid way.
 The whole of the earthy phosphate is not precipitated, on account of
 the presence of the ammoniacal salt.
    In certain circumstances there appeared also to be formed analo
 gous combinations of phosphoric acid, which probably consist of two
atoms of alkali, one atom of earth, and one atom of phosphoric acid.
These compounds are soluble in water.
    When an organic substance is carbonized, and the coaly mass is
exhausted by water, the aqueous solution contains earthy phos
phates (especially phosphate of lime), which separate on evaporation
to dryness, and the dry residue is dissolved in water. The earthy
phosphates are dissolved by the alkaline phosphates, and form double
salts with them.
   When pyrophosphate of soda is gently heated with an excess of
earthy carbonate, or when an organic substance is exposed to suffi
cient heat to carbonize it, the aqueous solution of the calcined mass
             -

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.            323
contains phosphate of lime. To make this experiment, a little more
than an atom, or preferably two atoms of pyrophosphate of soda, and
one atom of carbonate of lime are employed. In the aqueous solu
tion, the presence of lime may be discovered by oxalic acid. The
phosphate of lime does not always separate so well by evaporating
the aqueous solution to dryness, or by passing a current of carbonic
acid gas into it, as by decomposing it by carbonate of soda and eva
poration. The phosphate of lime eliminated does not contain any
carbonate of lime after washing.
    In this case there is evidently formed a double salt of phosphate
of soda and phosphate of lime. The latter separates when a portion
of the soda is converted in the solution into carbonate of soda.

ON INSOLUBLE ALKALINE AND EARTHY DOUBLE ARSENIATES.
                           BY M. H. ROSE.
    Arsenic acid forms with the alkalies and earths double insoluble
 salts, analogous to those of phosphoric acid. The earthy arseniates
 are always much more readily decomposed by heat and by the alka
line carbonates than the phosphates are; consequently, if an excess
 of an alkaline carbonate be employed, the result is a complete de
 composition. But if merely an atom of earthy arseniate and an atom
 of alkaline carbonate be heated together, partial decomposition is
 soon produced without undergoing fusion. If the calcined mass be
 treated with water, some earthy carbonate mixed with the insoluble
 compound remains, in which by long treatment with water the
 alkali is replaced by an equivalent of water, as already stated with
 respect to the insoluble double phosphates.
    There is therefore but little chance of success in preparing analo
 gous insoluble double salts of arsenic, but they certainly exist; and
 what proves this is the circumstance, that the calcined mass, although
 the washing may be long continued, always contains some alkali.–

            ON THE DISCOVERY OF PLATINA IN THE ALPS.
                            BY M. GUEYMARD.
    The author is chief engineer and director of mines, and discovered
 in 1847, platina on the mountain of Chapeau, in the commune of
 Champoleon, in the valley of the Droc. It occurs in gray copper
 ore, which besides contains from some cases as much as 12 per
 cent. of silver, some antimony, lead, zinc, iron, a little arsenic and
 sulphur; the gangue is a mixture of dolomites, quartz and barytes.
     In 1847 platina was found in the alluvion of Columbia, of the Ural,
 Brazil, and of St. Domingo; in the rocks of diorite of the high
 mountains of Columbia (Boussingault), and in the serpentines of the
 Ural (Leplay). The existence of this metal had not been discovered
 in other places, and never in the Alps. M. Gueymard states, that in
  1847 he had performed more than a hundred examinations or analyses
                                                         *

 in his laboratory; he was certain of the results which he obtained,
 but he says that he met with difficulties which required a hand more
 practised in manipulating than his to overcome. Some specimens
 yielded an ascertainable quantity, but these were the exceptions; at
 other times very clear indications of platina were obtained, but the
 quantity was not determinable.             Of one hundred specimens more
 than eighty yielded none.
    Being of opinion that the platina of Chapeau was not a solitary
 deposit of platina in the Alps, the author directed his researches to
 Saint-Arcy near the Mure (Isère), and in the bournonites, dolomites,
 and altered limestones of these mountains, he found platina. These
 bournonites were treated in the same way as the gray copper of the
 Chapeau, and similar results were obtained. Platina was sometimes
 found in 5 grammes of the mineral, while in other cases none could
 be discovered in 20 grammes; the metal is however more common
 at Saint-Arcy than at the Chapeau. A third locality is the Plan des
 Cavales on the Montagne des Rousses, in Oisans (Isère). These
 mountains are composed of protogenes, gneiss, talcose schists, lime
 stones and dolomite.
    At the Plan des Cavales there are many ancient workings anterior
 to the discovery of gunpowder. Among the rubbish there occur
 specimens of carbonate of copper of a foliated structure, containing
 as much as 50 per cent. of copper, and this carbonate, which is of a
 dirty green colour, yielded in two cases ascertainable quantities of
 platina; other examinations did not yield a trace, but the author
 states that he possessed but a small quantity of the mineral.
 Lastly, on the right bank of the Bens in Savoy, on the lands of
 Presles, there was found a fourth locality, on which gray and car
 bonate of copper, containing but little silver, gave traces of platina;
 it occurred in all the specimens, and in some of them its quantity
 was ascertainable, though with difficulty.
    At the request of M. Gueymard, M. Ebelmen examined the spe
cimens from these four localities, and he found platina in several of
them, though in quantity too small for working. M. Vicat, jun.,
also found indications of the presence of rhodium, and the same ob
servation was made by the author.—Comptes Rendus, 31 Decembre,

          ANALYSIS OF TIN FROM THE MINES OF BANCA.
                             BY M. MULDER.

   These results give 731:23 as the atomic weight of tin. M. Ber
zelius gave in 1835 the number 735:296, which has been generally
adopted.
   It is, however, admitted that the analyses cited were not of a nature
to supply the exact value of the atomic weight of tin, although they
show with certainty that it requires some alteration.
   To decide this question several experiments were made with all
the precautions required by operations of this nature. One hundred
parts of perfectly pure tin, reduced in various ways from its oxide,
gave 127:56, 127.56 and 127:43 parts of peroxide of tin. The
atomic weight calculated from the first two experiments, which gave
the same numbers, is 725-7. These analyses were performed by
M. Vlaanderen.
   This result places tin in the series of metals, the atomic weight of
which is expressed by a multiple of that of hydrogen; the number
725, which is 58X12.5, may be hereafter adopted for the equivalent
of tin, seeing that the difference of 0.7 in 725 cannot be detected
by chemical analysis. The composition of peroxide of tin inferred
is therefore

                ANALYSIS OF THE MUD OF THE NILE.
    The first analysis was made by M. Lajonchere in the laboratory.
 of M. Payen; it was supplied by M. D'Arcet, Jun. The specimen
was in irregular masses, which were readily reduced to a fine powder;
it was soft to the touch, and contained brilliant grains. It adhered
 slightly to the tongue, and had a sensibly saline and acrid taste. Its
 density was 2.5, nearly equal to that of various fertile soils. When
 calcined in the air it assumes a reddish-brown colour, loses weight
 by the evaporation of water and the combustion of organic matter;
 when calcined in close vessels, it yields alkaline vapours acting on
 test paper.                         -
    For the analysis 1.638 gr. of the original mud was taken, con
 taining 1:541 gr. of dry. This quantity of matter furnished 3"
 of gas measured at 19°, and under a pressure of 0.7565, which
 correspond to 3.43 millims. of nitrogen for 1.638 of original matter,
 or 2.22 for 1000 of dry matter; the original matter contained there
 fore 2:10 of nitrogen in 1000. These numbers show that the mud
 of the Nile approaches very fertile lands.
    The incineration of the matter dried at 105° C. in vacuo for three
 hours indicated 4.75 of organic matter in 100 parts, or 4.75 for 1000.
 This organic matter contains then 4:67 of nitrogen in 100 parts.
    The matter soluble in water was extracted in order to ascertain
 the nitrogen which it contained; the results were as follow:
                                                                   *

326           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
   Heated to 100° C. in a water-bath in a litre of water, 100 grms.
of the matter gave a solution which, filtered and evaporated on a
vapour-bath, left a residue weighing 0.866 gr., and contained, as
ascertained by calcination, 23 per cent. of its weight of organic
matter, 0.237 of dried matter, analysed by combustion with oxide
of copper, gave a volume of gas equal to 5*, under a pressure 0.7608
millim. at 19°, which corresponds to 0.00573 gr. of nitrogen, or
0.0109 gr. for 0.866 gr. of soluble substance contained in 100 grms.
of dried matter.
   The matter of this second analysis thus contains 2:19 per cent.
of nitrogen, and the organic matter contained in 1000 of the dry
mud represents 1-7 of nitrogen.
   Lastly, it may be concluded from this experiment, that the organic
matter of the mud of Egypt represents the whole of the nitrogen
contained in this mud.

XLI. Observations on a remarkable Exudation of Ice from
   the Stems of Vegetables, and on a singular Protrusion of Icy
    Columns from certain kinds of Earth during frosty weather.
   By JoHN LECoNTE, M.D., Professor of Natural Philosophy
   and Chemistry in the University of Georgia *.
    T is certainly a remarkable circumstance, that phaenomena
     so striking as those forming the subject of this paper have
received so little attention from philosophers; and it is per
haps still more singular, that hitherto no attempts have been
made at their explanation. Stephen Elliott, in his Sketch of
the Botany of South Carolina and Georgia, published in 1824,
notices a remarkable protrusion of crystalline fibres of ice from
the stems of the Conyza bifrons (vol. ii. p. 322). Sir John F.
W. Herschel published a short notice of a similar exudation
of icy fringes occurring around thistle-stalks and stumps of
heliotropes, in the London and Edinburgh Philosophical
Magazine for February 1833, p. 110 (3rd series, vol. ii. p. 110)t.
Professor S. P. Rigaud of Oxford notices the occurrence of
an analogous phaenomenon on a recently built stone wall, in
the succeeding Number of the same Journal (3rd series, vol. ii.
p. 190. 1833). As far as my researches extend, the above
mentioned notices—all of them very brief and imperfect—
embrace all the observations hitherto made on these remarkable
phaenomena.        Even the natural speculative tendency has been

Association for the Advancement of Science, at their extra meeting at
Charleston, South Carolina, March 12, 1850.
   t James D. Dana appears to have noticed the same phaenomenon. He
says, “On the cool mornings of spring or autumn in this climate, twigs of
plants are occasionally found encircled by fibrous icy curls, which are at
tached vertically to the stem. (Wide Manual of Mineralogy, 2nd Ed.

330      Dr. LeConte on a remarkable Exudation of Ice
held in check by the extreme paucity of facts and observations,
so that no explanation of them has been advanced.
   For many years my attention has been drawn to the re
markable deposition of ice around the stalks of certain plants,
as well as to analogous phaenomena exhibited by certain kinds
of soil. During a visit to the sea-coast of Georgia in the
months of November and December 1848, I had a very fa
vourable opportunity of studying the phaenomenon as exhi
bited in vegetables. The plants in which I have observed it
are two species of the genus Pluchea of DeCandolle, or Conyza
of the older botanists, viz. Pluchea bifrons and P. camphorata.
It is more common and conspicuous in the former species than
the latter. Both of these plants grow abundantly in wet soils,
around ponds and along the road-side ditches in the low
country of Carolina and Georgia. The root is perennial, but
the stem is annual and herbaceous.
   The exudations of ice are most abundant and striking
during the first clear frosty weather in November and De
cember. At this period the earth is warm; and the serenity
of the atmosphere is so favourable to radiation, that there is a
remarkable difference between the temperature of the day and
night. When the temperature sinks towards daylight to about
30° or 28° of Fahrenheit, or even lower, the surface of the
ground is totally devoid of the slightest incrusting film of
frozen earth, while hoar-frost is deposited in such profusion
on all dead vegetable matter as to resemble a slight fall of
snow. Under such circumstances, the traveller who passes
along the level roads of this region soon after sunrise cannot
fail to be struck with the remarkable accumulations of volu
minous friable masses of semi-pellucid ice around the foot
stalks of the Pluchea which grow along the road-side ditches.
At a distance they present an appearance resembling locks of
cotton-wool, varying from four to five inches in diameter,
placed around the roots of the plants; and when numerous,
the effect is striking and beautiful.
   In relation to the exudation of ice from the stems of vege
tables, the description and delineation given by Sir John Her
schel are so clear and faithful, and accord so exactly with the
results of my own observations, that I prefer using the lan
guage of that justly distinguished philosopher whenever it suits
my purpose. The engraving which accompanies his paper
represents the appearances presented very accurately". My
observations appear to establish the following facts in relation
to this phaenomenon:—
  * The reader is requested to refer to the engraving given by Sir John
Herschel in the Philosophical Magazine for February 1833,

                 Jrom the Stems of Vegetables.                331
   1: The depositions of ice are entirely confined to the im
mediate neighbourhood of the roots of the plants, the upper
parts of the tall unbroken stalks being quite free from them.
They frequently commence two or three inches from the
ground, and extend from three to four inches along the axis
of the stem. It is proper to state, that at this season the stalks
are dead and quite dry to within about six inches of the earth,
below which they are generally green and succulent. The
plant has a large and porous pith, which is always saturated
with moisture as high as six or seven inches from the base of
the stem.
   2. The ice emanates in a kind of riband- or frill-shaped
wavy friable semi-pellucid excrescence, “as if protruded in
a soft state from the stem, from longitudinal fissures in its
sides.”   As Sir John Herschel remarks, “The structure of
the ribands is fibrous, like that of the fibrous variety of gyp
sum, presenting a glossy silky surface, the direction of the
fibres being at right angles to the stem, or horizontal.” Ac
cording to my observations, the number of ribands vary from
1 to 5. All of them issue from the stem in vertical or longi
tudinal lines, which are not always symmetrically disposed
around the axis. Judging from the engraving given by Sir
John Herschel, the Pluchea exhibits the phaenomenon much
more conspicuously and beautifully than the stumps of helio
tropes observed by him. I have frequently observed the icy
excrescences to exceed five inches in length; and when thus
elongated, they are usually curled; often so much so, as to
bring the remote extremity of the frill nearly in contact with
its line of attachment to the stalk.
    3. “Although,” as Sir John Herschel correctly observes,
 “the icy sheets appeared to have been protruded from the
interior of the stem, yet on examination they were found to
 terminate sharply at its surface, adhering to it so lightly as to
 render it impossible to handle a specimen without detaching
 them, and in no instance connected with any formation of ice
 within; on the contrary, the majority of the stems were sound
 and solid, and many of them still green when cut. The point
 of attachment of the ice was, however, always on the surface
 of the wood, beneath the outer bark or epidermis, which the
 frozen sheets had in every instance stripped off and forced
 out to a distance. Where the fringes were large and well
 developed, the bark had quite fallen off; but in those cases
 where it adhered more strongly, it seemed to have prevented
 their free expansion; and in such instances the stem presented
 the singular appearance of a thick massive coating of ice in
 terposed between the wood and its integument, which was
                                Z 2

332      Dr. LeConte on a remarkable Exudation of Ice
swollen and rifted.” To the foregoing very accurate descrip
tion I have only to add, that, according to my observations on
the Pluchea, when the frost is quite severe, the icy sheets were
often “connected with the formation of ice within,” in fact,
 were continuous with the frozen pith; but under such circum
 stances the wood was always rifted longitudinally, and the
process of protrusion seemed to have been completely checked
 at the part of the stem in which this took place. Indeed, the
phaenomenon was seldom exhibited in its most perfect and
beautiful form when the wood was split. It is obvious, there
fore, that in these instances the frigorific action was too in
tense to permit the phaenomenon to be developed in a normal
 Inannel".
    4. The phaenomenon took place in the same plant during
several consecutive nights; and when the wood was not rifted,
frequently from the same portion of the stalk. When the
 wood was split, however, the deposition of ice occurred lower
down the stem, at a part which was unaffected by the frost of
the previous night. The stalks thus became completely rifted
by a succession of severe nights, from the height of six or
seven inches down to the ground. This is unquestionably
one of the reasons why these exudations of ice are seldom
observed after the middle of winter, for the stalks are usually
destroyed before this period.
    5. The stems which had been cut off within three or four
inches of the earth exhibited the phaenomenon as conspicu
ously as those which were left untouched. The icy sheets
never issued from the cut surface, but always from longitudinal
lines commencing somewhat below it and extending towards
the root. Plants which were torn up and transplanted in a
box of moist earth in a flower garden exhibited the same phae
nomenon, although much less strikingly than when left in situ.
    “The appearances above described,” to use the language
of Sir John Herschel, “are quite at variance with any idea
of the deposition of these icy fringes from the store of aqueous
vapour in the general atmosphere, in the manner of hoar
frost; and the only quarter to which we can look for their
origin is in the plant itself, or in the comparatively warm
earth beneath, to whose exhalations the decaying stems may
form a kind of chimney.” The additional facts which my
observations establish,—particularly in relation to the recur
rence of the phaenomenon on the same portion of the stalk
during several successive frosts, even after it had been cut off,
—appear to be irreconcileable with the idea that the physio
logical functions of the plant have any share in the production
of it. We must therefore look to the moist earth for the large

                  from the Stems of Vegetables.              333
supply of water necessary for the development of these vo.u
minous masses of ice. But by what force and through what
agency is it elevated and protruded?
   Impressed with the idea that the phaenomenon is purely
physical, having no connexion with the vitality of the stem, it
seemed reasonable that the remarkable exudation of icy co
lumns from certain kinds of earth, which long attracted my
 attention, might be referred to a similar cause. Considera
tions of this character induced me to study the latter phaeno
 menon more carefully. During the winters of 1848–49 and
 1849-50, abundant opportunities occurred of examining the
 phaenomenon under the most diversified circumstances, the
soil in this neighbourhood being peculiarly adapted to its de
velopment.
    The following facts seem to be established by my obser
 vations:
    1. The phaenomenon occurs most strikingly when a warm
 rainy period terminates in clear freezing weather, with the
 wind from the west or north-west. It is more or less distinctly
 developed at all temperatures below 30° Fahrenheit. When,
 however, the thermometer was as high as this at sunrise, it
 was exhibited only in situations most favourable to radiation.
 It frequently appears during several consecutive nights after
 a rain; but usually, when the temperature remains nearly
 constant, with decreasing conspicuousness. This obviously
 arises from the diminution of moisture: in situations which
 are persistently wet, it is always developed in proportion to
 the depression of temperature.
    2. It takes place in soils that are rather firm, but not very
 compact. For example, the phaenomenon is beautifully ex
 hibited along the sides of the water-worn ravines which fur
 row the declivities of the firm red clay hills of this primitive
 region, as well as along the cuts or ditches by the road-side.
 This clay seems to be formed by the decomposition, in situ,
 of hornblendic gneiss and mica-schist. This soil presents the
 same phaenomenon when thrown up and lying on the surface,
 provided it is not trodden down and rendered too compact.
 For this reason it never appears on the well-beaten high roads,
 although it is seen abundantly along their margins. The in
 fluence of compactness of soil is strikingly illustrated by the
 fact, that the protrusion of the icy columns will frequently
 occur around the margins and along the middle cleft of a track
 of a cloven-footed animal, while none were found on the por
 tions where the clay had undergone compression. The clods
 found at the bottom of the ravines and along the margins of
 the brooks generally afford beautiful manifestations of the

334      Dr. LeConte on a remarkable Exudation of Ice
phaenomenon, under proper circumstances. It is seldom, if
ever, observed in rich, mellow, alluvial soils, abounding in
vegetable matter.
   3. The general appearance of the phaenomenon is that of
a vast number of filaments of ice, forming in their aggregation
fibrous columns resembling bundles of spun glass,      '
at right angles to the surface, as if protruded in a semi-flui
state from an infinitude of capillary tubes in the ground. The
structure of the columns is distinctly fibrous, presenting a fine
silky, wavy, silvery surface, analogous to that of the fibrous
variety of gypsum. They exhibit various degrees of dia
phaneity, apparently depending on the purity of the water as
well as on the state of aggregation of the icy filaments; being
in some situations almost perfectly transparent, and in others
scarcely semi-pellucid. Sometimes the fibres composing the
columns are readily separable; at other times they are, as it
were, fused together. When examined by transmitted light,
transverse striae are observed to cross the filaments at intervals
varying from Toth to sloth of an inch. A thin stratum or
crust of loose frozen earth is frequently detached and elevated
on the summits of the columns, often forming a continuous
roof-like covering to the soil beneath, extending over many
square yards; at other times appearing in separate and iso
lated flat caps of variable size. The columns are not always
uniformly distributed over the surface of the ground, but fre
quently exhibit considerable intervals of unfrozen soil between
them. When the exudation takes place around the margins
of a circumscribed depression containing water, like that left
by the foot of a horse, it appears to draw up the water from
the cavity, leaving an interior grotto lined with fantastic
groups of icicles. The icy columns vary in length from one
to three, four, or even five inches, according to the favour
ableness of the situation and the intensity of the cold. They
vary in size from mere threads to prismatic bundles of one
fourth of an inch in diameter. When very long they fre
quently fall over by their gravity, presenting a beautiful ap
pearance when viewed in masses. The effect produced by
walking over a surface on which the phaenomenon is well
developed is very striking. The superior crust of frozen earth
and its supporting icy columns give way under the foot, which
thereby sinks several inches below the apparent surface at
every step. When the phaenomenon occurs along the preci
pitous sides of the ravines and road-side cuts, the earth which
has been elevated falls down to the bottom of the inclined
plane as soon as the sun takes effect, leaving a fresh surface
of soil exposed to the action of the next frost; and as this ex

                 from the Stems of Vegetables.                 335
foliation continues from nightto night when the weather is suffi
ciently cold, while all the earthy matter which is thus thrown
down is carried off by the first considerable fall of rain, it is
sufficiently obvious that it is a powerful agent of disintegration.
When the weather is not severe, it is only exhibited in situa
tions most favourable to the production of cold. The pre
sence of a twig or a straw on the surface of the clay will, under
these circumstances, determine the place of development of
the phaenomenon; and a twig will thereby be elevated above
the general surface, supported by an elegant pectinated ar
rangement of icy columns.
   4. On examination the icy columns were found to terminate
sharply at the surface of the clay, adhering so lightly as to be
detached by a mere touch of the finger, and scarcely ever con
nected with any formation of ice below,—in fact, never, under
the circumstances most favourable to the development of the
phaenomenon. On the contrary, in the majority of cases, the
soil from which they protruded was not frozen in the slightest
degree, even during our severest weather, and when the earth
in other situations was completely incrusted. This point was
carefully examined early in the morning on the 11th of Janu
ary 1849, when the thermometer was at 14° of Fahrenheit at
sunrise; again on the 17th of February, when it was at 12°;
and again on the 19th of the same month, when it stood as
low as 5°,-a most extraordinary degree of cold for this lati
 tude (34° N. lat.). These observations were carefully re
 peated on the mornings of the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th of Fe
 bruary 1850, when the temperature was respectively 16°, 14°,
 18°, and 23° of Fahrenheit's scale at sunrise.        On none of
 these occasions was the ground, where the icy columns were
 developed in profusion, frozen in the slightest degree. The
 afternoon of February 4, 1850, afforded me the rare oppor
 tunity of observing the phaenomenon in the very act of deve
 lopment. It took place on an eastern exposure at 5: P.M.,
 when the temperature was 28°F. As the day was very cold,
 the icy columns of the previous night, which were about three
 inches in length, had been only partially melted, in this pro
 tected situation, by the influence of the mid-day sun. At the
 time the observation was made, these columns were found to
 be elevated about one inch by the recently protruded ice.
 The line of demarcation between the old and new ice-forma
 tion was perfectly distinct, the lower portions of the former
 having been remarkably attenuated by the process of lique
 faction during the heat of the day. In this case it was obvious
 that the evolution of the phaenomenon during the previous
 night and morning had been temporarily checked by the solar

336     Dr. LeConte on a remarkable Exudation of Ice
heat, but was resumed as soon as that influence was with
drawn. The state of the soil was carefully examined; for it
seemed to be almost certain, that the process of formation
must have been going on under the eye at the time the ob
servations were made. The subjacent clay was found to be
moist and unfrozen, the icy columns separated from it with
the slightest touch, and were not connected with any formation
of ice below. As already intimated, in less favourable situa
tions, when the frigorific action was intense, the soil on which
the columns rested sometimes became incrusted with ice, after
the protrusion had commenced; but this was invariably at
tended with a complete arrestation of the process: indeed,
under such circumstances, it was obvious that there had been
an imperfect development of the phaenomenon. In these
cases, a stratum of frozen earth was found adhering to the
bases of the columns, while continuous icy threads were ob
served to transpierce this crust perpendicularly, and occasion
ally to extend into minute apertures in the unfrozen soil be
neath it. As already remarked, in more favourable situations
the ground beneath was never frozen; but on cautiously re
moving the icy columns, the moist clay was found to present
a very porous appearance, as if perforated by a multitude of
holes or spiracles, corresponding in position with the bundles
of thread-like ice, and which were frequently of sufficient size
to be quite obvious to the unassisted eye.
   Having thus described with sufficient fullness the phaeno
mena attending the occurrence of exudations of icy fringes
from the stems of plants, as well as the protrusion of columns
of ice from certain soils, we are now prepared to offer some
thing in explanation of them, and to attempt to rise from the
mass of details to the causes which have given birth to these
remarkable appearances. A careful examination and collation
of the two series of facts above recorded develope so many
strong points of analogy, that it is almost impossible to resist
the conviction, that both of the phaenomena must be referred
to the same cause. If we admit an identity of cause in the
two cases, it is obvious that it must be purely physical; since
that which relates to the production of the phaenomenon on
certain kinds of earth is necessarily physical. In the remarks
which follow, therefore, I shall treat the question as one of
physics, and shall apply them more particularly to the phae
nomenon exhibited by the soil: their application to the case
of vegetables will be easy and obvious.
   1. It is very clear that we cannot look to the store of va
pour in the general atmosphere for the origin of the icy co
lumns. For not only are the appearances above described at

                  from the Stems of Vegetables.              337
variance with the idea of the phaenomenon being a modifi
cation of hoar-frost, but the amount of water congealed at
the surface during a single night is vastly too great to have
come from this source. Moreover, the phaenomenon occurs
very conspicuously during our most violent and dry north
west winds; circumstances under which it would be impos
sible for any condensation of atmospheric vapour to take place.
It is well known to meteorologists, that a rapid agitation of
the lower strata of the atmosphere totally subverts the con
dition which is most essential to the deposition of dew, namely,
that the surface must be colder than the superincumbent air.
   2. It cannot be occasioned by the cold contracting a super
ficial stratum of earth, and thus forcing up the moisture which
freezes at the surface, because this cause is utterly inadequate
to furnish the large supply of fluid which is required for the
production of columns of ice from three to five inches in length.
The fact that isolated clods lying in moist situations frequently
exhibit a protruded investment of icy columns quite equal in
volume to the mass of earth from which they issued, is obvi
ously and palpably at variance with this idea. The phaeno
menon observed on the stems of plants is likewise manifestly
inconsistent with this notion.
   3. It cannot be owing to the exhalation of aqueous vapour
from the comparatively warm earth beneath through spiracles,
undergoing condensation and congelation at the surface, and
thus protruding the columns; for the amount of evaporation
from such a surface, when the temperature of the air is at 12
or 14 degrees of Fahrenheit's scale, is hopelessly inadequate
to furnish the necessary amount of water. Frequently during
a single night a sufficient quantity of moisture is elevated in
the form ' icy columns to maintain the surface in a very wet
 condition, even after several days’ exposure to the sun.
    4. Neither can the protrusion of the columns of ice be as
 cribed to the mere expansion of water during the act of freezing
 in the capillary tubes in the clay; for this supposition is op
 posed to the well-established fact, that they are not connected
 with any formation of ice below. Besides, if we assume the
 specific gravity of ice to be '92 as compared with water at
 32°F., it follows that the amount of expansion which it un
 dergoes during the process of congelation is about 87 parts
 in 1000 by volume. Granting the rigidity of the capillary
 tubes to be such as to admit of no transverse increment, and
 that the whole amount of cubic expansion is thereby mani
 fested in the longitudinal extension of the column, it appears,
 from a simple calculation, that to protrude three inches of ice
 the frozen column must penetrate about thirty-four inches be

 338       Dr. LeConte on a remarkable Exudation of Ice
 low the surface of the soil. We have already seen that the ice
 does not extend below the surface when the phaenomenon is
 well developed; and it is well known that the degree of cold
 necessary for freezing water is never observed in this latitude
 at a greater depth than one or two inches.
    5. In seeking for a cause of the elevation of the fluid, the
 first suggestion which presented itself to my mind was the
 well-known and remarkable expansion which water undergoes
 before congelation commences. In this we have a vera causa,
 of sufficient universality and acting in the right direction, to
 account for the phaenomenon, and yet perfectly consistent with
 an important invariable concomitant circumstance, namely, the
 unfrozen condition of the clay. But a little reflection very
 soon convinced me that it must play a subordinate part in the
production of the phaenomenon. A simple calculation is suffi
cient to place the inadequacy of this cause in a striking point
 of view. According to the recent and very satisfactory ex
 periments of Joule and Playfair, the maximum density of water
is at 39°1 of Fahrenheit's scale (Phil. Mag. 3rd Series,
 vol. xxx. p. 41 et seq. 1847). The very elaborate series of
experiments of Prof. Hällström show that the mean expansion
in volume between the point of maximum density and the
freezing-point (32° F.) is about 412 parts in 10,000,000
 (Thomson On Heat, &c., p. 28. Lond. 1830). Hence it is
 obvious, that if, by the unyielding character of the capillary
tubes, the whole of the increase of volume contributed to the
elongation of the column, the length of the column of water
requisite for furnishing 3 inches of ice through the operation
of this cause would be about 72,815 inches, or nearly 6088
feet". This reasoning is based upon the assumption, that the
temperature of the water at the orifice of the tube is at 32°,
while that at the other extremity of the column (viz. 6068
feet below the surface) is at 39° 1 F.; the only supposition
consistent with the absence of ice beneath.               As the effects of
cold penetrate but a comparatively short distance below the
surface of the earth, the insufficiency of this cause is too appa
rent to deserve further notice.
    Having thus shown the inadequacy of several presumed
causes to produce the remarkable phaenomena under consi
deration, it is of course expected that we should offer some ex
   * According to an extensive series of experiments made by M. Despretz,
the mean expansion of water between the points of maximum density and
freezing, is 482.6 parts in 10,000,000. (Wide Pouillet's Eléments de Physique

planation of them. Before doing so, it may be well to premise,
that whatever may be thought to be the proximate cause of
these phaenomena, all the rules of philosophizing require us to
look to the earth for the supply of fluid, and to the influence
of cold for the elevating force. We have seen that the effect
is invariably connected with cold, that it increases or dimi
nishes with the intensity of the frigorific influence, and that it
is proportional to the depression of temperature in all cases
of unimpeded action. The whole difficulty lies, therefore, in
ascertaining the modus operandi of this cause.
   After considerable reflection, we venture to offer the fol
lowing as the most probable explanation of the phaenomenon.
Let us suppose a portion of tolerably compact porous and
warm earth, saturated with moisture, to be exposed to the
influence of a cold-producing cause. The soil being an indif
ferent conductor of heat, only a very superficial stratum would
be reduced to the freezing-point. As the resistance to lateral
expansion is less at the surface than it is at a sensible depth
below, the effect of the first freezing would be to render the
apices of the capillary tubes or pores conical or pyramidal.
The sudden congelation of the water filling the conical capil
laries in the superior stratum would produce a rapid and for
cible expansion, which, being resisted by the unyielding walls
of the cone, would not only protrude, but project or detach
and throw out the thread-like columns of ice in the direction
of least resistance, or perpendicular to the surface. This
 would leave the summits of the tubes partially empty,—a con
dition essential to the development of capillary force. Under
 these circumstances, capillary attraction would draw up warm
water from beneath, which, undergoing congelation, would in
like manner elevate the column of ice still higher; and thus
the process would go on as long as the cold continued to
operate on unobstructed capillaries supplied with sufficient
water from below. It will be remarked, that this explanation
makes the whole process of protrusion to take place in a stra
tum of earth of almost inappreciable thickness. It also pre
sumes that the protruding force acts paroxysmally. Does not
the wavy striated structure of the icy columns clearly indicate
that the freezing process is intermittent? It is obvious that
 the unfrozen state of the soil is maintained through the opera
tion of two causes; to wit, the unceasing supply of warm water
from below, and the large amount of latent heat evolved during
the continued process of congelation. These two causes ap
pear to be fully adequate to explain this remarkable fact.
    The foregoing view explains why the phaenomenon does not
 take place on hard-beaten earth and on very loose soils; for,

340       Dr. LeConte on a remarkable Exudation of Ice
in the one case, the compactness of the superficial stratum not
only diminishes the porosity, but renders the resistance to
lateral expansion greater at the surface than it is below, and
consequently interferes with the protrusion of the column of
ice in the right direction; while in the other case, the open
ness of the soil prevents the formation of tubes possessing un
yielding sides, a condition which is equally essential to the
process. When the intensity of the cold is sufficiently great
to freeze the soil, the process is arrested, because the capillary
tubes are closed, and a resistance opposed to further protru
sion. The porous appearance presented by the subjacent
clay when the icy columns are removed is doubtless referable
to the enlargement of the orifices of the minute capillaries,
caused by the sudden expansion of the successive portions of
fluid as they were frozen at the surface.
    If the above is the true explanation of the phaenomenon,
we should expect, from a priori considerations, that in higher
latitudes, where the cold is more intense and persistent, the
conditions of its manifestation would exist only during the
early part of winter, before the ground became deeply and
permanently frozen; or else only in certain favourable situa
tions,—as in the neighbourhood of warm springs, and perhaps
along the margins of unfrozen streams,—where local causes
preserved the soil in a proper condition. Are not facts in
accordance with this view?
    The   £ explanation appears to            afford a satisfactory
interpretation of a   £ remarkable      experiment recorded by
Sir John Leslie, which is so nearly the counterpart of what
takes place in nature, that we cannot forbear citing it on this
occasion. He says, in treating of artificial congelation,
“When very feeble powers of        £              are employed, a
most singular and beautiful appearance is, in course of time,
slowly produced. If a pan of porous earthenware, from four
to six inches wide, be filled to the utmost with common water
till it rise above the lips, and planted above a dish of ten or
twelve inches diameter, containing a body of sulphuric acid,
and then a broad round receiver placed over it; on reducing
the included air to some limit between the twentieth and the
fifth part of its usual density, according to the coldness of the
apartment, the liquid mass will in the space of an hour or two
become entwined with icy shoots, which gradually enlarge and
acquire more solidity, but always leave the fabric loose and
unfrozen below.      The icy crust which covers the rim, now
receiving continual accessions from beneath, rises perpendi
cularly by insensible degrees. From each point on the rough
surface of the vessel, filaments of ice, like bundles of spun

                      Jrom the Stems of Vegetables.                       341
glass, are protruded, fed by the humidity conveyed through
its substance, and forming in their aggregation a fine silvery
surface, analogous to that of fibrous gypsum or satin spar.”
 (Supplement to Encyclopaedia Britannica, vol. iii. art. Cold,
p. 258.) The same elevating cause must have been in opera
tion during the progress of this experiment, which produces
the protrusion of icy columns from the earth".
    The phaenomenon manifested on certain plants is every way
 analogous to that relating to the protrusion of ice from certain
kinds of soil, and admits of the same explanation. The porous
 pith furnishes a constant supply of warm water from the earth,
 while the wedge-shaped medullary rays secure the mechanical
 conditions necessary for the development of a projectile force
 in the proper direction. In proof of this it may be remarked,
that the medullary rays are very conspicuous in the Pluchea;
 and when the stalk is split by the freezing of the water within,
the fissure is observed to follow their course. The development
of the phaenomenon is arrested when the pith becomes frozen,
for the obvious reason that the consequent splitting of the stem
destroys the arrangement of resisting tubes. For a like reason
it is exhibited lower down the stalk when it becomes rifted;
for the conditions essential to its production are there found.
 When the cold-producing cause is not too intense, the stalk
is not frozen, for the same reason that the ground remains
unfrozen under similar circumstances. The reason why the
phaenomenon is manifested only in certain kinds of plants,
probably arises from several peculiarities in their physical con
dition. They must be porous to furnish an abundant supply
of fluid; they must be herbaceous and annual to secure me
dullary rays of sufficient size and openness; and it is probable
that all vital action must have ceased, in order that the fluid
   * Since writing the above, my attention has been called to analogous
phaenomena developed during the crystallization of certain salts.
   If the smaller portions of the soft and spongy roots of our conmon cy
press (Cupressus disticha, Mich.) be thoroughly soaked in a solution of
nitrate of potash, and exposed to the drying influence of the air at ordinary
temperatures, the whole surface will in process of time be covered with a
most delicate investment of hair-like crystalline fibres. They are always
observed to emanate at right angles to the convex surface of the root in
the form of radial prolongations, and often extend out from the wood to a
distance equal to, or exceeding its semi-diameter. When brushed off by
the finger, a fresh crop speedily appears. A similar exudation of crystal
line filaments of sulphate of zinc is frequently observed on the surface of
the porous earthenware cups used in Grove's battery, when they are not
carefully washed. It is obvious that these phaenomena are identical in
their origin with the protrusion of the columns of ice from the earth, ex
cepting that in the latter case the influence of cold is essential to the pro
cess of crystallization.

342 Dr. LeConte on a remarkable Exudation of Ice.
which is elevated from the soil may be unmixed with the
proper juices of the plants, a mixture which would interfere
with congelation.
   We conclude these observations with a few remarks on the
teleological bearing of the phaenomenon which we have been
considering. The laws of the effect of temperature on water
are so remarkable in their adaptation to the beneficial course
of things at the earth's surface, that they have never failed to
impress the student of Nature with the most profound admi
ration of the wisdom and goodness of the Great Designer.
Among these, the infinite importance of the latency of heat in
the oeconomy of nature is one of the most striking. In the
phaenomenon which we have had under consideration in rela
tion to the protrusion of icy columns from the earth, we re
cognize an extension of this law, the importance of which it is
scarcely possible for us to over-estimate. By an admirable
combination of the laws of expansion and capillary attraction,
a vast amount of water is brought to the surface of the soil,
and there disengages its latent heat in the act of congelation,
thereby softening the rigours of winter, and preserving the
roots or bulbs beneath the surface of the ground from the
destructive effects of cold. Even on those portions of the soil
where the phaenomenon does not manifest itself in the pro
trusion of columns of ice, it is extremely probable that the
same law operates to a more limited extent. This seems to
be proved by a fact, which must have come under the obser
vation of every one; namely, that the amount of moisture
found at the surface of the ground after a thaw is vastly greater
than was present before congelation took place. This is the
case, under circumstances which are incompatible with the
idea of the deposition of dew; the water must therefore have
been elevated from the depths of the earth. The philosopher
who loves to dwell on causes and effects, and to trace the deep
processes of thought by which the great purposes of nature
have been revealed, both in the heavens above and in the
physical condition of the earth on which he treads, will be
gratified to discover in every portion of the universe those
prospective arrangements, compensations, minute adaptations,
and comprehensive inter-dependencies, which characterize the
 works of an omniscient Architect.

IF.    in order to find the terms depending on sin (p-6) and
      cos (p-61), we combine u2 and v2 with u1 and vi, there
will result terms with constant coefficients containing the factor
a1a2. And though they might in many places be larger than
those before found containing a”, they would be very much
less than those of the first order; and, moreover, we may
suppose them included in those terms of the first order which
have constant coefficients.       Besides, if we take account of
terms thus formed, we ought also to take account of the terms
depending on sin 3(p–63) and cos 3(?-68), which must be at

    If for any particular place we can make a near estimate of
the comparative values of D1 and Ei, we may perhaps be able
to put the expressions of these quantities under a better form.
    It is evident from (17.) that they may vary very greatly
from one place to another. If the diurnal equation be very
small or insensible on our shores, it is possible that it may be
very large in some other places. But this will chiefly depend
upon the form of the shores and of the bottom of the sea.
    It may happen in some places that the supposition on which
we have obtained approximate values of F2, 3, may not be
admissible. In that case we must have recourse to the equa
tions (11.), and endeavour to deduce the values of these quan
tities from them otherwise. The values of these quantities in
this theory have been deduced from a supposition which we
know to be true on our own shores.

for the effect of the disturbing force of the sea arising from

value of y given above, resulting from the action of the planet.
This force, therefore, if sensible, makes no alteration in the
general form of y, but only in the value of the numerical co
efficients. This investigation may also include the irregu
larity of the action of gravity arising from high mountains and
shores, which may in some places produce as much effect as
the disturbing force of the water itself. But the effect of these
causes is generally insensible; it is therefore unnecessary to
dwell upon it, '' the more so as we are not able to compute
its exact numerical amount.
   If the additional terms in the value of y which have been
found in these two papers be very small in some places, as

     XLIII. On the Nitroprussides, a New Class of Salts.
           By Dr. LYoN PLAYFAIR, F.R.S., F.C.S.
                        [Concluded from p. 283.]
SECTION IV.—Action of Caustic Alkalies on the Nitroprussides.
25.        HEN a dissolved caustic alkali, such as potash or
            soda, is added to a solution of a nitroprusside, the
dark red colour of the solution changes to an orange-yellow. If
both solutions have been moderately dilute, no oxide of iron is
precipitated, nor is ammonia evolved. The addition of alcohol
to the orange-yellow liquid causes the precipitation of an aque
ous solution of a new salt. This salt may be procured in a solid
state as follows. Nitroprusside of potassium is dissolved in
water and double its volume of alcohol is added.          Caustic
potash is now added to this solution, and a yellow curdy pre
cipitate is obtained. This precipitate is washed with alcohol
to free it from an excess of either of the reagents, but it is
almost impossible to remove the last traces. The salt is now

                         a New Class of Salts.                 349
  pressed between folds of bibulous paper and dried in vacuo
  over sulphuric acid. It may be called nitroprusside of
  potassium and potash.
     This salt is of a bright yellow colour and of crystalline ap
  pearance. It is very sparingly soluble in alcohol, but very
  soluble in water, to which it gives a strong alkaline reaction.
  It precipitates salts of lead of a fine yellow colour like the
  chromate of lead. Salts of iron are precipitated of a yellowish
  brown, and salts of copper of a brown colour. On the addi
  tion of an acid, the excess of potash is removed and nitro
  prusside of potassium remains in solution; the salt therefore
  is a compound of a nitroprusside with potash. It will not
  crystallize in vacuo, its solution decomposing with the depo
  sition of an oxide of iron, and with the escape of a gas which
  communicates a pink colour to the sulphuric acid used for
  the evaporation in the air-pump. The salt heated in a tube
  evolves nitric oxide and ammonia, and leaves a black residue
  which yields to water an alkaline solution of a nitroprusside.
  When its solution in water is boiled, complete decomposition
  takes place, a ferrocyanide, oxide of iron, nitrite and oxalate
  of potash being produced.
     It is almost impossible to obtain it free from uncombined
  nitroprusside, which is observed to remain in solution when a
  salt of lead is added to it. If potash in excess be used, it is
  equally difficult to remove the excess by washing. The ana
  lyses therefore give only approximative results; they were
  made in the usual way by decomposing the salt with fuming
  sulphuric acid.
      I. 17.350 grs. gave 3.440 grs. Fe O*and 14:32 KO, SO’.
     II. 37.870 grs. gave 7.345 grs. Fe O’ and 30.53 KO, SO”.
  The combustions were made with chromate of lead.
       I. 14.075 grs. gave 7.765 grs. CO and 1.015 gr, HO.
       II. 13.71 grs. gave 7.490 grs. CO° and 0.985 gr, HO.
     The samples of salt analysed were made at different times.

      Hence this salt differs from nitroprusside of potassium by
   containing 4 atoms of potash attached. Its formula is there
   fore Fe" Cy”3NO, K*-#4KO--8HO. There is little doubt

 350              Dr. Playfair on the Nitroprussides,
 that it might, when quite free from nitroprusside, contain an
 additional equivalent of potash.
    It has been stated that a solution of this salt is decomposed
 on boiling. Oxide of iron falls down, nitrogen escapes, and
 the solution is now found to contain ferrocyanide of potassium,
 nitrite of potash and traces of oxalate of potash.                   -
    26. The products of transformation were determined (1)
 by precipitating the ferrocyanide by alcohol; (2) by adding
 nitrate of lime to precipitate the oxalate*, which was always
 accompanied by a minute quantity of a pink compound con
 taining cyanogen and iron; (3) by examining the liquid which
 remained, and was found to evolve nitric oxide on            the addition
 of an acid. It gave a precipitate with nitrate of silver, which,
 though sparingly soluble in cold water, dissolved in hot water
 and crystallized on cooling; 13:25 grs. of the crystalline salt
 thus obtained, treated with hydrochloric acid, gave 12:33 grs.
 chloride of silver, or 70.03 per cent. Nitrite of silver (AgO,
 NO”) contains 70.12 per cent.
    In examining the relative quantities of these products of
 transformation, recourse was first had to the yellow salt itself.
 But as this generally contained a little nitroprusside, and as
 the products of decomposition varied with the period of ebul
 lition, on account of the slower action from the insufficient
 quantity of alkali, it was found more accurate to examine the
 transformations by acting upon a solution of nitroprusside
with an excess of alkali. 'W', therefore giving the details
 of the experiments on the yellow salt itself, some of the general
 results may be stated; from these it will be seen that the
quantities of oxide of iron and of prusside produced vary ac
cording to the conditions of the experiment, principally ac
cording to the longer or shorter period of ebullition. 100
parts of the yellow salt gave, on boiling its aqueous solution,—
                                       I.      II.    III.     IV.      V.

Ferrocyanide of potassium 60.86 60-59 59.48 68.83 64.50
    In all these cases there was more or less nitroprusside of
potassium undecomposed. The amount of oxalate of potash
found in solution varied from 0.97 to 1.5 per cent.
    The transformation was now examined in the following
   * To prove that this was an oxalate, a portion was precipitated by ni
trate of lead from the solution after precipitation by alcohol. The preci
£ was        of a pink colour, and was now decomposed by sulphuretted
  ydrogen, neutralized by pure carbonate of soda, and again precipitated as
a lead salt, which was now quite white. Calcined with nitrate of ammonia,
1:660 gr. gave 1:250 gr. oxide of lead, or 75.3 per cent. Oxalate of lead
contains 75.5 per cent.

                      a New Class of Salts.                  351
manner. A weighed quantity of a nitroprusside was dissolved
in water and boiled, caustic potash or caustic soda (according
as the nitroprusside was a salt of potassium or sodium) being
added to the boiling solution, until a drop taken out gave,
after being neutralized, no purple colour with a sulphide.
The precipitated oxide of iron was now collected and weighed.
The filtrate was precipitated by alcohol, and the prusside
collected and determined on a weighed filter. The filtrate
was now neutralized with acetic acid, and chloride of calcium
added, but the oxalate of lime was generally not in sufficient
quantity to collect and weigh, mere traces being obtained. It
was now attempted to estimate the amount of nitrate by the
process described by Nesbit for analysing nitrates”, that is,
by converting its nitrogen into ammonia by zinc and muriatic
acid, the hydrogen being slowly evolved. The ammonia thus
formed was separated by distillation with caustic soda, col
lected in muriatic acid and determined as chloride of platinum
and ammonia. This process did not however give constant
results in my hands, probably from the difficulty of preventing
the escape of nitric oxide on adding an acid to the nitrite.
The nitrite was therefore determined by loss. In one case
only did I, by the above process, obtain a result approaching
the quantity of nitrite in solution.
   17:24 grs. of nitroprusside of sodium were dissolved in
water, the solution was boiled and caustic soda added, keeping
the solution distinctly alkaline after ebullition had continued
for some time. It yielded 0.92 gr: peroxide of iron, and
14.85 grs. ferrocyanide of sodium; the residual liquid, treated
according to Nesbit's plan, only gave 2.57 grs. platinum salt.
         Iron precipitated . . . 3.73 per cent.
          Iron in prusside . . . 15:08 per cent.
                                        18'81
   Hence all the iron, except about 0.5 per cent, is found in
the oxide of iron and in the prusside; the remainder is pro
bably in the minute quantity of pink salt alluded to above.
The carbon contained in the prusside amounts to 20-3; so
that the total quantity of cyanogen has gone down in that
form, the carbon in the nitroprusside being 20.0 per cent.
   It will be seen that the iron precipitated as peroxide of iron
is one-fourth that retained in the ferrocyanide. The following
equation expresses the transformation:
2(Fe Cyla 3NO, Na')+9NaO=4(Fe"Cy", Na')+3NaO, NO”
                           + Fe2O3 + 3N.

to form peroxide, which it receives at the expense of the ni

either by smell or by turmeric paper.
    SECTION V.—Action of an Alkaline Sulphide on a Nitro
                              prusside.
    27. It has been repeatedly mentioned, that when solutions
of nitroprusside of potassium or sodium and of the corre
sponding sulphides are mixed together, the most magnificent
purple colour is produced. This colour however is very trans
itory and cannot be preserved in an aqueous solution. The
purple or blue compound may however be obtained in a solid
state when alcoholic solutions of the two salts are employed.
In order to obtain it in this state, nitroprusside of sodium is
dissolved in the smallest possible quantity of water, and to this
solution is added four or five times its bulk of alcohol.      An
alcoholic solution of neutral sulphide of sodium (the sulphide
obtained by reducing the sulphate with hydrogen) is now
added to the alcoholic solution of nitroprusside, the addition
being stopped before the supernatant liquid gives a decidedly
black reaction on lead paper. The mixed solutions acquire a
magnificent purple blue colour. On stirring the mixture, an
aqueous solution of the purple compound falls down in oily
drops. After this has settled, the alcohol is decanted, and
the blue solution is washed repeatedly and quickly with alcohol
by decantation. It is now, as rapidly as posssible, put in
vacuo over sulphuric acid, when it soon parts with its water
and becomes solid. It usually dries to a dirty green powder,
which is a mixture of the purple compound with the products
of its decomposition. It may however, though this is rare,
'     quite unchanged in its character, being still of a fine blue
colour and dissolving entirely in water with all its magnificent

purple blue shade. It cannot then be dried in the water-bath,
where it quickly decomposes and becomes green.
    The following analysis was made on two portions which
were dried in the air-pump, until they ceased to lose weight
and had all their properties unchanged. They were oxidized
by nitrate of ammonia; the residue was dissolved in nitric
acid. The iron was precipitated as peroxide, the sulphur
estimated as sulphate of barytes, and the soda as a sulphate.
    I. 14-210 grs. gave 3420 Fe O*, 5.710 BaO, SO", and 9:38
NaO, SO3.
    II. 8-99 grs. gave 3.88 BaO, SO", and 6.62 NaO, SO", the
iron being accidentally lost.
    The combustion was made by chromate of lead, peroxide
of lead being used to arrest the sulphurous acid.
      I. 620 grs. gave 3.855 grs. CO” and 0.440 gr. HO.
    II. 10.565 grs. gave 6'810 grs. CO°, and 0.675 gr. HO.

    In such a variable compound as this, close results can
 scarcely be looked for in two analyses. As an approximation,
 however, it will be seen that the iron is to the sodium as 5:8,
 and to the sulphur as 5: 3.
    The blue unchanged compound gives with protosulphate
 of iron a beautiful precipitate of the same purple blue colour
 as itself, but this is decomposed by washing. With salts of
 lead it gives a brownish-yellow precipitate, with salts of copper
 a brown precipitate, both these being obviously products of
 decomposition.
    28. The purple blue compound dissolved in water speedily
 becomes red, and when in this state, a salt of lead throws
 down a pinkish red precipitate. This red solution however
 soon decomposes, a brownish precipitate falling, and the yel
    * It should be stated that in many analyses of this compound in its par
 tially decomposed state, the most discordant results were obtained. The
 two analyses here adduced were made on the only specimens which appear
 to be unchanged; in all the other cases the compound had become green
 and therefore was decomposed, as it no longer dissolved in water with its
 characteristic purple tint.

 3.54          Dr. Playfair on the Nitroprussides,
 low colour due to a prusside being seen in the solution. If
 the sulphide originally employed contained sulphuretted hy
drogen, a soluble prussian blue is also found in the liquid.
 During these changes, ammonia, hydrocyanic acid, and a gas
possessing the properties of nitrogen are given off. In fact,
on mixing the solutions of sulphide and nitroprusside, it is
difficult, even by keeping the solutions quite cold, to prevent
the formation of a little ammonia and escape of nitrogen.
The solution of the purple compound in water decomposes
even under the air-pump, depositing the brown precipitate,
and it does so immediately when it is boiled.
    When the solution is filtered from the brown precipitate,
the addition of alcohol separates ferrocyanide of sodium. The
alcoholic filtrate strikes a blood-red colour with a persalt of
iron, and with sulphuric acid evolves nitric oxide, which is
immediately rendered sensible by a protosalt of iron, a nitrite
being thus shown to be in solution. Ammonia cannot be
detected in the solution, neither does it appear to any great
extent when the transformation takes place in the cold, though
it always does so when ebullition is used to hasten the trans
formation. It therefore appears to be the product of an after
aCtlOn.
   The brown precipitate is first to be examined. It is found
to consist of peroxide of iron and sulphur, the latter remaining
when the former is dissolved out by an acid. It was analysed
by oxidation with nitromuriatic acid. 7.21 grs. gave 16'90
grs, sulphate of barytes, equal to 2.83 grs. of sulphur, and
4.22 grs. peroxide of iron, the rest being water. Hence the
proportion of sulphur to iron in equivalents is nearly as 4:3;
the proportion for 2.33 sulphur would yield 3.0 iron, while
2.95 was found by the experiment.
   It was now desirable to ascertain what proportion of iron
was thrown down as ferrocyanide and how much remained in
the brown precipitate. For this purpose a portion of a pre
paration, which had become green by standing in the air
pump, was first analysed in order to ascertain the relative
proportion of its constituents, and it was then dissolved in
water and boiled.
    14.41 grs, gave 6'93 grs. sulphate of barytes, 17.68 grs.
gave 3:55 grs. peroxide of iron and 10:00 grs. sulphate of
soda. 6-025 grs. gave 3:31 grs. carbonic acid and 0.820 gr.
water. Hence this changed purple compound, before com

     11:31 grs. were now boiled in water, and 0.94 gr. of the
  brown precipitate was obtained by filtration, and 5.90 grs. of
  prusside of sodium were precipitated by alcohol. Hence of
  the total quantity of 1:58 gr. of iron present 1.08 gr. was found
  in the ferrocyanide, the remainder being in the brown precipi
  tate. As the ferrocyanide of sodium is of constant compo
  sition, which the brown mixture is not, the iron in the latter
  is here estimated by loss and would amount to 0:50 gr. The
  proportion in equivalents is nearly, though not exactly, as 7:3,
  which would have made the iron in the brown precipitate
  0.46 gr. instead of 0:50 gr.
     Taking these proportions as leading to a general view of
  the transformation, it may be expressed by the following equa
  tlOn :
  2(Fe? Cy”3NO+8Na+3S)+2HO=7(Na', Fe Cy”)
       +(Na, Cy S*)+(NaO, NO”)+Fe"O44-S4+2HCy+2N.
     The only point in which this transformation does not agree
  with experiment, is in the supposed production of ferroso
  ferric oxide, whereas, when the brown precipitate is washed
  with acid, only peroxide of iron unaccompanied by protoxide
  of iron passes through. It is therefore probable that the oxi
  dation of this oxide may give rise to the small quantity of
  ammonia observed, the oxygen from decomposed water uni
  ting with it, and the nascent hydrogen with nitrogen to form
  ammonia. Allowing this to be the explanation of the dis
  agreement with experiment, the following scheme may render
  the above equation more immediately intelligible. Two equi
  valents of the blue compound with 2 equivs. of water, by
  boiling, are resolved into
                 7 equivs. ferrocyanide of sodium.
                 1 equiv. sulphocyanide of sodium.
                 1 equiv. nitrite of soda.
                 1 equiv. oxide of iron (FeO+ Fe O”).
                 4 equivs. sulphur.
                 2 equivs. hydrocyanic acid.
                2 equivs. nitrogen.

356            Dr. Playfair on the Nitroprussides,
And probably the ferroso-ferric oxide is transformed at the
expense of the oxygen of water into ferric oxide, the hydrogen
forming ammonia with nitrogen,
             6 FeO +3HO + N=3 Fe2O3+NH3.
   29. In giving the above equation, the blue sulphur com
pound was supposed to consist of nitroprusside of sodium with

   The approximation is sufficiently near when the difficulty
of getting the substance in at all a stable state is considered.
Two views might be taken of the constitution of this singular
compound (1), that it is nitroprusside of sodium with 3 equivs.
of sulphuret of sodium attached—
             Fe Cy”3NO, 5Na+3NaS+6HO;
but this would scarcely account for its extreme facility of de
composition; it may therefore be supposed that caustic soda
is attached to the salt, as we have seen that it can be, in stu
dying the action of alkalies on the nitroprussides, and that the
sulphur has taken the place of the oxygen, thus:—
             Fe Cy”3NS, 5Na+3NaO +6HO.
   Either of these formulae would suit the analysis; in support
of the latter may be adduced the fact observed by Gregory,
that sulphuret of nitrogen in the presence of caustic alkalies
acquires a deep transitory amethyst colour, which, on disap
pearing, evolved ammonia, a description exactly accordant
with the present case.
    Action of Sulphuretted Hydrogen on the Nitroprussides.
   30. Sulphuretted hydrogen decomposes the soluble nitro
prussides. The products of transformation are most conve
niently obtained in the following way:-Nitroprusside of
sodium is dissolved in the smallest possible quantity of cold
water, and three or four times its volume of alcohol is added
to the solution. Sulphuretted hydrogen is now passed through

                       a New Class of Salts.                 357
this alcoholic solution. Sulphur, prussian blue, and ferrocy
anide of sodium, are very gradually precipitated; the action,
however, is very slow, and must be long continued. The alco
holic solution is now of a reddish olive-brown colour. When
the sulphuretted hydrogen has ceased to act, this supernatant
brownish liquid gives no coloration when mixed with an alka
line sulphide. If allowed to stand for a few hours, it deposits
a little of the precipitates which it held in solution. After
this the brown solution is found to contain neither ferrocy
anide nor nitroprusside of sodium; a persalt of iron is slightly
deepened in colour when mixed with it, showing the presence
of a mere trace of a sulphocyanide. When this reddish-brown
solution is evaporated in the water-bath, it deposits oxide of
iron and sulphur, and becomes decomposed. Evaporated in
vacuo over sulphuric acid, it deposits, when nearly dry, black
crystalline needles, but these seem to be a product of decom
position, and are mixed with oxide of iron and other sub
 stances; attempts were therefore made to ascertain the com
 position of the original substance by precipitating its solution
 by metallic salts. Bichloride of mercury produces a brown
 precipitate, sulphate of copper a pinkish-brown, and nitrate of
 silver a black precipitate. But these were obviously products
 of decomposition, for during the precipitation nitric oxide is
 abundantly evolved. This is especially the case in the preci
 pitate with silver. If that precipitate, after being washed, be
 now mixed with a small quantity of hydrochloric acid to take
 up the silver, sulphuretted hydrogen is evolved, protochloride
 of iron and abundance of sulphocyanic acid are now found in
 solution; the first is recognized by the prussian blue formed
 on adding red prusside of potassium, the second by the blood
 red colour which it strikes with perchloride of iron. When
 nitrate of silver is added to the red-brown solution, the black
 precipitate already alluded to falls down, but at the same time
 the supernatant liquor had a reddish-brown colour; on ex
 amining this it was found to contain a persalt and protosalt of
 iron, the dark coloration being due to the escaping nitric
 oxide. The amount of sulphur precipitated during the pass
 age of sulphuretted hydrogen through the nitroprusside is
 about 17 per cent.; the amount of ferrocyanide of sodium and
 of prussian blue has been found to vary much.
     From the difficulty of obtaining the products of transfor
 mation in a pure state, I have not yet been able to make direct
 quantitative examinations of the various substances formed;
 it is therefore impossible to express the transformation in the
 form of an equation. From some experiments now in pro
 gress, I trust, however, to overcome those difficulties which

  358               Dr. Playfair on the Nitroprussides,
 have prevented the completion of this study in time for the
 presentation of this paper.
               On the Constitution of the Nitroprussides.
    31. In the preceding part of the paper the analyses of the
 nitroprussides led to the extremely complicated formula Fe"
 C*N* O*R*. This formula was a priori very improbable,
 and naturally led to the belief that an error in the estimation
 of the carbon forced its adoption. In fact, if 25 instead of
 24 equivs. of carbon were present, the formula would resolve
 itself into the much simpler expression Fe°C*N*O R*. It
 is therefore important to review the evidence, in order to
 see whether the simple proportion of iron to carbon, 1 : 5,
 might be derived from it. The following table exhibits the
proportion of iron and carbon found in the analyses of the
 respective salts:—

    Now the proportion of 1 equiv. of iron to 5 equivs. of carbon
would require the proportion 28:30. This difference is too
great to be due to any errors of observation, especially when
it is remembered that these, in the case of a body containing
much nitrogen, tend to increase and not to diminish the ap
parent quantity of carbon. The actual proportion found,
28:28:9, indicates, in equivalents, 5 equivs. iron to 24
equivs. carbon; this proportion would require 28:28:8; the
slight excess found is in the direction of the known errors of
observation.
   These considerations forced the adoption of the complex
formula given above.             It will also be seen, from an examina
tion of the analytical details, that the quantity of nitrogen
corresponds to 6 equivs. for every 10 equivs. of carbon, or 15
equivs. for the 24 equivs, of carbon required by the formula.

                       a New Class of Salts.                  359
As 12 of these are in the state of cyanogen, as shown both by
the transformation of the nitroprussides by alkalies and by
sulphides, the remaining 3 equivs. must be in the form of an
oxide of nitrogen. But the loss on the analyses does not
admit the supposition that the oxide is nitric oxide, as might
have been supposed, neither do the transformations counte
nance this idea. The oxygen is in the proportion of 3 equivs.
for every 3 equivs. of nitrogen; the nitrogen not present as
cyanogen must exist as nitrous oxide. This is unusual, and
its functions must therefore be inquired into. It will at once
be seen that if nitrous oxide is supposed to substitute and play
the part of cyanogen, the iron and the non-electro-negative
bodies with which it is associated are present in the same pro
portion as in the hypothetical radical ferrocyanogen; 5 equivs.
ferrocyanogen have the formula Fe" Cy”; 1 equiv. of nitro
ferrocyanogen has the formula Fe" Cy”3NO. The nitro
prussides are therefore supposed to contain a ferrocyanogen
in which 3 equivs. of cyanogen are substituted by 3 equivs.
of nitrous oxide.
   32. But the proportion of the electro-positive element in
the nitroprussides is less than that existing either in the ferro
cyanides or ferridcyanides. Liebig supposes these two latter
compounds to differ by containing different radicals, one being
twice the atomic weight of the other. It would be equally
instructive to suppose that they both contain the same radical,
but that, as in the case of the different phosphoric acids, one
is quadribasic, while the other is tribasic.
    Quadribasic prussides, Fe"Cy"+4R, formula of ferrocya
       nides.
    Tribasic prussides, Fe°Cy"+3R, formula of ferridcyanides.
    Bibasic prussides, Fe°Cy"+2R, formula of undescribed
       compounds.
    With regard to the last class, its existence must be yet con
sidered hypothetical, but in searching for it, I have received
sufficient encouragement to enable me to hope that I shall
very shortly be able to establish it. Without presenting the
analytical evidence to this effect, it can only be adduced as a
probable hypothesis to explain the nitroprussides. The latter
class of salts may be supposed to correspond to a bibasic class
of prussides in which part of the cyanogen is replaced by
nitrous oxide. Thus 5(Fe Cy”+R)= Fe"Cy”+5R correspond
 to 1 equiv. of a nitroprusside, Fe" Cy”3NO+5R. The great
approximation of the latter formula to the more simple ex
pression Fe"Cy" NO+2R, renders it singular that the small
deficiency of carbon refuses to allow the formula to be thus

360        Mr. J. Glaisher's Remarks on the Weather
expressed. In such a case this supposed bibasic prusside and
the nitroprusside would stand in a very simple relation:
                       Fe Cys      +2R,
                       Fe? Cy"NO+2R.
   The complicated formula    £         by the analyses of all
the nitroprussides might be resolved into 2(Fe°Cy” NO+2R)
+(Fe Cy” NO+R), in which the latter member is constituted
on the same type, but more cyanogen is displaced by the ni
trous oxide. It will not excite surprise, after what has been
learned in the previous inquiry as to the obstinate manner in
which the nitroprussides unite with cyanides from which they
are not removable by any means tried, that a salt constituted
on the same type should unite with the true nitroprussides
and form an integrant conjugate compound which is not broken
up by crystallization. It appears therefore very probable that
the true formula of the nitroprussides may in reality be
Fe°Cy” NO+2R, and that further research may eliminate
this compound. Hitherto this has not been done, and the
only formula which correctly expresses the analysis is Fe"Cy”
3NO+5R, which on theoretical, but on no other grounds,
may be resolved into
           2(Fe°Cy” NO+2R)+(Fe Cy°NO+R).
   I trust soon to be able to present to the Society another
memoir on the prussides, which will confirm experimentally
some of the views theoretically supported in the present com
munication; but at present I submit the previous results with
a view of drawing attention to this interesting class of salts,
and with a perfect conviction that future research will sim
plify and explain the remarkably complex and unsatisfactory
formulae which I have been obliged to adopt, without believing
them to be the correct expression of the constitution of the
salts.
XLIV. Remarks on the Weather during the Quarter ending
   March 31, 1850. By JAMEs GLAISHER, Esq., F.R.S.,
   F.R.A.S., and of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich *.
     T the beginning and towards the end of the quarter there
       was much snow; the amount of rain was less than usual.
The weather was mild in February and severe towards the
end of March.
                  * Communicated by the Author.

        during the Quarter ending March 31, 1850.            361
   The mean daily temperatures of the air till January 24 were
below their average values; the mean deficiency was 4°6.
From January 25 to March 13 they were above their average
values; the mean excess was 5°.8; and from March 14 they
were below their average values; and the mean deficiency was
6°-2.
   The mean temperature of the air at Greenwich for the three
months ending February, constituting the three winter months,
was 39°:2; and that of the average from the seventy-nine pre
ceding winters was 37°6.
   For the month of January was 33°7, being 2°-0 less than the
average of the seventy-nine preceding years, and 3°8 less
than that of the preceding nine years.
   For the month of February was 44°7, exceeding that of
the average of the preceding seventy-nine years by 6'5, and
exceeding that of the preceding nine years by 5° 1.
   For the month of March was 39°-9, being less than that of
the average of seventy-nine years by 1°0, and less than that
of the preceding nine years by 2°5.
   The mean for the quarter was 39°4, exceeding the average
of seventy-nine years by 1° 2, and less than that of the pre
ceding nine years by 0°4.
   The mean temperature of evaporation at Greenwich
   For the month of January was 32°5; for February was
42°3; and for March was 37°0.         These values are 4°4 less,
5°.0 greater, and 2°.8 less than those of the averages of the
same months in the preceding eight years.
   The mean temperature of the dew-point at Greenwich
   For the months of January, February and March, were
29°5, 39°2 and 32°.7 respectively. These values are 5°7
below, 4° 1 above, and 3°.9 below respectively the averages of
the same months in the preceding eight years. The mean
value for the quarter was 33°8, and that for the preceding
eight years was 35°-6.
   The mean elastic force of vapour at Greenwich for the quarter
was 0.214 inch, being less than the average from the preceding
eight years by 0.023 inch.
   The mean weight of water in a cubic foot of air for the
quarter was 2.5 grains. The average from the preceding
eight years was 2.7 grains.
   The mean degree of humidity in January was 0.897, in Fe
bruary was 0.830, and in March was 0.770. The averages
from the eight preceding years were 0.901, 0-886 and 0.836
respectively.
   The mean reading of the barometer at Greenwich in January
 was 29.854 inches, in February was 29.828, and in March was

362        Mr. J. Glaisher's Remarks on the Weather
30.039. These readings are 0.088, 0.091, and 0.289 greater
respectively than the averages of the same months in the pre
ceding nine years.
   The reading of the barometer at Greenwich was 30-17 inches
on January 1; decreased to 29.31 by 10h A.M. on the 6th;
increased to 29.90 by the 13th; decreased to 29.27 by the
15th; increased to 29.86 by the 18th; decreased to 29.34         t
by the 19th; increased to 30.40 by the 22nd; decreased to
29-28 by 3 P.M. on the 26th; increased to 30.42 by the 27th
at 1" P.M., having passed the point 30.00 at midnight. This
great increase of 1:14 in twenty-two hours was very great.
The reading on the 28th was 29.74; increased to 30°22 by
the 30th; decreased to 28:80 by February 6; increased to
29.60 by Feb. 8; decreased to 29-30 by Feb. 9; increased to
30.00 by Feb. 10; decreased to 29.12 by the 12th, and in
creased to 30.00 by the 16th; and from this day till March 22,
with the single exception of March 3, the reading was above
30 inches. This high reading for so long a period is remark
able. On March 23 the reading was 29:39, which increased
to 30-01 by the 29th, and decreased to 29.67 by the end of
the month.
   The average weight of a cubic foot of air for the quarter,
under the average temperature, humidity and pressure, was
551 grains; being six grains greater than the average from
the eight preceding years.
   The rain fallen at Greenwich in January was 1:2 inch, in
February was 1-3, and in March was 0.8 respectively. The
falls for these three months on an average of thirty-four years,
are 1:6, 1:6 and 1.4 respectively.
   The average daily ranges of the readings of the thermometer
in air at the height of four feet above the soil, in January
was 8°5, in February was 11°-6, and in March was 16°4.
The averages for these three months from the preceding nine
years were 8° 4, 10°.0 and 13°4 respectively.
   The minimum readings of the thermometer on grass in Janu
ary was at or below 32° on twenty-four nights; the lowest was
12°8, and exceeded 32° on seven nights; the highest was
40°5. In February the readings were at or below 32° on
sixteen nights; the lowest was 19°, and exceeded 32° on
twelve nights; the highest was 44°. In March the reading
was at or below 32° on twenty-four nights; the lowest was
12°8, and exceeded 32° on seven nights; the highest was 40°.
   The temperature of the Thames water, from the observations
of Lieut. Sanders, R.N., Superintendent of the Dreadnought
Hospital Ship, was 32°4 in January, 41° 3 in February, and
41°:2 in March.

   The valuable series of observations taken at many of the
railway stations, and published daily in the Daily News, has
continued with great regularity. The working of this scheme
requires the assistance of all the railways. This has been most
liberally given by every company with the exception of the
East Lancashire, and Lancashire and Yorkshire, which com
panies alone have declined to join in this work of great utility.
   All the particulars received by this means and from various
other sources I lay on a map daily, from which the following
tables and remarks have been formed.

370        Mr. J. Glaisher’s Remarks on the Weather
   On January 1 the general direction of the wind was N.W.
 There was frost at all places, except near the south coast.
Jan. 2 and 3 were mild; fog in many places. There was a
gentle thaw on the 3rd. Jan. 4 was calm in many places, and
light airs in others. South of latitude 52° the general direc
tion was S. W.; between 52° and 53° it was W., and the air
passed in this direction across the country, and north of this
parallel it was S. Frost at Darlington only. Jan. 5 to 12
there was frequently a great diversity of direction of the wind.
Frost, fog and snow were general, particularly in the eastern
counties and in the north. Frequently the temperature was
 the lowest between the parallels of latitude of 52° and 53°.
There was no frost at Guernsey. Jan. 14, there were heavy
falls of snow in the northern and eastern counties.      A hard
wind was blowing from the N. and N.E. over the southern
parts of the country, described as a gale at Yarmouth. At
the same time the air was in gentle motion from the E. on
the north-east coast, which on meeting the high lands in
Cumberland was partly deflected up and partly down the
country. The air was calm at some places in the north.
Jan. 15, the direction of the wind south of latitude 53° was
uniformly N.E., with a heavy wind blowing; a hard wind was
blowing from the E. on the eastern side of the Cumberland
mountains, and on their western side its direction was from
the N. Frost everywhere, excepting Guernsey. Snow on
the east coast. Jan. 16, the general direction of the wind was
 N.E. Snow and frost as on the 15th. Jan. 17, fog, frost and
snow. Jan. 18, light airs in all directions. A hard frost,
except on the south coast. Jan. 19, in the north the direction
of the wind was principally E.; it was W. and S.W. between
the latitudes of 51#2 and 53%, and it was N.W. on the south
coast. A portion of the south-east coast was distinguished by
a gentle wind, another by a thick fog; at the same time, from
Portsmouth, round the south-west coast to Bristol, a hard
wind was blowing, described as a heavy gale at Exeter. A
rapid thaw everywhere. Jan. 21 to 25, the air was mostly in
gentle motion. A gentle thaw set in on the 23rd, and which
became general on the 25th. Jan. 26, on the south coast the
air was generally calm, or in gentle motion only from the W.
At Bridgewater was first felt a strong breeze from the S.W.,
which passed up the country, becoming stronger as it pro
ceeded, and described as a gale at Yarmouth, and so passed
to the North Sea. Above these parallels of latitude the air
was mostly calm.
   On Jan. 27 a heavy wind was blowing from the S., and
S.W., described as a gale at Oxford, and passed over Nor

          during the Quarter ending March 31, 1850.          371
folk to the North Sea. At Tamworth and Birmingham the
air was in gentle motion only. In the north, at the same
time, a strong wind was blowing from the Irish Sea, but which
was not felt east of the Cumberland mountains, except at
places of a considerable elevation, as at Durham. There was
a rapid thaw in the south. Jan. 29 to 31, the thaw proceeded,
and the air was in gentle motion.
    On Feb. I the general direction of the wind was S.W. in
the southern counties, and it was S. on the east coast and in
the northern counties. Rain was falling all over the country.
On Feb. 2 and 4 the general direction of the wind was S.W.
There were slight frosts at Crewe and at Darlington.
    On Feb. 6 there was a heavy gale from the N.W. This
gale raged in Ireland and on the Welsh coast.
    On a careful reference to an excellent map, and a re-ex
amination of my note-book, containing observations on the
situation of the stations made during my progress through
the country for the purpose of organizing the scheme now in
operation, I find that the variations, both of the strength and
direction of the wind, were owing to local circumstances.
 Starting from the north, and confining myself to the western
side of the high range of mountains, extending, with many de
viations east and west, from Edinburgh to a little below Derby,
 I find at Dundee a gentle breeze only is recorded. This is
possibly attributable to a high range of mountains, whose
 direction is from the S.W. to the N.E., and situated imme
 diately above Dundee, and which would shelter it from a N.W.
gale, such as that we are now investigating. At Glasgow and
Lanark, places open for miles round in a N.W. direction, a
 storm is described. At Beattock there was a heavy gale; this
 place is encompassed by the Moffat hills, forming the highest
 ground in the south of Scotland, the highest amongst them ex
 ceeding 3000 feet above the level of the sea. Proceeding south
 wards, at Shap a storm was raging. This place is situated to
 the north of a ridge of mountains extending across the country
 from Whitehaven to Appleby, and from its situation is much
 exposed to a gale from the N.W. and W. At both Lancaster
 and Manchester a gale, and at Liverpool a hard wind, was
recorded; the direction at these places was W. These places
 are open to the Irish Sea. At Conway a storm from the S.
 is recorded; the place is sheltered by a range of mountains
 to the east of it. At Holyhead there was      £y      gale from
the N.W. At Crewe and Tamworth there was a heavy gale
from the N.W. By reference to the map, Crewe is much
exposed, and Tamworth is open from the N.N.W. Starting
again from the N., on the eastern side of the mountains, at

372        Mr. J. Glaisher’s Remarks on the Weather
Berwick, which is sheltered on all sides, with the exception
of that open to the E., a strong breeze is recorded. At Dur
ham and at Darlington a hard wind was recorded; but both
these places, though at a considerable elevation above the sea,
are protected from the N.W., at a distance, by the main ridge
of mountains extending down the country. At Hartlepool, a
place situated on the sea-coast, there is no mention of wind
stronger than ordinary. At York there was a gale; at Whitby
a strong breeze, which probably is protected by the mountains
on the N.W. of it.     Thus it will be seen, that, whilst a furious
and destructive gale was raging on the western side of the
mountains, those places on the opposite side were experiencing
weather of a much more moderate character; plainly showing
that the land is of sufficient elevation not only to influence the
direction of the wind, but in a great measure to obstruct a
storm in its progress.
   A more cursory examination of the midland and southern
counties will be sufficient, the hills being of sufficient elevation
rarely to obstruct the wind in its course during the passage
of a storm. From all those places situated near the Bristol
Channel, except Exeter, including Weymouth and Guernsey,
a N.W. gale is mentioned. At Exeter a strong breeze only
was experienced, attributable probably to the vicinity of the
Devonshire hills rising N.W. of it. The same was described
at Swindon, a place situated between the range of high hills
in Wiltshire and Berkshire and those in Gloucestershire.          In
the south-eastern counties the gale was general, but it was
uniformly from the W. It is possible that this direction over
a portion of the country during a N.W. gale may be owing
partly to the high land in Wales, and partly to the different
velocities with which the air seems to have passed down the
country on the different sides of the northern mountains. At
the time the observations were taken, the heaviest part of the
gale had passed. It had attained its height all over the country
between the hours of 3 and 6 A.M. The decrease in the reading
of the barometer was great. At Chester the lowest reading
occurred at 3"45" A.M., and was 28.68, as observed by the
Rev. A. Rigg. At Durham the lowest reading was 27:9, as
observed by R. E. Carrington, Esq., being the lowest since
Dec. 12, 1847.     On Feb. 8 the direction of the wind was
S.W. principally, but it was much deflected by the high land.
Rain was falling at most places north of Holyhead. On Feb. 9
a strong S.W. wind was blowing at most places south of
latitude 53°; between 53° and 55° the direction was S.; and N.
of 55° it was W. A storm and heavy gale was blowing at
places north of 53° 30'; and heavy rain was falling at many

          during the Quarter ending March 31, 1850.           373
places. On Feb. 11 and 12 the general direction of the wind
was S.W.; rain was falling on the former all over the country,
and at many places on the 12th, on which day snow fell at
Edinburgh and at Shap. There was a frost at Darlington; on
the 10th the wind was from the N.W., and the frost was
general. Snow was falling at York and at Whitby. On the
14th the direction was S.W. and S., blowing strongly in the
south, whilst the air was either calm or in gentle motion only
in the north. Snow was falling at Shap, and rain was falling
at many places. On the 15th the wind was very variable in
strength. On the 16th the air was in gentle motion at most
places, whilst a gale was blowing from the Irish Sea between
the latitudes of 54° and 55°. On the 18th the air was mostly
calm on the south coast, and there was a hard wind on the
north-east coast. On Feb. 19 the general direction was S.W.;
 at places situated south of 53° 30', and north of this parallel,
 it was S. At most places the air was in gentle motion. At
 Glasgow and Edinburgh it was blowing strongly. On Feb. 20
the wind was S.W., except in the north, where it was N.W.
 Rain was falling at many places in the south. On the 21st
there were light airs passing in different directions; south of
latitude 53° 30' north of this parallel, a gale was blowing
from the W., and which passed across the country. On the
22nd the air was in gentle motion at most places, yet there
 was a hard wind at some places. From this day to the end
 of the month the air was mostly in a calm state, and fog was
 prevalent.
    On March 1 the air was in gentle motion in the southern
parts of England, and passing for the most part from the
 S.W. and S., till, arriving at Beattock, Lanark and Edin
 burgh, a strong N.W. wind was recorded. On the 2nd
 the prevailing direction was S.W., veering in the northern
 counties to the S., or, in other words, becoming parallel to
 the main ridge of northern mountains; in the extreme north,
 the wind was blowing strongly. On the 4th the air was
 evidently on its return down the country, setting in at Glas
 gow, Lanark and Beattock from the N.W., which shortly
 afterwards changed to N., and continued in this direction to
 the south coast with scarcely an exception. At Whitby, on
 this day, a heavy gale from the N. is recorded. On the 5th,
 at Beattock, Lanark, Edinburgh and Berwick, a strong breeze
 was recorded, the direction being different, affording strong
 evidence of the effect of the mountains in deflecting the course
of the wind. With a few exceptions this day was calm; the
 same remark applies to the 6th, with this difference, that, com
 mencing at Holyhead, there was a fresh westerly breeze, and

374        Mr. J. Glaisher’s Remarks on the Weather.
 the air passed in this direction over the western and midland
counties, the air at the same time passing in all directions on
 both sides of this current, particularly on its south side, where
it was mostly calm with fog. The 7th, 8th and 9th may be
classed as calm days. The 10th being Sunday, I have but
few observations.     The 11th was calm.     On the 12th the air
was for the most part in gentle motion, except over the southern
counties, where it was chiefly calm. The 13th and 14th days
were calm. On coming to the 15th, I find there was a gentle
breeze from the N.E. passing over those parts of the country
extending from the south coast to Sunderland; north of this
place the direction was E. Calm and fogs were registered at
Lanark, Glasgow and Dundee. The temperature of the air,
which till this day had been mostly above the average for the
season, declined considerably below it. On the 16th the pre
vailing direction was N.W., but the air was deflected in many
places. The temperature of this day was several degrees below
its average, and at night the reading was below 25° at most
places. On the 17th the direction of the wind was mostly N.E.
and E. The day was very severe; its temperature at most
places was 10° or 11° below the average for the season; and
from this time to the end of the month the temperature of the
air was low. On the 18th the air was passing in all directions,
but chiefly from the N. On the 19th the directions were
N.W., and N., and in many places a strong breeze was re
corded. On the 20th there was a westerly current in ex
treme north, a N.W. wind in the northern English counties,
and which dispersed in all directions in its progress to the
south. On the 21st the air was passing from the N. On the
22nd the principal direction was from the W. On the 23rd
there was a hard wind from the N.W., storms at some places,
with snow and hail falling at others. On the 25th the direc
tion of the wind was N.W., with a sharp frost. On the
26th the whole mass of air north of Liverpool passed from the
E., and below this latitude its direction was from the N.W.
On the 27th the air was in gentle motion from the E. and
N.E. at southern places, and from the W. and N.W. at
northern places. Snow was falling at several places in the
south on the 28th, the directions were chiefly N. and N.W.
On the 29th and 30th the principal directions were S.E. and
E., passing with gentle motion on the former day, and there
was a gale on the latter.
   The mean of the numbers in the first column is 29-847
inches, and it represents that portion of the reading of the
barometer due to the pressure of air; the remaining portion,
or that due to the pressure of water, is 0.224 inch. The sum

of these two numbers is 30.071; and it represents the mean
reading of the barometer for the quarter at the level of the sea.
   The mean of the numbers in the second column for Guern
sey, and those places situated in the counties of Cornwall and
Devonshire, is 43°3; at Liverpool and Whitehaven is 39°.8;
for those places situated south of latitude of 52°, including
Chichester and Hartwell, is 38°0; for those places situated
between the latitudes of 52° and 53°, including Saffron Wal
den and Holkham, is 38°3; for those places situated between
the latitudes of 53° and 54°, including Derby and Stonyhurst,
is 38°4; and for Durham and Newcastle 38°-8.        These values
may be considered as those of the mean temperatures of the
air for those parallels of latitude during the quarter ending
March 31, 1850.
   The average daily range of temperature in Cornwall and
Devonshire was 28°1; at Liverpool and Whitehaven was
24°5; south of latitude 52° was 33°2; between the latitudes
of 53° and 54° was 31°5; and north of 54° was 29°-9.
   I have received the following agricultural reports:—
   From Stonyhurst, favoured by the Rev. A. Weld, B.A.,
F.R.A.S.
   The fine weather which occurred at the beginning of March
induced some farmers to sow oats as early as March 15; but
owing to the cold weather and severe frosts which followed,
the seed has not come up as yet, and considerable fears are
entertained of its failure.
   Early potatoes were in some instances planted about the
same time, and have not yet appeared.
   Beans were sown as early as the middle of February, and
are now looking very well. The severe frosts which took place
about the end of March have done no harm to the fruit-trees
in this neighbourhood, the vegetation fortunately not being
in a sufficiently advanced state to receive any injury. Irriga
tion of meadows was carried on extensively in the early part
of March. The severe weather which followed and the pre
sent rains have entirely suspended the working of the ground
during the last fortnight. The lambing season began here
about the 21st of March.
   From Leeds, favoured by Charles Charnock, Esq.
   As regards any remarks on agricultural matters few can be
made, except that during the last three months little has been
done; and the extreme coldness of March has not only checked
the growth of vegetables, but the extreme frosts at night have
in a great measure destroyed the blossoms of the earlier fruit
treeS.
   A very large quantity of potatoes are being planted in
Yorkshire.

On the Secretion of the Leaves and Stems of the Ice-plant. 377
    Wheat has been opportunely checked.
   The land is generally in fine condition for the spring crops.
   The impetus given to draining has kept the agricultural
labourers well-employed during the winter.
    Cattle, where healthy, have done well; but they as well as
sheep have suffered from epidemics.
    From Nottingham, favoured by E. J. Lowe, Esq., F.R.A.S.
    Wheat looks very promising, and the grass in fields from
present appearance will be early. Apricots are nearly all de
stroyed by frost, and gooseberries and currants injured. There
is a great bloom of plums, cherries, pears and apples. Peaches
and nectarines have been slightly injured by frost.

XLV. On the Watery Secretion of the Leaves and Stems of the
   Ice-plant (Mesembryanthemum crystallinum, L.). By Dr.
   AUGUSTUs WoFLCKER, Prof. of Chemistry Royal Agricult. Col
   lege, Cirencester*.
A FEW months ago I had the pleasure of communicating to the
       Botanical Society of Edinburgh the results of an examination
of the watery liquid in the ascidia of Nepenthes destillatoria. Those
present at the meeting, as well as the readers of the ‘Philoso
phical Magazine,’ will remember that, in opposition to the state
ments of most botanists who have directed their attention to the
subject of the watery secretions of the leaves of plants, I found
the liquid in the ascidia of Nepenthes to differ materially from
pure water, inasmuch as it contained from 0.30 to nearly 1 per
cent. of solid substances, partly organic partly inorganic. I
stated at that time my doubts as to the watery secretion of
plants being nothing but pure water, and gave some reasons for
this opinion; Prof. Balfour, with whom I discussed the subject,
kindly furnished me with the means of investigating this point
still further by favouring me with fresh specimens of the curious
Ice-plant (Mesembryanthemum crystallinum), a plant which is re
markable on account of the gland-like vesicular eminences with
which its leaves and stems are covered. The result of the examina
tion of the fluid secreted by the leaves of this plant has fully con
firmed the opinion expressed in regard to the watery secretions of
plants; at all events it has shown me that the secretion of the leaves
of the Ice-plant is not merely pure water, but water containing
several substances in solution. Though I was unable to determine
quantitatively the composition of this secretion on account of the
small quantity of liquid at my command—a quantity insufficient

  378    On the Secretion of the Leaves and Stems of the Ice-plant.
  even for a minute qualitative analysis—yet I had no difficulty
 in detecting the chief constituent parts of the fluid. The secre
 tion I procured by lacerating the gland-like eminences with
 which the leaves are covered, with a needle, and collecting the
 fluid in a glass bottle. The fluid thus obtained was colourless
 and nearly clear, without smell, and possessing no distinctly
 pronounced taste. Litmus-paper dipped in it was very slightly
 turned red, showing the presence of merely traces of a free acid
 or an acid salt. In order to free it entirely from any particles of
 epidermis which might accidentally have mingled with the liquid,
 I filtered it through white filtering-paper. The fluid passing
 through the filter slowly was now perfectly clear. On heating
 to 212°F. white flakes were separated, which proved to be iden
 tical with vegetable albumen. They were collected in a filter, and
 the filtrate evaporated to dryness on a water-bath. During the
 evaporation the liquid turned yellow, particularly when evapo
rated to a small bulk, and left a brownish-coloured, very hygro
 scopic residue, which redissolved in a small quantity of distilled
water, leaving but a trace of a humus-like, dark-coloured organic
substance undissolved.
    The chemical nature of the fluid from which the albumen had
been separated, was ascertained as far as possible by the follow
ing tests:—               -
    Ammonia produced no change.
    Carbonate of ammonia gave no precipitate.
    Carbonate of soda on boiling gave a white precipitate.
    Oxalate of ammonia produced no change.
    Phosphate of soda and ammonia, added to the concentrated
liquid, gave a crystalline white precipitate of phosphate of mag
nesia and ammonia.
    Chloride of platinum, added to the concentrated liquid after
the removal of the magnesia, produced a crystalline yellow pre
cipitate.
   The presence of soda was indicated by the yellow colour given
to the alcohol flame.
    Lime-water produced a white precipitate.
    Sulphate of lime likewise produced a white precipitate.
    Chloride of barium gave a heavy white precipitate.
   Nitrate of silver gave a white flaky precipitate, soluble in am
monia, but insoluble in nitric acid.
   Acetate of lead produced a white precipitate.
   Basic acetate of lead gave a voluminous white precipitate.
   A portion of the water evaporated to dryness and heated to
redness left a white ash which effervesced with acids, indicating
the presence of carbonates, originated from organic acids present
in the fluid.
   The nature of the organic acids, which in all likelihood ac

companied the oxalic acid, I could not determine from want of
material. The presence of oxalic acid however is distinctly indi
cated by the above reactions. They likewise show the presence
of chloride of sodium, potash, sulphuric acid and magnesia.
    In comparing this secretion of the leaves of the Ice-plant with
the fluid in the ascidia of Nepenthes, we find a material difference
in their respective compositions, as will be seen by the annexed
table, which exhibits the composition of both fluids:—

XLVII. On the Meteor of November 5, 1849.              By JAMEs
   GLAISHER, Esq., F.R.S., F.R.A.S., and of the Royal Ob
   servatory, Greenwich.
  To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,
 IN the number of the Philosophical Magazine for February
      1850 is a notice of a fine meteor seen by V. Fasel, Esq.,
F.R.A.S., at Stone, on Nov. 5, 1849. This meteor was also
seen by R. L. Jones, Esq., F.R.A.S., and who wrote to me
from Chester on Nov. 6, describing it. As it is seldom that
a meteor can be so certainly identified as seen at two different
places, I beg to send you the following particulars, in the
hope that some other gentleman had the good fortune to see it
and to note its path. It is possible that the meteor seen by Mr.
Lowe at Nottingham on Nov. 5, at 6' 20", also mentioned
in the same Number of the Magazine, may be the same meteor.
   The following is Mr. Jones's account of the meteor:
   “I first saw it near the Pleiades, and by estimation (as I
could not see the time till I got home) at 6' 10m P.M. G.M.T.;
it passed close by a Arietis, 5° or 6° below a Andromedae and
8 Pegasi, and disappeared about 10° above the four stars in
the head of the Dolphin, occupying about 5° in its transit; it
had a head composed of seven or eight small bluish-coloured
balls, and left a vivid trace of sparks behind it. That these
sparks were not the impression on the retina I am sure, as I
closed my eyes, looked on the ground, and on raising my eyes
again still saw them. They remained in view at least two
minutes, and seemed to be attracted together in three or four
masses, and the brightest part was near the meridian.”

 382 Mr. T. S. Davies on Geometry and Geometers.
    I have this day received the following additional accounts
 of this meteor from Mr. Fasel, who with the Rev. J. B. Reade
 has revisited the spot from which he saw the meteor, and
 found by compass that the place occupied by the meteor when
 first seen was due magnetic north (about 7° west of true
 north). Just previously to this time Mr. Fasel was walking
 with his face towards the west, when the bursting of the me
 teor caused him to turn his head towards the north.                                  He
 then went home, made a diagram in his journal (a copy of
 which he has forwarded to me), and described it as a very
brilliant meteor of the size of a star of the first magnitude,
 and it left a long train of red light.
    From Mr. Jones's account, the meteor was first seen
At an altitude of............ (- - - - - - - - - - ... 13 and in azimuth...... 68 E. of N.
 Its altitude at the next observation was 27 and its azimuth...... 89 E. of S.
                                          • * *        49          • * *       63 E. of S.
         - --         • * *               ---          56          • * *       45 E. of S.
 Its altitude at explosion was...... ......            60          • - ©        8 W. of S.
    From Mr. Fasel's account, the meteor was first seen at an
altitude of 30°, and in azimuth 7° W. of N., and its altitude
at explosion was 38°, in azimuth 59° W. of N.
    The path of the meteor seems to have been from E.N.E.
to W.S.W., and was contrary to the order of planetary
motion.
    The intersections of the azimuths at explosion indicates
that the meteor at this time was vertical over a spot at about
fifteen miles from Montgomery, and north-east of it. Its
distance from the earth at this time was about eighty miles.

                  XLVIII. Geometry and Geometers.
       Collected by T. S. DAVIES, Esq., F.R.S. and F.S.A.:*
                                             No. V.
Ti: mathematical collections of Pappus have an enduring
        interest to the geometer; but without question, the short
notice respecting the Porisms of Euclid (in the preface to his
seventh book) is the most interesting part of the whole work.
    It is unknown what MSS. were used by Commandine in
making his translation; and all that have been since discovered
are of comparatively modern dates. From some remarkable
coincidences, there is reason to believe that the MS. of Com
mandine was of the same period as some of these:—one of
which coincidences is, the absence of a figure alike from all
known codices and from Commandine's translation. They
are all alike defective in not even verbally describing this
                     * Communicated by the Author.

            Mr. T. S. Davies on Geometry and Geometers.                      383
  figure". Other and multiplied coincidences might be pointed
  out, all of which tend to show that the existing MSS. are only
  copies (with sometimes unaccountable variations, it is true)
  from some one of an earlier date,—and this, too, an imperfect
  transcript of the original.
      The Savilian Library of Oxford contains two such MSS.
  (Nos. 3 and 9); and from these Halley attempted to form a
  text of that celebrated preface. This was prefixed to his
  Restoration of the Section of Ratio and Section of Space,
  printed in 1706; and is still the only text that is considered
  to make any probable approach towards the original. Yet he
  gives up in despair all attempts to elucidate what is said re
  specting the Porisms.
      Under these circumstances it would have been advisable
  (at least as regards the section, IIepi Tôv Tropiapótov Eirc\ei
  òov, pp. vi.—ix.) to give the readings of each of his MSS., and
  his reasons for any departure from them, however slight. The
    * M. Breton, indeed, denies that this figure (or these figures) has ever
 existed, or was at all necessary (Comptes Rendus, Oct. 29, 1849, p. 482):
 but in this he stands alone, and offers avery unsatisfactory reason,—“puisqu'il
 s'agissait de propriétés générales.” As, however, M. Breton's paper is not
 published, and only a slight notice given of it in the place referred to, it
 would be obviously an inappropriate subject of comment here. Still his
 general views are indicated with precision; and I may be (especially as my
 thoughts are deeply occupied with the same subject) permitted to express
 my entire dissent from his conclusions, and my conviction that his inter
pretation is alike contradictory to all historical evidence, and incompatible
 with the state of geometrical science in Euclid's time.
    I hope to be able to offer conclusive evidence that the porism of Euclid
must have been what Simson divined it to be, and could not possibly have
been anything else. I speak of it as a proposition : but I do not venture to
affirm that any single actual porism that has been said to be “restored” is
precisely one of those which Euclid gave, whether offered as such by Sim
son, Noble, or whoever else has made the attempt. They may be so: but
so long as the same lemma may be subservient to many porisms, how are
we to tell which of these many was really Euclid's individual porism?
Probability would indeed rest upon the simplest, but certainty upon no one.
   The fragmentary character of the description of the several porisms in
the last three paragraphs of the text renders it impossible to affirm whether
the words refer to the predicate of the proposition, or to successive muta
tions of the subject; or, in other words, whether they express the conclu
sion in which the reasoning is to terminate, or the several interchanges
of one single condition. The former has been uniformly assumed: but,
when closely examined, it seems to lead to difficulties from which the latter
is free. One of these difficulties is, that it is impossible to see in an enun
ciation so constructed anything more than a local theorem. This assump
tion, indeed, may account for the almost universal tendency (especially
amongst the continental geometers) to confound the porism with the local
theorem. There is no question, however, that the propositions given by
Simson, as porisms, are truly and essentially such, whether they coincide
with any of Euclid's or not.
    I cannot, however, enter into further details here. What I have to offer on
the subject will hence be reserved for another occasion and another place.
                                                                -

384     Mr. T. S. Davies on Geometry and Geometers.
reasons can now, of course, only be conjectured from the alter
ations which he made: but it only requires careful collation
to assign what those changes were. I am fortunately enabled
to give these from a MS. of the late Mr. S. P. Rigaud, Savi
lian Professor of Geometry in the University of Oxford, drawn
up in 1815, 1816, and undertaken at the request of the late
Professor Leybourn of the Royal Military College, Sandhurst.
I believe that all who had the privilege of Professor Rigaud's
friendship will admit that he was, from his habitual care and
accuracy, eminently likely to observe even the most minute
variation:—they would trust his eye quite as much as their
own, and feel even more confidence in his transcripts than if
made by themselves. This collation, too, was made three
times over; and by a scholar resident on the spot, who could
examine the MSS. at his leisure, and who moreover thoroughly
understood the subject to which they relate.
   It was for the use of Mr. Mark Noble, one of the then
Sandhurst staff of Professors, that Mr. Leybourn procured
this collation. Mr. Noble had some years previously pub
lished two short papers on Porisms, into the analysis of which
he conceived he had introduced material improvements. [See
 Leybourn’s Mathematical Repository, vol. i. p. 35, N.S.,
and Gentleman’s Mathematical Companion, vol. ii. p. 42.]
That venerable mathematician placed the papers in my hands
a short time ago, with the hope that they might be of use to
Mr. Potts and myself in preparing our notes to the translation
of Simson's Porisms; and, knowing the casualties to which
loose papers are liable when they are vested in private families,
I have thought it better to secure for the public a correct copy
in print, whilst the MS. remains in my possession. It will
save, too, a good deal of trouble, and remove in some degree
the vagueness with which we all estimate the value of infor
mation which is not generally accessible. If, too, other MSS.
 (the Paris and Burney, for instance) were collated with the
same care, and printed in the same manner, all the informa
tion that literature can supply on this subject would be open
to all; instead of being, as now, confined to a few, and ob
tained even by them with much trouble and expense.
   Any notes made by Simson in his copy of Commandine
would also tend to utility. The Adversaria, too, might contri
bute something, were those valuable papers carefully examined.
Glasgow, however, has her own resident geometers; and it is
not too much to hope, that regard for her own honour, and
veneration for her great men of past days, will operate as
sufficient incentives to this illustration of a book so intimately
connected with Simson's and with Scotland’s fame.
   A short summary of the contents of the mathematical col

         Mr. T. S. Davies on Geometry and Geometers.              385
lections was given by Dr. Hutton in the first edition of his
Dictionary (1796); and a somewhat more philosophical one by
Dr. Trail in the third supplement to his Life of Simson (1812).
    The letter itself is sufficiently explicit as to the signification
of the references and construction of the list of readings.
Those which were crossed out are here dotted beneath, to
still guide the reader to the words which were originally noted;
and the numbers referring to them are omitted from the margin.
Those words where the variations are retained have a line
beneath them in the original; but are here referred to by
numbers and letters in the usual manner.

           “SIR,                             “Oxford, Feb. 24, 1816.
     “The above are all the instances in which I can find any
  thing like what you desired me to look for: but although they
  are only three in number, the last is new, as I see nothing
  like it in Commandine. I am much obliged to you for Beja
  Ganita, and regret that your efforts for the promotion of
  scientific literature should be so little profitable to you. I
  have had the pleasure of being able to complete the collation
  sooner than I expected, and I lose no time in forwarding it
  to you.    I hope your friend will have no difficulty in under
  standing the references which I have made in the margins.
  You may explain to him that I have drawn lines under the
  words to which any various readings occurred, and I have put
 numbers in the margins referring to them. These will be
 found to have two interruptions: the first is from my having
 in a few instances discovered variations in a second collation
 which had previously escaped me, such as (18) No. 3. P. VII.
  (28) No. 9. P. VII. and (29) No. 9. P. IX.; the other inter
 ruption is from my having erased many references which I
 had made in my first collation. These erasures consisted
 almost entirely of what had been introduced by an excess of
 minuteness, which had induced me to copy out some of the
 contractions. Hence you will find very many of them in
 P. VIII., for in the MS. No. 9 the page which contains from
 Bayrueatepov (line penult. P. VII.) to 806evta (line 4. P. IX.)
 is written in a different hand from the two pages which pre
 cede and follow it, and it contains several contractions which
 differ from the characters used in them; thus (29) it has
 8ebouey-anov for Beöouevoy a muetov where the printed text has
8ebouevo a mueto; but as I had no doubts about the meaning
of any of these contractions, I thought it useless to leave the
mention of them where no variation was offered in the read
ings. Wherever any erasure has been made, the line which
was drawn under the word to which the reference was made
is marked thus . . . . . In some cases there are more words
in the margin than that to which the various reading belongs;
but this occurs only where I thought that there might other
wise be some mistake: if, however, in this or in any other
particular I have failed in making myself clearly understood,
I shall be happy in hearing from you or from your friend
(although I possibly have not the pleasure ofhis acquaintance),
and as I have Halley's book at hand, it will only be necessary
to mark the page and line in which the difficulty may occur.
    “I have carefully made the collation three several times,
and the last time I repeated it I could discover no variation
which I had not previously noted; I therefore feel confident
of the accuracy of what I send you. I hope likewise that it

             Mr. T. S. Davies on Geometry and Geometers.                      387

are most obviously the blunders of transcription.                   I did not,
however, think it necessary to set down where words were
differently divided from what they are in the printed text,
and      £, in many instances occurs in No. 9 without any
reason, and I gave up any attention to accents in that MS.;
indeed you may remember what Wallis says, “accentuum
spirituumque notae et interstinctionum puncta desiderantur fere
omnia. He certainly studied these MSS. with great atten
tion; but still I cannot feel perfectly satisfied with his conjec
ture of the one being only a copy of the other. Readings
and omissions likewise will be found in each which do not
occur in the other; and though there are very many instances
of peculiar similarity in them, this may have been occasioned
 by their both being transcripts from the same original.
      “Pray remember me to my old acquaintance Mr. Dalby,

my last letter.                    “Your most humble Servant,

the subscription for the Diaries. I shall go to the publisher
if I hear nothing from you to the contrary; and I should not
have troubled you on the subject, if I had not been afraid of
a mistake between your copies (for one of which I consider
myself as subscribing) and those which remained as Mr. Maw

 a few remarks which are suggested by the letter of Professor
 Rigaud; but as they relate neither to Pappus, to Halley, nor
 to the Porisms, I shall reserve them till the occurrence in this

                XLIX. Notices respecting New Books.
    Hurricane Guide.     By WILLIAM RADCLIFF BIRT. Murray.
This        little work is devoted to the phaenomena of revolving
       storms, and some few directions are given to seamen to avoid
their centres. There are also some remarks upon atmospheric waves,
and directions for taking meteorological observations.
   The work is divided into five chapters. The first and fifth are
devoted to revolving storms, and have been principally deduced from
Colonel Reid's Theory of Storms. The second chapter is devoted
to an explanation of Professor Dove's atmospheric waves, concluding
with an urgent request to captains and masters of ships to make
regular observations of the barometer, and the direction of the wind,
both during the day and night. As the science of meteorology to
seamen is of paramount importance, it is to be hoped that Mr. Birt's
wishes will be complied with.
   Chapter 3 is divided into five sections. The first treats of instru
ments, of observations, and of their reduction.   The second, of the
times of observation; but no mention is here made of the necessity
of almost continuous observations during storms and gales of wind.
(See Colonel Reid's book On Storms, 2nd edit. p. 418.) This sec
tion concludes with a repetition of the wish for the continuance of
hourly meteorological observations on the days of the equinoxes and
solstices.
   These observations were first begun to be taken in the year 1833,
and for a time they were sent to Professor Quetelet at Brussels;
after this they were sent to Lamont at Munich; but at present it
does not seem that there is any place for their reception. We know
that observations of this kind have been sent to Munich; and neither
has their receipt been acknowledged, nor has any use been made
of them.     If the numerous sets of these observations which have
been made were collected, reduced and discussed, their results would
be instructive, and possibly would suggest a different investigation.
Till this is done we can scarcely join in the wish for their continu
ance. Nothing is more injurious to researches of this kind, than to
urge observers to make observations, and then not to use them. In

Mr. Birt's book no mention is made of a depository forthe observations
he wishes made; but possibly he is willing to receive and reduce
them himself, and to publish their results. Some such guarantee as
this is needed, or we cannot expect gentlemen to engage in long
and tedious series of observations.
   The fourth section speaks of periods of extra observations, and par
ticularly of that of the great atmospheric wave of November. Our
experience does not confirm the existence of this particular wave. It
seems to us that waves as regular and as large take place in the pre
ceding and following months; and therefore, that if this period be
made one of special investigation, it ought to be extended so as to
include the months of October and December.
   There is an appendix to the work, being a reprint of Tables I. and
II. from the Report of the Committee of Physics of the Royal Society
for the reduction of the readings of those barometers whose scales
are of brass, extending from the centre to the top of the mercurial
column.
   The discussion of simultaneous observations of the barometer, and
directions of the wind, have already led to unexpected rules to
guide the mariner, to whose notice we recommend this work.
                L. Proceedings of Learned Societies.
                       ROYAL IRISH ACADEMY.
 A" the     last meeting of the Royal Irish Academy, the Rev. Dr.
      Lloyd, D.D., the President, made the following observations on
 the recent destructive storm in Dublin:—
    “Having watched attentively the progress of the late storm, and
 collected some facts relative to it from the records of the observatory,
 and from other sources, I avail myself of the present opportunity to
 lay them before the Academy. The phaenomena were of a nature so
 unusual (I may say unexampled) in these climates, that it is desi
 rable that some notice of them, however imperfect, should be placed
 on record, and the present summary of facts is offered chiefly in the
 hope that it may serve as a nucleus to a more complete one. I shall,
 of course, limit myself to those which have an immediate scientific
 bearing.
    “From the tracings of the self-registering anemometer erected in
 Trinity College, it appears that on the 17th, and during the morning
 of the 18th, the wind blew gently from the S.W. Towards noon,
 on the latter day, it gradually veered to the S., and continued at
 that point until the arrival of the storm. This veering of the wind,
 however, appears to have been confined to the lower current. The
 direction of the upper current, as estimated by the motion of the
 clouds, was nearly S.W.
    “The first indications of the approach of the storm were observed
 soon after three o'clock. Massive cumuli were seen forming in the
 south-western portion of the sky. These became denser as they
 approached, until they formed a mass of an ash-gray colour, pro

jected on a sky of a paler tint, while the rugged outliers from the
 mass, of the peculiar form (between cirrus and cumulus) which in
 dicates a high degree of electrical tension, showed plainly that a
 storm was approaching. About half-past three o'clock it burst
forth. The flashes of lightning (generally forked) succeeded one
 another with rapidity, and at length the roar of the thunder seemed
 continuous. Some persons who observed the phaenomenon from a
distance were able to distinguish the two strata of oppositely elec
trical clouds, and to see the electrical discharges passing between
them.
    “Hitherto the wind was light, and there was that peculiar close
ness in the air which is the result of high temperature and excessive
humidity. Shortly before four o’clock the rain commenced—this
was followed almost immediately by discharges of hail, and at four
 P.M. the terrific tornado, which was the grand and peculiar feature
of this storm, reached us.
   “This gale, which appears to have been a true whirlwind, first
sprang up from the S.E., driving the hail before it impetuously. It
then suddenly, and apparently in an instant, shifted to the point of
the compass diametrically opposite, and blew with increased violence
from the N.W. The noise about this time of the shifting of the
wind was terrific, and arose (as is conjectured respecting similar
tropical phaenomena) from the confused conflict of hail in the air.
The size of the hailstones, as well as the vehemence of the gale, ap
peared to be greater during the second phase of the storm than in
the first. These masses, many of which were as large as a pigeon's
egg, were formed of a nucleus of snow or sleet, surrounded by trans
parent ice, and this again was succeeded by an opake white layer,
followed by a second coating of ice; in some of them I counted five
alternations.
   “In less than ten minutes the tornado had passed. The wind
returned to a gentle breeze from the S.W., and the weather became
beautiful. All the phaenomena—the direction of the gale perpendi
cular to that in which the storm cloud was advancing, and the sud
den reversal of that direction—seem to prove that it was a true tor
mado, whose centre passed directly over the place of observation. It
is evident, on comparing the direction of the wind when the whirl
first reached this part of the town with that of the progressive mo
tion of the vortex itself, that its rotatory motion was retrograde, or
in an opposite direction to that of the hands of a watch.         It is de
serving of notice also that this is the invariable direction in the north
ern hemisphere of the cyclones, or great revolving storms, to which
the attention of meteorologists has been directed by Colonel Reid
and Mr. Redfield.      The late storm was, however, different from a
cyclone, both in the dimensions of the vortex and in the causes from
which it originated. The horizontal section of the cyclone where it
meets the earth is often 500 miles in diameter; and the vortex is
supposed to be the effect of two crossing currents of air, which ge
nerate a movement of rotation. In the tornado, to which species
the late storm belonged, the vortex is of much smaller dimensions,

                        Royal Irish Academy.                        397
and is produced by rapidly ascending currents of air, caused by the
heating of a limited portion of the earth's surface under the action
of the sun's rays. In the temperate zones, accordingly, it is never
produced in winter. These ascending currents are loaded with va
pour, which (owing to the rapid evaporation) is in a highly elec
trical state, and when they reach the colder regions of the atmosphere
the vapour is condensed, and electrical clouds are rapidly formed.
   “The evidence relating to the direction of the gale, and its changes,
as it passed over the College Park, is very complete and satisfactory.
In the park and garden adjoining, nineteen trees were rooted up and
prostrated, eleven of them being trees of large size. Of these ten
have fallen from the S.E., or under the action of the first half of the
gale, and nine from the N.W. Their bearings have been accurately
taken, and the general result is, that the main direction of the S.E.
gale, as indicated by that of the trees, is S. 56° E., and that of the
N.W. gale N. 53°W. I believe that these results are even more
accurate than those furnished by the anemometer; and they prove
that in this locality the direction of the wind was exactly reversed,
and therefore the centre of the vortex passed over the College.
   “A remarkable circumstance connected with the direction of the
fallen trees is their great uniformity, the individual direction seldom
differing more than ten degrees from the mean.       This is an indirect
evidence of the great violence of the gale; and it proves, moreover,
that the transition from the S.E. to the N.W. wind was immediate.
There is greater regularity in the direction of the trees fallen from
the N.W., than in those which have been blown down from the
opposite quarter. This may have arisen partly from the greater
violence of the gale in the former direction; but it is partly also due
to the circumstance that the trees which fell from the N.W. are
generally larger and in a less enclosed portion of the ground. It may
be mentioned also, that the trees which fell from the N.W. generally
lie to the southward of the others, as if there had been a shifting of
the whole vortex in that direction. There are, however, two large
trees in the garden lying side by side, but in directions diametrically
opposed.
   “It has been already stated, that in the College Park the shifting
of the wind amounted to 180 degrees; and it has been inferred that
the centre of the vortex passed over that spot. From what has been
said as to the nature of the phaenomenon, it will follow that in other
localities, over which the vortex did not pass centrally, the wind must
have shifted through different points of the compass, and through
angles smaller in proportion to the distance from the centre. Thus,
on the southern or south-eastern side of the line described by the
centre of the vortex, the change of the wind should be from S. to W.,
and on the northern side of the same line from E. to N.          We are
not yet in possession of facts which bear upon this point; but from
the limited dimensions of the vortex, and the consequent smallness
of the distance necessary to produce such a variation, it is probable
that evidence bearing upon it may readily be obtained. I shall only
observe, that in seeking and comparing such evidence care must be

taken not to confound eddies arising from local obstructions with
the general direction of the current.
   “The observations of the barometer and of the dry- and wet-bulb .

    “The fall of rain and melted hail during the storm amounted only
to 0.596 of an inch; but it is probable that the hail was driven out
of the receiver of the gauge by the wind.
    “It will be seen that the barometric fluctuation is small.       It is
stated, however, on what seems good authority, that a sudden and
considerable fall of the barometer took place shortly before the storm.
    “I have collected from the newspapers and other sources such in
formation as I could obtain respecting the area of the city visited by
the gale, but it is as yet very incomplete. It appears, however, that
the diameter of the vortex was not very different from the length of
 the city from north to south; the limits of the gale being, namely,
the Royal Canal on the north side, and the Grand Canal on the
south. Hail fell, however, abundantly beyond the limits of the gale.
Thus, at the gardens of the Royal Dublin Society at Glasnevin, the
 damage done by the hail was very great; but it was limited to the
roofs of the houses, the hail having fallen perpendicularly.
    “Further information is wanting also to enable us to determine
 exactly the progressive movement of the entire of the vortex. We
 are informed by the newspapers that a similar storm to that which
 visited Dublin, although not so severe, took place at Mullingar,
 about an hour and a half previously. If this be the same storm, the
 direction of its path must have been curvilinear. There seemed to
 be a disturbance of electrical equilibrium, accompanied by rain, in
 many remote parts of Ireland on the same day.”
    The President exhibited drawings of some of the hailstones which
 fell during the storm, and stated that they consisted of alternate
 layers of snow and ice, with a central nucleus of snow.

                     ON OZONE.    BY M. SCHöNBEIN.
 A'. the       request of M. Becquerel, M. Schönbein repeated before
       him various experiments relative to ozone; of these the author
 furnished M. Becquerel with a detailed account, from which the
 following statement is extracted:—

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.            399
    M. Schönbein procures a large quantity of ozonized air by putting
 into a receiver of the capacity of 10 to 15 litres, a small quantity of
 water, and sticks of phosphorus of 1 centimetre in diameter, one
 half of them being immersed in the water, and the other exposed to
 the air; the air of the receiver is heated from 59° to 68°Fahr. and
 imperfectly closed.    When the operation is finished, which is ascer
 tained by the odour of ozonized air, the receiver is inverted in a
 vessel of water, to get rid of the sticks of phosphorus, it is then re
 moved and shaken in order to wash the compound. This operation
 being finished, a cork is fitted to the receiver into which two tubes
 are passed, one serving for the conveyance of water, and the other
 to conduct the ozonized air into vessels or tubes containing the sub
 stances to be submitted to its action.
    Under the circumstances presently to be described, ozone is formed
 when the vapour of phosphorus and water are mixed with oxygen
 gas. It does not form at the same temperature in pure and dry
 oxygen : it is the same in pure and humid oxygen at the usual at
 mospheric temperature and pressure.       Phosphorus, placed in moist
oxygen, produces ozone at common temperatures, if the air is suffi
ciently rarefied.
   Phosphorus, in humid oxygen, at common pressures, gives rise to
ozone when the temperature is raised to 75°Fahr.; and its formation
takes place rapidly at 86°Fahr. The presence of certain gases in
the oxygen produces the same effect as rarefaction or increase of
temperature. Of all gases hydrogen is that which produces this
effect in the highest degree; then follow nitrogen and carbonic acid.
   In a mixture of four parts of hydrogen and one of oxygen, as
moist as possible, the formation of ozone is so rapid at 60° to 68°
Fahr., that on account of the action occasioned by this body on the
phosphorus, this substance and the explosive mixture inflame.
Ozone is not formed in moist air at 32°Fahr.; the formation begins
to be perceptible at 42° to 46°Fahr.; at 60° to 68°Fahr. it is rapid
and occurs without danger. No effect takes place at common tem
peratures when the air is compressed to a fifth or a sixth; to
obtain any action under these circumstances the temperature must
be raised. The presence of certain gases, such as olefiant gas and
nitrous vapours in humid oxygen, when sufficiently rarefied, and also
in air, obstructs the formation of ozone.
   According to M. Schönbein, when the vapour of aether is slowly
burnt in air or in oxygen, there is formed, among other products, a
compound of ozone and olefiant gas.
   When ozone is passed through a tube heated to 482°Fahr., it is
entirely destroyed. And the same is the case at common tem
peratures with charcoal. Ozone has the odour of chlorine if it is
concentrated.     When it is mixed with air, it has the odour which is
perceived on turning the plate of an electrical machine.
   Air which is strongly impregnated with ozone impedes respiration
and produces catarrhal affections; small animals are quickly killed
in it; it is insoluble in water; it quickly destroys organic colouring
matter, and also ligneous and albuminous substances, &c. It com

400           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
bines chemically with chlorine, bromine and iodine when water is
present, and chloric, bromic and iodic acids are formed. Strongly
ozonized atmospheric air, when exposed to lime-water, produces ap
preciable quantities of nitrate of lime. It may be stated, generally,
that nascent ozone, when in contact with nitrogen and a strong base,
produces nitric acid; a small quantity of nitric acid is also formed
during the slow combustion of phosphorus in the air. Ozone acts
powerfully on most metals, causing them to assume their maximum
of oxidizement; the action commences at 32°.        It combines directly
with olefiant gas without decomposition; it destroys sulphuretted
and seleniuretted hydrogen, &c., and converts sulphurous and nitrous
acids, &c. into sulphuric and nitric acids.
   Ozone precipitates peroxide of lead from an alkaline solution of
lead, or from the acetate. It rapidly decomposes all the salts of
manganese, whether in the solid state or in that of solution, pro
ducing peroxide.     Hence it results that a strip of dry paper impreg
nated with sulphate or chloride of manganese is a reagent for ozone;
the paper becoming rapidly brown in an ozonized atmosphere.
Another and very sensible reagent, which M. Schönbein prefers,
is a strip of starched paper containing a very small quantity of iodide
of potassium. A solution of yellow ferrocyanide of potassium is
changed by ozone into red cyanide. A great number of metallic
sulphurets are rapidly converted by this substance into sulphates;
such are the sulphurets of iron, lead, copper and antimony.
   According to M. Schönbein, ozone is the most powerful oxidizing
agent in nature. As ozone is invariably formed in the air by the
action of artificial electrical discharges, it should also be produced
throughout the atmosphere, in which natural electrical discharges
occur. Nothing is easier than to demonstrate the presence of ozone
in the atmosphere, and the variations of the quantities produced, by
means of the test papers described. In general the reaction is
greater in winter than in summer. M. Schönbein has always ob
served, that during a fall of snow it is much greater than at any
other time. An exposure of iodized and starched paper for two
hours is sufficient to render it of a deep blue colour, whereas the
same air, enclosed in a receiver, produces no effect.
   It may be inquired whether the nitric acid which is formed by
passing electric sparks through air, as first observed by Cavendish,
and also that produced during storms, are due to the direct action of
electricity on oxygen and nitrogen, or to that of ozone on nitrogen.
   Such are the general properties of a substance the composition of
which has hitherto escaped all methods of analysis, and which M.
Marignac considers as a peculiar modification of oxygen, which in
creases its chemical affinities. M. Schönbein regards it as a com
pound, probably containing more oxygen than oxygenated water.
But these are merely hypotheses which require the sanction of fresh
experiments. Opinions as to the nature of this substance should
not yet be pronounced.—Comptes Rendus, 14 Janvier, 1850.

         THE FIRST IDEA OF THE ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH.
   Whenever it happens to be in my power, I feel a desire to render
to Caesar what belongs to Caesar; on which account I wish the
learned world to know that my late excellent friend Dr. Odier was
the first who had the idea of the Electric Telegraph. Here is what
he wrote seventy-seven years ago, namely in the year 1773, to
Mdlle B . . .
   “I shall amuse you, perhaps, when I tell you that I have some
experiments in my head for obtaining the power of enabling the
English, French, or other inhabitants of Europe to enter into con
versation with the Emperor of Mogul or of China, so that without
any trouble they shall be able to communicate whatever they may
wish, at the distance of four or five thousand leagues in less than
half an hour ! Will this satisfy you as to glory? Nothing, how
ever, is more real. Whatever turn these experiments may take, they
 must certainly lead to some great discovery; but I have not the
courage to make them this winter. That which gave me the idea,
 was a word dropt accidentally the other day at the table of Sir John
Pringle, where I had the pleasure of dining with Franklin, Priestley,
and other men of great genius.”
    At that time Odier was much occupied upon the study of elec
 tricity. Some days before, he had thus written to Mdlle B . . . . . .
 “Is it not astonishing that the movement of a morsel of straw
 attracted by a piece of amber should have given Franklin the sub
 lime idea of the lightning-conductor? Franklin is the first to have
 found the secret of imprisoning the electric fluid in a bottle.”

          ACTION OF NASCENT CHLORINE ON LACTIC ACID.
                            BY M. STAEDELE.R.
    When a mixture of lactic acid or a lactate, common salt, peroxide
of manganese, and sulphuric acid is subjected to distillation, a
liquid is obtained, which, when mixed with potash, deposits oleagi
nous drops possessing the odour of chloroform.
    If the quantity of chlorine is insufficient to act upon the lactic
acid, aldehyde is chiefly obtained. This happens on distilling a
 mixture of one part of lactate of iron, four parts of peroxide of man
 ganese and common salt, and four parts of sulphuric acid diluted
 with an equal weight of water.
    When, however, the proportions employed are one part of lactate
 of iron, ten parts of peroxide of manganese and common salt, and
 ten of sulphuric acid, aldehyde is obtained only at the commence
 ment of the reaction.      If the products subsequently obtained by
 distillation be rectified over chloride of calcium, a colourless liquid
 separates on standing, which resembles chloral. In fact chloral may
 be separated from it by simple distillation; the liquid which comes
 over forms, with a small quantity of water, crystals of hydrated
 chloral; its solution in water furnishes chloroform by the action of
 potash.—Journ. de Pharm. et de Chim, Novembre 1849.

     ON THE SEPARATION OF CERTAIN ACIDS OF THE SERIES
                     Cn Hn O4.       BY M. J. LIEBIG.
    When it is proposed to separate a mixture of butyric and valeric
 acids, even when the quantities are small, the following process,
according to the author, may be employed:
    Saturate a portion of the mixed acids with potash or soda, add
the remainder, and subject the whole to distillation.
    Two cases happen. If the mixture of valeric acid is contained in
 larger quantity than requisite to saturate the whole of the alkali,
 the residue no longer contains butyric acid, but pure valeric acid.
    If the quantity of valeric acid contained in the mixture is insuffi
 cient to saturate the alkali, the remainder contains, besides the whole
 of the valeric acid, a certain quantity of butyric acid; but the pro
 duct of the distillation consists of pure butyric acid.
    The quantity of alkali to be added to the mixture ought conse
quently to be calculated according to the quantity of valeric acid
which it is supposed to contain. If the mixture contains 10 per
cent., one-tenth of the acid should be saturated. If it be required
to separate 10 per cent. of butyric acid from impure valeric acid,
nine-tenths of the mixture must be saturated.
   From what is now stated, it is easy to perceive that one operation
is sufficient to obtain one of the acids in a pure state.     Either the
product of the distillation is pure butyric acid, and the residue con
tains a mixture of valeric acid and butyric acid, or the product of
the distillation contains a mixture of butyric and valeric acids, and
then the product is pure valeric acid.
    In repeating the same operations on the residue or the product of
the distillation performed, there is again obtained a certain portion of
one of the acids in a pure state; and by continuing these saturations
and distillations, a complete separation of the acids may be effected.
   As the boiling-points of butyric and valeric acids differ, it might
be supposed that soda, when combining with the less volatile acid,
would prevent its volatilizing at the temperature at which the other
boils. In fact, when in a mixture of valeric or butyric acids, the
first of these acids is fixed, it is evident that the second may distil
in a state of purity.
   A mixture of valeric and acetic acids, or of butyric and acetic
acids, behaves in a totally different manner. When such a mixture
is partially saturated with potash and submitted to distillation, it is
not the acetic acid which passes over, as might be supposed, but the
two other acids, although the point of ebullition of acetic acid is
lower by more than 50° than that of butyric acid, and by more than
70° than that of valeric acid; in this case an acid acetate is formed
which is not decomposed by the two less volatile acids.
   If valeric acid be added to a neutral solution of acetate of potash,
the acid dissolves in large quantity; whereas it remains in the state
of oily drops in a solution of acid acetate of potash, in which it does
not appear to dissolve in larger quantity than in water.

tate of potash, and the mixture is distilled, part of the valeric acid
distils, while in the residue there is a mixture of acid acetate of pot
ash and valerate of potash.
   When a mixture of acid acetate of potash and valeric acid is di
stilled, this acid distils and the acid acetate of potash remains free
from valeric acid; butyric acid acts similarly to valeric acid with
acetate of potash.
    It results from what has now been stated, that when butyric or
valeric acid, containing acetic acid, is partially saturated with potash,
one of two things happens: either the acetic acid remains entirely
in the residue with a certain quantity of butyric acid, and then the
acid which distils is free from acetic acid; or the residue is formed
 entirely of acetic acid, and then the product of the distillation still
contains acetic acid, which may be separated from the butyric acid
 or from the valeric acid by a second similar treatment.—Journ. de

 ON THE COMPOSITION OF THE PRECIPITATE                  FORMED     IN SO
    LUBLE CYANIDES BY SUBACETATE OF LEAD.                  BY M. E. ER
    LENMEYER.
    When hydrocyanic acid is added to subacetate of lead, no preci
pitate is formed; ammonia is requisite to produce it, by which a pul
verulent white precipitate is formed and readily deposited.
    In order to analyse it, M. Erlenmeyer washed it with water free
 from carbonic acid, collected it on a filter, and dried it on watch
 glasses under a receiver containing lime and sulphuric acid. During
 drying the precipitate gradually changes from white to yellowish
 white, and continually evolves hydrocyanic acid. When dry the
 decomposition ceases; it consists, according to the author, of 2PbO,
 Pb CV.
     ic composition is the same whether aqueous or alcoholic solutions
 of ammonia or potash be employed in preparing it. The author
 adds, that it appears probable that the white precipitate is at first
 cyanide of lead, which is gradually decomposed by water into hydro
 cyanic acid and oxide of lead; the decomposition would stop when the
 composition of the substance is that indicated by the above formula.

   THEORY OF COMPLEMENTARY COLOURS.                  BY M. MAUMEN£.
     The author has described, in a letter to the Academy of Sciences,
 an experiment which is interesting as regards the demonstration of
 the theory of complementary colours.
     It is well known that the combination of two complementary
  colours produces white; and this is usually shown in lectures by
  employing two glasses, one of a red and the other of a green colour,
  the tints of which, although of considerable intensity, entirely dis
  appear during the simultaneous interposition of the glasses between
  the eye and the source of light. M. Maumené several years since

404         Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
arrived at the same result by using coloured liquors, and especially
by mixing a solution of cobalt with one of nickel, both perfectly pure,
and so diluted that their colour is nearly of equal intensity. The
rose-red colour of the cobalt is completely destroyed by the green of
the nickel, even in concentrated solutions, and the mixed liquid re
mains colourless.—Journ. de Pharm. et de Chim., Mars 1850.
      ANALYSIS OF THE WATERS OF THE MEDITERRANEAN.
                           BY M. UZIGLIO.
   M. Marcel de Serres has made a report of the different memoirs
by M. Uziglio, relating to the analysis of the water of the Mediter
Tanean.
   A knowledge of the composition of the water of the Ocean and
of inland seas, is highly interesting in a geological point of view, on
account of the importance of these great fluid masses in the history
of the globe. It is not less interesting to the chemist and the ma
nufacturer, who works upon the salts which these waters contain.
M. Uziglio rightly concluded that it was necessary again to analyse
the water of the Mediterranean, the chemists who preceded him not
having estimated with sufficient correctness the proportions of potash
and soda which are held in solution.
   The composition of the water of the Mediterranean cannot be com
pared to that of the Ocean, since it is circumscribed in a basin which
is closed and limited, and hence it is more concentrated. In fact,
the saltness of the seas appears to be maintained by the salts sup
plied from the water of the continents, and by the soluble substances
which mineral waters supply in their courses. Thus the water is
generally more salt near the coasts than in the open sea. On the
other hand, mineral waters, and particularly salt springs, greatly re
semble sea-water.
   According to M. Uziglio, the principal substances contained in
the Mediterranean are sulphuric, hydrochloric, hydrobromic and
carbonic acids. MM. Figuier and Mialhe have also stated the pre
sence of traces of phosphoric acid combined with magnesia. As to
bases, M. Uziglio has observed potash, soda, lime, magnesia and
oxide of iron, to which for the Ocean must be added oxide of man
ganese. The best-known and the most abundant element of sea
water is chlorine; in fact 100 grammes of the water of the Mediter
ranean contain 2:0468 grs. of it, and only 0.0432 gr. of bromine,
which almost constantly accompanies the chlorine; both occur com
bined with sodium and potassium.
   The most important point in the researches of M. Uziglio into the
composition of the water of the Mediterranean, is the proof of the
quantity of potash which it contains. According to his analysis, this
quantity amounts to 0.0320 gr., or only 0.265 of potassium in
100 grammes. Notwithstanding the smallness of this quantity, M.
Uziglio presumes that before long the potash extracted from the
Ocean or the Mediterranean will replace the product of the lixivia

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.              405
tion of wood-ashes, just as soda artificially extracted from sea-salt
has been long and advantageously substituted for that obtained from
marine plants.
   When the petrifaction of shells which occurs at present in the
Ocean is considered, it excites no surprise that the proportion of lime
is double that of the potash. In fact, 100 grammes of the water of
the Mediterranean contain 0.623 gr. of lime, and the proportion
contained in the Ocean, according to Figuier and Mialhe, is still
larger. The carbonate exists in the Mediterranean in sufficient
quantity to form considerable masses of shell-limestone analogous to
those of the tertiary formation, and to be substituted for that which
composed the shells in their fresh state. This new calcareous mat
ter produces also true petrifactions, analogous to those of the geolo
gical aera.
   One hundred grammes of the water of the Mediterranean contain
2.914 grs. of chloride of sodium, that is to say, nearly three hun
dredths; the next most abundant salt is the chloride of magnesium,
of which 100 grammes contain 0.3219 gr.; whilst the sulphate of
magnesia amounts to 0:2477 gr., and the sulphate of lime to 0-1357 gr.
   The large quantity of sulphate of lime which the concentration
of the water of the Mediterranean precipitates in the salt marshes
would induce the belief that this salt existed in larger quantity; and
if analysis does not show a larger proportion, it must not be for
gotten that the mother-waters of the salt-works are frequently re
newed.      On this account it will be readily conceived, that after a
certain time this salt may be deposited to a considerable extent.
    Vegetables and animals contain considerable proportions of iodine,
 and yet the latest analyses do not indicate its existence either in the
 Ocean or the Mediterranean.      It cannot, however, be inferred that
these beings have the power of forming it; it follows only that the
absorbent organs of vegetables and animals are more delicate and
perfect than our best methods of analysis. The quantity of bromine
found in sea-water prevents the detection of iodine; the production
of the blue colour with starch may be effected or prevented, at plea
sure, by repeatedly adding to a liquid an iodide or bromide: iodine
cannot therefore be detected in sea-water while it contains bromine.
    In a second memoir, M. Uziglio has examined the results of the
evaporation of the water of the Mediterranean at different degrees
 of the areometer, and those of its analyses at different temperatures.
He has given the result of his experiments on the deposits of salts
comparatively with the thermometer and areometer; these tabu
lated results, however useful to the manufacturer, are not susceptible
of analysis.
    M. Uziglio has given a table (which is capable of being advan
tageously extended for the use of the manufacturer) of the different
saline deposits obtained at different densities. The tables which
precede it show that the progress of the continual evaporation of
the water, in the salt-works, is identical till the density reaches 25°,
 and is pretty well maintained up to 30°, but beyond this, and when
approaching 35°, the difference between day and night complicates

406          Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles,
the phaenomena, so that very variable mixtures of common salt, sul
phate of magnesia, and chloride of magnesium are obtained.
   The results of evaporation are still more variable above 35°. The
mixtures of the salts deposited undergo numerous differences in their
composition, without the possibility of foretelling the result of the
precipitations: some contain from 0.5 to 0-17 of their weight of
potash; it sometimes happens that this substance is found in depo
sits formed in solutions, the density of which is only from 34° to
35°; these deposits are derived from variations in the composition of
the waters.—L'Institut, Fevrier 27, 1850.
ON NEW COMPOUNDS OF AMMONIA WITH FERRoCYANIDE AND
        FERRIDCYAN IDE OF NICKEL.           BY M. A. REYNOSO,
   When excess of ammonia is added to recently precipitated and
moist ferrocyanide of nickel, it dissolves at first, changes its colour,
and soon produces a precipitate composed of a multitude of very fine
needles of a violet colour; these are the ammoniacal ferrocyanide of
nickel. It may also be prepared by adding ferrocyanide of potassium
to a solution of nickel containing much ammonia, or by causing a
solution of the salt of nickel to act upon a mixture of ammonia and
ferrocyanide of potassium. In every case the crystals of the salt are
finer as they are more slowly formed; that is to say, when there is
much ammonia, and the solution is consequently very dilute.         The
analysis of this salt indicated its formula to be 2NiCy, Fe Cy, 5NH*,
4HO.
   When ferrocyanide of potassium is poured into a solution of am
moniacal nitrate of nickel, a greenish-white precipitate is obtained,
which after being well dried is a mass of a very deep green colour,
which becomes white by pulverization. It adheres to the tongue,
is insipid, and completely insoluble in water. Ammonia dissolves it
and converts it into quinto-ammoniacal ferrocyanide. Heat decom
poses it, evolving ammonia and ferrocyanide of ammonia, leaving a
carburet which fuses in burning.
   This salt is the biammoniacal ferrocyanide of nickel; its formula
is 2NiCy, Fe Cy, 2NH3, HO.
   The ferridcyanide of potassium, poured into ammoniacal nitrate
of nickel, produces a fine yellow precipitate, soluble in excess of am
monia. It is the biammoniacal ferridcyanide of nickel, the formula
of which is 3NiCy, Fe2 Cy3, 2NH8, HO.
   All the ferrocyanides and ferridcyanides of the metals whose oxides
are soluble in ammonia are themselves soluble in ammonia.           The
alkaline solution of ferridcyanide of cobalt is of a very deep red
colour. The ferrocyanides and ferridcyanides of the metals whose
oxides are soluble in potash, are themselves soluble in potash. Thus
potash added to ferrocyanide of zinc produces immediately ferrocy
anide of potassium and oxide of zinc, which dissolves in the excess
of potash. If the potash be added with precaution, on filtering,
the liquor contains merely ferrocyanide of potassium, and oxide of
zinc remains on the filter. With ferrocyanide of mercury the reac

tion is very distinct. This compound is white; on treating it with
potash, there are produced ferrocyanide of potassium and yellow
oxide of mercury, insoluble in excess of potash.—L'Institut, Avril 10,

             EQUIVALENT OF CHROMIUM.                   BY M. LEFORT.
    According to Berzelius, the equivalent of chromium is 351; other
chemists make it 320 and 330: according to M. Lefort, the equiva
lent is 333.—Ibid.

LII. On the Measurement of Temperatures by Thermo-electric
                Currents. By M. REGNAULT*.
                            [With a Plate.]
IT is known, from the beautiful discovery of Seebeck, that
      when a closed circuit is formed with two plates of differ
ent metals soldered at their extremities, and that the tempe
rature of one of the junctions is raised, an electric current is
formed, which is in general the more intense the greater the
difference of temperature at the two places of soldering. Phi
losophers immediately sought to turn this property to ac
count for measuring temperatures.
   As we possess extremely delicate apparatus, by means of
which, to a certain point, the weakest currents may be de
tected and measured, while on the other hand the metallic
plates forming the circuit may be replaced by wires of very
small diameter, exceedingly small thermoscopic apparatus,
capable of demonstrating the feeblest variations oftemperature,
have been constructed. Every one is aware of the advantage
which MM. Becquerel and Breschet have derived from these
apparatus in measuring the differences of temperature exhi
bited by the several parts of the human body, and the beau
tiful results which Melloni obtained with his thermo-electric
pile in his researches on radiant heat.
    M. Pouillet has used the same principle for the measure
ment of high temperaturest; and he has described, under the
name of magnetic pyrometer, an apparatus which is compared
with his air pyrometer, and by means of which he states that
he is able to measure the highest temperatures of our furnaces.

410 M. Regnault on the Measurement of Temperatures
    The employment of thermo-electric couples for measuring
temperatures would, under many circumstances, present      such
great advantages over the ordinary processes, especially when
it is desired to determine temperatures within limited spaces,
that I have frequently devoted attention to this subject; but
I must confess, that, notwithstanding the very numerous and
varied experiments which I have made, my researches have
met with little success, and I have not been able to obtain a
comparable instrument whose indications might at all times
inspire confidence. There is such instability in the molecular
conditions which determine the thermo-electric currents, that
we are never certain of obtaining a current of constant inten
sity when the two solderings are raised at repeated intervals
to the same temperatures; the variations are especially con
siderable when, during the interval, the apparatus has been
heated to very different temperatures.
   The instrument which is used for determining the inten
sity of currents is far from presenting the perfection which is
necessary in accurate investigations, especially if these inten
sities vary considerably, as happens when thermo-electric cur
rents are employed for the measurement of temperatures.
   The intensity of electric currents is measured, either by the
deflexions which they produce upon a freely suspended mag
netic needle, or by the chemical decompositions which they
effect. The second method, which is of great importance for
the measurement of powerful currents, is inapplicable in the
case of thermo-electric currents, which are always very feeble,
and present too little after resistance to overcome the least
obstacles introduced into the circuit.
    The only instruments which have hitherto been employed
for measuring thermo-electric currents, are based, therefore,
on the deviations which these currents impress on the mag
netic needle; they are the galvanometer and the sine com
pass.
    The galvanometers with two partially compensated mag
netic needles are most suited for measuring very weak cur
rents; they appear, consequently, to be adapted principally
for thermo-electric currents. Unfortunately, the deviations
of the needles are not proportional to the intensity of the cur
rents except between very restricted limits; and for somewhat
considerable deflexions, it is necessary to construct a table in
which the intensities corresponding to the observed devia
tions are found. The direct construction of this table would
not be a matter of any moment if the same table were of ser
vice for any time; but experience has shown, that in a system
of two partially compensated needles, the magnetic intensity

                   by Thermo-electric Currents.        -      41 l
varies somewhat considerably, owing to circumstances which
it is impossible to foresee and guard against, so that it is ne
cessary to make this table very frequently. Frequently in the
midst of a series of experiments a perceptible alteration may
occur, and the experimenter is always uneasy on this point.
Moreover, the sensitiveness of the galvanometer decreases
rapidly with the amplitude of the deviations; and it must not.
be used to measure deviations of more than 60°, because
beyond that limit the indications of the instrument become
very uncertain.
    A part of these inconveniences is obviated in the apparatus
 to which M. Pouillet has given the name of sine compass.
In this instrument the needle is simple, and its magnetic axis
is always placed so that it shall coincide with the direction of
the current; the intensities of the current are then propor
tional to the sines of the angles which the magnetic meridian
forms with the direction of the axis of the needle.         To be
convinced at any time of the identity of the measuring ap
paratus, it suffices to pass through the wire a current of con
stant intensity, and easily producible always of the same
strength; if the needle indicates the same deflexion, we are
certain that the apparatus has remained comparable.
    The sine compass should not be employed to measure
 currents which produce deflexions of more than 50° to 60°;
 because beyond these limits the sines increase but very slowly
 for considerable variations ofthe arc, and the compass becomes
 useless. Thus all the measures on the sine compass should
 be comprised between 0° and 60°, and correspond to the in
 tensities of the thermo-electric current between the limits of
 temperature which it is desired to measure. It thence results,
 that if we wish to determine elevated temperatures, it is requi
 site to be content with somewhat weak deviations for a differ
 ence of 100°, and the apparatus becomes not very sensitive.
 Thus, in the magnetic pyrometer of M. Pouillet, the compass
 indicated a deviation of 4° to 5° for a difference of temperature
of 100° of the two solderings of the thermo-electric element.
 It is true, that, by giving a sufficiently large diameter to the
 divided circle, and observing the deviation with the assistance
 of a vernier, the subdivision of the degree may be carried as
 far as wished; and it is easy, if the divided circle has a dia
 meter of 10 to 15 centimetres, to appreciate angles of 1'. The
 deviation produced by a difference of temperature of 100°
 would consequently be measured to within san; that is to
 say, with more than sufficient accuracy. Unhappily, the mag
 net needle is far from exhibiting any such sensitiveness. In
 the ordinary compasses the   ":
                               2 E 2
                                      is supported on a pivot; and

412      M. Regnault on the Measurement of Temperatures
with whatever care the bearing and the pivot have been worked,
it is impossible to give to the needle a sufficiently great mo
bility to cause it to obey the feeble variations in the intensity
of the current. It is necessary to give the instrument a few
shakings to overcome the inertia of the needle; and the direc
tion in which it stops, after having removed it from its position
of equilibrium, varies very perceptibly, although the current
always preserves the same intensity. Thus, in a perfectly
constructed compass with an agate bearing, on which I have
experimented, the uncertainty amounted to #2, which conse
quently gives an uncertainty of 10° per cent.
    Much greater mobility is given to the needle by suspending
 it to a cocoon thread; but then other inconveniences arise,
 which occasion similar uncertainty. The accurate centring
of the needle becomes difficult; it may perceptibly vary during
the course of the experiments; the extreme mobility of the
needle causes it to oscillate constantly around its position of
equilibrium; it is difficult to alter the direction of the current,
so that it coincide with that of the magnetic axis of the needle;
and if the temperature which it is desired to measure is not
absolutely stationary for a pretty long time, it becomes almost
impossible to make an observation at the suitable moment.
In all cases the measurement of the deviations presents great
uncertainty, unless we have much time at our disposal to ad
just the apparatus.
    If the instrument is not to be employed to measure very
high temperatures, but is merely to be used between 0° and
400° Cent, it may be arranged so as to obtain for a difference
of temperature of 100° of the two solderings a deflexion greater
than 5°. However, this is not always easy when it is desired
to use but a single couple, and not to have recourse to a pile
composed of several elements; when, moreover, this couple
cannot be formed of those metals which produce the most
powerful currents, as bismuth and antimony, on account of
their great fusibility. Greater deflexions, it is true, are ob
tained by increasing the number of the convolutions of the
wire which act upon the needle; but this increase has a limit,
because the wires should possess great conductibility for ther
mo-electric currents, and consequently present a considerable
diameter.
    Any degree of sensibility may be obtained by substituting
for the simple needle a system of two partially compensated
needles; but then we meet with the same incoveniences as the
galvanometer presents, especially those dependent on the
magnetic alteration of the system. I have made numerous
experiments with compasses arranged in this manner, but the

                   by Thermo-electric Currents.              413
extreme mobility of the needles renders the manipulation
very difficult.                                                    -
   The difficulties which are met with in the accurate mea
surement of the intensities of thermo-electric currents by the
galvanometer and sine compass, induced me to seek for a
process of measurement which was wholly independent of
those instruments; and I think I have succeeded by the fol
lowing method, which appears to me susceptible of successful
application to the study of the laws of thermo-electric currents.
   I constructed an element of bismuth and antimony com
posed of two bars, ABCD, Plate I. figs. 1 and 2, cast in the
same mould. These two perfectly similar bars are juxtaposed
throughout their extent and kept separate by a blade of ivory;
they only touch at the two extremities, A and D, where the
two solderings are. The length BC is 20 centimetres, the
vertical pieces ABCD are 12 centimetres. This element of
bismuth and antimony is the normal element, with which I
compare all the other thermo-electric elements, but it should
not be used for temperatures exceeding 30°.
   The element destined for high temperatures is formed of
an iron wire and a platinum wire of 1 millimetre in diameter;
the extremities of these wires are soldered with silver.     The
iron wire, Ef F, fig. 4, is about 80 centimetres in length; the
two platinum wires, Ec, Fa, are fixed near to the iron wire,
from which they are isolated by a non-conducting envelope.
In their lower portion these wires are separated by a plate of
thin glass. They are terminated by two brass appendages, c
and d, which allow of the introduction of a galvanometric ap
paratus into the circuit.            -
   The two junctions, E and F, are kept in glass tubes filled
with a fixed oil containing no oxygen. One of these tubes is
placed in the oil-bath mentioned in a former part of this work
(p. 57), by the side of a mercurial thermometer extending from
0° to 350°. In some experiments an air-thermometer placed
in the bath was employed. The tube which contained the
second junction is kept at a constant temperature by means
of melting ice, or placed in a great water-bath alongside the
mercurial thermometer.                            t      -       -
   The normal element of bismuth and antimony, ABCD,
figs. 5 and 6, is arranged in such a manner that the two sol
derings, A and D, dip into two vessels, MN, M'N', filled with
water at different temperatures, and separated from each other
by a partition, SR. The same agitator, FGF'G', serves to
agitate at the same time the water in both vessels, and two
very accurate and strictly comparable thermometers, T and
T, are placed near the two solderings. These thermometers

414 M. Regnault on the Measurement of Temperatures
are the same as those used in my calorimetric experiments:
each centigrade degree is divided into eighteen divisions, so
that the differences of temperature of the two solderings can
be measured with extreme accuracy.
   Lastly, a very sensitive differential galvanometer completes
the apparatus. This galvanometer has a system of two little
compensated needles, to which is fixed a long hollow glass
rod drawn out very fine. The extremity of this rod, which
is blackened, moves on a divided quadrant 15 centimetres in
diameter; it is observed by means of a telescope. The qua
drant is divided into quarters of a degree; and it is very easy
to appreciate deviations of #th, and even of T',th of a degree.
The sensitiveness of the galvanometer is such, that a differ
ence of temperature of 1° in the two solderings of bismuth
and antimony produces a deflexion of the needle of 17°.
   The galvanometer is connected with the iron and platinum
circuit by one of its wires, and with the bismuth and antimony
circuit by its second wire.
   With this arrangement, the junction of the iron and pla
tinum, E, being maintained at a constant temperature t, if
the junction F be raised to a temperature T measured on
the thermometer of the oil-bath, a current will result which
will deflect the needle of the galvanometer; but by suitably
raising the temperature of one of the solderings of the bismuth
and antimony element, a second current, the inverse of the
first, will be obtained, by means of which that may be neutral
ized and the needle of the galvanometer restored to 0. The
temperatures 6 and 6', which the two thermometers T and T'
indicate at the moment of neutralization, are noted down.
   Thus a difference of temperature, T'—t, between the two
solderings of the iron and platinum, produces a current which
is neutralized on the galvanometer by the current developed
in the bismuth and antimony element by a difference of ten
perature 6'-6. This difference of temperature, 6'-6, is more
over much smaller than T"—t, because the electromotive force
of the bismuth and antimony element is incomparably greater
than that of the iron and platinum element, for with T'—t
= 100 we have 6'-6=6°-5.
   If the oil-bath be raised to the temperature T", 6" must be
raised to 6" in order to maintain the needle of the galvano
meter at 0°. By continuing in the same manner, we obtain a
series of temperatures T'—t, T"—t, T"—t, &c., which will
produce on the iron and platinum element currents which
will hold in equilibrio on the galvanometer the currents
produced on the bismuth and antimony element by the differ
ences of temperature 6'-6, 6"–6, 6"–6, &c. If, consequently,

                         by Thermo-electric Currents.                                415
the two thermo-electric elements remain comparable, it will
suffice once for all to form a table, in which are inscribed on
one side the differences of temperature, T'—t, T"—t, T"—t,
of the iron and platinum element measured upon an air-ther
mometer, and on the other side the differences of temperature,
6'-6, 6"-6, 6"-6, of the bismuth and antimony element.
   If it is now desired to measure a high temperature with the
iron and platinum couple, it will suffice to look out the tem
perature, 6'-6, which equilibrates it on the couple of bismuth
and antimony; and we shall find in the table, the construction
of which I have described, the temperature T–t correspond
ing to it on the element of iron and platinum.                                         -
   This method is entirely independent of the measuring ap
paratus. The magnetic state of the needle may vary without
any inconvenience resulting, as it will be modified in the same
manner for the two thermo-electric elements.                        The sole indis
pensable condition is, that the two elements should always
remain perfectly comparable, and experiment will readily de
cide whether this condition is satisfied.
   I shall not transcribe here the numerous experiments which
I have made by this method, but shall content myself with re
lating in detail one of the series, and shall merely give the
results of some others in order that the progress of the obser
vations may be judged of.

    I have represented graphically the results of these experi
ments. To do this easily I took for ordinates the differences
of temperature of the iron and platinum junctions divided by
 3, and I took for abscissae the differences of temperature of
 the bismuth and antimony junctions multiplied by 5.
    The conditions being apparently identical in these several
 series of experiments, the corresponding curves ought to be
 susceptible of being superposed: but such is not the case; in
 some instances the curve exhibits a very satisfactory regularity
 throughout its extent; in other cases, on the contrary, and
 without its being possible to ascertain the cause, there is a
 sudden leap at a point, and the second portion of the curve
 no longer agrees with the first: very rarely the curves fur
nished by two series of experiments approach sufficiently for
 the differences to be attributed to errors of observation, and
 the two curves to be considered as the expression of the same
 phaenomenon.
    These variations are probably owing to changes which take
 place in the molecular condition of the metals at the place of
 the solderings, and which suffice to modify perceptibly the
 electromotive forces. Sometimes these changes come on sud

                          by Thermo-electric Currents.                               41 7
denly in the midst of a series of experiments, they then pro
duce the leaps which are observed in the curves; in other
cases, on the contrary, the alterations are but slowly effected,
and they are only detected by causing the elements to pass
through the same temperatures.
   I thought it might perhaps be possible to cause these irre
gularities to disappear by avoiding the small quantity of solder
which joins the two metals*, and by giving a great section to
the worst conducting element. For this purpose I constructed
the element represented in fig. 3. A hollow iron tube was
curved while red-hot in the direction ABCD; the upper por
tion of this tube was filed away so as to convert the portion
BC into an open channel. The extremities A and D were
hammered while red-hot in order to cause the interior aper
ture to disappear almost entirely, and in it was incorporated,
at a white welding heat, two platinum wires of one millimetre
in diameter. These wires are placed in the interior of the hol
low tubes AB and CD; and to isolate them from the iron
sides, they were covered with glass tubes; they terminate in
two brass binding-screws, a, b, situated the one alongside the
other, and by means of which the element is brought into
connexion with the galvanometer.
    This new thermo-electric element was arranged in the ap
paratus in the same manner as in the preceding experiments;
 the portion which dipped into the bath was kept in a tube full
of oil. I will here give the results of some experiments.

    I represented by the graphic method the results of these
new experiments as I had done for those of the first, I ascer
tained thus that the three curves could not be superposed, but
that nevertheless they exhibited less considerable deviations
than those of the first four series.
     In the second series the oil-bath was allowed to cool after
the observation made at 28.1°, without disturbing any portion
of the apparatus, and the experiments recommenced when
the temperature of the bath had descended to 140°. It should
be observed, that the portion of the curve corresponding to
this second period does not agree with that which is given of
the first, and nevertheless the apparatus had undergone no
change.
     I have made numerous experiments on the bismuth and
antimony couple in order to ascertain whether these irregu
larities were not principally due to that couple; but by vary
ing the temperature of the junctions between the limits which
had been attained in the preceding experiments, viz. from 15°
to 33°, I found that the bismuth and antimony element re
mained pretty constant. I observed that a difference of tem
 perature of 1° between the two solderings produced sensibly
 the same deflexion of 17° on my galvanometer, whatever was
 their absolute temperature, provided it always remained com
 prised between the limits above indicated. But it is difficult
 to decide whether this proposition is exact, or merely approxi
 mate, because the intensity of the current varies perceptibly
 with the time, even when the two junctions constantly present
 the same difference of temperature; and there always remains
 a little uncertainty as to the value of the deflexion which
 should be inscribed.
  . But I found, contrary to the opinion generally admitted,
that an increase of 1° in the difference of temperature of the

                   by Thermo-electric Currents.              4. 19
two junctions of the bismuth and antimony element developes
an electromotive force, weaker in proportion as the difference
of temperature is greater, even between the limits 15° and 35°.
   This result is easily verified in the following manner. The
bismuth and antimony element being arranged in the two
vessels full of water, as in fig. 6, and in communication with
the galvanometer, the needle is brought to zero by raising the
water of the two vessels to exactly the same temperature; a
certain quantity of hot water is then poured into one of the
vessels, so as to produce precisely a difference of temperature
of 1° between the two solderings. The deflexion n of the
needle is noted down.
   After this a very feeble and perfectly constant hydro-electric
current is passed through the second wire of the differential
galvanometer: the needle is deflected a certain quantity by
this current, but it is brought back to zero by suitably raising
the temperature of one of the bismuth and antimony junctions.
The two currents then hold each other in equilibrio. The
temperature of the same junction is raised 1°, whence results
a deflexion of the needle, which is precisely equal to the de
viation n previously observed, if the electromotive force deve
loped by an increase of 1° in the difference of temperature is
the same whatever that difference may be.
   By passing in this manner successively stronger and stronger
constant hydro-electric currents through the second wire of
the galvanometer, and neutralizing them each time by a suit
able difference of temperature between the two solderings of
the thermo-electric current, I found that the electromotive
force developed by an increase of 1° of difference of tempera
ture was the more feeble as that difference was greater. The
thermo-electric element formed of wires of iron and platinum
is not the only one which I have experimented with at high
temperatures; I likewise made some trials with elements com
posed of other metallic wires. But the element of iron and
platinum has proved to be most suitable; it is that the electro
motive force of which decreases least with the elevation of the
temperature.
   The sensitiveness of a couple of iron and copper decreases
very rapidly with the temperature. At about 240° an eleva
tion of 20° to 30° no longer exerts any influence upon the
needle, which remains perfectly stationary: the needle retro
grades when the temperature is raised higher; and the inten
sity of the current, far from increasing with the temperature,
now decreases. This observation agrees with what M. Bec
querel long ago observed on a couple of iron and copper.
According to that able philosopher, the current is even esta

   420     Mr. W. R. Birt on the Hail Storm of May 5, 1850,
   blished in a direction contrary to its primitive one when the
   element of copper and iron is heated in the flame of a spirit
   lamp".
      I have likewise on several occasions made experiments on
   thermo-electric currents by interposing variable resistances in
   the circuit, so as to maintain the needle of the galvanometer
   at a constant deflexion for the different temperatures commu
  nicated to the solderings. For that purpose, I employed
   sometimes Prof. Wheatstone's rheostat, sometimes a simple
   metallic wire strung by a weight, and of which I inserted dif
   ferent lengths in the circuit; but I thus obtained much more
   variable and uncertain results than by the method above de
  scribed. I added in this manner to anomalies produced by
  the thermo-electric elements themselves those due to the irre
  gularities of the conductibility of the resisting wires, which
  will always render this method very uncertain for the study
  of feeble electric currents.
      To conclude, if the numerous experiments which I have
  made on the thermo-electric currents do not demonstrate that
  these currents cannot in future be employed for the measure
  ment of temperatures, they at least show that we are still far
  from being acquainted with all the circumstances which exert
  influence on the phaenomenon, and of being able to establish
  the conditions in which the thermo-electric elements ought to
  be placed so that the intensities of the currents may depend
   solely on the temperature.                                          -

  I annex a record of observations made at Kew on the Hail
  Storm of May 5, 1850, and beg to add my views of the phae
  InOmena.
     “At half-past 5 in the afternoon, on May 5, 1850, my atten
  tion was arrested by a very heavy and dark collection of clouds
  (cumuli) in the N.E., from which rain was falling in the di
  stance. The appearance of the clouds was very black and
  threatening. Below this black collection, which occupied a

                as observed at the Kew Observatory.            421
 very considerable portion of the sky from the zenith to the
 eastern horizon, the cloud, apparently a sheet of cirrostratus,
 presented a most remarkable reddish hue.        Cirrostratus had
 been prevalent during the day.      At 9 A.M. I registered cirrus,
 cirrostratus, cirrocumulus and cumulus; and at 3 P.M. cirro
 stratus and cumulus.     On both occasions these clouds were
 moving from the south-west. At 3 P.M. I observed a very
 splendid solar halo; the portion of it not covered by cumuloid
 clouds was exceedingly well-defined, the angular distance
 between its upper portion and the sun being 21° 49'. It con
 tinued more or less visible until 4 P.M., and presented an ellip
 tical form, the lower portion being much further from the sun
 than the upper. The interior boundary of the halo exhibited
 a reddish-brown tint, gradually passing towards the exterior
 boundary into a softened white, which thinned off into the
 general mass of cloud; the darkness of the interior space, espe
 cially near the halo, was very striking. When I first noticed
 the threatening aspect of the clouds, those in the immediate
 neighbourhood of the observatory were moving from the
 S.W. At 5' 40" P.M. a few large drops of rain fell; they
 were almost immediately succeeded by hail (small), and hail
 mingled with heavy rain continued to fall until 6h 10". Du
 ring this time the process of ninbification proceeded rapidly,
 extending from the N.E. towards the S.W.; so that although
just previous to the commencement of the storm the clouds were
 moving in the opposite direction, the action, now very consider
 able, rapidly converted the cumuli hovering over the observatory,
and more probably to some distance S.W. of it, into nimbi, ac
 companied with a very copious precipitation of hail. While this
 active precipitation of hail was proceeding, the electrical con
 ductor became charged to about 40° of Henley’s electrometer,
 the pendulum vibrating rapidly at the time when the hail came
down in greatest abundance and of the largest size, and sparks
were observed 0-3 inch in length.
    “The heavy rain previously noticed ceased at 6h 27", and
during the 47 minutes of this portion of the storm the tempe
 rature declined 4°7. After this a lighter rain fell until 7" 10",
in the course of which the tension, as manifested by the con
ductor, increased: the vibrations of the pendulum of Henley's
electrometer also increased; on one occasion it reached 90°,
with sparks 0.70 inch in length. During the storm the charge
was generally negative.”
    We have in the above phaenomena an illustration of Mr.
Howard’s remark (see vol. xxxvi. p. 167):—“This rain
opens an immediate communication with the earth; the po
sitive electricity, which before rendered the particles buoyant,

STREAMS     DOWN   ALONG   WITH  THE    RAIN   AND   THROUGH
IT; and the shower is propagated in all directions till the
whole mass of cloud is brought into action.” The great body
of cloud, as appears from observations at the commence
ment and close of the storm, was moving from the S.W.,
from which the legitimate inference is, that the storm itself
was moving from S.W. to N.E. When the black threat
ening appearance was first noticed in the N.E., rain was
falling from the bases of the cumuli; it did not, however, ap
pear to be of great extent; and at the same time the clouds
in the S.W., W. and N.W., presented, especially as con
trasted with those in the N.E., a remarkable light appearance:
the storm did not pass over this observatory from the S.W.
 Shortly after the rain commenced, and during the continuance
of the hail, the well-defined black masses of cumuli were ra
pidly resolved into nimbi; and it appeared to the writer that
 this resolution of cumuli into nimbi occasioned the apparent
progression of the storm from the N.E. Unfortunately he did
not particularly observe the character of the clouds in the
 S.W., W. and N.W.; but his impression is, that during the
 entire period of the storm the atmosphere was much lighter
 in those directions. It would be extremely interesting to learn
 at what point nimbification began, and how far it extended
 on each side the nucleus. The apparent conclusion from the
 phaenomena is, that when nimbification commenced it rapidly
 extended in all directions from a central point.
    From information that I have received, I have some reason
to conclude that the area over which the hail fell was very
circumscribed.     The hail was not noticed either at Mortlake
or Petersham, both near Richmond; the clouds were moving
towards the former village, and the dark threatening appear
 ance was seen in that direction; so that the nucleus was most
probably between Richmond and Mortlake, but nearest the
former place. The storm was observed at Ham.
    The phaenomena above detailed appear to me so illustra
tive of the views embodied in my paper on the connexion of
Atmospheric Electricity with the Condensation of Vapour
 (vol. xxxvi. p. 161), that I have thought they may not be
 altogether uninteresting to the readers of the Philosophical
 Magazine.
    Will you be kind enough to notify in your next Number
that I shall be happy to receive from any quarter observations
 made in conformity with ' instructions in the Hurricane
 Guide? if corrected, so much the better; and as opportunity
 may offer, such observations shall undergo discussion, at least
 insofar as they may throw light on the great aerial move

ments mentioned in the Guide, and the results be communi
cated to some scientific body.                               -
   With regard to the remarks on the November wave by the
writer of the notice, I am quite of opinion that the movements
I have observed are not confined by any means to November,
nor do they extend only to the three autumnal months, but
are to be detected in every month all the year round. Nor
do I apprehend that these movements stand out more promi
nently in November than at any other time. The only reason
that they have been brought more prominently into notice in
November is, that more attention has been paid to the baro
metric phaenomena in that month. The mode of inquiry is,
however, one involving considerable labour, and requiring
numerous stations; so that unless a gentleman is able to de
vote to it the whole of his time, or at least a very considerable
portion of it, the progress in the general investigation must be
but slow. Some of the most valuable data would be obtained
from marine observations.
               I have the honour to be, my dear Sir,

§ XX. On the use of the multiplying Rheometer for measuring
    differences of intensity of weak or powerful Electric Currents.
21 1. Th; measure of the variations of intensity of galvanic
   -         currents is ordinarily effected by the aid of the vol
 tameter. But the employment of this apparatus requires
 various precautions, without which we arrive at false results,
 and diminishes the energy of the current by the whole of the
 resistance proceeding from the liquid under decomposition.
 It is often more convenient to employ the galvanometer, which
 does not expose us to the same errors. I do not speak of the
 coarse multipliers with a single very heavy needle, such as
 were constructed twenty years ago, but of rheometers with a
 longer or shorter wire, and furnished with an almost astatic
 system of light needles delicately suspended.
     212. If the current which has to be appreciated is suffi
 ciently weak not to heat a thin copper conductor, it is distri
 buted between the two equal wires of a differential galvano
 meter, giving it an opposite direction in each of them, or the
        * From the Bibliothèque Universelle de Genève, January 1850.

424.    Prof. E. Wartmann's Eighth Memoir on Induction :
differential resistance-measurer of Professor Wheatstone is
employed. The needle remains at zero under the influence
of the two contrary actions which affect it. It is only neces
sary then to place a rheostat in the circuit ofone of the wires to
diminish its conductibility, and give to the current circulating
in the other an increasing preponderance. When the index
has been brought to the fortieth or fiftieth degree, it detects
the feeblest variations in the intensity of the current.
    213. This method is inapplicable when the current is very
powerful. A part of its intensity would be spent in over
coming the resistance of the wires of the instrument, and the
latter might be deteriorated. In this case we must not circu
late the whole of the current through the rheometer, but only
introduce into it a part, the amount being in proportion to the
delicacy of the apparatus.
    214. This may be effected in two ways. Let us suppose
that the wires of the galvanometer terminate in two glasses
filled with mercury, in which are plunged the extremities of
the circuit traversed by the voltaic current. A conductor will
serve to unite these two glasses. This conductor may be a
rheostat, which, by changing the length of the communicating
wire, will determine a variation in an inverse direction in the
 intensity of the part of the current which is conveyed to the
 multiplier.
    215. We may also give constant dimensions to the con
 ductor which joins the two glasses, and connect this rheostat
 with the rheometer. It is always possible to separate in this
 manner a part of the whole current proportioned to the sen
 sitiveness of the instrument without weakening the energy of
 the action of the battery upon the substances comprised in its
 circuit. The measure of the variations of this energy will be
 diminished in the relation of the abstracted to the total cur
 rent; but this diminution will be compensated by the perfec
 tion of the system of needles subjected to the influence of the
 abstracted current, as long as the battery is not of very great
 power".
  § XXI. Does Electro-magnetic Induction modify the conduc
                   tibility of bodies for Electricity ?
    216. Philosophers have carefully determined the electro
 dynamic relations which are established between a magnet
 and a conductor traversed by an electric current when one of
    * This method of derivation has already been employed in my second
 memoir (74.). See the important work of Mr. Wheatstone, entitled “An
 Account of several new Instruments,” &c., Phil. Trans. 1843, part 2, p. 322;

these bodies is moveable. They have studied the remarkable
effects which the magnet produces upon the voltaic arc, and
the sounds which it gives rise to in the conductors traversed
by discontinuous currents. But they appear not to have in
vestigated the influence which might be exercised by the mag
netic or diamagnetic state developed in various substances on
their conducting power. The following experiments are in
tended to fill up this blank.
   217. An electro-magnet was set in action by a Grove's
battery of ten large pairs, and rendered capable of raising
several hundredweight. The conductors of the battery com
municated with two little cups filled with mercury. The
wires of the electro-magnet terminated in two other similar
cups. In effecting the junctions by the aid of the commutator
already described (152.), the direction of the magnetization
was made to vary at will, and very rapidly.
   218. A zinc and copper pair, of small dimensions, was
plunged into distilled water. The current was conveyed by
long strips of thick copper, intended to comprise in their cir
cuit the bodies to be magnetized, and an excellent Ruhm
korff’s rheometer far enough off to experience no perturbation.
   219. The first conductor submitted to trial was the soft
iron armature of the electro-magnet, isolated from the poles
by the interposition of a thin sheet of paper. Whatever were
the energy of the magnetism produced, and its direction rela
tively to the direction of the current which traversed the ar
mature, the index of the rheometer remained in one constant
position.
   220. Being desirous of giving greater certitude to this re
sult, I employed a soft iron wire, perfectly annealed, and
twisted fifty-eight times upon itself. The whole length of this
wire was two metres, and the length of the convolutions equal
to the distance of the poles from the magnet. After isolating
all the folds with very dry paper, I substituted this wire, three
millimetres thick, for the armature of the previous experi
ment. The multiplier was not affected by the production
of sixty contrary polarities conferred consecutively and at
equal intervals during the passage of the voltaic current. ..
   221. A solution of sulphate of protoxide of iron was dis
posed axially on the poles.     Its conductibility was not modi
fied by the magnetization.                -
   222. I then replaced the iron and its solution by diamag
netic metals. Some bars of bismuth and others of antimony
were first tried in the axial position. They were then placed
equatorially, after covering them with a thin piece of paper to
isolate them from two soft-iron armatures, of the same length

 as themselves, and each resting on one of the poles of the
 magnet. The induction was again without influence.
   223. The experiment was repeated with a bar of bismuth
 antimony. Two polar armatures concentrated the maximum
 of magnetic energy upon the solder, when the cylinder was
 perpendicular to the axis of magnetization. This heteroge
 neous conductor was traversed by the current of the pair in
 directions successively opposite; the position of the magnetic
poles was also changed. In spite of these alternatives, the
 absolute value of the deviation of the galvanometer remained
 invariable.
    224. I wished to anticipate the objection that the electric
 current passed through my different conductors was too weak
 not to be admitted without modification, whatever were the
 molecular changes caused by an intense magnetism, and those
which depended on the cessation of that force. I therefore
replaced the small cell (218.) by three Daniell’s cells of large
dimensions, charged with some concentrated sulphate of cop
per and strongly acidulated water. For the Ruhmkorff’s
rheometer I substituted one of Gourjon, No. 27, the wire of
which is much longer. A rheostat was connected with this
instrument, and the derivation of the rheometer current was
effected as has been stated (215).
   225. The repetition of all the preceding experiments led
to the same conclusion as before.
   226. A bismuth-iron cylinder was placed first axially, then
equatorially. The direction of the magnetization was succes
sively deranged. Some armatures magnetized the solder in
the diamagnetic position with extreme energy. The result
did not vary.
   227. Lastly, I tried the experiment on different liquids, as
the chlorides of nickel and cobalt dissolved in distilled water,
and on acid solutions of nitrate of bismuth and chloride of
antimony. These solutions were contained in glass tubes
closed by stoppers which admitted the passage of metallic
wires. Here again the rheometric deviation was not at all
affected by the induction of the magnet.
   228. It remained to examine the case of a current still more
intense, traversing the magnetized conductor. I employed
that of a battery of ten large Daniell’s elements. But in order
not to take measures on too small a portion of the active elec
tricity, the multiplier was replaced by a voltameter with very
large plates of platina.
   229. The armature of the electro-magnet, placed in the
circuit, did not vary in conductibility, in whatever direction it
was magnetized or brought to its ordinary state.

On the Motion of a Rigid System about a Fixed Point.                  427
   230. The long iron wire (220.) behaved as before.
    231. Lastly, I examined under the same point of view some
bodies having an atomic rotatory power on the polarized waves
of light and heat. I applied to them the principle of deri
vation mentioned (214.), employing Gourjon’s rheometer, and
a voltaic intensity proportioned to their conducting power.
   232. Some sugar syrup in a glass tube was placed between
the poles of the electro-magnet. The current of ten Daniell’s
pairs was made to pass through it a length of some milli
metres. The multiplier was not affected by the magnetiza
tion, whatever was its direction.
    233. A concentrated solution of sulphate of quinine in di
stilled water, traversed by a current of five pairs, gave the
same result.
    234. Concentrated tartaric acid, submitted to the current
of a single Daniell’s pair a length of three centimetres, was
not modified by the magnetic induction.
    235. It follows from these researches that magnetization
does not alter the molecular condition developed by the pas
sage of an electric current so as to affect its conductibility".
The inverse proposition would also be verified in all proba
bility. If then, electricity results, as some physicists suppose,
in aetherial movements depending on the surrounding matter,
these movements preserve their intensity when this matter is
acted upon by the forces which emanate from the poles of an
energetic magnet. This circumstance must be taken into
account by the theories which pretend to explain the phae
nomena of electricity and magnetism.

      HERE is a very simple theorem which seems to be
       capable of useful applications in the theory of the motion
of a rigid system. I do not remember ever to have seen it
explicitly stated, though Mr. Boole appears to refer to it in a
paper published some time ago in this Journal, which will be
mentioned below. I propose here to give a geometrical de
   * After digesting these notes, I have found in the Traité de Physique of
 M. Péclet an isolated observation which agrees with the facts examined
above, although the author has not drawn from them any conclusion rela
tive to the nullity of the influence of the magnetism upon the conductibi
lity. (See vol. ii. p. 265, No. 1142; 4th edition, 1847.)

 428       Prof. Donkin on the Geometrical Laws of the
 monstration of it, after establishing the necessary definitions
 and conventions.
    In considering the motion of a rigid system about a fixed
 point, let us conceive a sphere to be described about that
 point as a centre, and fixed in space; and another sphere,
 with the same centre and radius, to be invariably connected
 with and carried by the moveable rigid system; so that the
 motion of this latter sphere may be substituted for that of the
 rigid system, so far as its geometrical displacement only is
 concerned. For convenience, let the radius of each sphere
 be taken equal to the linear unit.
    When a rotation takes place about any axis passing
 through the centre, let the points of intersection of that axis
 with either sphere be called the poles of the rotation; and let
 that be called the positive or north pole, with respect to which
 the rotation has the same direction as the earth's diurnal
 motion with respect to its north pole.
    Suppose A, B are any two points on either sphere; we may
 use the abbreviated expression “the rotation AB’ to denote
 that rotation of the moveable sphere round the axis of the
 great circle joining AB, which would cause the point A on
 the moveable sphere to describe the arc AB on the fixed
 sphere; and we may call the positive or north pole of such a
 rotation the positive or north pole of the arc AB.
    It is plain that the rotation AB is the same thing whether
 the two points A, B be supposed to be on the fixed or move
 able sphere. But two successive rotations AB, CD will in
 general produce a different displacement, according as the
 four points A, B, C, D are on one or the other sphere.
    I now proceed to the theorem in question.
    THEOREM.                      Fig. 1.          D
 Let ABC be any
 spherical triangle
upon the fived
sphere. Then twice
the rotation AB,
followed by twice
the rotation BC,
produces the same
displacement      as
twice the rotation
AC.

BE = AB and BD=CB. Also produce AC both ways, and
make AF=CG= AC. Then because the angles D, E are re
spectively equal to the angles at C and A, and DE = AC, it
is plain that the rotation AE (or 2AB) will carry that arc on
the moveable sphere which at first coincides with FA, into
the position DE; and then the rotation DC (or 2BC) will
carry the same arc from the position DE to the position CG.
But this last is the position into which it would have been
carried by the single rotation FC (or 2AC); whence the
truth of the theorem is manifest.
    The following is an equivalent theorem, easily deducible
from the preceding. It is worth while, however, to establish
 it independently.
    Let PQR be any spherical triangle upon the fived sphere,
 the letters being so arranged that Q is the positive pole of a ro
 tation from QP to QR. Then, if P, Q, R. denote the interior
 angles of the triangle, a positive rotation 2P round the pole P,
followed by a positive rotation 2G, round Q, produces the same
 displacement as a positive rotation 2(t–R) round R.
    Demonstration.—                      -
 Produce PR, and                       Fig. 2.

  QR; draw Qp           p
  =QP, making an
  angle     pGWR=
  P&R; join pR
  and produce it.
  Then it is plain
  that the triangles
 p(\R, PQR have
  their sides   and
  angles    respect
  ively equal. Now       *                                     V
  the first rotation
  (round P) will carry that arc on the moveable sphere which
  at first coincides with PT, into the position PV; and the
  next rotation (round Q) will carry the same arc into the po
  sition pW. But this same displacement would evidently have
  been produced by a single rotation round R through the angle
   PRp, or 2SRP. Whence the theorem is proved.
     It is easy to establish corresponding propositions for the
   case in which the spherical triangles are drawn upon the
   moveable sphere. In fact, we have only to look upon the dis
   placements supposed in the preceding demonstrations, as rela

4:30      Prof. Donkin on the Geometrical Laws of the
tive instead of absolute, and consider the sphere there supposed
moveable to be fixed, attributing opposite rotations to the
sphere there supposed fixed, and we obtain the following
theorems:—
   Let ABC be any triangle on the moveable sphere. Then
twice the rotation BA followed by twice the rotation CB is
equivalent to twice the rotation CA.
   Referring to figure 1, and considering it as drawn on the
moveable sphere, we see that this is equivalent to the fol
lowing proposition, viz. twice the rotation EB followed by
twice the rotation BD is equivalent to twice the rotation CA.
Whence it is obvious that we may enunciate the theorem as
follows:—
   Twice the rotation AB followed by twice the rotation BC is
equivalent to twice the rotation DE.
   The second theorem will take the following form:—
   Let PQR be any triangle on the moveable sphere, the letters
being arranged as before. Then a negative rotation 2P round
P, followed by a negative rotation 2G) round Q, is equivalent to
a negative rotation 2(t–R) round R.
   It is also easily seen that in this enunciation we may sub
stitute positive for negative rotations, provided we adopt the
reverse arrangement of the letters P, Q, R, namely, that in
which Q shall be the negative pole of the rotation from QP
to QR.
   If in this theorem, whether referring to the fixed or move
able sphere, we suppose the rotations indefinitely small, the
order of the two component rotations becomes indifferent, and
we easily obtain the ordinary propositions concerning the
composition of angular velocities.
   I shall not, however, enter into details upon this point, as
I wish at present to point out the use which may be made of
the preceding theory, as affording a direct connecting link
between the geometrical laws of the displacements of a rigid
system, and the analytical formulae of Sir W. Hamilton's
method of quaternions. In fact, the latter method furnishes
an algebraical theory of spherical trigonometry; and we have
just seen that the geometrical laws in question depend in a
very simple manner on the properties of spherical triangles.
I must premise, however, that I have found it convenient to
use a system of interpretation of quaternions which differs, to
a certain extent, from that employed by Sir W. Hamilton
himself. It is possible, therefore, that the two following in
stances of the application of the method may not be fully in
telligible. . . I give them nevertheless, in the hope that I may
be allowed in a future communication to explain the prin

       Motion of a Rigid System about a Fixed Point,        431
ciples of interpretation alluded to, which appear to me to
possess considerable advantages, at least for some purposes.
   Returning to the suppositions made at the beginning of this
paper, let us conceive two systems of rectangular axes, having
their common origin at the centre; one system being fixed in
space, and the other invariably connected with the moveable
sphere; the axes being, moreover, so arranged, that the posi
tive axis of Z shall meet the sphere in the positive pole of the

   Formulae equivalent to these were obtained by Mr. Cayley
as analytical results of M. Rodrigues formulae for the trans
formation of coordinates, and published in the Cambridge
Mathematical Journal in 1843 (vol. iii. p. 226). Their geo
metrica significance, however, was not apparent before the
discovery of quaternions. The possibility of representing the
effect of successive rotations of a rigid system by a quaternion

4.32      Prof. Donkin on the Geometrical Laws of the
product has been since noticed both by Mr. Cayley (Phil.
Mag. vol. xxxiii. p. 196) and Mr. Boole (vol. xxxiii. p. 278);
I have introduced the above proof of it partly for the sake of
future reference, and partly because I am not certain whether
Mr. Boole refers to it as a proposition depending upon Mr.
Cayley’s results, or as the analytical expression of an indepen
dent geometrical theorem, under which latter aspect I have
here viewed it.
   I shall conclude this paper by showing how the formulae of
M. Rodrigues may be established by means of quaternions.
The investigation is closely connected with the subject of the
preceding observations, and it will be seen to include an ex
planation of another remarkable analytical result noticed by
Mr. Cayley (Phil. Mag. vol. xxvi. p. 142).
   Recurring to fig. 1, and recollecting that the radius of the
sphere is represented by unity, let l, m, n be the coordinates
of the positive pole of AB, and v, y, z the coordinates of the
positive pole of AC, both referred to the fixed axes, with which
the moveable axes at first coincide.     Also let
                      2AB=0, 2AC= p.
   When the moveable sphere has been displaced by the ro
tation AE=6, let
                  a, b, c,  a, b, c';   a”, b", c'"
be respectively the direction cosines of the moved axes, referred
to the fixed axes. The plane of the great circle (on the move
able sphere) which at first coincided with that of AC, now
coincides with that of DE, so that x, y, z are also the coordi
nates of the positive pole of DE referred to the moved axes.
Hence if #, n, be the coordinates of this same pole referred
to the fixed axes, we have, by the common formulae,
                        #= ax + ay+a"z
                       n=bv + by +b"z
                        &=cx+cy+c"z.
   Now let                        a  .
                 q=  *: + sin #(i+jm-in)
      •         q'= cos' + sin #G# B)
                q"=  cos' + sin: (#####).
Then, applying the calculus of quaternions to the triangles
ABC, BDE, it is easily seen that we have

 . These are the formulae in question, as given by Mr. Cayley
 in the Cambridge Mathematical Journal *.
    The preceding process affords a striking example of the
 power of the method of quaternions in reducing complex geo
 metrical questions of a particular class to algebraical calcula
 tion. The reader will probably have perceived that I consider
 the quaternion
                       {cos S + sin Š(il-Hjm +kn)}p
 (where l’+m”--n’=1) as representing the rotation of a line
 or radius vector p through an angle S in a plane perpendicular
 to the axis whose direction cosines are l, m, n.              In a future
 paper I propose, with the editors’ permission, to explain the
 system of interpretation which leads to this result, and to show
 that it represents the theory of quaternions as a natural and,
 indeed, necessary extension of the common geometrical algebra
 of two dimensions.

LVI. On a new and curious Application of the Permanence
    of Impressions on the Retina. By M. J. PLATEAU, Member
   of the Royal Academy of Belgium".
                             [With a Plate.]
      WO discs of white paper, of sufficient strength, are to be
       cut out, one 30 and the other 35 centimetres in diameter.
The first is divided into eight equal sectors; two opposite sec
tors are then painted red, and two others blue, employing for
this purpose fine gum colours; two other opposed sectors are
afterwards covered with a very opake black, and a circular
space of 4 centimetres in diameter, in the centre of the disc,
is covered with the same black; finally, the two last sectors
are left white (see Plate II. fig. 1, in which the colours red and
blue are indicated by the shading and the letters r and b).
When this is done, a colourless varnish is laid upon the disc,
which penetrates into the pores of the paper, and gives more
transparency to the white and coloured parts+. In the other
disc are made two opposite openings, likewise in the form of
sectors, but which extend to only 3 centimetres of the circum
ference of the disc, and whose angular width is only three
fourths of that of the sectors of the other disc; their extremi
ties adjoining the centre also leave a distance between them of
4 centimetres; this disc is blackened all over (see fig. 2).
    These discs are fixed respectively at their centres, by means
of nuts, upon two small brass pulleys 3 centimetres in dia
meter. These last are placed upon a support so that the
discs are vertical, parallel to one another, and distant 3 cen
timetres from each other, and so that the two axes are in
the same straight line. These pulleys are furnished with
cords which pass over two other larger pulleys; these are of
wood; they are both 15 centimetres in diameter, and are fixed
upon a common axis, which is furnished with a small handle.
Lastly, the cords are arranged so that the two brass pul
leys, and consequently the two discs, turn in the same direc
tion. This system is similar to that of the anorthoscope,
as it has been presented to the public, except the equality
in diameter of the brass pulleys, the community of direction
of their motions, the less number of the openings of the
black disc, and the greater width of these openings. Like
the anorthoscope also, the present instrument must be em
ployed in the evening, and strongly illumined by a good lamp
   * From the Bulletin de l'Acad. de Bruxelles, vol. xvi. p. 424.
  t In order that, in the disc thus varnished, the tints of the coloured
parts may remain very bright when observed by transmission, it is well for
the colours to be applied on both sides of the paper.

conveniently placed behind the coloured disc; lastly, the ob
server must also place himself on the other side of the appa
ratus, that is to say, opposite to the black disc, keeping his
eyes on a level with the centres of the discs, whilst another
person turns the handle with sufficient rapidity. The di
stance of the observer from the apparatus must be a metre at
least.
    With this arrangement, let us imagine, for an instant, that
the diameters of the two brass pulleys are mathematically
equal, that the same is the case with the two wooden pulleys,
and that the thicknesses of the two cords are also exactly
alike. Then the velocities of the two discs will be perfectly
equal; and as they are in the same direction, it is clear that
if, at the commencement of the movement, the two openings
correspond, for example, to the red sectors, they will continue
to correspond with them indefinitely; so that, if the velocity is
sufficient, the observer will simply see the whole circular
space traversed by the openings coloured a uniform red, and
the effect of the apparatus will be limited to this. But this
perfect equality of the velocities will not be realized; for sup
posing the pulleys to have been made with such care that
their diameters might be regarded as perfectly equal, and
admitting moreover that the two cords, taken from the same
piece, have exactly the same thickness, special precautions
would still be requisite for them to have exactly the same
tension; and a very small difference in this respect suffices to
alter in some degree the equality of their thicknesses, and con
sequently that of the velocities. There will therefore be in
general a small inequality between the velocities of the two
discs, and upon this inequality is founded the illusion here in
question.                               -
    In fact, let us suppose, in order to fix our ideas, that the
colours are ranged in the order of figure 1, that the discs turn
in the direction indicated by the arrows, and that the black
disc has a small excess of velocity. In this case, let us arrange
matters so that before putting the apparatus in motion, the
middle of the width of the openings may correspond with the
middle of that of the black sectors of the other disc. It is
then clear that at the commencement of the movement the
observer will only see a completely black surface. But the
relative position of the openings and of the black sectors
changing by degrees, by reason of the small excess of velocity
of the first, after a certain time the openings will begin en
croaching a little upon the red sectors, and consequently the
observer will see the black surface become uniformly coloured
with a slight tinge of red; then the encroachment of the

436      M. J. Plateau on some new and curious applications
openings upon the sectors of this colour continually increasing,
the tint of the apparent surface will become more and more
vivid, and will pass at last into a brilliant red when the open
ings project entire upon the red sectors. This tint will
continue without alteration until the openings begin to en
croach upon the white sectors; the red will then begin to
grow pale, will pass slowly into a rose colour, becoming gra
dually of a lighter shade, and finally to white. This last will
then gradually change into a blue, more and more vivid,
which after some time will begin to darken, giving place in
sensibly to black. Lastly, if the movement be continued, the
phaenomena will be reproduced in the same order.
   The tints thus produced are very beautiful, without having
too much brilliancy; their uniformity is perfect, and the pas
sage from one to the other is effected with extreme delicacy.
This illusion then presents, within certain limits, a sort of
realization of the ocular harpsichord of Father Castel, and
the persons to whom I have shown it have appeared to derive
from it great pleasure.
   In conclusion I would urge this point, that the success of the
experiment entirely depends on the establishment of a suitable
inequality between the velocities of the two discs. To attain
this, it is necessary that, in the construction of the instrument,
the diameters of the two brass pulleys should be made as
perfectly equal as possible, as well as those of the two wooden
pulleys, and that great care should be taken to give the same
tension to the two cords, which should be taken from the same
piece; the small differences which will always exist, in spite
of these precautions, will produce, unless by a very peculiar
chance, a sufficient inequality between the two velocities; for,
it will be understood, it is necessary that this inequality should
be the least possible.

       of the Permanence of Impressions on the Retina.         437
sion to the two velocities, their relative direction, and the form
of the slits. In the instrument as constructed according to
my directions for the public, the velocity of the transparent
disc is to that of the opake disc as 4 to 1, and these velocities
are in opposite directions; lastly, the slits are straight, and
directed from the centre of the disc to the circumference.
   With these elements, as shown by the instrument in ques
tion, the distorted figure is single, it is angularly dilated, and
it gives rise to five regular figures symmetrically arranged
around the centre of the disc; but it is clear that other ar
rangements would lead to other results. Now as no one, that
I am aware, has hitherto varied these arrangements, and as,
on changing them in part, we arrive in certain cases at results
which appear to me curious, I proceed to examine the subject
in some detail.
   To simplify the considerations, I will suppose the slits ex
cessively narrow, so that they may be regarded as simple lines.
This being laid down, I shall here call to mind that the re
gular figure obtained by the simultaneous movement of the
two discs is composed of the aggregate of the impressions left
on the eye by the points of the distorted figure seen through
the same slit in the successive positions of the latter. Now,
if the slit is considered in one of these positions in particular,
all the points of the distorted figure which correspond to it at
that instant presented to the eye, are perceived simultane
ously, and consequently belong, with their relative positions,
to the regular figure; that is to say, they are in the latter
ranged identically in the same manner upon a line of the same
form as the slit. Reciprocally, then, if, after having drawn
upon a sheet of paper the regular figure which it is desired to
reproduce by means of the apparatus, a line be traced upon
the latter which represents the slit in one of its positions, all
the points in which this line will cut the figure should be found
placed identically in the same manner upon a similar line in
the drawing of the distorted figure; and the same will take
place with any number of similar lines, traced upon the draw
ing of the regular figure, and representing so many successive
positions of the slit. The series of points which are found
respectively upon these lines, will then have all their identical
corresponding points upon the drawing of the distorted figure;
but these last will not occupy among them the same relative
positions as upon the first drawing, and in this will consist the
deformation.
   To fix our ideas and avoid complication, let us suppose, in
what follows, that the slits are rectilinear, and directed ac
cording to the radii of the disc.        This being the case, we

438      M. J. Plateau on some new and curious applications
proceed to study successively the systems in which the two
discs turn in contrary directions, and those in which they turn
in the same direction.
                I. Velocities in contrary directions.
   Let us imagine a slit in one of its positions, which for greater
simplicity we will suppose vertical, and the radius of the
transparent disc, which is seen at this moment through this
slit, let us call r; the impression left on the retina by the
series of the points of the distorted figure ranged on this ra
dius r, will belong to the regular image. Let us then imagine
the slit in a subsequent position, making with the first any
angle which we will designate by 2. In this new position
there will be another radius of the transparent disc, which we
will call r', behind the slit, and the impression produced in
the eye by the succession of the points of the distorted figure
ranged on this second radius, will belong also to the regular
image. In this image the two series of points will comprise
therefore between them the angle 2. But whilst the slit,
quitting the vertical, has advanced up to its meeting the radius
r' whilst describing this angle, the radius r, also quitting the
vertical, has described, in a contrary direction, another angle
which we shall designate by 3; whence it follows that at the
instant when the slit comes before the radius r', at an angular
distance a from the vertical, the radius r is, on the opposite
side, at an angular distance 3 from this same vertical, and that,
consequently, upon the transparent disc, the radii r and r"
comprise between them an angle equal to 8+ a.
   Thus, two series of points respectively ranged upon two
radii traced upon the drawing of the regular figure, and com
prising between them the angle a, will have for correspondents
upon the drawing of the distorted figure, two series of points
ranged in the same manner upon two radii comprising between
them the greater angle 3+ x; and, consequently, the deforma
tion will consist simply of an angular dilatation of the regular
figure.
   It is easy to find the general expression of the relation
8+2.

          In fact, this relation may be stated under the form
8 + 1; now the angle 8 is evidently to the angle x as the ve

 a quantity which depends only on the relation between the
 velocities of the two discs.
    From the above it is seen, that, for a given relation between
 the two velocities, the construction of the distorted figure will
 be effected by the following process:–1. Tracing upon the
 drawing of the regular figure which it is desired to reproduce,
 a series of radii sufficiently near together. 2. Tracing the
 same number of radii upon the disc which is to bear the dis
 torted figure, but so that the angle comprised between each
 of these latter radii and that which follows it be to the angle
 comprised between the two corresponding radii of the regular
 drawing in the relation M. 3. Transferring successively upon
each of the radii of the disc the series of points ranged upon
the corresponding radii of the regular drawing, placing these
points at the same respective distances from the centre.
4. Lastly, connecting with each other, by suitable lines, the
points thus distributed. For example, in the published anor
thoscope, the velocity of the transparent disc is fourfold that
of the black disc, which gives M=5; and, in fact, the con
struction of the drawings of that instrument consisted simply
in rendering the angular distances five times greater than in
the regular figures which were to be reproduced. It is seen,
by the above general expression of the relation M, that the
deformation will be greater in proportion as the velocity of
the transparent disc is more considerable with relation to that
of the black disc.                                                -
   We may substitute, in the formula (1.), for the quantity M
its equal 8  #;    hence we shall consequently have
                      84.2–2(\#1),
an expression in which 8+ x is evidently the angular distance
which separates the radius r of the slit, when the latter has
described the angle x. Now, if this latter angle is such that the
angular distance 8+ 2 has for its measure the entire circum
ference, the slit will occur again before the radius r. If then,
we designate by a the value of a which fulfills this condition,
and if, in order to simplify, we take the circumference as unity,
the condition in question will give

and a regular, perfect figure will thus be produced in this
same angle. But as the slit then coincides again with the
first point of the distorted figure, a new regular figure will
also be produced in a following angle equal to the first, and
so on. The figure is multiplied, then, whilst becoming regular;
and if the angle of which we have just spoken is measured by
an aliquot part of the circumference, which evidently requires
that the relation w: be an entire number, the regular figures
will be found ranged symmetrically round the centre, and will
be reproduced in the same positions at each revolution of the
slit. It is clear that the number of these figures will then be
equal to

and there are produced, in fact, five identical regular figures,
symmetrically arranged around the centre.
    The velocities must always be taken such, that the relation
Va.
     be an entire number; for otherwise, when the slit shall

have made one revolution, it is clear, from what precedes, that
it will not be found again in coincidence with the first point
of the distorted figure, and that, consequently, the regular
figures afterwards produced will not be superposed upon the
first, so that there will be confusion.
   If it is desired that each regular figure be seen completely

necessary, when the drawing of it is made, that it be comprised

This is what has been done, for example, in the published
anorthoscope, with regard to the figure which represents a
lady holding a parasol. If the drawing exceeds the angle in
question, the distorted figure will be found folded upon itself
in such a manner that one of its extremities partly conceals
the other, and each of the regular figures produced will have
one of its extremities partly concealed by the other extremity
of its adjoining one. This, for example, may be seen in the
published anorthoscope, with respect to the figure representing
a galloping horse. It is clear that it will be usually advan
tageous to arrange matters in this manner.
   Lastly, we have hitherto reasoned on the hypothesis in
which the black disc should present only a single slit; but it
is easy to show that a number of equidistant slits may be
                                              Va

take again as initial positions of the two discs those in which
one slit corresponds to the first point of the distorted figure,
it is evident that, after one revolution from this point, the slit
will have made a portion of a revolution measured by the

the above fraction is comprised in unity, that is to say w: slits,

it always being understood that this latter quantity is a whole
number. It is thus that, in the published anorthoscope, for
which we have V,  : =4, the black disc presents four slits.
               II. Velocities in the same direction.
   Let x and 8, as before, be the angles described at the same
time, starting from the vertical, by a slit and by a radius r of
the transparent disc, and let also r" be the radius before which
the slit comes in its second position. The angle a will still
be that comprehended, in the regular image, by the two series
of points respectively ranged upon the radii r and r"; but here
the angles a and 6 being on the same side of the vertical, the
   Phil. Mag. S. 3. Vol. 36. No. 245. June 1850. 2 G

442     M. J. Plateau on some new and curious applications
angle comprised upon the transparent disc between the radii
r and r", will evidently be equal to the difference of these
angles. Thus, two radii traced upon the drawing of the
regular figure, and comprising between them the angle a, will
have for correspondents, upon the drawing of the distorted
figure, two radii comprising the angle 2–8, an angle the value
of which may be positive or negative; the relation of these
two angles will then be
                     # =# =1 # =1–4.
                       - = *- :           V,
If we designate it again by M, the construction of the distorted
figure will be given by the expression                       -
                                     Vg

   But the results of this construction will be of a different
nature, according as we have V, - V, or V, -V., that is to
say, according as the velocity of the transparent disc is greater.
or less than that of the black disc. We shall now proceed
successively to a consideration of these two cases.                -
                     First case : Vd = W, .
   In this case the relation M will necessarily be less than
unity; whence it follows that the distortion will always con
sist of an angular contraction, a contraction which will be
stronger as the velocities approach nearer to one another.
   If we designate by y the angle comprised between the two
radii which pass respectively by the first and by the last point
of the regular figure, and by y' the angle comprised between
the two radii which pass in the same manner by the extreme
points of the distorted figure, we shall evidently have:      =M,
whence
                              y' = My. .  . .   . .. .. .      (4.)
   Now it is evident, that here, in one revolution of the slit,
only a single regular figure will be manifested. In fact, for
this figure to be multiple, it would be necessary for the slit to
recur several times in its revolution, in coincidence with the
first point of the distorted figure; now, according to a similar
coincidence, the point in question, in virtue of the less velocity
of the transparent disc, will remain behind the slit; so that
this last will have made its revolution before it, and conse
quently no other coincidence can be produced. Nothing,
then, limits the angular extent which the regular figure may
have; and consequently, when this figure is constructed to de

        of the Permanence of Impressions on the Retina.        443
form it afterwards, it may be taken quite arbitrarily as to
position and size, provided, be it well understood, that it is
comprised in a circle equal in diameter to the transparent
disc. This regular figure may, for example, be a head equal
in height to the diameter of the disc. Only, the pulleys to
which the discs are fixed, and the rod which bears these pul
leys, will conceal a small portion of the image. The greatest
angle which the regular figure can occupy will then be mea
sured by an entire circumference. Consequently, if we again
take the circumference for unity in the measure of the angles,
and designate by A the greatest angle which the distorted
figure can occupy, the equation (4.) will give, making y= 1
and y' = A,
                               A=M; . . . . . . . (5.)
thus the extent of the distorted figure cannot exceed an angle
having for measure the fraction M.
    Although one entire revolution of the slit can, as we have
seen, produce only a single regular figure, yet the figures which
are produced in the subsequent revolutions must be all super
posed on the first, without which there would be confusion.
But this requires that the successive coincidences of the slit
and the first point of the distorted figure be effected at the
same spot; or, in other words, that in the interval of one coin
cidence to the following, the slit make either one complete
                           e
revolution, or an entire number of revolutions. Let us then
seek the condition which, for this to happen, the relation      %7t
of the two velocities must satisfy.
    Let us suppose this relation reduced to its simplest expres
sion, or, in other words, let us assume to represent the two
 velocities, two numbers which have no common factor. As
 in the case of the velocities of contrary directions, let x' be
 the angle described by the slit from one coincidence with the
 first point of the distorted figure up to the ensuing coincidence.
 The mode of reasoning which we have employed to arrive at
 the expression (2.), will lead us, in the present case, to the
 relation
 which will give
 But as, from one coincidence to the other, the slit must ac
                                2 G 2

 444      M. J. Plateau on some new and curious applications
 complish one revolution or an entire number of revolutions,
 it will be necessary that the angle a' be equal to unity or to
 any entire number. Now we cannot suppose a'= 1 ; for, ac
 cording to the above expression, there would result from it
 Va =0; thus the second coincidence can only be produced
 after several revolutions of the slit. Now, as the numbers V.
 and V, have no common factor, it is clear that the quantity
-v'v.
    72    d
            , or a', can only be equal to an entire number, if we
 have V, -V.E.1. We arrive, then, lastly, at this conclusion,
that the velocities should be taken such, that the numbers
 which represent them differ among themselves only by a unit.
 We shall then have simply a' =V,; that is to say, from one
coincidence to another, the slit will accomplish a number of
revolutions equal to V.
    We remark, moreover, that in this case the value of M
given by the expression (3.) is simplified, and becomes
                                     I
                               M=v- . . . . . . (6)
The expression (5.) will also consequently become
                                     1
                               A= W.   *
                                           .   .  .  .   . . (7)
This being settled, let us examine more closely what passes
in the successive revolutions of the slit. If we always start
from a coincidence, it is at once evident that, in the first of
these revolutions, a complete regular figure will have been
produced; or, in other words, that the slit will have passed
before the whole of the distorted figure. In fact, according
to the manner in which we have arrived at the formula (3.),
if we suppose that after a coincidence with the first point of
the distorted figure the slit has described an angle a, the
quantity M will represent also the relation between the angular
distance which then separates the slit from the point in ques
tion, and that angle x ; if, then, a constitutes an entire revo
lution, and is thus measured by unity, the above angular di
stance, or, in other words, the portion of the transparent disc
before which the slit will have passed from the coincidence,
will then be represented by M, and consequently, in the pre
                  1    .           -                   •
sent case, by V. But, according to the expression (7.), the
                   72,
fraction  W. is the measure of the largest angle which the dis
            ??

                             *
        of the Permanence of Impressions on the Retina.        445
torted figure can occupy; then, as I have said, this figure
will have been crossed entirely by the slit.
     According to this, since the slit will only be found in coin
cidence with the commencement of that angle after V, -1
new revolutions, it follows that, during these, it will pass
before the free part of the disc, and that nothing longer
will be seen; then, that a second regular figure will be pro
duced in a position identical with the first, to be followed by
a new interval in which nothing will be seen, and so on.
This would constitute a serious inconvenience, did not a very
simple means present itself to obviate it. This means consists
in dividing the transparent disc into V, equal angles, and re
peating, in each of them, the drawing of the distorted figure.
Then, in fact, it is clear that after each of its revolutions, the
slit will coincide with the origin of one of these angles which
it will sweep entire in the following revolution, so that the
regular images will be produced without interruption, and
 will all be mutually superposed. Another advantage will
hence result; that in general the anamorphosis will be much
 more difficult to decipher. Thus, whilst for velocities in op
 posite directions the distorted figure is single and the regular
 image multiple, it is the contrary in the case which we are
 examining; that is to say, the distorted figure is multiple and
 the regular image single.
     Lastly, let us seek what number of slits may be pierced in
 the black disc. For each of these slits to produce identically
 the same effect, it will suffice that when, after a coincidence
 between one slit and the first point of one of the distorted
 figures, the first point of the following distorted figure shall
 reach the same spot, another slit is come before it. Now,
 from one of these two positions to the other, the transparent
   •                                                       •    1
 disc has moved over an angle measured by the fraction Y-;        72
 and as the angle, the slit of which has turned at the        same
 time, is to the preceding one in the relation of the velocity of
 the black disc to that of the transparent disc, this angle will
     -                                   •   1               •
 evidently have for measure the fraction W. Such, then, is the
                                              d
 value of the angle by which the second slit should be removed
 from the first; and as the same thing will take place with re
 gard to the third slit in relation to the second, and so on, it is
 clear that the total number of the slits will be equal to Va.
       We will illustrate all this by an example. Let us suppose
 that the velocity of the transparent disc is to that of the black
 disc as 3 to 4, numbers which satisfy the condition that we
 have established, namely, only differing from each other by

 446     M. J. Plateau on some new and curious applications
 one unit. We shall then have Va–3, and V, =4, which will
 give M=    #   whence it follows that the distorted figure will
 be constructed by reducing the angular distances between the
 different points of the regular figure to a fourth of their re
       -                                              I       -
 spective values. We shall have, moreover, A= T : that is to
 say, the distorted figure will be found comprised in a right
 angle, and must be repeated four times. In fine, three slits
 may be pierced in the black disc. With these elements, we
start from the coincidence between one slit and the first point
 of one of the partial distorted figures. When this slit shall
 have completed one revolution, the point in question will only
 have made three-fourths of its revolution, so that it will be
 removed from the slit an angular distance equal to a right
 angle. The slit will then have passed before the whole of
 one of the distorted figures, and consequently a complete
 regular figure will have been produced. But then the slit
 will be found before the first point of the following distorted
 figure, so that its second revolution will cause a second regular
 figure superposed upon the first, and so on.    Moreover, when,
 after one coincidence, a slit shall have effected one-third of a
revolution, another slit will be found in the position which the
 first occupied at the instant of that coincidence; but also,
during this third of a revolution, the transparent disc will have
made a fourth of its revolution: the second slit will then cor
respond to the first point of the succeeding distorted figure,
and consequently these two slits will produce identical effects;
in short, the same reasoning applies to the third slit with re
lation to the second, and it is seen that an uninterrupted suc
 cession of regular images will result from this system, which
Awill be completely superposed upon one another.
    In order to form an idea of the kind of deformed drawings
which the case under our consideration gives, I suppose that
with the above elements it is wished to obtain, for a regular
figure, the word LOI written in white letters upon a black
ground (Plate III. fig. 1); the construction of the distorted
 figures will then give the fanciful drawing represented by
fig. 2; and we see that unless acoustomed to this kind of
anamorphosis, it would be very difficult to divine, from the
 inspection of this drawing, the regular figure which it will
produce.
    It remains for us to offer two remarks with respect to these
 figures. In the first place, let us consider a radius traced
 upon the drawing of the regular figure, and let us take, for
 example, that which, in the straight position of this figure, is



        of the Permanence of Impressions on the Retina.            447
directed vertically from below upwards, starting from the
centre.     Let us also consider a slit at the moment when it is
equally directed from below upwards.            If at this instant the
slit is situated before the radius of one of the distorted figures
corresponding to the above radius of the regular figure, it is
evident that the regular image produced will be seen in the
straight position; but if the slit coincides with another radius
of the distorted figure, this last will then occupy, in the regular
image, the vertical position, and consequently this image will
be seen inclined in one direction or the other, or even reversed.
Now we shall recall here", that, unless by a quite peculiar
chance, the system of pulleys, however carefully constructed,
will never realize in an exact manner the relation which has
been assigned to the velocities of the two discs; whence it fol
lows, that, when the slits shall one after the other attain the
vertical position from below upwards, they will coincide with
radii which occupy, in the partial distorted figures, somewhat
different positions, so that the regular images successively pro
duced will not be exactly superposed; but if the apparatus is
 well made, this displacement of the images will be excessively
small, and there will result from it only the continued sensa
tion of a single regular image turning very slowly around the
centre, an image which, consequently, will necessarily pass
by the straight position. For the rest, this movement of the
regular image may be avoided, by substituting for the system
of pulleys a system of cog-wheels; and then if by attaching
the transparent disc upon its axis, it is placed so as to fulfill
the condition indicated above, the image will occupy the
straight position, and will maintain it invariably.
   In the second place, to observe the image, the spectator
must stand at a certain distance from the apparatus, so that
the prolongation of the axes of the discs shall pass in the
middle of the interval between the two eyes.
   These remarks apply equally to the following case:—
                        2nd Case: W = W.
   Here the formula (3.) gives for M a negative value. In
order to interpret this change of sign, we resume the reasoning
which led us to the formula in question. We start always
from a vertical position of the slit and of the radius r, and
suppose that this slit and this radius proceed afterwards toward
the right. Then, when the slit, after describing the angle a,
has come before the radius r', the image of the latter will be
seen on the right of that of the radius r. But since the trans
parent disc turns more quickly than the black disc, the radius
            * See the previous note at p. 434 of this number.

448      M. J. Plateau on some new and curious applications
7' must have advanced towards the slit; whence it follows that,
upon the transparent disc, this radius r is to the left of the
radius r. Hence it results, that all the points of the distorted
figure situated on the same side of the vertical will have their
correspondents, in the regular image, situated on the other
side of this same vertical, and that consequently the angular
distances will be measured in opposite directions in the dis
torted figure and in the regular figure. It is clear, then, that
one of these figures will be inverted with reference to the
other; in other words, all that in the one is found to the right
of the vertical, is in the other to the left of this same vertical,
and vice versá. It is clear now on what depends the negative
sign of M ; for this quantity designating the relation between
the corresponding angular distances in the two figures, if we
take as positive those which belong to one of these figures,
we must, on account of the opposition of direction, consider
 as negative those which belong to the other, and consequently
 the relation will take the sign minus.
    The absolute value of the relation in question is
                                ++ -l.

 Now, as the  quantity V: 7t
                              is only limited to the condition of
 being superior to unity, it is clear that three circumstances
may present themselves; namely,
                   V                V
                   V: –1-1, V: –1 =1,

or lastly,
                               Va=2V.
    Let us begin by examining the first of these partial cases;
in other words, let us suppose that the velocity of the trans
parent disc exceeds the double of that of the black disc. Then
the absolute value of M exceeding unity, it follows that the
distorted figure will be, as for the systems of opposed velocities,
angularly dilated with relation to the regular figure; and by
reasonings analogous to those we have employed with regard
to these systems, we shall recognize without difficulty that the
regular image will also be multiple; lastly, we shall ascertain

          of the Permanence of Impressions on the Retina.       449

to be superposed on those of the preceding revolutions, the

                                                   Let us take, for
example, the velocity of the transparent disc equal to six times
that of the black disc.     The absolute value of M will then be
5, and consequently the angular dimensions of the distorted
figure will be, as in the published anorthoscope, five times
those of the regular figure. This distorted figure then will
be constructed in the same manner, the inversion excepted, as
in the system of the published anorthoscope; whence it fol
lows, that if, for example, we by transmission look at one of
the distorted figures which belong to this system, we shall
have that which will produce the same regular figure in the
new system, on turning the disc, that is to say, by placing
opposite the eye the face of this disc which was first
turned toward the light. Moreover, in this new system, the
regular figure will be likewise repeated five times around
the centre; for when, after a coincidence between one slit and
the first point of the distorted figure, this slit shall have per
formed one-fifth of a revolution, the point in question will
have performed six-fifths of a revolution, that is to say, one
revolution plus one-fifth, so that it will be found behind the
 slit, and consequently a regular figure will have been produced.
 As to the number of the slits to pierce in the black disc, they
 must be six instead of four; for when, after a coincidence
 between one slit and the above point, this point shall have
 accomplished one revolution, the slit will only have reached a
 sixth of its revolution.                   ©
     According to what we have stated above, it is seen that if
 we desire, with the same distorted figures, to obtain absolutely
 identical results in the two systems, it will suffice, in order to
 employ them in the second, to invert the discs which had been
 constructed for the first; that is to say, that each of these
 discs shall be attached to the pulley, so that the face which,
 in the first system, was turned towards the black disc, should
 on the contrary be turned towards the lamp; moreover, it
 will be necessary in one of the systems to employ a black disc
 pierced with four slits, and in the other a black disc pierced
 with six slits. If, in passing from one of these systems to the
 other, the inversion of the transparent discs is not effected, it is
 clear that it is then the regular figures which will return; if, for
 example, we employ successively in the two systems, and with
 out inverting it, the distorted figure intended to give, as a
 regular result, horses at a gallop, the horse which shows itself
 on the upper part of the image will have, in one of the systems,

450      M. J. Plateau on some new and curious applications
the head to the right and the tail to the left, and in the other,
the head to the left and the tail to the right.
   We arrive, then, at a curious conclusion, namely, that the
same transparent discs may be employed with two systems of
entirely different velocities. Now it is clear that this conclu
sion is not limited to the above example, and that for every
system of velocities in contrary directions, there may likewise
be substituted a system belonging to the partial case under
our consideration, and vice versá. We shall evidently obtain
the general relation between the proportions of the velocities
in these two equivalent systems, by equalling to the value of
M given by the formula (1) the value of this same quantity
given by the formula (3.), and taken with contrary signs. If,
then, in this last we designate the velocities by V's and V',

and it is seen that, as we have said, if the proportion of the
velocities of one of the two systems is a whole number, that of
the velocities of the other system will be so likewise.
   Let us now pass to the second partial case, that is to say,
let us suppose V, to be comprised between V, and 2V. Then
the absolute value of M will be less than unity, and conse
quently the distorted figure will be angularly contracted with
relation to the regular figure. Following always the same
mode of reasoning, we shall see that if Va only exceeds V, by
one unit, we  shalf be able to repeat the distorted figure, as
in the case of the systems in which, on the contrary, V, ex
ceeds Va by one unit; so that there will be again two different
systems which may be substituted one for the other. For
example, if we take Vd = 5 and V, =4, the absolute value
of M will be   #   so that, as in the drawing of the figure 2, the
angular dimensions of the distorted figure will be four times
less than those of the regular figure, and we shall ascertain
without difficulty that the distorted figure may likewise be re
peated four times; also the drawing of the figure 2 will pro
duce identically the same regular figure, whether it be em
W: with the system Va=3 and Vn=4, or with the system
Va=5 and V, =4, provided that, in the second, the disc which
bears it be reversed. For the second system, however, it will

be necessary, as it is easy to convince oneself, to substitute for
the black disc pierced with three slits another black disc
pierced with five slits.
   Designating again by V"d and V", the velocities of the two
discs relative to the partial case which we have just examined,
we shall have evidently, for the general relation between two
equivalent systems, one of which would belong to this same
case, and the other to the case in which, the velocities being
always in the same direction, that of the transparent disc would
be less than that of the black disc,

which gives
                        Vl,        V

   In the system to which the term w: of this expression is re
                                          72
ferred, V, must, we know, exceed Va only by one unit; we
may then in the place of Wa substitute V, -1, and the above
expression may then be stated under the form
                               V"a   W,+ 1

whence it is seen that, in the supposed relation Vl,   # reduced
to its simplest expression, V", will be equal to V, and V's will
be a unit greater.
   There now remains the third partial case, namely Va=2V.
This is of an entirely peculiar nature, and seems to me very
remarkable. The absolute value of M is then, in fact, equal
to unity; so that the angular dimensions of the distorted figure
are equal to those of the regular figure, or, in other words,
the deformation consists only in a reversing of this last figure.
Reciprocally, then, if upon the transparent disc is drawn
any regular figure, the instrument will reproduce this same
figure, but reversed; that is to say, having on the left what
on the disc is to the right, and vice versá,       If, for example,
upon the transparent disc there be drawn a head viewed in
profile and looking to the right, the instrument will reproduce
identically this same head, but turned so as to look to the left.
In short, if the drawing traced upon the transparent disc be
such that its right half is symmetrical to its left half, if, for
example, this drawing represents a head seen in front and
illumined in front, or a word formed of letters placed symme
trically, and which do not change by reversing, such as the

452       On the Permanence of Impressions on the Retina.
Latin word TOT, or again a number composed of figures
under the same conditions, such as the number 808, the in
strument will reproduce each of these figures with a complete
identity, and we shall thus have a new and very curious means
of making an object in rapid motion appear to be unmoved.
   It is clear that with this system the number of the slits can
only be two; for when the first point of the figure, starting
from its coincidence with a slit, shall have accomplished a re
volution, the slit will have performed a half-revolution, so
that, for a second coincidence then to take place, the succeed
ing slit must be situated opposite to the first.
   In order to ascertain whether this system is also the equi
valent of another, either of a contrary or of the same direction,
let us make, in the formulae (8.) and (9.), V", =2V', ; the two
                Vd
will then give V, =0, and consequently Va=0. This other
system would then be that in which the black disc would turn
in any direction before an immoveable transparent disc upon
which should be traced a regular figure. Then, in fact, it is
clear that we should see simply this figure such as it is. In
this case the black disc might evidently have any velocity,
supposing it, however, sufficient to cause a continued impres
sion, and the number of the slits might also be any whatever.
   Thus for the whole system of velocities, either of opposite
directions or of the same direction, there exists a different
system, which, with the same transparent discs previously in
verted, produces identically the same regular figures, and
which, with these discs not inverted, shows, on the contrary,
the regular figures inverted.
   We have all along supposed that, as in the published anor
thoscope, the axes of the two discs were the one a prolonga
tion of the other, and that the slits pierced in the black disc
were rectilinear and directed according to the radii of this
disc. In these hypotheses we have exhausted all the combi
nations possible; but we might contrive so that the two axes
should be placed at a certain distance from one another, in
such a way that the centres of the two movements should no
longer be superposed with relation to the eye, and we might
moreover give to the slits other directions or other forms.
The distorted figures would then probably be much more un
decipherable still; but their construction would also become
much more complicated.

     LVIII. On the Phantascope. By Prof. J. LocKE*.
As     many persons find it difficult, if not impossible, to con
       verge the optical axes (or in common phrase to look
“cross-eyed ”) for the purpose of making the experiments
lately described by met under the head of “binocular vision,”
I have invented an instrument which enables all persons to
succeed in obtaining the chief results. It is very simple,

having neither lenses, prisms nor reflectors, the object being
in general the same as holding the finger or other object near
the eyes and concentrating the attention upon it for the pur
pose of optical convergence.
    It consists of a flat base-board about nine by eleven inches,
with an upright rod at one end bearing two sliding sockets to
be clamped at any elevation like those of a retort stand, or
adjustible by stiff sliding springs. The upper socket supports
horizontally a small vane or card, having a slit or sight-hole
one-fourth of an inch wide and three inches long from right
to left. This slit has its middle directly over the centre of
the base-board, and is intended to have the eyes directly over
it, one eye at one end and the other at the other; two small
holes, say one-fourth of an inch, occupying the place of the
ends of this slit would answer, except for the unequal distances
between the eyes of different observers. The lower of the
two sockets bears horizontally a moveable screen of paste
board or thin wood, having a slit at least three inches wide
from left to right, and about one inch in the other direction,
with its centre also perpendicular over the centre of the base
board. This screen has marked vertically across its middle
an index, shown by two arrows in the figures marked I.
   Experiments.—In experimenting with the phantascope, the
operator places whatever is to be tried upon the lower tabular
base-board, looks downward through the upper slit and slides
the screen up or down until he attains the adjustment required.
   Exp. 1. Let there be two identical letters, say A, placed
or drawn on the base-board about two and a half inches apart
from left to right, let the moveable screen be nearly down,
and directing the eye, not to the letters, but to the index, draw
the sliding-screen bearing the index gradually upward; the
two letters seen indirectly will appear as four, or each letter
will be double AA           AA; continuing to raise the screen
and to regard the index, the double images will recede more
and more until their position will be thus:
                     A         A  A        A;
continuing still to raise the screen, the two internal images
approach until they are optically superimposed and coalesce
into one, thus:                   A        A
   This middle or superimposed figure is the phantom or
image where there is really no object. Cease to look at the
index I, and turn the attention to the base-board itself, and
this phantom figure instantly vanishes. If the two letters be
placed on the base-board at the same distance as the eyes are
apart, say two and a half inches, then this normal position of
the screen will be just half-way between the eyes and the base
board. If they are placed further apart, the screen must be
raised higher; the distance from the eyes to the index-screen

                Prof. Locke on the Phantascope.              455
being in all cases, to the distance from that screen to the base
board, as the distance between the eyes is to the distance be
tween the objects viewed. In the case above, the phantom
image is formed exactly as if there were a letter in the area
of the index-screen of half the size of the primitive letters on
the base-board, and optically the letter should appear then;
but the knowledge of the observer that there is nothing at that
place will often prevent the deception.
   Exp. 2. Lay upon the base-board a card having letters or
other figures which are identical in size and form, set in re
gular rows and at equal distances all over, thus:
                     A    A   A    A   A.  A
                     A   A    A   A    A   A
                     A    A   A    A   A   A
and proceed to raise the screen as before; you will form phan
tom images as before between each of these figures, or possibly
you will superimpose the first object upon the third, when you
will have, not a single phantom, but a whole plane of them,
each pair presenting a phantom between. This phantom
surface will be likely to effect a complete deception, and will
rise from the base-board and coincide with the index plane,
when it may be contemplated with the same deliberation and
ease to the eyes as if it were a real object. This would be
sure to be the case if the index plane were figured over in the
same manner, but with figures properly reduced in size.
    Exp. 3. Place two identical pictures of the same flower on
the base-board, say they are an inch in diameter, and two
and a half inches apart; place also on the edge of the index
area a picture of a small flower-pot or vase, with flower stems
as an index; then form the phantom image as before, and the
 flowers will appear in the vase so long as you contemplate the
 stems at the index-screen; but the moment the eyes are di
 rected to the flowers themselves, the phantom vanishes.
    Exp. 4. Let one of the above flowers be red and the other
 blue; the phantom will be purple. Sometimes, however, it
 will appear nearly red, and then again blue. This and some
 other experiments convince me that the attention of the mind,
 even when we are looking with both eyes, is often directed
 exclusively to the image in one eye; and perhaps after that
 tires, the image in the other is contemplated. If this be true,
 then the two eyes serve in the first place to fix the distance
 of an object by the amount of convergence, and in the next
 place to relieve each other by turns.

456               Prof. Locke on the Phantascope.
   Exp. 5. Let there be a horizontal heavy line placed to the
left and a vertical one to the right on the base-board, thus:
- ||, then adjust the screen and superimpose the images
to form a phantom. That phantom will be a cross, and the
whole will appear thus:           -         +
   Exp. 6. Do the same with any other parts of a figure of
which one shall be the complement of the other; the phantom
will be the complete figure. Thus, take the picture of a person,
cut it out of the paper, and cutting off the head, place the
body on one side of the base-board and the head upon the
other; the converged phantom will be the complete figure,
the head coming in from one side and the body from the other.
It is perhaps unnecessary to say, that each part must be
placed in its true elevation, though displaced horizontally. It
was in repeating this experiment that I discovered that my
eyes did not appear to be mates; for I saw the body clearly,
but the head obscurely. After a little time, however, these
conditions interchanged, and I saw the head clearly and the
body obscurely. Nor did I seem to have any voluntary con
trol over these conditions, but my eyes continued to relieve
guard according to some rule of their own. This is rather an
amusing experiment. The figure being beheaded, the phan
tom ghost appears between the two parts of the body; and
from a little unsteadiness of the optical convergence, the
ghost’s head is inclined to attitudinize, and will sometimes
start off a little from the body, and in returning will go a little
too far, and will break the neck in the opposite direction. If
the head of the experimeter be a little inclined, then the head
of the phantom will come on too high or too low.
   Exp. 7. I placed a card, having two perpendicular parallel
lines, about two inches in length and three inches apart. On
converging them in an attempt at superposition, I found the
converged lines were not parallel, but came in contact at the
upper end first, and diverged a little downward. Standing
with my head erect, I repeated this experiment by converging
voluntarily, and without the aid of any index, the parallel
sides of a window; the same want of parallelism was exhibited;
but on throwing my head backward and looking horizontally
over my cheeks, the converged perpendiculars coincided
throughout. I learned by this that both of my eyes do not
rotate in one and the same horizontal plane. I got another
person to repeat the same experiment; and he found the error
of his eyes to be in the opposite direction, the converged per
pendiculars meeting first at the bottoms. This proves a moral
":     to be physically true, “we don’t all see alike.”
   This instrument, and the researches into binocular vision,

    Capt. Lefroy on Observations of the Aurora Borealis.      457
serve to extend considerably our knowledge of the anatomy
and physiology of vision, nor is the subject by any means ex
hausted. I have not time to investigate the matter fully, and
shall be happy to see fair and honourable competitors enter
the field. The verifications and variations of the experiments
by Dr. Lathrop were gratifying to me.
   This apparatus will illustrate many important points in
optics, and especially the physiological point of “single vision
by two eyes.” It shows also that we do not see an object in
itself; but the mind contemplates an image on the retina, and
always associates an object of such a figure, attitude, distance
and colour, as will produce that image by rectilinear pencils
of light. If this image on the retina can be produced without
the object, as in the phantascope, then there is a perfect optical
illusion, and an object is seen where it is not. Nay, more,
the mind does not contemplate a mere luminous image, but
that image produces an unknown physiological impression on
the brain. It follows, that if the nerves can, by disease or by
the force of imagination, take on this action, a palpable im
pression is made without either object or picture. As this
would be most likely to occur when actual objects are excluded,
as in the night, we have an explanation of the scenery of
dreams, and the occasional “apparitions” to waking persons.
The murderer, too, has a picture stamped on the sensorium
by the sight of his victim, which ever wakes into vibration
when actual pictures are excluded by darkness.
LIX. Preliminary Report on the Observations of the Aurora
   Borealis, made by the Non-commissioned Qfficers of the Royal
   Artillery, at the various Guard-rooms in Canada. By
   Captain LEFRoy, R.A., F.R.S.
      MY DEAR SIR,                       Woolwich, May 18, 1850.
IF you think the accompanying Report will          be interesting
      to the readers of the Philosophical Magazine, it is much
at your service.

   The system of observations on the aurora borealis, per
mitted by Colonel Dynely, C.B., at my request, to be made
at all our regimental guard-rooms, under the sanction of the
officers in command, has now been continued for two years
in Canada, and for one year in Nova Scotia and Newfound

458          Captain Lefroy's Preliminary Report on
land. I have therefore pleasure in communicating to the
officers and non-commissioned officers who have interested
themselves in the subject, a short account of what has been
done, for the sake of the encouragement which the results
afford for persevering in the undertaking.
   The printed instructions, dated 11th October 1848, ex
pressed in a few words the objects in view in keeping these
registers. They were—1. To ensure the observation of every
aurora which should be visible in Canada, so as to afford a
better criterion of the actual frequency of the phaenomenon
than can be given by observations at any one station. 2. To
supply the means of judging how far variations of the mag
netical elements, shown by the instruments at Toronto during
cloudy weather, might be connected with aurora visible else
where. 3. To furnish data for computing the height or di
stance of the luminous region from the earth. 4. Lastly, to
throw some light on the question whether or no the same
aurora is not sometimes seen under considerably different
forms by observers stationed not very far asunder.
   It is not worth while to enter into some of these inquiries
until all the materials for comparison are accessible, including
the observations made in the United States under the instruc
tions of the Smithsonian Institution, and those published in
the Regent's reports. I shall confine myself, therefore, at
present principally to the first of them.
   In the year 1848, aurora, or auroral light, was observed at
Toronto on 69 nights, although for the last six months of the
year no observation was made after midnight. This number
is exclusive of five observations of a luminous appearance in
the clouds, referred to aurora, but not perfectly determined.
Observations are to be found at other of our stations on many
of the same, and on 57 other nights, exclusive of one doubtful
one; making a total of 126 decided, and 6 doubtful appear
ances in Canada". There are about 46 nights in the year
on which it was clouded at all the stations; if we omit these,
the proportion is 10 observations to every 26 nights on which
observation is not wholly precluded by the state of the sky,
or 39 per cent.
    This proportion is greater than that given by any one sta
tion taken singly. W. have—
   At Quebec, in 1848, 52 obs, to 188 practicable nights-28 per cent.
   At Montreal,        41   ...   201          -         20    ...
   At Kingston,        64   ...   218          -         29
   At Toronto,         69   ...   207          -         33    ...
   At London, C.W.,    33   ...   178          -         19    ...

                 Observations of the Aurora Borealis.                      4.59
It is, however, probably less than the truth, as far as it ex
presses the actual frequency of the phaenomenon, as I have
considered observation to have been possible whenever nothing
to the contrary is stated, which is most likely more than the
facts would warrant; moreover, when we consider the short
duration of some of the displays, and how close to the horizon
others of them occur, it is difficult to believe that we have
noted every one, even on nights when the sky was clear; it is
probably set down as clear in many instances when it was
sufficiently clouded near the northern horizon to prevent a
feeble display from appearing. The dates included in the list
at which it was seen at all the stations, which extend along a
line of 500 miles, are Jan. 11, 16; Feb. 21, 23, 24; March 16,
24; April 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 29; Aug. 21; Nov. 16. On several
other occasions it was seen at every station at which the state
of the sky permitted it; but there are one or two instances of
clear sky at stations not recording aurora which was seen
elsewhere.
   Aurora, or auroral light, was observed at Toronto in 1849
on 63 nights, exclusive of 5 entries of an uncertain character,
the observations terminating at midnight throughout the year.
The other stations, including Newfoundland and Halifax, add
70 more, exclusive of 2 doubtful ones; making a total of 133
certain, and 6 uncertain appearances, in Canada, Nova Scotia,
and Newfoundland *. The area included this year, measured
from London, C.W., to Newfoundland, extends about 1150
miles from east to west; and measured from Quebec to Ha
lifax about 140 miles from north to south.                        Owing to this
great extent, there are but few nights (24) clouded at all the
stations; and omitting these, the proportion is 39 per cent,
or exactly the same as before. We have at—

remainder being made up from the other commands.
    These observations having been continued throughout the
night, may be referred to for testing an apparent law which
was noticed in the observations made by Serjeant Henry and
myself at Lake Athabasca in the winter of 1843–44, and which
is fully confirmed by the series at Toronto, namely, that the
aurora borealis does not appear with equal frequency at all
the hours of darkness, but is subject, like most other phaeno
mena in meteorology, to influences having a diurnal period as
well as an annual one. The present series places the hour of
maximum frequency at 10 or 11 P.M.; probably a longer con
tinuance will be necessary to fix it accurately.

          Any observation before 6 P.M. is here set down at 5, and so on.
    The aurora appears in Canada in every month of the year.
The greatest number of observations is in April; and there is
a very marked excess in February, March, and April of each
year over any other period. Taking them by the seasons,
there are in the—

              Observations of the Aurora Borealis.            461
   I believe that this number of observations is greater than
has ever before been made in so low a latitude, and am in
clined to think that it is very high even for Canada. The
greatest number of observations at Toronto in any previous
year since 1840 was 37 in 1846, the average of the ten years
being 35. The greatest number in any one year (from 1837
to 1848) collected in the Regent's reports is 75, the average
50. The greatest number observed by M. Hansteen at
Christiania, in Norway, lat. 60° from 1837 to 1846, in any one
year, is 52—the average 33. This result is not more than
may have been expected from the great advantages afforded
by the duties of non-commissioned officers on guard for ob
servations of the kind, and from our comparative proximity
in geographical position to the magnetic pole, with which, in
some way not at present well understood, the phaenomenon
appears to be connected. But it is highly satisfactory to find
that the pains taken have been so successful. For the next
twelve months’ observations will be continued at Toronto
throughout the night, and the observatory will be provided
with a number of self-registering instruments, recording every
change of the magnetic elements mechanically. Hence it will
be of great consequence not to lose the key which auroral
displays at a distance may possibly afford to those movements
in a single instance.        -
   At some of the stations the non-commissioned officers have
got out of the habit of attempting to describe what they see.
This is to be regretted. Measurements with the wooden
quadrant, or careful estimations of the heights and azimuths
of arches, are frequently wanting, and the time is not always
stated. This remark applies particularly to the termination
of the displays, which are frequently said in general terms to
have lasted until daybreak; in all such cases the observer
should state, as nearly as he can, the latest moment at which
he was sure of seeing the light, watch its extinction attentively,
and endeavour to decide for himself whether that is the con
sequence of the increase of daylight, or of the actual termina
tion of the phaenomenon. Very early appearances should, for
similar reasons, be particularly described; for instance, it is
recorded to have been seen at London, C.W., on the 24th of
July 1848, at half-past 7 P.M., which is but a few minutes
after sunset. Such a rare observation should have every pos
sible confirmation. These particulars might at least be noted
with very little trouble at the hours of going rounds. I
should be glad also to see a more explicit statement every
morning of what the character of the night has been, as re
gards the possibility of observing aurora, so as to give some

462            Captain Lefroy's Preliminary Report on
precision to the rough calculation attempted above of the per
centage of nights in which it is seen, to nights in which it
could be seen if it occurred. The expression “fine night” is
ambiguous. In any statement of this kind, the point to be
chiefly referred to is the condition of the northern half of the
sky—the rest is of little consequence. I should be obliged
by a memorandum on the next register of the nature of the
look-out at each station, and how nearly down to the horizon
the view from N.E. to N.W. extends; some difference in this
respect is perhaps the reason why the observations are more
numerous at some stations than at others.

 a valuable body of information respecting the aurora, and will
 have a very important bearing on the observations to which
 the establishment at Toronto is devoted.               While, therefore,

            Instructions of Observations of the Aurora*.
     Non-commissioned officers on guard have an opportunity
of observing at every second hour whether any aurora is
visible; and by encouraging the more intelligent of the men,
when their posts are favourably situated for the purpose, to
notice and to report any display of short duration which may

             Observations of the Aurora Borealis.            465
occur in the intervals, will be able to state every morning
whether aurora has been seen at all during the night, and if
not, whether the state of the sky was favourable or otherwise
to observation. Private observers should make a regular
practice of looking for auroras, every clear evening, from dusk
to as late an hour as may be convenient, recording the result
whether there has been an aurora or not, together with the
times of observation. The notes may be short, but they
should be clear and precise. Wet or cloudy evenings should
be noted.
   Auroral phaenomena may be divided into the following
classes:—
   1. A faint light in the north, without definite form or
boundary.
   2. “A diffused light, defined by an arch below.”
   3. Arches resembling the rainbow in size and form, but of
a uniform white colour, sometimes retaining their apparent
position for a considerable time without change.
   4. “A dark segment under the arch;” if any star can be
distinguished within this space, the circumstance should be
particularly noted.
   5. “Floating patches of luminous haze or cloud.”
   6. Beams, rays, streamers, transverse and serpentine bands,
sometimes tinged with colour, and undergoing more or less
rapid changes. It may be necessary to define the last two
expressions. Transverse bands are frequently nothing more
than arches which have advanced nearly to the zenith, or
perhaps have passed it, and retain their regularity of form,
although now projected nearly as straight lines. Serpentine
bands rather resemble curtains of light, and undergo in their
outline changes like those of the folds of a curtain. They
are usually the most brilliant part of a display.
   7. “Auroral corona, or a union of beams a few degrees to
the south of the zenith.”
   8. “A sudden appearance of dark clouds” in the region
recently occupied by the aurora.
   9. “Sudden appearance of haze over the whole face of the
sky.”
  'o. Lastly, a disposition in light clouds at a great elevation
to arrange themselves   '      daylight in parallel lines, cross
ing the meridian at right angles, has been frequently suspected
to be connected with the aurora, or with a common source.
   The observer should state in plain and definite language
the general character of the aurora, with reference more par
ticularly to the foregoing characteristics. At Canadian sta
tions every observation of the azimuths of the extremites of

an arch, when they are well defined, its span along the hori
zon, its height above it, or its place among the stars, will be
valuable for comparison. At all stations the time at which
the light passes to the south of the zenith should if possible
be stated, as well as the precise times of very brilliant or
active displays, which frequently last but a few minutes.
Lastly, it should be noted how much beyond the zenith, to
the south, the bands of light descend. The degree of bril
liancy may be denoted by the terms—faint, moderate, bright,
very bright.

Jan. 10,      XPERIMENTS and Observations upon the Properties
 1850.         of Light.” By Lord Brougham, F.R.S. &c.
   The author states that the optical inquiries of which he here
gives an account were conducted in the first instance under the most
favourable circumstances, arising from the climate of Provence,
where they were commenced, being peculiarly adapted to such
studies: he further states that he subsequently had the great benefit
of a most excellent set of instruments made by M. Soleil of Paris;
remarking, however, that this delicate apparatus is only required
for experiments of a kind to depend upon nice measurements, and
that all the principles which he has to note in this paper as the
result of his experiments can be made with the most simple appa
ratus and without any difficulty or expense. His statement of the
results of his experiments is thrown into the form of definitions
and propositions, for the purpose of making it shorter and more
distinct, and of subjecting his doctrines to a fuller scrutiny. He
premises that he purposely avoids all arguments and suggestions
upon the two rival theories, the Newtonian or Atomic, and the Un
dulatory.
   The following are the author's Definitions and Propositions.
                              DEFINITIONs.
   1. Flexion is the bending of the rays of light out of their course
     in passing near bodies.
   2. Flexion is of two kinds—inflexion, or the bending towards the
      body; deflexion, or the bending from the body.
   3. Flexibility, deflexibility, inflexibility express the disposition of
     the homogeneous or colour-making rays to be bent, deflected,
     inflected by bodies near which they pass.
                             PROPosITION I.
   The flexion of any pencil or beam, whether of white or of homo
geneous light, is in some constant proportion to the breadth of the

                              Royal Society.                         467
coloured fringes formed by the rays after passing by the bending
body. Those fringes are not three, but a very great number, con
tinually decreasing as they recede from the bending body, in de
flexion, where only one bending body is acting; and they are real
images of the luminous body by whose light they are formed.
                             PROPOSITION II.
   The rays of light when inflected by bodies near which they pass
are thrown into a condition or state which disposes them to be on
one side more easily deflected than they were before the first flexion;
and disposes them on the other side to be less easily deflected: and
when deflected by bodies they are thrown into a condition or state
which disposes them to be more easily inflected, and on the other
side to be less easily inflected than they were before the first flexion.
                            PRoPosLTION III.
   The disposition communicated to the rays by the flexion is alter
native; and after inflexion they cannot be again inflected on either
side; nor after deflexion can they be deflected. But they may be
deflected after inflexion, and inflected after deflexion, by acting on
the sides disposed, and not by acting upon the sides polarized.
                            PROPOSITION IV.
   The disposition impressed upon the rays, whether to be easily de
flected or easily inflected, is strongest nearest the first bending body,
and decreases as the distance increases.
                             PROPos ITION V.
   The fringes made by the second body acting upon the rays de
flected by the first, must, according to the calculus applied to the
case, be broader than those made by the second body deflecting those
rays inflected by the first.
                            PROPOSITION VI.
   When one body only acts upon the rays, it must,by deflexion, form
them into fringes or images decreasing as the distance from the
bending body increases. But when the rays deflected and disposed
by one body are afterwards inflected by a second body, the fringes
will increase as they recede from the direct rays. Also when the
fringes made by the inflexion of one body, and which increase with
the distance from the direct rays, are deflected by a second body,
the effect of the disposition and of the distances is such as to correct
the effect of the first flexion, and the fringes by deflexion of the
second body are made to decrease as they recede from the direct
rays.
                            PROPOSITION VII.
   It is proved by experiment that the inflexion of the second body
makes broader fringes or images than its deflexion, after the de
flexion and inflexion of the first body respectively; and also that

468                         Royal Society.
the deflexion fringes decrease, and the inflexion fringes increase with
the distance from the direct rays.
                          PRoPosition VIII.
   The joint action of two bodies situated similarly with respect to
the rays which pass between them so near as to be affected by both
bodies, must, whatever be the law of their action, provided it be in
versely as some power of the distance, produce fringes or images
which increase with the distance from the direct rays.
                           PROPosITION IX.
   It is proved by experiment that the fringes or images increase as
the distance increases from the direct rays.
   These propositions are illustrated by particular instances, and their
truth is shown by experiments and by some mathematical investiga
tions. The author concludes his paper by a few observations tending
further to illustrate and confirm the foregoing propositions, and for
the purpose of removing one or two difficulties which had occurred
to others until they were met by facts, and also of showing the
tendency of the results at which he had arrived.
   2. “Electro-Physiological Researches.”—7th Series. By Signor
C. Matteucci. Communicated by W. R. Grove, Esq., F.R.S.
   In this memoir, Prof. Matteucci, after recapitulating the results of
his previous researches on electro-physiology, published in the Philo
sophical Transactions, proceeds to the relation of new experiments.
He first shows that nervous filaments made to conduct an electric
current in a liquid are not capable, like metallic wires, of acting as
electroids, and giving rise to electro-chemical decomposition. The
solution employed was that of iodide of potassium; the nerves, two
large ones taken from a living animal, each of which was separately
attached to the metallic extremities of a pile of fifteen couples. No
trace of decomposition followed; and he concludes from hence, that
the conductibility of nervous matter is due to the liquid part of the
matter itself.
   He then gives further experiments on the relative conductibility
of muscles and nerves, with a view to ascertain whether, when a
current was impelled through a mass of muscle, any part of the cur
rent might have passed through the nervous filaments spread through
that muscle.    For this purpose he inserted the nerve of a galvano
scopic frog into a hole made in a piece of dead muscle, through which
he then passed a very powerful current: no contraction followed
in the galvanoscopic frog.    When muscles still retaining their irri
tability were substituted for the dead muscle, induced contractions
occurred in the galvanoscopic frog during the passage of the current.
He concludes that when the poles of a pile of twenty-five or thirty
elements are applied to the surface of the muscles of a living animal,
the phenomena produced by the passage of the current must depend
either on the direct action of the current on the muscular fibre, or
on the indirect action or influence of the electric current transmitted

by the muscular fibre to its own nervous filaments, or rather to the
nervous force existing in those filaments.
   Referring then to an experiment related in a preceding paper, in
which the lower limbs of a frog, united to the spine only by the
lumbar nerves, are placed astride two glasses containing water, with
each foot immersed, and in which a current, after traversing the two
limbs, and consequently the two nerves, in opposite directions, so
modifies at length the excitability of the nerves, that, on opening the
circuit, only the limb in which the current has been passing inversely
contracts, he shows that if in this state what may be called the ‘in
verse nerve be touched by a piece of muscle, although the circuit is
continued, yet the limb contracts as though the circuit had been
broken. In fact, the muscle, by its greater conductibility, becomes
traversed by the current in place of the nerve. Again, if after the
former part of the experiment has been performed, the portions of
nerve which had hitherto been buried among the crural muscles be
dissected out, it is easily seen that their excitability has not been af
fected like that of the lumbar nerves, because the current in place
of traversing them has traversed only the crural muscles. The nerve
has had its excitability modified in only that part of its course in
which, being laid bare and isolated, it has necessarily conducted the
current.
   M. DuBois Reymond (Comptes Rendus) has related an experiment
seeming to lead to the inference that section of the spinal marrow
increases the excitability of the lumbar nerves, at least during a
certain period of time. In order to test the accuracy of this con
clusion on so important a point, M. Matteucci institutes a number
of very accurate experiments, in which he measures the excitability
of the lumbar nerves after section of the spinal marrow, by means
 of the apparatus of Breguet, used and described by him in a former
paper. His first results show that “the contraction excited in the
muscles of a frog, of which the spinal marrow has been divided from
 twelve to eighteen hours, is stronger than that obtained under the
same circumstances from the muscles of a frog just killed, without
 having been previously subjected to any injury to its nervous system.”
 But subsequent experiments have satisfied him that this result de
 pends not on the separation from the spinal marrow, but rather on
 the repose in which the muscle has been permitted to remain; for
 without division of the marrow, nearly the same force of contraction
 existed after the same interval of time.      He finds indeed that the
 only alteration which the excitability of a nerve undergoes by sepa
 ration from the nervous centres, consists in its being more readily
 exhausted under the action of stimulants, the longer the period that
 has elapsed since its detachment.
    The author then proceeds to relate the nature of the strict analogy
 existing between electricity and nervous force. As electricity is de
 veloped under the influence of the nervous current in the organs of
 electrical fishes, so, as a converse of this phenomenon, electricity
 may develope the nervous force. After adverting to the well-known
 analogy subsisting in every particular between the phenomena of
 the electrical organ and those of muscles, he adverts to the old ex
 periment of passing a current through the muscles of the thighs of

470                 Royal Astronomical Society.
a living animal, the positive pole being placed now above, now below,
so that it may be supposed that the current passes in the two cases
in opposite directions as regards the nervous filaments distributed in
the muscles. He then points out that the effects of a current
directed downwards, in the direct course of the nerves, are a strong
contraction of the muscle traversed, and also of the muscles of the
leg below; while the effect of a current in the opposite, or inverse
direction, is pain, together with contractions less violent and always
confined to the muscles traversed. The contractions (especially of
the parts below) indicate a current of nervous force propagated to
wards the muscles, while the pain indicates a current towards the
nervous centre. Now, bearing in mind that it has been proved by
direct experiments that an electric current traversing a muscle never
quits the muscular fibre to enter the nervous filaments, it seems clear
that the phenomena just spoken of are exclusively owing to the in
fluence exerted by the electricity passing through the muscles on
the nervous force contained in the nerves; and also that this nervous
force acts peripherad or centrad according to the direction of the
electric current which excites it. The great importance of the con
clusions drawn from these experiments consists in this, that they lead
to the same law which establishes the analogy between nervous force
and the electrical discharge of fishes. The paper concludes with
some further considerations intended to confirm this law.

   Jan. 11, 1850.—On the Past History of the Comet of Halley. By
Mr. J. R. Hind.
   It is well known that the periodicity of the remarkable comet
which bears the name of Halley was inferred by that astronomer
from a comparison of three sets of elements, calculated on observa
tions of the comets of 1531, 1607 and 1682.        When his table of
cometary orbits was first published, Dr. Halley says he was content
to hint at his conjectures respecting the identity of the comets of
those years as having some degree of probability, and to advise pos
terity carefully to watch for its return about the year 1758. At a
subsequent period, an examination of the catalogues of ancient
comets showed that three others had preceded those already men
tioned, “manifestly in the same order and at like intervals of time,
viz. in the year 1305 about Easter; in the year 1380, the month
unknown; and, lastly, in the month of June 1456;” and on making
this discovery Dr. Halley says he became much more confirmed in
his former opinion. Want of data, however, prevented his ascer
taining beyond doubt that the comet of 1682 had appeared in any of
the three years 1305, 1380 or 1456, and he had little or nothing
but equality of intervals, on which to found his belief.
   M. Pingré, after collecting together the immense mass of records
from which his great work the Cometographie is constructed, was
enabled to convert into a certainty Halley's supposition respecting
the appearance of his comet in 1456, Two definite observations of

                   Royal Astronomical Society.                    471
the position were found, the one at Vienna, mentioned in an Austrian
chronicle by Ebendorffer, the other at Rome, preserved in a manu
script treatise on the comet of 1468, to which Pingré had access in
the Bibliothèque du Roi at Paris. The comet was in perihelion on
the 8th of June at 22", Julian style.
   The preceding appearance was referred by Halley to 1380, but
M. Laugier has shown that it took place in the autumn of 1378,
under nearly the same circumstances as in 1835.          The Chinese
observations fix the time of passage through perihelion on November
8" 18". (Conn. des Temps, 1846.)
   In a paper on the history of the comet of Halley, published in
the Comptes Rendus for 1846, July 27, M. Laugier has recognised
this body in 760 and 451. The elements calculated by Burckhardt
for the comet observed by the Chinese in 989 approached so close
to that of Halley's comet, that some suspicion of their identity has
been entertained. But I believe, with these exceptions, the returns
which I am about to mention as either certain or probable have not
been previously noticed. The valuable details existing in the annals
of China, and but recently known in Europe, enable us to trace
this famous comet with a high degree of probability to the year 11
before the Christian aera,—a most important circumstance, not only
as regards the history of this particular comet, but as bearing on
the constitution of these bodies in general. I shall merely state
here the results to which I have been led by a close examination of
the Cometographies and Chinese records, without extending this
notice to an inconvenient length by the insertion of details. The
data which I have had to work upon are found in the Cometo
graphies of Pingré, Hevelius and Lubienietski, Ma-tuoan-lin's cata
logue of comets and extraordinary stars, and the other Chinese
authorities with which we are acquainted through the labours of
M. Edouard Biot.
   The comet of Halley having returned to its perihelion in 1378,
we may expect to find some mention of it about the year 1301; and
notwithstanding the anomalous character of the results obtained by
MM. Burckhardt and Laugier for the first comet of that year, I
am pretty well convinced it was no other than the comet of Halley.
The Chinese account, which is tolerably definite, is exceedingly well
represented by the elements of that body: assuming the perihelion
passage to have occurred on October 22d 16" Greenwich time, the
comet passed through Gemini, south of Ursa Major, and finally
traversed Serpens and Ophiuchus, being lost in the twilight at the
end of October or beginning of November. There is one European
account, however, which is not so easily reconciled with this sup
position. It is that of Friar Giles, whose description has led
M. Laugier to an orbit differing considerably in the position of the
line of nodes from that of Halley's comet. Now had this Friar
Giles established for himself a reputation as an exact and con
sistent recorder of facts, we might justly entertain serious doubts as
to the identity of the comet of 1301 with Halley's; but in his
account of another comet (that of 1264) he contradicts himself so

  472                 Royal Astronomical Society.
 manifestly in the same paragraph, that we may fairly question his
 ability to describe accurately what he saw. Even in the case before
 us there is some confusion, and M. Laugier has been obliged to
 admit an alteration, which produces a contradiction in Giles's ac
 count, in order to reconcile the main part of his description with the
 Chinese observations.
    The question stands thus: Halley's comet should have appeared
 in all probability about 1301. We find in that year mention of a
 comet, whose apparent path, according to the Chinese historians, is
 well represented by the elements of Halley's comet: the only ob
 jection to the identity that can be advanced rests on an observation
 of latitude by an European astronomer, or rather astrologer, whose
 description of another comet has been shown to contain a manifest
 contradiction, and who in the very case before us has committed
 one pretty decided error. I am strongly inclined to recognise in
 the first comet of 1301 Halley's famous star.
    It will readily be understood that I have not the slightest in
 tention to undervalue M. Laugier's investigation on this comet:
 there can be no doubt, that if we admit the whole narration of Friar
 Giles, his orbit must be retained, and in that case we must conclude
 that the comet of Halley passed its perihelion about the year 1301
 unobserved, or at least unrecorded.
   The preceding return of the comet took place, I think, in 1223,
in the month of July, shortly before the death of Philip Augustus,
 as French historians state. It was seen for eight days at the be
 ginning of July in the evening twilight. The Chinese have no
 mention of this comet, and it unfortunately happens that European
 chronicles give very vague accounts of it, so that we cannot come
to any definite conclusion respecting its identity with Halley's.
All that can be said is, that the few particulars we possess agree
perfectly well with the position of Halley's comet in the heavens
when the perihelion occurs in July, and that the comets of the pre
ceding and following year, observed in China, appear to have had
very different elements. It is therefore most likely that our comet
was in perihelion in July 1223.
   In 1145 the return of the comet of Halley seems to me little less
than a matter of certainty.    On carrying back the elements to that
epoch, and fixing the perihelion passage on April 19, the whole of
the particulars left us by the European and Chinese authors are
exactly represented. Its discovery in the morning twilight about
April 15, its increasing brilliancy towards the end of the month, the
disappearance about the first week in May, and rediscovery in the
evening sky in the north-west on May 14, and gradual fading away
in Hydra on the 9th of June, are fully explained, the positions
agreeing perfectly.
   The periods of revolution between 1145 and 1456 average 77}
years, and if we reckon backwards a like interval from 1145 we ar
rive at the year 1067, about which epoch we may expect to recog
nise the comet again.
   There is vague mention in several European chronicles of the ap

                    Royal Astronomical Society.                               473
pearance of a comet at the time of the death of Constantine Ducas,
in May 1067. We have no particulars, and even the reality of the
comet is subject to some doubt. In 1066, a year memorable in
English history as that of the Norman Conquest, a very grand and
remarkable comet is recorded by nearly every chronicler and historian
of the age. It was observed throughout Europe and China during
the months of April and May. The elements of Halley's comet, as
they at present exist, will hardly represent these circumstances with
a sufficient degree of accuracy; but if we assume the following
numbers, we shall have a very fair agreement between observation
and calculation:—
Perihelion passage 1066, April 1* 0", Greenwich time, Julian style.
           Longitude of perihelion ............ 264. 55
           Ascending node . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .      ... 25 50
           Inclination . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 17 0
           Least distance . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   0 72
                           Motion retrograde.
   In this orbit the longitude of perihelion is further in advance than
that of the present orbit of Halley's comet by 30°, and the node by 17°:
the perihelion distance is greater by 0-14. But are these differences
to be considered beyond the limits of probability? In the lapse of
so many centuries, may not the planetary perturbations have pro
duced alterations in the elements at least equivalent to those here
exhibited, especially since there is good reason to conclude that the
plane of the orbit of Halley's comet formerly coincided much more
closely with the plane of the ecliptic than at present, the comet
being therefore subject to far larger perturbations than it has under
gone in more recent times?
    The elements which I have assumed for the comet of 1066 have
been obtained partly from the observations in that year, and partly
from the Chinese description of a comet A.D. 141, which also agrees
 with the supposed period of Halley's. The same orbit will represent
the apparent paths in both years; and I would particularly insist on
 this point as one of some importance in the present inquiry. I may
 also remark, that it appears by no means improbable that an orbit
 more closely resembling that of Halley's comet might be made to
 represent the circumstances recorded of the comet of 1066 with
 tolerable accuracy. The descriptions of this object are so confused,
 that a good deal of uncertainty is necessarily attached to any con
 clusion we may deduce from the observations.
    The preceding return of Halley's comet took place, I think, in
 989, and Burckhardt's calculations relative to the comet observed in
 China in that year strongly support this idea.                     The perihelion
 passage would occur about the 12th of September.                       -
    In 912 a comet was seen in China, in the month of May, in Leo,
 near the star marked X on our charts. It was also perceived in
 Europe. The orbit of Halley's comet, with very trifling alterations,
 will agree with the above position about May 13 or 14, if we fix the
 perihelion at the beginning of April.

   The preceding appearance of the comet should fall about 837, in
which year a most splendid comet was observed both in Europe and
China. The elements of this body, calculated by Pingré, exhibit a
general similarity to those of Halley's comet, with the exception of
the node, which is almost diametrically opposite. Now Pingré con
jectured, as he himself states, that the comet passed the ascending,
and not the descending node on the 10th of April, or otherwise it
could hardly be said to move in a north-west direction on the 12th,
as we learn from the Chinese relation. It is clear, from the position
of the tail on the former date, that the head of the comet could not
have been far from the ecliptic; and it appears to me that Pingré's
conclusion is unavoidable, if we take into consideration the whole of
the Chinese description, notwithstanding its laxity as regards the
distances of the comet from the equator, and the singularity of the
circumstance that a comet should have become visible in the very
year when Halley's would probably return to the perihelion, pre
senting in every element except the node a striking resemblance to
the orbit of that interesting body. The comet of 837, which figures
in our catalogues, was therefore in all probability different from
Halley's, though the position and distance in perihelion and direc
tion of motion were the same, and the inclination of the orbit (a
most uncertain element in the present case) not very widely different
for the two bodies.
   The Chinese annals mention another comet in May and June 837,
which was probably that of Halley. It is not unlikely that suc
cessive copyists have altered the original description of the path
amongst the stars, and that the comets observed in Gemini and Virgo
in these months were the same.      For the Chinese accounts of the
apparent tracks of comets present frequent instances of want of
chronological arrangement: thus a date is occasionally mentioned
as the epoch of discovery, and a position corresponding to a subse
quent time immediately follows. If we may interpret the Chinese
description, so as to place the discovery of Halley's comet in Gemini
on April 29, and to refer the positions in Leo and Virgo to that body
at a subsequent date, it will be easy to reconcile the apparent path
with calculation, supposing the perihelion passage to have occurred
early in April.
   If the comet of Gemini and Leo was not that of Halley, probably
this object was missed altogether at this return.
   M. Laugier has shown in the most satisfactory manner that the
observations of the comet of 760 in Europe and China are perfectly
represented by the orbit of Halley's comet, the perihelion falling on
June 11. This year accords with my intervals. The return of the
comet in 760 appears to me little short of a certainty. (Comptes
Rendus, 1846, July 27.)
   In September and October 684 a comet was seen in China in the
western heavens; but no further particulars are given.    If Halley's
comet reached its point of least distance from the sun in October, it
might have been observed in this position in September and the
early part of October.

   The previous return should have taken place about the year 607,
and the Chinese annals have several comets in that year. I find, by
actual computation, that none of them present any decided indications
of identity with the one which forms the subject of these remarks,
and I am therefore inclined to fix its reappearance in the following
year, 608, when a comet is mentioned by Ma-tuoan-lin, though
(most unfortunately) he has omitted to state the days to which his
positions apply. The path attributed to this body, from Auriga,
through the lower part of Ursa Major, into Scorpio, where the comet
vanished, is precisely that which Halley's comet must follow when
the perihelion takes place in October or early in November. This
circumstance, and the close agreement of intervals, appear to render
it highly probable that the Chinese observed the comet of Halley in
608.
   After a careful examination of the particulars related of the comets
of 530 or 531, which Newton and Halley, owing to the want of
precise data, recognised as that of 1680, I find the whole of them
may be explained by the elements of Halley's comet, supposing it to
have been in perihelion early in November. Yet this inference is
necessarily open to considerable doubt, and I am very far from in
 sisting upon it. Of one point I have become pretty well convinced
by my calculations, viz. that the comet of 530 or 531 (for the year
of appearance is doubtful) was not identical with the celebrated one
of 1680. Pingré seems to have suspected this, though he has en
deavoured, by alteration of dates or positions, to show that such
identity may have been possible. Where however we find the
accounts of a comet as they stand in the original authorities recon
cilable with a single orbit, it is surely unfair to alter them in any
way, so as to produce an agreement with some preconceived notions.
   In 451, or at an interval of about 79 years from 530, a comet was
observed in Europe and China.       It appeared about the time of the
battle of Chalons, when Attila was defeated by the Roman General
Aetius. On May 17 the Chinese saw it near the Pleiades, and fol
lowed it till July 13, when it was situate near 3 Leonis. Assuming
Halley's comet to have arrived in perihelion on July 3 at midnight,
M. Laugier finds a remarkable agreement between the observed and
calculated positions, and there can remain but little doubt that this
body was seen in 451.
    Seventy-eight years previous, or in October 373, 24th day, the
Chinese mention a comet in Ophiuchus and Serpens. Suppose our
comet to have been at its least distance from the sun early in No
vember, we shall find it would be located in Ophiuchus on the 24th
of October. The account is too vague, however, to allow of any
definite conclusion.
   Deducting another period of 78 years, we arrive at the year 295,
and at this epoch I find recorded a comet in Ma-tuoan-lin's cata
logue which has every appearance of identity with Halley's. The
path assigned by this historian is exactly represented by the orbit of
Halley's comet, assumed to be in perihelion at the commencement
of April. I passed through the      #:

 Virgo, having been previously seen with the same right ascension as
 the constellation Andromeda. A comparison of the track in 295
 with the paths followed by the comets in 451, 760 and 1456, will
 sufficiently justify the inference that the observations of the year
 295 really belong to the comet of Halley.
    Another interval of 77 years from this epoch brings us to the year
 218, when this famous body should have visited us again; and it is
 an important fact that the Chinese annals mention a comet in 218,
 which there can scarcely be a doubt was the one in question. It was
 seen also in Europe shortly before the death of the Emperor Opilius
 Macrinus, who was killed on the 7th of June.          Dion Cassius describes
 it as a very fearful star, and the Chinese tell us it was intensely
 brilliant. It passed through Auriga, Gemini, Ursa Major, into Leo,
 but was observed first in the morning in the eastern heavens.           I fix
 the time of perihelion passage of Halley's comet on April 6, and
find every circumstance recorded of the comet of 218 faithfully
represented.
    The preceding return fell, I think, in the year 141, and a fine
comet is referred to that year by the Chinese historians. It was seen
first in Aquarius and Pegasus, in the morning sky, about March 27,
 and about three weeks subsequently became visible in the evening,
 traversing Taurus, Gemini, Leo, &c. The elements of Halley's
 comet, unaltered, do not quite agree with this track and the dates
 attributed to the various positions; but if we suppose the following
 orbit, depending on the observations of 1066 and 141 (as already
mentioned), we shall have a very fair agreement:—
                         Perihelion, March 29' 1.

                            Motion retrograde.
    These elements have great resemblance to those of Halley's comet,
and it is very likely that an orbit differing still less might suffice to
produce a tolerable agreement. But few comets are recorded about
this year, and none of them exhibit any indications of identity with
Halley's, except that of 141.
    In the catalogue of Ma-tuoan-lin we find a comet in the year 65,
and another in 66, either of which may possibly have been Halley's,
though I think the latter agrees better on the whole. It was dis
covered in January in the eastern heavens; on February 20 it had
the same right ascension as the star 3 in Capricornus, and advanced
to the south of Scorpio. These circumstances are in perfect ac
cordance with the track followed by Halley's comet when the peri
helion passage takes place on January 26.
   The few particulars we have respecting the comet of A.D. 65 may
be represented by the orbit of Halley's comet, admitting it to have
reached the perihelion on August 5. It is possible therefore that

the sword-shaped sign that was seen over Jerusalem at the com
mencement of the war which ended in the destruction of the Holy
City by Titus may have been the comet of Halley.
   The most ancient, and at the same time one of the most certain
apparitions of this body, took place in the year 11 B.C., reckoning
according to the manner of astronomers. It was observed, according
to Dion Cassius, under the consulate of M. Messala Barbatus and
P. Sulpicius Quirinus, before the death of Agrippa, and seemed as
though it were suspended over the city of Rome. The Chinese
found it on the 26th of August in Gemini; it passed over this con
stellation, north of Castor and Pollux, towards Leo and Virgo,
moving at the rate of 6° daily. Subsequently it passed near Arc
turus and other stars in Boötes, and arrived in Ophiuchus and
Serpens. Fifty-six days after, August 26, it set with r and a
Scorpii.
   After the publication of M. Biot's valuable details in the appendix
to the Connaissance des Temps for 1846, I attempted an orbit for
this comet, and was immediately struck with the similarity of the
elements to those of the comet of Halley. The only alteration
necessary appeared to be a diminution of the orbital inclination,
which, instead of 17°, would be more satisfactory at 8° or 10°. The
Chinese description cannot be strictly followed, or we should have
a very irregular path; but I am satisfied that the elements of Hal
ley's comet for perihelion, node and least distance, and an inclination
of 8°, will accord as well with the observations as any orbit can
possibly do.
   Previous to the year 11 B.C. the accounts of comets become so
vague that it would be vain to attempt to carry the inquiry into
more remote antiquity. I think it will be deemed a fact of con
siderable interest that the celebrated comet which bears the name of
our countryman Halley may be traced, in a pretty satisfactory
manner, as far back as the year 11 before the Christian aera. For
this extensive knowledge of its probable history we are mainly in
debted to the records preserved in the annals of the various reigning
dynasties in China.

  ON BRONGNIARDITE, A NEW MINERAL.              BY M. A. DAMOUR.
M        CASTELNAU, during his last journey in America, collected
      • a considerable number of mineral substances, which he depo
sited with M. Damour to examine.     Among these minerals, there was
a large specimen possessing metallic lustre, and described as an ore of
silver. As it did not possess any trace of crystallization, it was only
by analysis that it could be ascertained to be a distinct species, con
sisting essentially of sulphur, antimony, lead and silver. Its prin
cipal characters are these:—It has the metallic lustre peculiar to the
antimonio-sulphurets, such as polybasite, bournonite, zinkenite, &c.
Its fracture is uneven, and it has no cleavage. Its powder blackish

478            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
gray. It scratches calcspar, and is scratched by a steel point. Its
density is 5.950. When heated on charcoal, it decrepitates, and
quickly fuses at a temperature below incipient redness, emitting a
sulphurous smell and white vapours. After long-continued roasting,
it leaves a globule of silver surrounded by a yellow aureola, indi
cating the presence of oxide of lead. When heated in a close glass
tube, it decrepitates, fuses, and yields a small orange-red sublimate,
surmounted by a white sublimate. If heated in an open glass tube,
it decrepitates, fuses, disengages a strong sulphurous odour, and a
white sublimate of peroxide of antimony is deposited on the sides of
the tube.
   Concentrated nitric acid attacks it rapidly, with the evolution of
nitrous vapours; the silver dissolves, and a residue is left, formed of
sulphur, oxide of antimony and sulphate of lead. Nitric acid,
diluted with four times its volume of water, attacks it slowly,
evolving sulphuretted hydrogen; the silver and lead are partially
dissolved; a gray deposit is left, in small needles, consisting of sul
phuret and oxide of antimony, containing a considerable portion of
lead and silver.
   Hydrochloric acid, when concentrated and boiling, dissolves this
substance completely, evolving sulphuretted hydrogen. On cooling,
the solution becomes turbid, and deposits chloride of silver mixed
with chloride of lead.
   A boiling solution of caustic potash attacks this mineral when
finely pulverized. It thus dissolves a large quantity of sulphuret of
antimony; a black heavy powder remains, which consists of sul
phuret of silver and lead containing some antimony.
   If sulphur be added to the potash solution, the greater part of
the antimony may be separated by successive decantations; the
author, however, never succeeded by this method in separating the
sulphurets of lead and silver perfectly from the sulphuret of antimony.
   The analysis of the mineral was performed by acting upon it with
a current of dry chlorine, in the manner described by M. Rose.
The volatile chlorides of sulphur and antimony were separated by
exposure to a gentle heat from the fixed chlorides of silver and lead.
The sulphur was converted into sulphuric acid, and its quantity de
duced from that of the sulphate of barytes which it yielded; the
antimony was precipitated by sulphuretted hydrogen; the sulphuret
obtained was analysed by the direct determination of the sulphur,
and inferring the antimony.
   The fixed chlorides were treated with boiling water, which dis
solved the chloride of lead; the chloride of silver remained insoluble;
its weight indicated the proportion of silver; the chloride of lead
was converted into sulphate, and the weight of it gave that of the
lead.
   The liquor separated contains a minute quantity of copper, iron
and zinc, the quantity of which was ascertained by the usual pro
CeSSeS.
   The mean of three analyses gave

The above results indicate the constitution of the mineral to be
5 equivs. sulphur, 2 equivs. antimony, 1 equiv. silver, 1 equiv. lead.
In composition it approaches the schilfglaserz, described in Dufre
noy's Mineralogy, containing, according to Wöhler,—
                  Sulphur . . . . . . . . . . . . . .      18: 74

Considerable difference in the composition of these two substances
is however observable; the crystallographical characters of the
schilfglaserz serve to distinguish one from the other; in fact, the
latter mineral crystallizes in the system of the right rhombic prism,
and gives well-marked cleavages; whilst the new mineral has a
shining uneven fracture, without any indication of cleavage. It is
to be expected, however, that it will at some time be found in regular
crystals.
   The specimen brought by M. Castelnau comes from the Mexican
mines, and weighs about 14 lbs. One of its surfaces is sprinkled
with iron pyrites. From its size and appearance it may be pre
sumed to form a workable seam.
   M. Damour proposes for this substance the name of brongniardite,
as a tribute of respect to the memory of the late M. Brongniart.—
Annales des Mines, vol. xvi. p. 227.
 ACTION OF SULPHATE OF MAGNESIA AND SULPHATE OF ZINC.
   M. Schaeuffele states, that when a saturated solution of sulphate
of magnesia is put in contact with pulverized sulphate of zinc, the
salt obtained differs from that procured by the inverse operation. In
the first case the crystals contain 12:59 per cent. of magnesia and
11.60 of oxide of zinc, whilst in the second case the quantities are
27.84 of oxide of zinc and only 0:27 of magnesia.
   The same fact is observed with regard to sulphate of iron in com
bining with sulphate of zinc.          If the first of these salts be taken in
powder, and the second in saturated solution, the crystals of the
double salt obtained contain 13.80 per cent. of oxide of zinc and
12:10 of oxide of iron; whilst, on the contrary, if a saturated solu
tion of sulphate of iron be taken, and the sulphate of zinc in powder,
the double salt formed contains 14.63 of oxide of iron and 12.05
only of oxide of zinc.

480           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
   The two salts, in combining, obey then some other law than that
of their reciprocal affinity: this new influence M. Schaeuffele de
scribes as the effect of masses.
   In fact, it cannot be mistaken that the relative mass of the con
stituent salts has a peculiar action on the definitive product, since
it is always the sulphate that has served to form the saturated solu
tion which predominates in the double salt obtained, and it is also
that which impresses its form on the product obtained.
   A fact, which had long escaped the notice of chemists, is thus
generalized, and to which M. Gerhardt first drew attention. What
happens in the preceding experiments may be assimilated to that
which is produced in the reaction of two solutions, according as one
is poured into the other.—Journ. de Pharm. et de Chim, Avril 1850.
             ON ARSENIC IN THE ZINCS OF COMMERCE.
   M. Schaeuffele observes, that it is not requisite to insist on the
importance of this subject. As zinc is not only employed in manu
factories for culinary purposes and in medico-legal investigations, it
has become necessary to determine the relative proportions of arsenic
which it may contain. The experiments of the author were made
on four specimens of zinc of well-known origin; and he submitted
them to the test of two methods generally applied in researches for
arsenic, those of Villain and Jacquelain. The former consists
in passing the arseniuretted hydrogen gas through a glass tube .
heated to redness, and in weighing the metallic arsenic resulting from
its decomposition; the process of the latter consists in passing the
gas through tubes with bulbs filled with solution of chloride of gold,
which it decomposes, giving rise to metallic gold, hydrochloric and
arsenious acids.                                                       -
   M. Villain's method gave the following results, as the quantity of
arsenic contained in a kilogramme of each of the kinds:
                                                                T.

              Zinc of Corphalie . . . . . . . . . .      . . .0:000038
   M. Schaeuffele also examined ten other commercial samples of
zinc, but of unknown origin; and he found the quantities of arsenic
comprised between the above-stated limits.
   It results, therefore, from these experiments, that the zinc from
the mine of Corphalie is the purest of those met with in commerce;
the author indeed admits, that, on account of the small quantity of
arsenic which it contains, it may be employed in medico-legal re
searches without previous purification, which cannot be done with
the zinc of France without danger, it being the most arsenical of all.

                  ON HUMUS.        BY M. SOUBEIRAN.
   It is well known that old trees are met with in forests the trunk
of which decomposes slowly internally, and eventually becomes a
brown-coloured powder of greater or less intensity. When this de
composition is much advanced, a moderately strong blow is sufficient
to occasion this product of decomposition to fall in abundance. The
author collected the altered wood which served for his experiments
from an old oak, which had a large hole low down, level with the soil.
It was moist; its colour that of Spanish snuff; its properties were
those of the purest mould. It was insipid and inodorous; it yielded
no colour to water, and gave a deep-coloured solution with am
monia; treated afterwards with an acid, and then again by ammonia,
it was coloured. Lastly, this old wood, thus exhausted, soon again
gave another coloured liquor by contact with the air and alka
lies.   The powder of the old wood therefore consisted of a mixture
of pure humus, a little humate of lime, and a substance not yet
altered, but capable of being changed into humus by contact with
the air and alkalies.
   The author extracted the humus from this old wood by washing
it at first with water, and then treating it with ammonia. This so
lution was precipitated by hydrochloric acid, and the humus purified
by repeated washings with water, boiling alcohol and aether. It was
then analysed. It left 7:16 per cent. of ash. By Warrentrapp and
Will's process, it yielded 2.5 per cent. of nitrogen. Deducting the
ash, combustion by oxide of copper and chlorate of potash gave—

                                                          100.0
 Subtracting the nitrogen, these numbers approximate C*H* Ois.
    It is worthy of remark, that in this humus, formed by exposure
 to air and moisture for many years, the carbon did not exceed 55
per cent. It seems that this is the extreme limit of the decomposi
 tion which lignine can undergo unassisted by heat and the concen
 trated alkalies.   This limit, it will be observed, is far removed from
 that assigned by M. Peligot to artificial ulmin, or 72 per cent.
    As to the nitrogen, which is always one of the constituents of
 humus, it is impossible to say what proportion belongs to it,
 and what proportion enters into the nitrogenous products, which
 are mixed with it. It is to be observed, that, in the powder
 of oak used, the quantity of nitrogen is greater than in the wood
 which gave rise to it. This fact renders it probable that some of
 the nitrogen of the air is fixed in it during the decomposition of the
 wood; this was the opinion of Theodore de Saussure. It may be
 argued, that the remains of insects have supplied it; but for a long
 period this powder could have afforded them no shelter, since the
 slightest shock causes it to fall at the foot of the tree.—Journ. de
 Pharm. et de Chim., Mai 1850.

ON A NEW REAGENT FOR ASCERTAINING THE PRESENCE OF
         sugAR IN CERTAIN LIQUIDS.           BY M. MAUMENíš.
   Chemists have indicated several processes for the detection of
sugar, even under the singular circumstances of diabetes. Unfor
tunately no one of these processes is sufficiently simple for adoption
in medical practice. The author proposes one by means of a re
agent of tissue, which will instantly discover the presence of the
smallest quantity of sugar.
   The action of chlorine on sugar is very imperfectly known, and
the experiments which M. Maumené has performed have shown nu
merous inaccuracies in the assertions which have been made by cele.
brated chemists. Thus chlorine acts even on dry sugar; it requires
only 212°F. to excite the reaction; when cold, more time is required.
In all cases a brown matter is formed, partly soluble in water, be
coming a brilliant black caramel when it is dried. This is obtained
by chlorine, and it is easily procured with the chlorides, and espe
cially with the perchlorides.
   All sugars act in the same way as cane-sugar with the chlorides;
all undergo the dehydratation, the brown-black product of which
is the final completion.    And this is not all; as may be foreseen,
substances, the composition of which is analogous to that of sugar,
and which may also be represented by carbon and water, undergo the
same kind of alteration: this is the case with lignin, hemp, flax,
cotton, paper, starch, fecula, &c.
   From all these facts results a knowledge of the conditions requi
site for preparing a substance which has imbibed the reagent proper
for discovering the presence of sugar. Strips of white merino an
swer this purpose; after having soaked it during three or four mi
nutes in an aqueous solution of bichloride of tin, made with 100
parts of the bichloride of commerce and 200 parts of water, the
merino is drained, and when dried in a water-bath on a strip of the
same stuff, the reagent is prepared. It is to be cut into portions
of 7 to 10 centimetres in length and 2 to 3 wide, like common test
papers.
   By employing this chlorinated merino, the physician can, without .
any trouble, determine whether the urine contains an appreciable
trace of sugar. It is sufficient to let fall a drop of the urine on the
prepared test, and to hold it over red-hot charcoal, or the flame of a
spirit-lamp, to produce in a minute a very visible black spot. The
sensibility of this reagent is extreme; ten drops of diabetic urine,
added to 100 cubic centimetres of water, form a liquid with which
the test is rendered completely brownish-black. Common urine,
urea and lithic acid, yield no such discoloration with chloride of tin.

FORMATION OF ASPARTIC ACID WITH BIMALATE OF AMMONIA.
                         BY M. DESSAIGNES.               -
   To M. Piria is due our knowledge of the interesting fact, that
asparagin and aspartic acid, submitted to the oxidizing action of ni
trous gas, disengage nitrogen and leave a residue of malic acid. He

             Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.              483
has also shown, by the analytic method, that these two substances
may be considered as amides of malic acid, corresponding to oxa
mide and oxamic acid. If this be the case, synthesis should repro
duce asparagin and aspartic acid. The action of ammonia on malic
aether, when this aether shall be prepared, ought to give rise to as
paragin. The author states, however, that he has not been more
fortunate than his predecessors in his attempts to obtain malic aether;
but he has succeeded in preparing aspartic acid with bimalate of am
InOnla.
   When this salt is heated from 160° to 200° (Centig.) in an oil-bath,
it fuses and swells, and disengages some very slightly ammoniacal
water. The residue is a reddish, transparent, resinous-looking
mass, which is very slightly soluble even in boiling water. By
repeated washings with hot water, a pulverulent, amorphous mat
ter is obtained, which is of a pale-brick colour and an earthy
taste. It is a new nitrogenized acid, which differs in all its re
actions from aspartic acid. This substance is very stable. It dis
solves in hot concentrated acids, from which water precipitates it
unchanged, even after boiling for a short time. But if it be heated
for five or six hours with nitric acid or with hydrochloric acid, it
undergoes a remarkable transformation. The reaction is over when
water, added to the acid solution, ceases to precipitate anything.
The solution, evaporated in a water-bath to dryness, left a brown
residue, crystalline and very acid, which is a compound of hydro
chloric acid and organic matter. This compound is easily purified
by charcoal, and fine colourless crystals are obtained. It was dis
solved in a large quantity of hot water, and the solution was divided
into two equal portions, one of which was accurately saturated with
ammonia, and then added to the other portion. On cooling, a great
quantity of small brilliant prisms were formed, which were aspartic
acid; it did not possess the same form as the acid obtained from
asparagin, but the salts which it forms with lime, soda, and with the
oxides of copper and silver, crystallize in the same form as the cor
responding aspartates; and the author ascertained by analysis that
they contained the same quantity of base; the acid submitted to
analysis gave the same results as those obtained from the compound
of aspartic acid.—Comptes Rendus, Mars 18, 1850.
DESCRIPTION OF AN APPARATUS FOR             REGULATING THE HEAT
     PRODUCED BY A GAS-BURNER.            BY ALEXANDER. KEMP.
   Any one who has had occasion to maintain an object at a regu
lated temperature for a length of time by means of a gas-burner,
must have experienced the difficulty of keeping the heat at the re
quired point from two causes. First, the quantity of gas passing
through the burner in any given time varies directly as the pressure
on the service-pipes; a greater quantity is therefore consumed when
the pressure increases, and the amount of heat applied to the object
is increased in the same degree.
   Secondly, as the temperature of the atmosphere is liable to change
during the continuance of the experiments, its cooling influence will
be greater at one time than another. Both these causes conduce to

 484           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
 render the attainment of the object in view one of considerable
 difficulty.
    It will be evident, from what I have just stated, that any instru
 ment intended to supply the desideratum must be self-acting, and
                                   must supply the gas to be consumed
                                   exactly as it is required. The in
                                  strument I have been in the habit
                                  of using for some time back con
                                  sists of an air-thermometer, AB,
                                  containing mercury in the lower part
                                  of the bulb B and part of the stem
                                  A.    A tube of smaller diameter,
                                  marked C, passes down the axis of
                                  the tube A, the annular space being
                                  made air-tight by a small brass
                                  stuffing-box, D, by means of which
                                  it may be retained at any required
                                  elevation. In using the instrument,
                                  the bulb B is placed in the same
                                  situation as the body to be exposed
                                  to the heat of the gas-flame; for
                                  instance, if it is a water-bath con
                                  taining vessels or other objects, it is
                                  immersed in the water; or if an air
                                  chamber or hot-press, it is placed
                                  as near the object as possible, so
                                 that the air in the bulb may attain
                                 the same temperature as the sur
                                  rounding medium.
   A tube of vulcanized India rubber is now to be connected with a
stop-cock attached to the service-pipe, and its other extremity drawn
over the end of the pipe C, which will make it sufficiently air-tight.
A second India rubber tube is in like manner to be attached at E,
to convey the gas to the burner employed as a source of heat in the
operation.
   Let us now suppose that it is required to keep an object at a tem
perature of 100°F., the bulb of the instrument being placed con
tiguous to the object; the stop-cock is to be opened so as to allow
a free supply of gas to the burner, which is now to be kindled; the
heat now begins to act on the air contained in the ball of the in
strument, causing it to expand and force the mercury up the stem
A; when it is found, by the use of a common thermometer, that the
heat has risen to 100°, the tube C is to be pushed down till its
lower extremity is immersed in the mercury. This would, of course,
cause the flame to be extinguished; but, to prevent this occurring,
a small hole is bored through the inner tube opposite F, which per
mits a small quantity of gas to pass to the burner. As the passage
of the gas is now interrupted, the source of heat is withdrawn, and
the cooling influence of the surrounding air comes into play, which
will cause the air contained in B to contract and the mercury to
sink in A, leaving the end of C uncovered, and thus open a free
passage to the gas, which by its combustion would again raise the

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.           485
temperature so as to cut off the supply; but in a very short time
these two opposing forces come to an equilibrium, and the flame
scarcely varies in size.                             -
   After trying the instrument in the form described, I experienced
a practical difficulty from the want of perfect contact between the
end of the tube C and the mercury, from which I found that it
might rise many degrees beyond the assigned limit without sufficiently
lowering the flame; this I at once saw might be overcome by making
the tube of a substance which would become wetted by the mercury.
I tried a brass and also a copper tube, amalgamated at the end, but
they slowly dissolved in the mercury, which they rendered impure,
so that its rise and fall could not be depended on with the required
nicety. The substance now used is platinum, of which about half
an inch of the lower end of the tube is formed, amalgamated by
dipping it into a liquid amalgam of sodium and mercury. In con
nexion with this I may mention, that platinum, iron and steel may
be readily amalgamated in the same way, or by using a strong so
lution of caustic potash or soda in contact with the mercury.
   I have now used several of these instruments for various periods,
and have found them to answer well. In one operation, conducted
in Professor Gregory's laboratory (the fermentation of sugar into
butyric acid), one of them has been in use for upwards of six weeks,
keeping about five gallons of liquid at a temperature of 98° F., and
it has not been observed to vary. I have also another in an appa
ratus for artificial incubation, where the temperature in the well
part is kept at 120°F. For this latter purpose I consider it well
adapted, as it may be placed in the vessel along with the eggs, and
thus the use of hot water be altogether dispensed with, as well as
the constant attendance required to regulate the heat applied to the
eggs.
   I need not take up space with pointing out hany applications
that may be made of the instrument; these will occur to every one:
but there is one I may allude to, viz. obtaining products of the de
composition of organic bodies at fixed temperatures, which has
hitherto been somewhat difficult, as different substances are formed
as the temperature varies to which they are subjected. The only
limit to its application is the same as in the ordinary thermometer,
viz. the boiling of the mercury; this might be overcome by using
an easily fusible metal, such as tin, and constructing the instrument
of iron, when its form might also be modified to suit particular
circumstances.—From the Chemical Gazette for May 15, 1850.
          ON SOME PHAENOMENA OF DEFECTIVE VISION.
      To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
        GENTLEMEN,                            Brompton, April 6, 1850.
   One of the earliest evidences of old age creeping on is experi
enced in defective vision; and some months ago my attention
was directed to a peculiarity in the phaenomena attending it which I
do not recollect to have seen noticed in books. It may possibly be
peculiar to my own eyes; but I think not; for though there is a

486           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
difference between my left and right, from long habit of using mi
croscopes, still the general result is similar in each, and I think such
as must be detected by other persons.
    I made a small square bounded by narrow lines on a sheet of paper,
and closing my left eye, I observed that the image was double, the
false one being raised, and to the left of the true the interval filled
up with a pale reddish-brown spectrum, most intense near the true .
image; the breadth of the interval about 0.03 inch. With my right
eye closed, the image was, as I expected, to the right and above (in
both instances towards the brow and nose), and the interval simi
larly tinged, but fainter, and 0.025 inch wide.
    I then took a slip of card, and made with a pen-knife a fine slit in
it, and looked through it held horizontally at the square; the upper
false image was no longer visible, the upper and lower sides of the
square clearly defined, but the lateral sides were unchanged; on
holding the slit vertically, the lateral false images disappeared and
the upper and lower returned. Similar appearances occurred with
the other eye.
    I now took a card and made two fine pin-holes exactly in the
positions of the centres of my pupils, and I found that I saw the
true image as correctly as I had ever done in my life; in fact, it sup
plied the place of a pair of spectacles; the square, of course, being
seen under a greater angle, appearing magnified. By making the
pin-hole larger or smaller, the focal distance, if I may use the ex
pression, increased or diminished proportionably. I beg further to
remark, that in the sunshine I can read small print at the natural
focal distance; it is only in fainter light that the double image and
confusion of letters occur. Now a flattening of the cornea won’t
explain all this: it seems to have a more intimate connexion with
some want of contractility engendered in old age in the iris. I am
curious to obtain an explanation, and send this notice to you for the
purpose of eliciting one.
                                        Truly yours,
                                                      R. T. CRANMoRE.
   P.S.. I have since observed that wire-gauze, the wire being very
fine, and the meshes about £5th of an inch in diameter, when worn
close to the eye, enables me to read small print with tolerable faci
lity at a distance of five or six inches; when the meshes are closer,
I can see the most minute objects with remarkable distinctness.

   ON THE EXISTENCE OF IODINE IN FRESHWATER PLANTS.
                         BY M. AD. CHATIN.
   In verifying the fact stated by Muller (Lindley's Vegetable King
dom), of the existence of iodine in a cress of unknown origin, the
author has ascertained—
   That iodine exists in freshwater cresses, that it is not peculiar to
this species, nor general with respect to plants of the family of the
Cruciferae;
   That iodine does not exist, or at any rate cannot be discovered in
terrestrial plants, whereas it exists in all aquatic plants;

                      Meteorological Observations.                                   487
   That of the latter, those which occur in running water are richer
in iodine than those of stagnant water;
    That in sheets of water, which are sufficiently large to be strongly
agitated by winds, the plants approach those of running water, in
the quantity of iodine which they contain;
    That the proportion of iodine contained in plants is in general
independent of their nature, and subordinate only to their habitat,
as indicated by the Confervae, the Potamogetons, the Nymphaea, the
Ranunculi, and the Cresses, all of which are equally rich in iodine
in running waters, and equally poor in marshes;
    That the iodine exists uncombined with the tissue, but in the state
of alkaline iodide in the juice of the plant.—Comptes Rendus, Mars 25,

LXII. On the Geometrical Interpretation of Quaternions. By
   W. F. DoNKIN, M.A., &c., Savilian Professor of Astro
   nomy in the University of Oxford *.
IN     a recent paper in this Journal, I gave two examples of
      the application of quaternions to geometrical problems,
in which I made use of a system of interpretation different
from that usually employed by Sir W. Hamilton. This
system it is my present object to explain. I am not at pre
sent prepared to offer an opinion as to its practical advantages
or disadvantages. It is here proposed as possessing a certain
theoretic interest, arising from the fact that it represents the
method of quaternions as a natural (or rather the natural)
extension to tridimensional space of the usual geometrical in
terpretations of symbolical algebra. The general principles
employed in the investigation have no pretensions to novelty.
The view here taken of symbolical algebra, and of its inter
pretation in plane geometry, is substantially the same as that
advocated by the late Mr. Gregory (in the fourteenth volume
of the Edinburgh Philosophical Transactions, and in several
papers in the Cambridge Mathematical Journal); and the
extension to geometry of three dimensions rests upon prin
ciples which will be found, I believe, to agree essentially, as
far as they go, with those laid down by Sir W. Hamilton
in his papers on symbolical geometry in the last-named pe
riodical.   In what follows, then, no further reference will in
general be made to previous writers. Moreover, to avoid the
use of frequent qualifying phrases, propositions will be stated
dogmatically which only claim to be accepted as belonging to
a consistent system, not as belonging to the only consistent or
useful system.
   General symbolical algebra is a calculus of operations. All
the symbols employed, including those arithmetical symbols
which occur, represent or indicate operations. The subject

490      Prof. Donkin on the Geometrical Interpretation
 of operation, or (to adopt Sir W. Hamilton's convenient
 term) the operand, is in general not represented by any sym
 bol at all, but is to be understood. Thus the symbol ab
 represents the successive performance of the operations b, a
 upon the operand. Neither operations nor operand are de
Jined, further than definition is involved in the assumed laws
 of the combination of symbols. If we assume ab=ba, we limit
 to a certain extent the choice of meanings for the operations
 a and b; and if we assume that the arithmetical equation
 m+n=s shall be true in symbolical algebra (where m and n
 are absolute numbers, and s their sum), we limit the choice
 of the operand: for let it be a ; then the above equation sig
 nifies ma+na=sa, and the meaning of a must be such that
 this may be capable of an intelligible and consistent interpre
 tation. It is not necessary for our present purpose to attempt
 a complete discussion of the laws of the usual algebraical
 symbols. The following remarks, however, may serve to elu
 cidate the processes to be explained hereafter.
    The symbols + and — are used in algebra in two essen
 tially different ways. First, they are used, as in arithmetic,
 to indicate addition and subtraction.     Thus a + b denotes a
 certain resultant formed by separately performing the opera
 tions a and b on the operand, and adding the result of the
 latter operation to that of the former. The meaning of ad
 dition cannot be defined till the nature of the operand is de
 termined. The same may be said of a -b, mutatis mutandis.
 The equations
                    a + (b+c)= a + b + c, &c.
 suggested by arithmetic as convenient assumptions, suggest
 in their turn further assumptions; namely, that if + and -
 should ever be used as true symbols of operation, so that + a
 should denote the result of performing the operation + upon
 the operand a, and + -a should denote the performance of
 the successive operations a, -, + upon an operand (not ex
 pressed), then the laws of their combinations should be
               + + = -- = +,       +- = - + = -.
 Such combinations do not really occur at all in the first use
 of these symbols. The expression a-(b–c) only suggests,
 but does not really contain the combination – –.
    We now come to the second way in which + and – are
 used, namely, as true symbols of operation, defined by the
 laws of combination just stated.
    Let us for the present distinguish this use of the symbols
 by inclosing them in brackets. Then the following equations

                         of Quaternions.                     491
are well known, viz.
          (+)"= (+), (-)*=(+), (-)*-*=(-),
where n is an integer. But it is to be remembered, that, unless
n=1, these   equations do not express identity, but only equi
valence. (-)*=(+) is an identical equation; but (+)*=(+)
does not mean that (+)” is the same operation as (+), but
only that it produces the same result when performed on the
operand. Thus (+)*=(+) is only true in the same sense in
which (+) = 1 is true. And this brings us to a point of con
siderable importance, namely, the twofold use of the symbol 1
in algebra, as representing an operation on the one hand, or
a concrete quantity or operand on the other.      Considered in
the former light, 1 represents the operation of taking the ope
rand as it is; considered in the latter, it represents a concrete
unit taken as a subject of operation. In the former case (+)1
and (-) I may be used as synonymous with (+) and (-), and
 V(+)1, V(–)1 as synonymous with (+)', (–)'. In the
latter case
            ((+)1)', ((-)1)", v(+)T, V(E)i
are all equally unmeaning, just as
                  ((+)-81),      V(–):1, &c.
are equally unmeaning. It appears to me that a great deal of
confusion has arisen from neglecting this distinction. At all
events I intend to preserve it strictly in the present paper, in
which all the symbols will represent operations, and never
concrete quantities, unless that be expressly stated. Thus, if
a be one of the coordinates of a point in space, a represents,
strictly speaking, in any equation in which it may occur, not a
line, nor a number, but the operation of multiplying the ope
rand (which is understood throughout) by the same number
by which the linear unit must be multiplied in order to pro
duce a line equal to the distance of the point in question from
the plane of yz. If this be well understood, there is no ob
jection to speaking of v, for convenience, as if it really repre
sented such a line.
   To return, however, to the symbols + and —, the equations
  a + (+)b= a-(-)b=a+b, a -(+)b= a + (–)b=a-b,
which rest on grounds that need not be here examined, justify
us in omitting the use of brackets to save trouble, though it
would perhaps be theoretically desirable to have some equi
valent mark of distinction.

492      Prof. Donkin on the Geometrical Interpretation
algebra in plane geometry are now generally understood and
recognized. There are some important remarks, however, to
be made with reference to what follows. The operand, in
this system of interpretation, is always a directed line, that is,
a straight line in a determinate direction, and with a determi
nate beginning and end. It is convenient for our present pur
pose to assume that all the lines considered shall have their
beginnings at the same point or origin. The operand, then,
is a radius vector drawn from a determinate origin in a deter
minate plane. The symbol + denotes the operation of turn
ing this line round the origin through a whole revolution, in
a determinate sense, which we will assume to be contrary to
that of the motion of the hands of a watch. It is especially
important to observe, that + does not represent the operation
of placing the line in a determinate direction (such as that of a
given fixed axis), but the operation of turning it round from
the direction it had at first (which may be any whatever) till it
comes into the same direction again. Then (+)", or -, re
presents a semi-revolution; (–)", or, as it is commonly written,
 V–1, a quarter of a revolution; and so on. And if a be a
numerical symbol, then (+)"a represents the compound ope
ration of altering the length of the operand line in the ratio
of a to 1, and also turning it round through an angle equal
to 227t.                                         -
   The addition and subtraction of directed lines is to be per
formed, as is well known, according to the rules for the com
position of forces. Thus, if a, b be two radii vectores, a +b
represents another radius vector, namely the diagonal (drawn
from the origin) of the parallelogram constructed on them;
and a-b represents a third radius vector, namely the dia
gonal (from the origin) of the parallelogram of which two sides
are a, and a line equal to b, but in the opposite direction.
The symbol cos 0-- V-1 ..sin 6 represents a compound opera
ration, namely (1) multiplying the operand by cos 6 without
altering its direction; (2) multiplying it by sin 6 and turning it
through a right angle; (3) adding together the two lines so
obtained, or taking the diagonal of the parallelogram described
upon them; which diagonal is obviously equal in length to
the original operand, but inclined to it at an angle 6, so that
cos 0-- V-1.sind represents the operation of turning through
an angle 6, and is equivalent to (+)", if 0 =2ar. Nothing
depends, as was before observed, on the direction of the ope
rand line; but in interpreting such expressions as p-HQ, where
p, q are any symbols of operation, of course it is assumed
that both refer to the same operand. In plane geometry, the

                          of Quaternions.                       4.93
 direction of the operand line is in general completely arbitrary
 in its own plane; but this is not generally true when it is a
 line in space not confined to a determinate plane. Inow pro
 ceed to consider the application of algebraical symbols to this
 CaSe.
    If we assume the symbol +, to represent the operation of
 turning a line through a complete revolution in a plane per
 pendicular to a determinate axis r, drawn from the origin,
 then (+.)" will represent the operation of turning through an
 angle 22n; and we may use -, as a symbol equivalent to
 (+)", denoting a semi-revolution. So far as rotations in this
 one plane are concerned, all that has been said of (+) and
 (-) in plane geometry will apply to +, and —,          I will add,
 however, one remark, which may be useful to readers (if this
 paper should meet with such) to whom the subject is new. If
 we admit (which, however, is not necessary) the idea of nega
 tive angles, then, 6 representing an angle described by a de
 terminate rotation, -6 represents an equal angle described
 by a contrary rotation. But if q represent the operation of
 describing the angle 6, or the rotation by which it is described,
 then the operation of describing – is represented, not by
 -q, but by   : or q-".    The equation 6+(–6)=0 means the
same thing as q"q= 1. The former expresses that the an
gular distance between the first and last positions of the de
scribing line is 0; the latter, that if we turn a line through
any angle and then back again, the result is equivalent to
simply taking it as it is, which, considered as an operation, is
represented by the symbol 1. To justify the assertion that
the consideration of negative angles is not necessary, it will be
sufficient to observe that an angle which is negative when
considered as described about one axis, is positive if it be con
sidered as described about an opposite axis. But a complete
discussion of this point would involve an examination of the
theory of indices, and would lead us too far from our imme
diate subject, to which I return.
   For convenience let q be put for (+.)", so that q is a symbol
of rotation, and represents the operation of turning the ope
rand line through an angle 8(=2xt) in a plane perpendicular
to a given line r (whose length is immaterial) drawn from the
origin; the direction of rotation, moreover, being such that
the line r shall be its positive or north axis. The initial po
sition of the operand must be in the plane of the rotation,
otherwise the operation could not be performed upon it: but
so far as this one operation is concerned, it may be in any

494      Prof. Donkin on the Geometrical Interpretation
part of the plane; and the symbol q represents, indifferently,
rotation through an angle 6 in any part of the plane.
   Now let q = (+, )” represent in like manner the operation
of turning through an angle 6'=287 in another plane whose
axis is r'. The two operations q, q' cannot in general be suc
cessively performed upon the same operand line. In order
that this may be   £         it is necessary to place it at first in
the plane of the first rotation q, and in such a direction that
this first rotation shall bring it into the line of intersection of
the two planes, whereby the second rotation becomes possible.
   Let q" represent the single rotation which would have
brought the line from its initial position into that final position
in which it is placed by the successive rotations q, q'; we have
then the symbolic equation (or rather equivalence) qq=q".
The successive rotations q, q' are (not identical with, but)
equivalent in effect to the single rotation q". If now a third
rotation q" is to be performed, the rotation q" must (if neces
sary) be transported in its own plane so as to make the com
pound operation q"q" possible, just as the first rotation q was
transported so as to make q'q possible. These conventions
enable us to assign a determinate rotation in a determinate
plane as the result (or product) of any number of given suc
cessive rotations in given planes. But it is obvious that no
useful method of calculation could be based upon such assump
tions, unless we could prove (as we can prove) that the asso
ciative principle holds good with respect to the product of
rotations; that is, that (q"q")g=q"(q'q).
   Let us now adopt a method of representing rotations (in
words or by actual diagrams) similar to that employed in the
previous paper. Conceive a sphere with arbitrary radius to
be described about the origin; and, AB being any arc of a
great circle on this sphere, let “the rotation AB” signify that
rotation of a radius vector which would cause its intersection
with the sphere to describe the arc AB (from A to B), or any
equal and similarly described arc in the same great circle. [It
must be carefully borne in mind, that we are now concerned
with the rotations of lines, and not, as in the former paper, of
solids].
   Let ABC be any spherical triangle, and let the rotations
AB, BC, AC be represented as above by q, q', q"; we have
then q'q = q". It is easy to see that qq' does not represent
the same thing as q'q, and also to see what it does represent.
For producing AB to A and CB to C, making BA = AB,
BC = CB, and joining C'A', we see that q9' represents the
successive rotations CB, BA', the effect of which is the same
as that of C'A'.    If then, we denote th s last rotation by qi,

                          of Quaternions.                      4.95
we have qg'=qm, and since C'A' is equal to AC, we see also
that qq', q'q represent equal rotations, but generally in different
planes; these planes, however, being equally inclined to the
planes of q, q'.               -
    Consider now in particular the case in which AB, BC are
both quadrants. Then it is obvious that C'A' is in the same
great circle with AC, so that if q" represent the rotation AC,
 1    .                      -                                   •
7" will represent the rotation C'A', and we have therefore, in
this case, qq'= (g'q)". Now let q, represent (not AC but)
CA, so that q, q', q, represent the rotations by which the sides
of the triangle would be described in a cyclic order; then we
shall have, for any triangle,
                  *=+,       u-#, w=#
                       7, war-7 at - 7.
and if we further suppose all the sides of the triangle to be
quadrants, we shall also have, as we have just seen,
                   qq'=7p q/7–9', 'q = q.
    Before we proceed further, there is one important remark
to be made with respect to the symbol (+), or -., namely,
that the effect of the rotation denoted by it, is, regard being
had to the conventions above established, independent of the
direction of the axis r; since a semi-revolution, in any plane
in which it is possible, merely reverses the direction of the ope
rand line. We may therefore in all cases substitute the general
symbol – for -, and write (+) = -. To illustrate this
further, let q represent any rotation AB, and let us examine
the meaning of the product –, q. The arc AB must be so
placed in its own plane that its end B shall be at the intersec
tion of that plane with the plane of the rotation –,"; then the
 operand line must first describe AB, and then half a circum
ference in the latter plane, after which it will obviously be
 again in the same great circle with AB, cutting the sphere in
 the point opposite to B. Now the same effect would have
 been produced by a single rotation in the plane of the rotation
 q, through an angle 6+T described positively, or 7-0 de
 scribed negatively, 6 being the angle of the rotation q. If,
 then, q=(+.)", we have
                         (-r)g = (+, )*,
in which we may henceforth drop the subscript r", and write
 simply —q on the first side.
    It is still more obvious that similar remarks apply to the
 case of the symbol +, ; or that we may always drop the sub

496       Prof. Donkin on the Geometrical Interpretation
script, and use + simply, to denote a whole revolution in any
plane. But there are no other values of x besides these two
of x = 1, x =   # and their multiples, for which the effect of the
rotation (+)" is independent of the direction of r.      It is also
to be noticed, that these are the only cases in which the
symbol (+...)" is commutative with respect to all other symbols
of rotation. The reader will easily see, that, on the principles
we have admitted, (+)*q is equivalent to q(+)". Either will
be henceforth denoted by –q.
    Now let there be three fixed rectangular axes meeting the
sphere in X, Y, Z, and so arranged that X is the north pole
of the rotation YZ.      Let us for convenience assume three
fixed symbols, i, j, k, to represent the three rotations YZ,
ZX, XY; that is, quadrantal rotations respectively in (any
parts of) the three planes of yz, za, aly. According to our
previous notation, we might write
                                                                    *
                 i=(+.), j=(+), k=(+.)";
but we shall not have much further occasion for it.
    The conclusions obtained above respecting quadrantal tri
angles give the equations
          ji=i, i=1, 5-, 6-#, it=}, ji= #2
of which the three last can now be written
                  kj=-i, ik=-j, ji= -k.
For we have
   i-'=(+.)"=(+.)(+.) *=(+.)*=(+.)*(+.)*= -, i.;
and we have seen that - may be replaced by —, so that we
get i-'= -i, and, in like manner,
                      j-"=-j,      k"= -k.
Also we have
                          i°=( + ..)"= - as
and similarly,
                       j*=-, *=-.;
which may now be written
                          i°=??=k*= – 2:
 and, to conform to common notation, we may put –1 instead
 of -. In all these cases it is to be recollected that the symbol
 = denotes, not identity of operations, but equivalence of
 results.

                         of Quaternions.                     497
    The associative principle, so far as the products of the qua
drantal rotations represented by i, j, k are concerned, is now
established, since
              (ii) k=k*= -1, i(jk)=i°= -1, &c.
    Hitherto we have been considering the use of the symbol
 +, as representing rotation. We must now proceed to ex
amine the principles on which the symbols + and - are to
be employed in the present system, as indicating the addition
and subtraction of directed lines.
    Let q, q' denote any two rotations, and a, a two numbers.
What is the interpretation of aq+a'q'? In the first place,
aq represents the compound operation of turning the operand
line through the rotation q, and altering its length in the ratio
of a to 1; and alq has a similar meaning. Next, in order
that aq, a'q' may both refer to the same operand line, that line
must at first coincide with the intersection of the planes of the
two rotations q, q'. Let a be the operand so placed; then
aqa, a'a'a represent two lines whose lengths are aa, a'a, and
whose directions are determined by the rotations q, q'. Their
sum aqa-Ha'q'a represents the diagonal of the parallelogram
constructed upon them. Let a'a be the length of this dia
gonal, and q" the rotation which would bring the original
operand into coincidence with it; then we have
                        aqa-Ha'q'a=a"q"a,
or omitting the symbol of the operand,
                          aq +a'q'=a"q".
Thus the complex symbol of operation, aq+a'q', represents a
single determinate rotation combined with a determinate alte
ration of length. It is easy to illustrate this by a diagram,
thus:—
    Let ABC be any spherical triangle, and let q, q' represent
the rotations AB, AC. Then (aq + a'q')a represents the dia
gonal of a parallelogram constructed on two radii vectores
 which cut the sphere in B and C, and whose lengths are aa,
 a'a. This diagonal will cut the sphere in a point D of the
 arc BC, such that
                     sin BD: sin CD :: a': a.
 Join AD; then, in the equation aq+a'q'=a"q", we have ob
 viously
                    a"*= a”+ a”--2aa’ cos BC,
 and q" is the symbol of the determinate rotation AD.
    The expression a + a'q', which is merely a particular case
 of the above, is easily interpreted in the same way. The ope

  498      Prof. Donkin on the Geometrical Interpretation
  rand a must first be in the plane of the rotation q'. The
  operation a merely alters its length into aa; the operation
  a'g' alters its length into a'a, and also alters its direction.
  Then (a +a'g')a is the diagonal of the parallelogram constructed
  on the two lines represented by aa, a q'a; and if a'a be the
  length of this diagonal, and q" the rotation which would bring
 the operand into coincidence with it, we have, as before,
                                       11,11
                            a +a'q'=a"q".
     The expression
  *                        aq +a'q'+a"q",
 in which q, q', q" represent any three rotations, and a, a', a”
 any three numbers, cannot generally be interpreted without
 the help of conventions similar to those adopted in interpreting
 £            because unless the planes of the three rotations
   appen to intersect in the same line, it is impossible so to place
 the operand that each operation can be performed on it. But
 we have seen that aq+a'q' is equivalent to the symbol of a
 single determinate rotation in a determinate plane, combined
 with a determinate alteration of length. Suppose, therefore,
                f          aq+a'q'= agr
 Then we may transport the rotation q, in its own plane, until
 its origin coincides with the line of intersection of that plane
 with the plane of the rotation 7", so that a q,--a"q" may be
 interpretable in the same way as aq+a'q'. Thus we shall
 finally arrive at a single determinate rotation, with a determi
 nate alteration of length, as the interpretation of
                          (aq+a'q') +a"q".
 The usefulness of the system will depend upon our being able
 to show (as we shall easily do) that the associative principle
 holds good in addition, or that
      (aq +a'g') +a"q"=aq + (a'q'+a"q")=(aq +a"q") +a'g',
which will justify us in omitting the brackets.
    The case of subtraction is evidently included in that of ad
dition, since the sign -, preceding any symbol of rotation,
may be changed into +, provided we increase the angle of
rotation by two right angles.
    We are now in a position to prove the following funda
mental proposition :
    Let i, j, k represent, as above explained, quadrantal rota
tions whose positive poles are respectively X, Y, Z, and let
l, m, n be the direction cosines of any line r from the origin.
Then il-Hijm +kn represents a quadrantal rotation whose po
                                                                     •

                           of Quaternions.                    499
sitive axis is r, or, according to our previous notation,
                         il-Hjm + kn=(+...)4.
   If the condition
                           l?--m?-- n°= 1
did not subsist, then, putting
                          A/l”+m2 + n°=u,
we should have               -
                        il-Hjm +kn=(+,)'u,
representing the compound operation of turning the operand
through a right angle in the plane perpendicular to r, and
altering its length in the ratio of w to 1, the direction cosines
of r being proportional to l, m, n.
   The proof of this
is very simple, but
can hardly be given
without a diagram.
In the figure (of
which all the lines
represent arcs of
great circles), let X,
Y, Z be the positive X
poles of the rotations
i,j, k, or the points
in which the positive
axes of w, y, z cut the
sphere; and let X’,
Z be diametrically
opposite to X, Z.
   Now to interpret                         **
mj+nk, take XZ and XY to represent the rotations j, k,
then taking Q in YZ", so that
                     sin YQ: sin QZ": ; m: n,
and joining XQ, we have evidently, by the principles esta
blished above,
                        mj+nk= Vm”-En”.q,
where q represents the quadrantal rotation XQ.           Next, to
interpret
                           vm”-- *. q +li,
transport the rotation q in its own plane to QX', so that its
origin may be in the plane of the rotation i. Take QS a
quadrant, and join SX'. Take R in SX' so that
                 sin SR: sin RX':: Vm"+n”: i,

 500     Prof. Donkin on the Geometrical Interpretation
 and join QR. Then, by the same principles, we have
                vm"+n. 7+li= VP-Fm++7°.g.,
 where q' represents the quadrantal rotation QR. If we sup
 pose
                          l”--m”--n’= 1,
 then what we have just proved is that
                           il-H (jm +kn)
 represents the quadrantal rotation QR, without alteration of
 the length of the operand.          -
   Let QR cut YX' in T. Then in the right-angled triangle
 QYT the preceding conditions give easily
              cos YQT=l, cos YG =—#
                                          w/m2 + n’
whence, by Napier's rules,
                           cos YTQ = n.
                                                                *
 Thus l and n are the cosines of the angles which the plane of
 QR makes with the planes of yz, ay; whence it follows that
m is the cosine of the angle which it makes with the plane of
az.    In other words, l, m, n are the direction cosines of the
axis of the rotation QR; and an examination of the figure
 constructed for any particular case, shows that they belong to
 the positive axis of that rotation.
   We have thus interpreted the expression il-H (jm +kn); and
the symmetry of the result shows that the interpretation of
(il-Hijm)+kn or of (il--kn)+jm would have conducted us to
the same conclusion. Thus the associative principle of ad
dition is established so far as quadrantal rotations are con
cerned, and we may write il-Hjm +kn without brackets.
   Consider now the expression
                    cos 6+ sin 6(il-Hijm + kn).
The first term represents the operation of altering the length
of the operand in the ratio of cos 6 to 1; and the second, the
compound operation of altering its length in the ratio of sin 6
to 1, and turning it through a right angle in a determinate
plane. Applying, therefore, the principles explained above
with reference to the interpretation of such expressions as
a +a'q', we see that the complex symbol now under conside
ration represents the operation of turning the operand, without
altering its length, through an angle 6, in a plane perpendi
cular to the axis whose direction cosines are l, m, n.    Let r
denote such an axis; then we may write
                cos 0+ sin 6(il-Hijm-i-kn)=(+,)",

                            of Quaternions.                           501
where
   The quaternion
                             w--iv-Hjy Hke
is always reducible to the form
                     *(cos 6+ sin 6(il-Hijm-i- kn)),
where
                             l”--m”-- n°= 1,
by the assumptions
P = V/w”+x^+y^+z”, r= Va"+y^+2°, wsin 6=r, ucos6=w,
                           l  -  772   %2      l
                          * T y T = Tr’
and therefore it represents a rotation, combined with an alte
ration of length in the ratio of a to 1.
    It must be observed, however, that we have so far only in
terpreted the expression
                          w-H (ix +jy+ k2),
and that we are not at liberty to remove the brackets without
first establishing the associative principle of addition with re
spect to symbols of alteration of length, such as w, and sym
bols of alteration of length combined with quadrantal rotation,
such as iv, &c. But this is very easily done, and as easily for
any rotations as for quadrantal.
   Let ABC be any spherical triangle, and let q, q' represent
the rotations AB, AC. Let a, b, c be numerical quantities.
Then the equations
             (a +&Q) + cq'= a + (bq+ eq')=(a+cq')+bq,
are easily seen to express, that if a parallelepiped be con
structed with three edges coinciding in direction with the radii
drawn to the points A, B, C, and proportional in length re
spectively to a, b, c, then the diagonal of the parallelopiped may
be obtained indifferently by taking the sum of any one of these
edges and the diagonal of the parallelogram constructed on
the other two.
    We have now established” all that is necessary to give de
monstrative force to geometrical conclusions deduced from
algebraical calculation with quaternions. This paper has,
   * The geometrical proof of the distributive property, expressed by such
equations as
                              i(a+jb)=ia-Hkb,
&c., is so easy and obvious, that I leave it to the reader.

 502     On the Geometrical Interpretation of Quaternions.
 however, already extended to such a length, that I will only
 give one simple instance of such reasoning.
    Let ABC be any spherical triangle, and q, q', q" represent
the rotations AB, BC, AC. Then we have, as before ex
plained, q"=q'q. But if we put AB=0, BC=6', and call
l, m, n, l', m', n' the direction cosines of the positive poles of
 AB, BC, then we have seen that
                    q=cos 0+ sin 6(il-Hijm-i-kn),
and q' is similarly composed of accented letters; hence
q'q= cos 6 cos 6'— sin 6 sin 6'(ll'+mm'+nn')
       + i{l sin 6 cos 5'--l'sin 6'cos 64-(m'n-mn") sin 6 sin 6'}
       +j{m sin 6 cos 6'4-m'sin 8' cos 6+ (n'l-nl) sin 6 sin 5'}
       +k{n sin 6 cos 3' +n'sin 5' cos 64-(lm'—lm) sin 6 sin 6'}.
    This is the quaternion symbol of the rotation AC; its first
term therefore expresses cos AC, which agrees with the fun
damental theorem of spherical trigonometry; and the terms
affected by i, j, k are proportional to, and determine, the di
rection cosines of the positive axis of AC. The product qq'
in like manner represents the rotation C'A', if A', C be points
taken in AB, CB produced, so that BA'=AB, BC = CB.
   The reader who is familiar with Sir W. Hamilton’s re
searches on quaternions will observe that these and similar
results, which are here primary, appear in his system of inter
pretation as secondary or polar; and the converse would easily
be shown to be true also. (See particularly Irish Transac
tions, vol. xxi. part # 80–86.) The reason of the differ
ence is apparent. In Sir W. Hamilton's geometrical system,
i, j, k are not symbols of operation, but represent concrete
units, namely, unit lines in fixed directions, so that iv-Hjy+ k2
represents also, not an operation, but a concrete quantity,
namely the radius vector of the point whose coordinates, re
ferred to axes coinciding with the directions of i, j, k, are
a, y, z. The quaternion w-i-ix +jy+kz therefore represents
what may be called a couple, or sum of two heterogeneous quan
tities, namely, an abstract length w, and a directed line
ix-Hjy+ k2. It is therefore not capable of a geometrical in
terpretation. This circumstance, however, as Sir W. Ha
milton has abundantly shown, does not at all interfere with
the use of quaternions in obtaining geometrical results.
   In the system of    £                which has been explained in
this paper, every symbol is regarded as representing an ope
ration; and every term of the quaternion, as well as the whole
expression, has a geometrical interpretation. In fact, a qua

          Mr. R. Phillips on the Electricities of Steam,      503
ternion expresses, in this system, what Sir W. Hamilton has
called a geometrical quotient, or the operation which must be
performed on one directed line to make it coincide in length
and direction with another directed line.        If a, a be two
such lines, l, m, n, l, m, n' their direction cosines, and tº the
arithmetical ratio of the length of a to that of a', then the geo
     •         .   . a .                   - - -
metrical quotient TV is expressed, as it is easy to see, by the
quaternion
  q=g (ll 4-mm +nn'+i(m'n—mn')+j(n'l-n!)+k('m-lm')},
       I
and  # by another quaternion obtained from q by writing "
instead of P. and changing the signs of the three terms affected
by i, j, k. According to this view, since i, j, k are symbols
of operation and not of quantity, there is nothing in the least
strange in their not being commutative symbols, for we are
familiar with non-commutative operations in other parts of
analysis. I am not without a hope that this, with other con
siderations suggested by the preceding investigations, may
tend to obviate any prejudice which may be felt against the
theory of quaternions, as containing something arbitrary,
mysterious, opposed to common notions, and incapable of in
terpretation. I trust it has sufficiently appeared that the
theory may be completely divested of any such characteristics,
At the same time I am far from thinking that they really
apply, in any sense implying an objection, to Sir W. Ha
milton’s mode of considering the subject. On the contrary,
that mode possesses, in my estimation, besides its undoubted
practical utility, the attraction of suggesting a novel and very
interesting subject of inquiry; the properties, namely, of sets
or sums of heterogeneous quantities. This, however, is a topic
upon which I cannot here attempt to enter.

            LXIII. On the Electricities of Steam.
                  By REUBEN PHILLIPs, Esq.
                       [Continued from p. 108.]
94.    A    COMMON laboratory brass tripod stand with
           straight legs was insulated, by putting each leg into
a glass tube previously closed at one end by the blowpipe;
the glass tubes were securely jammed on by means of worsted,
and a small piece of cork was placed in the bottom of
each tube, to prevent the metal bearing on the glass; the

504.     Mr. R. Phillips on the Electricities of Steam,
tubes were varnished externally with a solution of sealing
wax. The longer arm of the tin pipe was placed perpendicu
larly to the horizon, with its mouth upwards; the other arm
of the pipe stood before the brass jet of the boiler (40.), as
formerly (83.). The tripod stand was placed near the tin
pipe, and the fountain (77.) placed upon the tripod. The cock
of the fountain was fitted with a straight glass tube, except
that near its upper end the glass tube was bent twice at a
right angle in the same plane; this end of the glass tube held
a brass jet, through which the water was projected downwards
about the axis of the long arm of the tin pipe. The distance
of the brass jet of the fountain, from the nearest part of the
tin pipe, was 11 inches; and the diameter of the aperture of
the brass jet of the fountain was #5 inch.
   95. The fountain was now electrically connected with the
ground, and the tin pipe with the single-leaf electrometer. The
cock of the fountain was opened a little, so that the water was
discharged from the jet by some low pressure, perhaps equal
to 6 or 10 vertical feet of water; a positive charge was com
municated to the electrometer.     The cock of the boiler was
now opened so as to make the boiler positive; a great increase
of positive electricity was immediately given to the tin pipe,
the gold-leaf being kept in contact with, or rapidly striking
the conducting plate of the electrometer; and this effect con
tinued without diminution so long as the supply of steam
and water was maintained.      This result is identical with that
previously obtained (84.).
   96. The fountain was now insulated; the cock of the foun
tain being opened as before, the positive charge, which at first
was freely given to the electrometer, soon became very feeble
(it could be immediately renewed by touching the fountain):
then opening the boiler as before, a quantity of positive elec
tricity passed through the electrometer; presently this effect
also ceased, and then the electrometer generally began slowly
to discharge itself of negative electricity. The steam was
now shut off; then, as soon as the steam began to leave the
tin pipe, the gold-leaf commenced rapidly striking the con
ducting plate with negative electricity; in a few seconds this
negative charge was exhausted.
   97. The negative electricity which the instrument slowly
acquired in this experiment, after the positive effect was over
and while the steam was passing, was no doubt merely the
negative electricity collected from the steam (81.).
   98. The fountain and tin pipe were now electrically united;
on opening the cock of the fountain as formerly, no electricity
was produced; and when the steam was sent through the tin

          Mr. R. Phillips on the Electricities of Steam.     505
pipe, the negative charge collected from the steam was the
only electrical effect observed.
    99. During the above experiments the boiler was uninsu
lated, and it was examined at each experiment to be quite
certain that the issue of steam communicated positive electri
city to the boiler; this was, however, a needless precaution.
These results have been obtained with very different pressures
in the boiler, up to 40 lbs. on the inch. The statement (48.),
that at 40 lbs. on the inch the boiler is positive at a certain
pressure, and negative at lower, is an error, into which I fell
probably through not being aware of the influence of water
(74. 114.). Although I experienced considerable difficulty at
first, I can, now that the conditions are better known, make
the boiler positive with the same precision, whether the pres
sure in the boiler is 6 or 40 lbs. on the inch.
    100. I have sometimes observed the electricity of the water
as it issued from the fountain to be negative; at such times the
electricity apparently given by the steam in the tin pipe, was
negative when the steam was turned on, and positive when it
was shut off, the general arrangement of the apparatus being
as before.
     101. The following is, I think, the explanation of these
 results:—When the fountain is insulated and a current of elec
 trified water is passing from the jet, the fountain soon takes
 its maximum electric charge, the issuing stream of water being
 oppositely electrified; and the electric difference between the
 water and the brass jet being so great, that the electricity
 generated by the friction runs back again through the water
 to the brass jet. If now a medium possessing greater induc
 tive capacity than air be made to surround the stream of
 water, the electric difference between the issuing water and
 the brass jet is diminished, and electricity is again carried
 forward by the water; and the same quantity of opposite elec
 tricity is accumulated on the brass fountain. When air is
 again made to surround the jet of water, the excess of electri
 city which the former medium had caused to be accumulated
 on the fountain, passes off by the jet of water. I thus come
 to the conclusion that the specific inductive capacity of the
 steam-cloud is much greater than air. It is now necessary to
 separate these experiments with the fountain from those of
 the electricity of condensation.
     102. The hole in the bung was reduced to a circular aper
 ture, 6 inch diameter, and    the distance of the aperture from
 the end of the brass jet of the boiler was 1.6 inch, every
 thing else being as before (95.). The positive electricity when
 the steam was turned on, and the negative when it was shut

506       Mr. R. Phillips on the Electricities of Steam.
off, were much diminished. The negative electricity collected
from the steam (97.) remained unaltered.
   103. The hole in the bung was again reduced to a circle
“4 inch diameter; the distance of the hole from the brass jet
of the boiler was 1:2 inch. When the boiler was opened
as usual, the only electrical effect I could certainly recognize
was the negative electricity of the steam, which remained just
as before.
   104. It follows, from the foregoing, that it is the steam
cloud, and not the steam, which possesses the large capacity for
induction. Indeed as much might have been inferred from
the fact discovered by Dr. Faraday, that gaseous bodies have
but one, or nearly one inductive capacity.
   105. The glass tube was taken from the fountain, and the
brass jet of the fountain was removed from the glass tube,
and united to the cock of the fountain so that the stream of
water might issue horizontally; the fountain being set on the
tripod stand as in former experiments. One end of a stout
piece of copper wire was flattened out, and the other end was
attached to a glass tube to insulate the copper. The flattened
end stood in the path of the jet of water which struck one of
the flat surfaces perpendicularly; the distance between the
part of the copper which was struck by the water, and the
end of the brass jet of the fountain, was 12 inches. The cop
per wire and the fountain both communicated with the single
leaf electrometer. In the experiments to be described, the
water should not be discharged from under a much lower
pressure than 3 or 4 atmospheres, and a higher pressure is
better.
   106. The fountain being now opened and the water con
sequently dashed against the copper plane, the electrometer
was electrified negatively; the charge was feeble, and could
scarcely hold the gold-leaf midway between the two plates.
The surface of the copper on which the water struck, was
cleaned with sand-paper, but the electrical effects did not
Wal'W.
   £7. The long arm of the tin pipe was placed horizontally
with the short arm pointing to the zenith, and without dis
turbing the former arrangement, the long arm of the tin pipe
was brought before the jet of the fountain, so that the stream
of water might pass axially along it; and the flattened end of
the copper wire occupied about the axis of the shorter limb
of the tin pipe. The fountain, the tin pipe and copper wire
were united to the single-leaf electrometer. The fountain
now being opened, plenty of positive electricity went to the
electrometer, which must have been collected by the tin pipe

          Mr. R. Phillips on the Electricities of Steam.     507
£ the mist.        The gold-leaf readily struck the conducting
plate.
   108. The copper wire was removed from the tin pipe, the
water consequently now struck against the inside of the short
arm of the tin pipe, the fountain and tin pipe were connected
with the single-leaf electrometer; the positive electricity re
mained as before.
   109. The jet of water was made to strike against the out
side of the tin pipe, everything else as in the last experiment.
The electricity was now negative, and rather stronger than in
the similar experiment with the copper wire.
   110. The arrangement (107.) was restored with this ex
ception, that hot water was placed in the fountain, which was
then made to boil by a spirit-lamp; the air was then thrown
in until the resistance offered to the piston of the syringe was
about the same as with cold water.       When the fountain was
opened, the positive electricity was perhaps three times more
abundant than before.
   111. The tin pipe was removed, giving the same arrange
ment as (105.); the negative electricity remained as with cold
Water.
   112. In the foregoing experiments, in which cold water was
used, care was taken to have it as near the temperature of
the air of the room as it could be well brought. When the
discharged water was about 9° F. colder than the air in
which the experiments were conducted, the quantity of elec
tricity remained sensibly the same as with water of the tem
perature of the air.
   113. In these experiments, the apparent excess of positive
electricity must have been generated after the water left the
metal against which it had been dashed and reduced to a great
extent to mist. The similarity between these experiments
with the fountain, and that species of electrical excitation
which for the sake of distinction I call for the present the
electricity of condensation, is very perfect.
   114. A gun-metal elbow-piece was screwed into the Arm
strong's condenser, which was dry, and the brass jet (40.) by
its appropriate connecting pieces was screwed into the elbow
piece and made an angle of about 55° with the horizon. When
the cock of the boiler was partially opened so as to allow
steam to escape with sufficient force, the boiler became strongly
positive; the brass jet was now unscrewed from the connect
#    piece, the steam fully turned on for a few seconds, shut
off, the brass jet restored, then the steam being allowed to
escape as in the first instance, it was found to leave the boiler
neutral for about the first half-minute.    When the water was

 508       Mr. R. Phillips on the Electricities of Steam.
 not blown out of the steam passages, it took about 8 seconds
 from the time the steam was first turned on to make the gold
 leaf strike the conducting plate of the electrometer, the steam
 being as nearly as possible of the same pressure at the jet in
 both cases. These results were constantly obtained; from
 which I conclude, that water as well as steam is necessary to
 render the boiler positive. It is perhaps proper to remark,
 that the elbow-piece used in this experiment was not made
 for the purpose, but to receive an Armstrong's jet. Also I
 have succeeded in producing the foregoing electrical effect
 without the intervention of the elbow-piece.
    115. Water was placed in the condenser, and the Arm
 strong's jet screwed into its place in the condenser; the
 steam easily rendered the boiler positive, but this jet was by
 no means a good exciter of this species of electricity. I have
 also made the boiler positive with discharging passages of
 lead, pewter, glass, cane, quill, and variously shaped brass
 orifices; the best was perhaps the cane, which was about #
 inch long.
    116. The condenser was dried, and a piece of cane of a
 length and size sufficient to fill about £rd of the bore of the
 pipe of the condenser, which was about 8 inches long and
 ‘55 inch diameter, was well soaked in a solution consisting of
 1 hydrate of soda and 12 water, and placed in the pipe of the
 condenser; then the brass jet was screwed into its place. It
was found the boiler could be made positive at the lower
pressures as easily as with pure water, although the fluid
which escaped felt strongly alkaline. The boiler could not
be rendered negative, but was neutral at the higher pressures,
as Dr. Faraday had previously discovered.
    117. The larger collector (46.) was held in the steam at
distances varying from 9 to 24 inches; it received a powerful
positive charge of the electricity of condensation; but this
effect soon ceased, being dependent, as before observed, on a
considerable quantity of moisture escaping with the steam.
The boiler was found to be neutral both before and after such
experiments. These experiments were made by discharging
the steam at various pressures from 6 to perhaps 20 lbs. on
the inch. It was necessary occasionally to renew the solution
of soda in the pores of the cane.
    118. A cylindrical piece of cane divested of its siliceous
covering, 6 inches long and #5 inch diameter, was soaked in
a concentrated aqueous solution of ammonia, and placed in
the pipe of the condenser. The boiler could be made posi
tive as easily as with pure water.
   119. The last-mentioned piece of cane was dried and soaked

         Mr. R. Phillips on the Electricities of Steam.                 509
in a solution of acetate of ammonia, made by adding an excess
of the solution of ammonia to a concentrated solution of acetic
acid. The cane being again placed in the pipe of the con
denser, and the boiler opened, the positive state of the boiler
was found unaltered.
   120. When two bodies are rubbed together to produce
machine electricity, it is not necessary that both of them
should be bad conductors, it is enough to have one surface in
that condition. If, therefore, the electricity which renders
the boiler positive and the steam negative, is produced by
the friction of the steam on the wetted surface of the orifice
of the jet, then we see why increasing the conducting power
of the water does not prevent the production of this electricity.
I think this is the only interpretation the experiments will be
found to bear.
   121. A piece of cane, about the same size as the former
pieces, and saturated with turpentine, was placed in the pipe
of the condenser. When the cock was opened a little, the
boiler was positive; and the positive effect was much stronger
than I ever before observed in the similar experiments without
turpentine.
   122. The steam was now raised to perhaps 15 lbs. on the
inch, and the cock fully opened; the larger collector being
held as usual. in the steam, received a very powerful positive
charge as measured by the single-leaf electrometer, and the
boiler was at the same time strongly positive to the two
leaved electrometer*.     I also rendered the steam and boiler
both positive at pressures greatly below 6 lbs. on the inch.
   123. A pewter tube, 9 inches long and #5 inch internal
diameter, had one end attached to the pipe of the condenser,
the brass jet (40.) being screwed into the other end. A slip
of cane about 7 inches long was placed in the pewter tube,
and so thick as to fill up about $ the space of the pewter tube
in which it lay.    The boiler could be rendered positive as
when the jet was screwed into the condenser. The pipe of
the condenser, connecting pieces, &c. were of course quite
clean.
   124. A piece of cane similar to that last mentioned was
dipped into olive oil and substituted for the former piece in
the pewter tube. On allowing the steam to issue, I observed
in many experiments a decided diminution in the quantity of
positive electricity given to the boiler by the friction of the
steam in the jet; in other experiments I could not perceive
any effect produced by the oil. The diminished effect was
especially remarked after the steam had been issuing for some
time, and most of the oil had been thus blown out.
  * See Faraday's Researches in Electricity, vol. ii. p. 116, and following.

510       Mr. R. Phillips on the Electricities of Steam.
   125. A piece of cane similar to the last was dipped into a
solution of common resin in spirit of wine of the consistence
of rather thin spirit varnish; the cane was partly dried and
used as in the foregoing experiment with oil. The electrical
results were similar to those obtained with the oil.         I em
ployed the pewter tube in the experiments with oil and resin,
not knowing what trouble I might have in thoroughly re
moving such substances from the pipe of the condenser so as
to bring the instrument to its normal state.
   126. Having seen reason to conclude that the friction of
steam on the wetted surface of the orifice from which it
escapes renders that surface positive and the steam negative,
it may be about as safely assumed that when water gives up
its motion to air, the water becomes positive and the air ne
gative, which I take at present to be the explanation of such
experiments as (107.); further, when hot water is used, the
specific inductive capacity of the steam-cloud enables the water
and air to take a higher charge, just as it did the brass and
water in the experiments with the fountain (84, &c.). The
experiments (107, 108.) are so similar to those with the jet of
steam (56, &c.), that I cannot but recur to the theory before
mentioned (65.) as the explanation of the cause of the elec
tricity of condensation. In such experiments as (47, 89.),
where no condensation occurs, but a check is only given to
the motion of the steam, I suppose the particles of water,
which are discharged with the steam in giving up their mo
tion to the steam, and perhaps when they derive their motion
from the steam, become positive and the steam negative; part
of these particles strike on the tube, and are incorporated with
the stratum of moisture, rendering the tube positive, while the
remainder take the negative charge from the steam, and in
some measure pass out of the tube. Some electricity must
also be simultaneously developed by the friction of the steam
on the wetted glass.
   127. I think it probable that the magnetism of steam, and
thermo-electricity generally, may be occasioned by friction,
the condensation in the case of steam being only effective in
producing friction; for it is not difficult to imagine, that when
a current of particles of steam strike against a tube and are
condensed, or strike against cold air, that the friction must be
of a much more violent nature than when no condensation
occurs. I intend to return to this so soon as I have finished
some experiments I have in hand bearing on the subject.
   128. According to these views, we have that electricity of
steam which is so abundantly afforded by Mr. Armstrong's jet,
produced by the friction of particles of water against the dis
charging orifice (Faraday); that electricity produced in such

     Dr. Andrews's Report on the Heat of Combination.                  511
 experiments as (71, &c.), occasioned by the friction of steam
on water held by cohesion to the surface of the discharging
 orifice; and that, called the electricity of condensation, pro
 duced by the resistance the particles of water offer to the
 steam, when the steam gives or takes from them motion.
    129. In applying these facts to meteorological phaenomena,
 we have to add wind to condensation to account for electrical
developments; the friction between air and water producing
the electricity, and cloud by its high specific inductive capacity
permitting the charge to be maintained. A sudden abundant
rain can only be produced by about as sudden an intermixture
of masses of the atmosphere, and hence the connexion which
always exists between wind and thunder-showers. The
structure of hail shows that it has been much exposed to
 wind”. In addition to those instances I have already men
tioned in which atmospheric electricity may be explained by
reference to the experimental facts brought forward, one
would expect some electricity to be produced by a fog driving
over a wet surface. I would also suggest, that if a mass of
ice, water, or vapour should ever enter the atmosphere with
great velocity, the steam and friction, together with the cold
ness and rarity of the air in that region, would be very favour
able to the exhibition of electrical meteorous light.

          LXIV. Report on the Heat of Combination.

TH:           are few molecular changes in the condition of matter
       which are not accompanied by the evolution or absorption of
heat. The quantity of heat which is thus set free or absorbed,
bears always a definite relation to the amount of the mechanical or
chemical action, and its determination in each particular case is a
problem of considerable interest as affording a measure of the forces
in action. If we consider the great number of phaenomena, mecha
nical, electrical and chemical, among which the production of heat
forms the only bond of connexion which has hitherto been clearly
ascertained, although there may be strong grounds for suspecting
them to be only modified forms of the action of the same force, the
importance of investigations of this kind to the future progress of
physical science will become at once apparent.
   The object of the present Report is to give a general view of the
actual state of knowledge on the subject of thermo-chemistry, under
which we may conveniently include a description of the thermal

 effects that occur in chemical actions of every kind. A few new
 experiments will be described in their proper places. These will be
 given in some detail, but when referring to experiments alread
 published, all numerical quantities will, as far as possible, be avoided.
    Before entering upon the consideration of chemical combinations
 and decompositions properly so called, it may be useful briefly to
 refer to the thermal changes which accompany solution. The earlier
 experiments on this subject having been made solely with the object
 of discovering frigorific mixtures, do not furnish quantitative mea
 sures of any scientific value. But of late years the inquiry has been
 pursued in a more useful way by Gay Lussac, Thomson, Karsten,
 Chodnew and Graham. The salts examined have been chiefly the
 soluble sulphates, nitrates and chlorides, and the solvents pure Water
 and saline and acid solutions. The principal results of these inves
 £
TIOInS :
            I have endeavoured to express in the following proposi
    1: The solution of a crystallized salt in water is always accom
 panied by an absorption of heat.
    2. If equal weights of the same salt be dissolved in succession in
'    '" liquid, the heat absorbed will be less on each new addition
 Of Salt.
   3. The heat absorbed by the solution of a salt in water holding
 other salts dissolved, is generally less than that absorbed by its solu
 tion in pure water.
    4. The heat absorbed by the solution of a salt in the dilute mineral
acids, is generally greater than that absorbed by its solution in water.
    As the subject is of great extent and the inquiry has hitherto
embraced only a small number of cases of solution, it is not unlikely
that some of these conclusions will require hereafter to be modified.
From some experiments by Graham on the solution of salts belonging
to certain isomorphous groups, there is reason to suspect the exist
ence of a connexion between isomorphism and the absorption of heat
in solution.
   The foregoing remarks apply only to the solution of crystallized
salts. If, however, we take a salt which crystallizes with water and
make it anhydrous before solution, the thermal results will be alto
gether different. The anhydrous salt, when added to an excess of
water, will first combine with its ordinary equivalent of water of cry
stallization, and the new compound will then dissolve. The change
of temperature observed is therefore a complex quantity arising from
the heat of combination due to the union of the anhydrous salt with
water, and the heat absorbed by the solution of the hydrous salt.
From a comparison of the results obtained on dissolving the same
salt in the anhydrous and hydrous states, Graham has endeavoured to
deduce the amount of heat due to the combination of the dry salt with
its water of crystallization. According to his experiments, the sul
phates of water, copper and manganese, disengage the same quantity
of heat in combining with the first atom of water. The sulphates
of magnesia and zinc also disengage equal quantities of heat in their
complete hydration. The same simple relation is not however ob

    Dr. Andrews's Report on the Heat of Combination.                          513
served to hold between the quantities of heat evolved in the com
plete hydration of the first set of salts, or in the combination of the
second set with the first atom of water. Neither does it apply to the
other sulphates of the magnesian series.
   None of the experiments hitherto published furnish all the requi
site data for calculating with precision the absolute quantities of
heat set free or absorbed in these cases of chemical action.                  The
weights of the water and of the salt are given, and sometimes the
weight and form of the vessel, and the material of which it is com
posed; but these data are not sufficient to enable us to deduce the
true numbers from the observed increments or decrements of tem
perature. Knowing the weight and composition of the containing
vessel, we may, it is true, calculate its thermal value in water. But
other corrections, such as those for the heating and cooling influ
ence of the surrounding air, can only be ascertained by special
experiments performed under similar conditions to the original ob
servations. Neither have any experiments of sufficient accuracy
been made to determine the specific heats of the solutions formed.
   To complete an investigation which would furnish all these ele
ments, would be a work of very great labour, and will probably
scarcely be undertaken till our instruments and means of observation
are greatly improved. As a first step to such an inquiry, I may here
describe a few preliminary experiments on the specific heats of some
saline solutions, and on the quantities of heat absorbed in the solu
tion of successive portions of the same salt,
   To obtain results approaching to accuracy in experiments on the
specific heats of saline solutions is extremely difficult, as the errors
of experiment are often of nearly the same order of magnitude as
the whole differences to be observed. The corrections for the cooling
and heating action of the air and for the effects of radiation, cannot
be estimated with any certainty by the application of general for
mulas founded on experiments made at a different time.*; and the
most careful examination of the calibre of the thermometer tube
will fail to render different parts of the scale accurately comparable
with one another to a five-hundredth part. The general method
pursued in the determination of the following specific heats was the
same which I described some years agot ; but to avoid the uncer
tainties just referred to, alternate experiments were made with pure
water and with the solution, under conditions as nearly as possible
identical, and these were repeated till accurate means were ob
tained. By this mode of operating, a very great degree of preci
sion may be given to experiments of this kind.
   The only salts whose solutions have yet been examined are the
nitrate of potash, the nitrate of soda and the chloride of sodium.
  * If the vessel be uncovered, changes in the hygrometric state of the atmosphere
produce a very marked influence on the rate of cooling, when the excess of tempe
rature above the air amounts only to a few degrees; and even in a close apartment
the increased agitation of the air on a windy day sensibly increases the rate of
cooling.

    It is obvious that the specific heat of the solution is, in every in
stance, less than the mean of the specific heats of its component
parts, and that serious errors would be committed, if we should
attempt to calculate on this principle of the thermal values of solu
tions which may be formed in the course of our experiments.
   I have made a short series of experiments on the quantities of
heat absorbed during the solution of nitrate of soda and of nitrate of
potash, when added in successive portions to the same liquid. The
results fully confirm those previously obtained by Graham, but as
the experiments were only preliminary trials to a more extended in
vestigation, it is not necessary to describe them in detail. I may
briefly state, that on dissolving 12'22 grammes of nitrate of soda in
250 grammes of water and repeating the experiment with each new
solution, till the water was nearly saturated, the following decre
ments of temperature were found:—

    Combination of Sulphuric Acid with Water.—In an elaborate
memoir on thermo-chemistry, which was published in Poggendorff's
“Annalen, Hess made the first systematic attempt to reduce the quan
tities of heat disengaged in the formation of the hydrates of sulphuric
acid to definite laws. His experiments were made by two distinct
methods, which however did not give exactly the same results. In
the first or indirect method of operating, equivalent quantities of
SO, SOs HO, SO, 2HO, &c., were respectively mixed with a large
excess of water and the increments of temperature observed in each
case. The difference between the increments observed on mixing
any two compounds with water, was assumed to correspond to
the heat due to the combination of the first compound with the
number of equivalents of water necessary to convert it into the
second. Thus, if SOs HO added to a HO gave a units of heat, and
 SO, 3HO added to the same a HO gave b units, a-b was supposed to
 represent the number of units which would be obtained on combining
 SOs HO and 2HO.           In the second, or direct method, each com
 pound was combined with the quantity of water exactly required to
 convert it into the succeeding compound, and the heat measured
by observing the increment of temperature of a determinate quantity
 of water surrounding the vessel in which the combination took place.
 These experiments have since been repeated by Graham, Abria, and
Fabre and Silbermann, but their results do not generally agree with
the statements of Hess.
    The fundamental principle laid down by the latter is, that there
 exists a simple relation between the numbers which express the
 quantities of heat set free in the formation of the successive hydrates
of sulphuric acid. If we designate by 2 a the heat disengaged in the
 combination of SOs HO with HO, then, according to Hess, the heat
 set free in the formation of the other hydrates will be

   In an early part of his memoir, Hess gives 38.85 for the value
of a, but this he afterwards changes to 4694, still maintaining how
ever the accuracy of the ratios. It is difficult to see how this can
be correct. The only experiment described by Hess on the combi
nation of the anhydrous acid with water gave the number 305, which
bears to 46-94, not the ratio of 8: 2, but nearly that of 6.5 to 2.
Abria obtained a still lower number for the combination SOs with
HO. There can therefore be little doubt, if the experiments may be
relied on, that the first ratio is too high. It remains to be seen how
far the others have been confirmed by subsequent investigations.
   The multipliers of a for the three latter combinations given in the
preceding table are, according to Graham's experiments, 0.72, 1:35
and 1:18. These numbers agree with Hess's statement only so far
as to indicate that the heat evolved in the combination of SOs HO
with HO is nearly the same as that evolved in the combination of
SOs 2HO with 4HO.
   The experiments of Abria were performed by the direct method
and with a similar apparatus to that employed by Hess. Adopting
the views of Hess as to the quantities of heat in the cases of combi
nation being in simple relations to one another, he arrives nevertheless
at very different numbers for the ratios. In the next table I have
given Abria's theoretical whole numbers, as also the exact numbers
which result from his experiments.
                                      Theory.                Experiment.
             SOs +HO . . . . . . . .    6a     . . .... ..      6-02a:
             SOs HO-H-HO . . . .         2a    .. . ... . .     2:00a
             SO, 2HO+HO. . . .            a    . . . ... . .    0.95a

            SOs 5HO+HO . . . .          #a . . . . . . . .      0.22a
  In the three latter cases, the simple relations in the second co
lumn are scarcely borne out by the experimental numbers. The
only agreement with the ratios given by Hess is in the combination
SOs 2HO with HO, which, according to both experimenters, sets
free exactly half as much heat as the combination SO, HO with HO.
The value of a, given by Abria, is 39-33.
   The latest experiments on this subject are those of Fabre and Sil
bermann, from which I have calculated the following multipliers
for a :
                SOs HO-H HO. .      .... .   .. ..      2:00a
                SOs 2HO+HO          .... ..   ....      0-93a

                SOs 5HO+HO . . . . . . . . . . 0.26a
   Hess has also attempted to express by simple multiple relations
the quantities of heat disengaged in the formation of the hydrates
of nitric acid, but for the details of his results I must refer to the
original memoir.
   Combination of Acids and Bases.—In the same memoir Hess de

518       Dr. Andrews's Report on the Heat of Combination.
scribes an extensive set of experiments on the heat evolved during
the union of certain bases with acids of different degrees of concen
tration. These experiments serve to illustrate the general principle,
that in the formation of a chemical compound the heat developed
is a constant quantity, being the same in amount, whether the
combination takes place directly at one time or indirectly at re
peated times. Thus he finds that on neutralizing an aqueous solu
tion of ammonia with sulphuric acid, containing one, two, three and
six atoms of water, there is a different development of heat in each
case; but by adding to the results found by experiment in the three
latter cases the quantities of heat due to the combination of the
monohydrated acid, with one, two and five atoms of water respect
ively, the same number is obtained in each case as in the direct
combination of the monohydrated acid itself. This principle is
correct, but it is almost self-evident and scarcely required so ela
borate a proof.
   The bases examined by Hess were potash, soda, ammonia and lime,
which he combined in different ways with the sulphuric, nitric and
hydrochloric acids. The conclusion at which he arrives is, that the
same acid in combining with equivalents of different bases produces
the same quantity of heat, but at the same time he expresses some
doubt as to the applicability of this principle to all similar cases of
combination. Indeed his own experiments with lime and ammonia
do not accurately agree with it; I refer particularly to his experi
ments with ammonia, which, when properly interpreted, appear to
me to prove clearly that that base in combining with acids developes
less heat than potash or soda, although I am aware that Hess himself
has drawn from them a different conclusion.
   About the time of the publication of the first part of Hess's me
moir, I had completed an investigation of the same subject, but instead
of employing strong solutions of the acids and bases, I diluted all the
liquids largely with water previous to examining their thermal reac
tions. In this way I hoped to avoid the complex effects that arise
when successive combinations and decompositions of different kinds
occur in the same chemical action, and the result fully realized my
anticipations. The general conclusion deduced from this investi
gation may be briefly expressed, by stating that the heat developed
during the union of acids and bases is determined by the base and
not by the acid. The following special laws will be found to com
prehend the greater number of cases of chemical action to which
the foregoing principle can be made to apply.
   1. An equivalent of the same base, combined with different acids,
produces nearly the same quantity of heat.
   2. An equivalent of the same acid, combined with different bases,
produces different quantities of heat.
   3. When a neutral salt is converted into an acid salt by combi
ning with one or more equivalents of acid, no disengagement of heat
OCCull'S.
   4. When a double salt is formed by the union of two neutral salts,
no disengagement of heat occurs.

     Dr. Andrews's Report on the Heat of Combination.                  519
   5. When a neutral salt is converted into a basic salt, the com
bination is accompanied by the disengagement of heat.
   6. When one and the same base displaces another from any of its
neutral combinations, the heat evolved or absorbed is always the
same whatever the acid element may be.
   As some of the bases (potash, soda, barytes and strontia) form
what we may perhaps designate an isothermal group, such bases
will develope the same, or nearly the same heat in combining with
an acid, and no heat will be developed during their mutual displace
ments.
   These laws are not intended to embrace the thermal changes
which occur during the conversion of an anhydrous acid and base
into a crystalline compound. The steps by which such a conversion
is effected are generally very complicated, and involve successive
combinations and decompositions. We cannot combine, at ordinary
temperatures, a dry acid and a dry base; and when combination
takes place in presence of water, hydrates of the acid and base are
first formed, which are afterwards decomposed, and the crystalline
salt finally obtained is sometimes anhydrous, sometimes combined
with water. To expect simple results where so many different ac
tions must produce each its proper thermal effect, would be alto
gether vain, and to introduce the consideration of some of these
actions without the whole would only render the numbers empirical.
In the experiments from which the foregoing laws were deduced, the
acids and bases before combination, and the compounds after com
bination, were as nearly as possible in the same physical state. The
only change which occurred was the combination of the acid and
base, and the heat evolved must therefore have arisen from the act
of combination. Such changes of temperature as are produced by
solution are not in any way concerned in producing these thermal
effects, as none of the reacting bodies assumed at any time the solid
state. The insoluble bases form, it is true, an unavoidable exception
to this statement, and in the experiments with them, the results
would require to be corrected for the heat due to the change of the
base from the solid to the fluid state.    As this correction, however,
although unknown, must be a constant quantity for the same base,
it would not, if applied, interfere with the direct proof of the first law.
   In an inquiry of this kind, it is important, while endeavouring to
generalize the results of experiment, to point out at the same time
the differences which occur in particular cases between those results
and the numbers deduced from the theory. In the whole range of
the science of heat, scarcely a single general principle has yet been
discovered which is strictly in accordance with all the results of
experiment; and from the application of improved methods of expe
rimenting, discrepancies of this kind have of late years been found
to exist where they had not before been suspected.
   In the original experiments from which the first of the foregoing
laws was deduced, the mean heat developed by the nitric, phosphoric,
arsenic, hydrochloric, hydriodic, boracic, chromic and oxalic acids
being 6°61, the greatest deviation from the mean on either side

520 Dr. Andrews's Report on the Heat of Combination.
amounted only to 0°-15; and a similar remark may be made with
respect to the combinations of soda, barytes and ammonia. On the
other hand, sulphuric acid disengaged about 0°7 more than the mean
quantity, and the citric, tartaric and succinic acids about 0°5 less.
To ascertain whether these discrepancies depended on the state of
dilution of the solutions, I repeated these experiments lately with solu
tions of only half the strength, but although only half the heat was
obtained, similar differences were still found to exist.   If, instead of
taking just the quantity of sulphuric acid required to neutralize the
base, we employ a large excess, the heat given out during combina
tion will be nearly 0°2 less, which reduces the anomaly presented
by this acid to about 0°5. The sulphurous acid not having been
formerly examined, I have lately made some experiments on its ther
mal relations to the bases, the results of which are very interesting.
Although one of the feeblest acids, it agrees almost exactly with sul
phuric acid in the heat developed by its combination with potash.
In several carefully conducted experiments the increments of tem
perature did not differ more than 0°.05. Combining this with the
fact that acids differing so much in composition and properties as the
nitric, boracic and oxalic, also disengage almost exactly the same
amount of heat in the act of combination, there will, I conceive,
be little hesitation in attributing the deviations already mentioned
to the influence of extraneous causes, and in acknowledging the truth
of the principle, that the heat of combination depends upon the neu
tralization or combination of the base, and not upon the nature of
the acid by which the base is neutralized. That other causes of
change of temperature, of feeble power, do actually exist, may be
proved by the following fact. If we add an excess of sulphuric
acid to the neutral solution after combination has taken place, a
slight fall of temperature, amounting to about 0°-1, will occur; if
we make the same experiment with sulphurous acid, an increase of
temperature of about equal amount will be observed, while with
oxalic acid there will be no thermal change of any kind. Now it
is very probable that the same causes which produce these slight
thermal effects are in operation during the original combination of
the acid and base, and if so, they would introduce anomalies into the
quantities of heat then developed.
    There is one important condition, which, as far as my investiga
tions extend, requires to be fulfilled in order that the first law may
hold good; viz. the acid must have the power of neutralizing the
alkaline reaction of the bases. It is for this reason that the hy
drocyanic, carbonic and arsenious acids do not develope the same
quantity of heat in combining with potash as the other acids. The
sparing solubility of the arsenious acid in water prevents an accu
rate examination of its thermal reactions; but on repeated trials
 I obtained 0°25 F., on combining with it the same quantity of pot
ash, which under similar conditions gave 0°-34 with nitric acid.
Although a considerable excess of arsenious acid was taken, as
proved by the fact that further additions produced no new deve
lopment of heat, the solution still exhibited an alkaline reaction.

     Dr. Andrews's Report on the Heat of Combination. 521
The same is also well known to be true of the hydrocyanic and car
bonic acids. In the case of bases, such as the oxide of copper, whose
salts have all an acid reaction, this criterion will not apply; but
the exceptional acids are so few, and their peculiarities so well
marked, that they give rise to little difficulty in the experimental in
vestigation.
   The quantities of heat developed by different bases in combining
with the same acid are so different, that it is unnecessary to refer
particularly to the proofs of the second law. In this case, neutrali
zing power has no apparent influence on the results, as oxide of silver,
which forms salts neutral to test paper with the strongest acids, is
one of the feeblest bases if measured by its thermal power. It de
velopes, in fact, little more than one-third of the heat which potash
does in combining with the acids.
   The more recent experiments of Graham and of Fabre and Sil
bermann, confirm the accuracy of the facts from which the second
and third laws were deduced, that no heat is developed on mixing
solutions of neutral salts or of a neutral salt and acid *. It is diffi
cult however to obtain, as Graham has remarked, positive proof of
the occurrence of combination, when such solutions are brought into
contact.     Fabre and Silbermann indeed are of opinion that acid salts
cannot exist in the state of solution.
   Double Decompositions.—When solutions of two neutral salts are
mixed and a precipitate formed from their mutual decomposition,
there is always a disengagement of heat, which, though not consi
derable, is perfectly definite in amount. It does not altogether arise
from the components of the precipitate having changed from the
fluid to the solid state—as it is not always the same for the same
precipitate—but it is chiefly connected with the latent heat of the
precipitate. If the latter contains water of crystallization, the heat
given out is much greater than when an anhydrous precipitate is
formed. Experiments of this kind appear at first view to be ex
tremely simple, but it is often difficult to obtain exact results, from
the length of time during which the heat continues to be disengaged,
even when the combination is aided by brisk agitation.
   The precipitation of the salts of barytes and lead by a soluble
sulphate appeared to present favourable conditions for investigation,
and accordingly I made an extensive set of experiments with these
classes of salts. This is indeed the only part of the inquiry which I
have been able to complete. A few other examples of double de
composition will however be noticed.
    Chloride of Barium and Sulphate of Magnesia.—Of chloride of
barium carefully purified and dried immediately before the experi
ment at a low red heat, 16.94 grms. were taken in each experiment,
equivalent to 19:00 grms, sulphate of barytes. The weight of sul
phate of magnesia (dry) was 10.3 grms, which is a little more than
   * Slight changes of temperature may however occasionally be detected; but in
some cases a development, in others, an absorption of heat occurs. These thermal
effects evidently arise from causes altogether distinct from those which produce the
 combination of acids and bases.

sufficient to decompose completely the chloride of barium. The en
tire weight of the water employed to dissolve the salts was 234 grms,
of which one-third was taken to dissolve the sulphate of magnesia,
and two-thirds to dissolve the chloride of barium.              The solutions
were contained in vessels of thin copper, the smaller of which, when
filled with its solution, floated in the larger, and could be rapidly
rotated, so as to produce in a short time a perfect equilibrium of
temperature throughout the whole apparatus. The thermometer
attained a maximum about 8' after the solutions were mixed.               I have
elsewhere indicated the precautions to be taken in such experiments,
and shall therefore not refer to them here. In the following state

sulphate of lead took place with the same facility as that of the sul
phate of barytes, the thermometer attaining the maximum in eight
minutes.

was pure and in crystals, 4.17 grms, precipitated by oxalate of ammonia
gave 2.454 grims, oxide of lead, which exactly agrees with the theo

    In the last experiment the precipitation was so slow that the ther
 mometer did not attain the highest point for thirteen minutes after
the solutions were mixed.
    When the salts of lead are precipitated by a neutral oxalate, the
 heat disengaged is much greater than when they are precipitated by
 a sulphate.    I have not examined in detail the increments of tem
 perature in this class of precipitations, but in one experiment, in
 which the acetate of lead was precipitated by the oxalate of potash,
 36.2 units of heat were obtained for each gramme of oxalate of lead.

   These experiments can only be regarded as introductory to an
extended and interesting subject of inquiry. With such limited data,
it would be premature to attempt to draw any general inferences.
   Solution of Metals in Nitric Acid.—Every chemist is familiar
with the violent action of nitric acid on zinc and copper, and the
abundant evolution of gas which accompanies it. But the facility
with which the gases may be condensed by the acid solution is
probably not so generally known, and when the experiment is made
for the first time cannot fail to excite surprise.             If a small vessel of
thin German glass, of about the capacity of half a fluid ounce, be
half-filled with nitric acid of density 14, and a slip of zinc be sus
pended in the upper part so as not to touch the acid, the flask her
metically sealed, and finally inverted while surrounded with cold
water, a very violent action will occur, but without bursting the ves
sel. Having ascertained these facts, there was little difficulty in
measuring the heat disengaged during the solution of the metals in
nitric acid. The metal was weighed in a glass tube open at one end,
which was introduced into a thin glass vessel containing nitric acid
of specific gravity 1.4. The latter was then carefully closed and
introduced into a copper vessel filled with water, and suspended in a
metallic cylinder which was capable of rotation. On inverting the
apparatus, the metal and acid came into contact, and the solution
was completed in a few seconds. The rotation was afterwards con
tinued for five minutes, which was sufficient to diffuse the heat dis
engaged through every part of the calorimeter.

   I made several attempts to determine the amount of heat disen
gaged in the solution of iron in nitric acid, but although acids of
different strengths were employed, I was unable to obtain satisfactory
results, as the iron always assumed the passive state before a suffi
cient quantity was dissolved to raise the temperature of the water
in the calorimeter through 1°. Silver, bismuth and other metals
were also tried, but the solution did not proceed with sufficient
energy.
   The numbers 5857 and 2578 obtained above, are very nearly in
the same ratio as 5366 and 2394, which, according to my experiments
(and their results differ little from those of Dulong), express the
quantities of heat set free by the combustion of zinc and copper in
oxygen gas. This shows clearly that the oxidation of the metals is
the principal cause of the heat produced during their solution in
nitric acid.   Other causes of thermal change however exist, which
must exercise a considerable influence.           Such are the combinations
of the oxide with the nitric acid, the separation of the elements of
a portion of the nitric acid during the solution, and the condensation
of the oxygen gas during the combustion. From these and other

     Dr. Andrews's Report on the Heat of Combination.                527
 circumstances, it is not unlikely that the numbers expressing the
 quantities of heat disengaged in these reactions will not be found in
all other cases to be so nearly in the same ratio as in the foregoing
examples; but it may be presumed that the general results will be
the same, and that those metals which produce a greater amount
of heat by their combustion in oxygen will also produce a greater
amount of heat when dissolving in nitric acid.
    The heat produced by the solution of copper in nitromuriatic
 acid is, according to the result of a single trial, about #th less than
that produced by its solution in nitric acid.
   Metallic substitutions.—I have lately treated this part of the sub
ject at so great length in a paper published in the Philosophical
Transactions, that I shall here only transcribe the general result of
the investigation. It is thus expressed:—“When an equivalent of
one and the same metal replaces another in a solution of any of its
salts of the same order, the heat developed is always the same; but
a change in either of the metals produces a different development of
heat.” This is evidently an analogous law to that already stated
for the thermal changes which accompany basic substitutions. The
numerical results are however entirely different in their details.
   Combustions in Oxygen Gas.—Since the time when Lavoisier
published his celebrated experiments on the heat produced by com
bustion, the subject has frequently engaged the attention of chemists.
But few results were obtained of any scientific value, till the post
humous publication of Dulong's valuable researches, which have
formed the basis of all subsequent inquiries. More recently, Grassi
and Fabre and Silbermann have examined the same subject, and I
have myself lately published a set of experiments upon it, which
were made some years ago. With the exception of some of Grassi's
results, the numbers obtained by the different experimenters agree
very nearly with each other, and we may therefore consider the
quantities of heat developed by the combination of oxygen with the
more important simple bodies and with some of their compounds to
be determined with considerable precision. Fabre and Silbermann
have also examined the combustion of carbon in the protoxide of
nitrogen.    A tabular view of nearly all the numerical results hitherto
obtained, will be found in the edition of Gmelin's Hand-book of Che
mistry recently published by the Cavendish Society. I shall here
therefore confine myself to a few general observations.
   The following bodies in their ordinary physical states, viz. hy
drogen, carbonic oxide, cyanogen, iron, tin and antimony, disen
gage nearly the same amount of heat in combining with an equal
volume of oxygen. The numbers which express the heat of com
bination in these cases do not in fact differ from one another more
than #5th part of the whole quantity,—a difference which is nearly
within the limit of the errors of experiment. This observation ap
plies only to the quantities of heat actually obtained by experiment.
But if we apply corrections for the heat due to the changes of phy
sical state which occur in some of these reactions, the same agree
ment will no longer be observed. Thus in the combustion of car

528       Dr. Andrews's Report on the Heat of Combination.
bonic oxide, the resulting compound is obtained in the gaseous state,
while in the combustion of hydrogen it is condensed during the
course of the experiment into a liquid; and if, from the entire quan
tity of heat evolved in the latter case, we deduct that arising from
the condensation of the vapour of water, the result will no longer
agree with the quantity of heat obtained in the former case. Pro
toxide of tin may probably be added to the foregoing list, and perhaps
also phosphorus, which disengages however a little more heat than
the other bodies.
    Sulphur, copper and the protoxide of copper, disengage, during
their combustion in oxygen gas, a little more than half the quantity
of heat evolved by the preceding class of bodies. Carbon occupies
an intermediate position, while zinc gives out a larger quantity of
heat than any of the bodies already enumerated; and potassium a
still larger quantity than zinc. The combustion of a large number
of carbo-hydrogens, alcohols, aethers and organic acids has been ex
amined by Fabre and Silbermann. Their results prove the opinion
to be erroneous, that if we subtract the oxygen in the form of water,
the remaining elements give the same amount of heat as in the free
State.
   In the reduction of oxide of iron by hydrogen gas, no perceptible
evolution of heat occurs, while in the reduction of the oxide of
copper by the same gas, it is well known that ignition takes place,
unless the experiment is conducted very slowly. These phaenomena
are at once explained by the fact, that in combining with oxygen,
hydrogen gas disengages nearly the same quantity of heat as iron,
and twice as much heat as copper.
    Fabre and Silbermann have observed that the heat of combustion
is influenced to a considerable extent by the physical state in which
the combustible exists before combination. According to their ex
periments, carbon in the form of the diamond disengages 7824 units
of heat during its combustion in oxygen gas; in the form of gra
phite 7778 units; and in that of wood-charcoal 8080 units.         Ac
cording to my own experiments and those of Despretz, the combus
tion of wood-charcoal produces only about 7900 units. Fabre and
 Silbermann have also supposed that they were able to detect differ
 ences in the quantities of heat disengaged by sulphur in its differ
ent allotropic states.   The same chemists have also made the re
markable observation, that a much larger quantity of heat is evolved
by the combustion of carbon in the protoxide of nitrogen than in
oxygen gas. From this it should follow that in the separation of
the elements of the protoxide of nitrogen, heat would be set free.
Accordingly, by passing the protoxide of nitrogen through a pla
tina tube heated to redness by burning charcoal in a suitable ap
paratus, it was found that a larger quantity of heat was actually
evolved than could be accounted for by the weight of charcoal
burned.
     Combustions in Chlorine Gas.—Some years ago, I published the
 results of an investigation on the quantities of heat evolved in the
 combination of zinc and iron with chlorine, bromine and iodine;

                Mr. Soane on the Geometry of Boethius.                           529
and I have lately given an account of a set of experiments on the
 combustion of potassium, tin, antimony, mercury, phosphorus and
 copper in chlorine gas. So far as I am aware, the only other expe
riments on this subject are those described by M. Abria on the com
bustion of hydrogen and phosphorus in chlorine. From a com
parison of the results, it appears that in several cases the quantities
 of heat evolved during the combustion of the same metal in oxygen
and chlorine are nearly the same. This observation applies parti
 cularly to the cases of iron, tin and antimony. Zinc however dis
engages a greater quantity of heat with chlorine (6309 units) than
with oxygen (5366 units), and copper nearly twice as much (3805
and 2394 units). Phosphorus, on the contrary, gives less heat with
chlorine than with oxygen (2683 and 4509 units). On comparing
the quantities of heat disengaged by different bodies in combining
with the same volume of chlorine, it will be found that potassium
disengages a larger amount of heat than any other body hitherto
examined, twice as much as zinc, and nearly four times as much as
tin, antimony or copper.
    Combinations of Bromine and Iodine.—The heat disengaged by
the same body in combining with bromine is less than with chlorine,
and with iodine less than with bromine. The greater development
of heat in the case of chlorine is at least partly due to that element
being in the gaseous state before combination. In some early expe
riments, I observed that the quantities of heat developed on con
verting equivalent solutions of the sesquichloride, sesquibromide
and sesquiiodide of iron into the corresponding proto-compounds
were equal. When a solution of protochloride of iron is converted
into sesquichloride by agitation with chlorine gas, a definite disen
gagement of heat occurs, as also in the formation of the sesquibro
mide of iron by the combination of the protobromide and bromine;
but in the corresponding reaction between the protoiodide of iron
and iodine, no change of temperature can be observed.
LXV. On the Connexion of Pope Gerbert with the Geometry
             of Boethius. By GEoRGE SLOANE, Esq.”
   N the editions of Boethius's collective works we find a translation
     of the first four books of Euclid, or rather of the propositions or
enunciations alone.        This treatise is divided into two books, both of
which purport to be a translation of Euclid, although in fact the
first only is such, the second being for the most part a collection of
problems in mensurationt.
   * We avail ourselves of the permission of the Philological Society to transfer this
Paper to our pages from the Journal of their Proceedings, now extending to four
very interesting Volumes: we are also indebted to the Author for the additions and
corrections with which he has favoured us.
   f T. ii. p. 1487–1546. ed. Basil, 1570. Except in one or two instances, which
will be readily distinguished, the references in this paper are to the pages and lines
of the new edition of the Agrimensors, ‘Gromatici Veteres ex recens. C. Lach
manni, Berol., 1848.

   530         Mr. Soane on the connexion of Pope Gerbert
      The so-called translation is followed by a kind of supplement or
   appendix, which in the printed editions bears the title of Boethii
   liber de Geometria, but in the MSS. of Demonstratio Artis Geometrica.
   With the exception of a kind of catechism of geometry and some
  arithmetical observations, which seem to be nothing more than con
  fused extracts from the Arithmetic of Boethius, it contains scarcely
   anything but fragments from Varro, Seneca, and the Agrimensors.
   It begins with an introduction on the origin and value of geometry,
  part of which is to be found in the “Outlines of Geometry and As
  tronomy’ of Cassiodorus, the friend and contemporary of Boethius,
  and the rest is, in the opinion of Blume, a free imitation of a passage
  in Agenus Urbicus*. This introduction is followed by a collection
  of extracts from Frontinus, Balbus, Hyginus, and the Libri Colo
  niarum, on the qualitates agrorum, the controversiae and the limites
  (p. 395–403); to which are subjoined lists of nomina Agrimensorum
  and of lapides finales (p. 403-406).
      If we turn from the printed editions to the MSS. of the Geometry,
  we shall find that they differ exceedingly in their contents, as well
  from the editions as from one another. In the library of Berne, for
  instance, there are two MSS. of the Geometry, divided into five
  books, the first two of which correspond to the appendix, the third
  and fourth to the first, and the fifth to the last of the printed copies.
  In the older of these MSS. t the matter contained from p. 1544 mid.,
  to the end is wanting; and between the fourth and fifth books is
 inserted a piece with the title Altercatio geometricorum de figuris
 numeris et mensuris (p. 407 seq.): the fifth, besides being fuller than
 the editions, contains a fragment, De Mensuris et Jugeribus, which
 is expressly ascribed to Frontinus, but which is partly taken from
 Columella (v. 1–3), and partly from the fragment De Jugeribus Me
 tiundis (p. 354).
     The second Berne MS. has all that is contained in the other,
 and in very nearly the same order. It has, in addition, Frontinus de
 Agrorum Qualitate, with the commentary of Agenus Urbicus (p.1–8);
 an extract from Hyginus de Limitibus Constituendis (p. 182-191);
 and a fragment of Censorinus de Geometria!.
    * “Bei aller Verschiedenheiten im Einzelen, doch in Gedanken und Wen
 dungen einer Stelle des Pseudosimplicius verwandt ist, so dass man sie als eine
 freie Imitation des Leztern bezeichnen könnte.”   Blume, Ueber die Handschriften
 der Agrimensoren, in Rhein. Mus. für Jurispr. vii. p. 229. The two related pas
sages are p. 64, 24–65, 14, and 394, 11–395, 14. I confess I can find no simi
 larity in the two, beyond both containing the praise of geometry.
    + The contents of this MS, which is of the 10th century, are minutely de
scribed by Sinner, Catalogus Codd. MSS. Bibl. Bernensis, p. 292. The title given
to the book in the MSS. is ‘Boetii libri Artis Geometriae et Aritmeticae numero V
ab Euclide translati de Graeco in Latinum.'
    # Sinner, l.c. p. 292. In the library of Trinity College, Cambridge, there is a
MS. of Boethius's Geometry, the contents of which are very similar to, if not iden
tical with, those of the second Berne MS.    The loss of some papers prevents me
from giving a more detailed account of it. It does not agree with any of the MSS.,
the readings of which are given by Lachman, in the order of the Nomina Agri
mensorum, unless, indeed, there is, as I suspect to be the case, a misprint as to the
order of the Munich MSS.(m), with which it agrees in reading Claudii and Augustini.
It is also fuller in the Nomina Lapidum. The MS. which is probably of the

                     with the Geometry of Boethius.                            531
   There are again other MSS. which do not contain so much as the
printed copies. Such are the Harleian, Lansdowne, and Arundel
MSS. in the British Museum, none of which have the appendix".
   The Harleian and Arundel MSS. coincide in their contents with the
editions down to the beginning of the Demonstratio, or Appendix, that
is, nearly the foot of p. 1536. Immediately after the table in that
page, there are a few lines which have never been published in the ori
ginal Latin, and the existence of which was unknown until M. Chasles
gave a French translation of a portion, in his “Aperçu sur l’Histoire de
Géométrie, from a MS. belonging to the town of Chartrest. At
the end of this passage the Harleian has the words epilogus finitur :
and then follows in both this sentence—“Si quis vero de contro
versiis, et de qualitatibus et nominibus agrorum, deque limitibus, et
de statibus controversiarum scire desideret, Julium Frontinum necnon
Urbicum Agenum lectitet. Nos vero haec ad praesens dixisse sufficiat.”
    Here the Arundel MS. ends, but in the Harleian we find what is
a meagre abstract of Balbus, followed by a collection of geometrical
and arithmetical problems, which are taken, in part at least, from
Nipsus, Epaphroditus and Vitruvius!.
   Such and so varied are the contents of the different MSS.                   We
have now to inquire whether any and what part is to be attributed
to their reputed author.
   The opinion of Niebuhr on the authorship of this treatise is to be
found in the appendix to the first edition of the second volume of his
‘History.” “It is absolutely certain,” says he, “that the section on
the art of marking out boundaries in Boethius's Geometry can never
have been written by the learned and talented Consular. It is a
confused heap of rubbish, almost worse even than the great compi
lation. Boethius's Geometry, until the appearance of Pope Gerbert's,
was, with Nipsus, Vitruvius and Epaphroditus, the manual of the
land surveyors; and by one of them has this addition, which dis
honours his name, been surreptitiously introduced; just as the rude
ignorance of the copyist, at least of the MS. from which it was
printed, has stript the propositions and diagrams of what was most
essential$.”
   Blume agrees with Niebuhr in thinking that the Demonstratio is
spurious, but differs from him as to the genuinemess of the Euclid.
eleventh century, deserves a closer examination. Five MSS. have been used for
the new edition of the Agrimensors, two of which (a and m) apparently do not
contain the Euclid, and one (z) has only the two books without the appendix.
   * These MSS. are respectively numbered 3595, 842, and 339.

of this MS. are fully given by M. Chasles in his ‘Catalogue des Manuscrits de la
Bibliothèque de Chartres, No. 142. According to Bethman it is not older than
the end of the twelfth century.

Some of them were also published from the Arcerian MS. by Hase, in Bredow's

Rei Nummariae Rom. et Graec. (Ant. 1615), from a MS. in the Cistercian Monastery
at Duyn, which had also the ‘Musica et Arithmetica of Boethius. Is the MS. in
the public library of Cambridge (Moore 74) similar to this?

 532          Mr. Soane on the connexion of Pope Gerbert
 For allowing, on the authority of Cassiodorus, that Boethius indeed
 translated the Elements, he contends that the translation, which now
 passes under the name of Boethius, must be considered as spurious,
 inasmuch as in most MSS. it is found mixed up with the Demon
 stratio, and that consequently both must stand or fall together”.
    Although it is impossible to produce any positive proof in support
 of the common opinion that the translation we possess is the work
 of Boethius, still there is a certain amount of negative evidence to
 that effect. It is not disputed that Boethius did translate the Ele
 ments. Besides the testimony of Cassiodorus already alluded to, we
 find Gerbert, in his Geometry, referring to the definition of some
 elementary terms in geometry given by Boethius, and which are
 apparently identical with those which we find in the treatise in ques
 tion f. With this we must combine the fact, that until the resto
 ration of the Elements in their perfect form at the close of the
 eleventh century by Adelard's translation from the Arabic, there was
 no work, so far as is known, which professed to be a translation of
 Euclid, save and except the meagre list of propositions which now
 goes under the name of Boethius.
    There seems to be more force in Niebuhr's assertion, that, though
 the translation is genuine, we have it only in a mutilated form.
 From the remarks with which Boethius prefaces the demonstrations
 of the first three propositions of the first book, we may readily as
 sume that Boethius adopted the opinion of those who considered
 that Euclid only arranged the propositions, and that the demon
 strations were the work of others!. The admirable literary history
 of the Elements by Mr. De Morgan, in the ‘Dictionary of Classical
 Biography, shows how this error may have arisen; and when we
find Boethius confounding Euclid the geometer with his namesake
the philosopher of Megara—a most portentous error, and one quite
inexcusable in him,-we ought not to be surprised if he also adopted
 the current opinion on the subject, viz. that Theon and not Euclid
 was the author of the demonstrations.
    The only argument against the genuineness of the translation which
 seems to have any weight, is that derived from the circumstance of
   * Rhein. Mus, für Jurispr. B. vii. p. 235. He conjectures that a part of the
genuine translation probably survives in the 14th and 15th books of a mathematical
work to be found in a palimpsest MS. at Verona, which is evidently allied to the
printed translation of the summary of Hypsicles. Whatever grounds there may be
for denying the genuineness of the common translation, there can be no doubt that
this conjecture is altogether unfounded. For though the Elements consist of
fifteen books, it is quite clear, as well from the books themselves as from other tes
timony, that the two last were not written by Euclid; and there are very good
grounds for saying that they are the work of Hypsicles, who cannot have written
earlier than the middle of the sixth century, that is, at least five-and-twenty years
after the death of Boethius. See Mr. De Morgan's articles on Euclid and Hypsicles
in the ‘Dict. of Classical Biography.’

   # P. 1514. See also p. 1487 in. The passage in p. 1542 may also be referred
to, not indeed as containing the opinion of Boethius himself—for it occurs in the
spurious appendix-but as indicating that generally entertained at the time of its
composition.

                     with the Geometry of Boethius.                               533
a part of the Demonstratio being inserted in the midst of the Euclid
in most of the MSS. The part so interpolated is not any of that
continuous whole, if it may be so termed, which we have called the
Appendix, but a portion of the Altercatio (p. 407, 1–410, 7), filling
nearly two leaves in the Bamberg (b), and about one leaf in the
Rostock (r) MS. of the Demonstratio.               A careful examination of the
contents of each page of the MSS. will convince any one that Blume
has made a stronger assertion than the facts warrant, when he says
that the two arecompletely blendedtogether(ganz undgar vermengt),
and will at the same time show us how the confusion probably
arose *. Leaving out of consideration the two propositions of the
third book, inserted in the Altercatio (p. 408, 3–9), all that we find
is, that some few of the following propositions (389, 28–390, 20) are
placed at the end of the Altercatio. This may, I think, be readily ac
 counted for by supposing that a leaf of the codex from which our pre
 sent MSS. are derived, containing the portion in question, had been by
 some accident transposed out of its proper place, and inserted where
 we now find it. This transposition may also be accounted for by sup
 posing that the writer of the original MS. having by accident probably
 overlooked or omitted the matter contained in p. 489, 28 seq., did
 not discover his mistake till he had got to p. 408, 3, where he in
 serted the two first of the missing propositions, but then changed
 his mind and reserved the remainder for the conclusion of the piece
 he was then engaged about. I say the conclusion, for it is evident
 that the following part of the Altercatio, from p. 410, 8, does not
 cohere even with the Euclid+.
    That the Demonstratio did not proceed from the pen of Boethius,
 few persons will be inclined to dispute. Independent of the grounds
 assigned by Niebuhr and Blume for denying its genuineness, the
 book itself shows that it is the production of a Christian, and that
 consequently it cannot have been compiled by the author of the
 Consolatio}.
     In order to understand and appreciate Blume's opinion on the
 origin of the treatise we are considering, it is necessary to say a few
 words on the classification of the different MSS. of the fragments of
 the Agrimensors. In the article on these MSS. which we have al

    + The conclusion of Euclid (p. 390, 20) is not far from the heginning of p. 15
 of the Rostock MS., while p. 410, 8, corresponds with the latter half of the following
 folio. That the writer was very stupid or very careless, is evident. See for in
 stance the confusion in 385, 21–386, 7; 388; 391, 18–26.          The whole of 388,
 21–389, 20, is such a confused and unintelligible medley, that it has been altogether
 omitted in the various editions of Boethius' collective works.

 crificium faciebant,” p. 401, 6.  In the passage of the Liber Coloniarum (p. 241, 5)
 from which this is taken, errantes is not to be found.   That Boethius was a heathen
 has been clearly shown by Obbarius, in the introduction to his edition of the Con
 solatio, Jen, 1843,

   534          Mr. Soane on the connexion of Pope Gerbert
   and calculated to throw light on the subject has been carefully col
   lected by the learned and able author, Blume divides the different
   MSS. into four classes:–1, that of which the Arcerian is the repre
   sentative; 2, the MSS. containing the extracts from the Digest;
   3, the MSS. of Nipsus; 4, those of Boethius. In the course of the
   article he has endeavoured to trace, as far as his data permitted, the
   history of the several MSS. which pass under review, and particu
   larly of the celebrated Codex Arcerianus, which he identifies with
   the MSS. said to have been discovered by Thomas Phaedrus in the
   Monastery of Bobbio, in the year 1494, and transferred by him to
   Rome". The Arcerian is also considered by him to be the source of
   the fourth-class MSS., or those containing the treatise attributed to
   Boethius.f
      After insisting that the genuineness of the Euclid is bound up
  with that of the Demonstratio, Blume goes on to say:—“Rather
  may Gerbert be considered the compiler of this Appendix. For in
  dependently of Gerbert's probable connection with the Arcerian at
  Bobbio, and without reference to the MS. of the third class, in which
  Goesius says he found the Epistola ad Celsum ascribed to Gerbert,
  we must most especially take into consideration a MS. belonging to
  De Thou, which was used by Rigaltius, and is thus described in the
  Catalogue of De Thou's library:—‘Boetii Musica, Arithmetica, Ger
 berti Geometria et Rhythmomachiaf.’”                  It was from this MS. that
     * Though it is difficult to deny the extreme probability of this supposition, yet
 there are difficulties which make the author hesitate.    The known connection be
  tween John Lasco and the celebrated Erasmus would seem to raise a presumption
  that the Erasmus whose name appears on the MS. was no other than that great
  philologist. But this would go far to show that the Arcerian was not the same
  with the Bobbio MS. The MS. is not mentioned either in the Catalogue of the
  Bobbio library, printed by Muratori in the third volume of the Antiq. Ital, nor yet
 in the one compiled in the year 1461, and published by Peyron in his ‘Commen
 tatio de Bibliotheca Bobiensi.     In the first-mentioned list, which is as old as the
 tenth century, we find ‘Libros Boetii iii. de Aritmetica et alterum de Astronomia.”
     t “Mir scheinen nun schon aller Handschriftern, in welchen der Name des Boe
 thius mit workomt, zur Arcerianische Familie zugehören,” p. 198. In a subsequent
 page, after pointing out the supposed resemblance of a part of the introduction to a
  passage in Agenus Urbicus, he proceeds:—“Das Uebrige schliesst sich dem Arce
 rianus meist wortlick, und oft selbstbüchstablich in sichtbar corrumpirten Lesarten
 an: doch steht auch Einiges darunter, was sich sonst teils gar nicht, teils wenigstens
 nicht in Arcerianus erhaltenhat,” ib. p. 299. Though this is undoubtedly true, still in
 many places it deserts the Arcerian, and agrees with the Erfurdt MS. which belongs
 to the third class. See, for instance, 395, 20; 396, 4, 5, 15; 403, 8, 10; 409, 17,
 20-25. If p. 27, 12 is to be considered as the original of what we have in Boethius,
 p. 397, 6 and 409, 6, then the writer must have had a MS. of the third class before
 him, for in neither of the other two classes is the first-mentioned passage to be
 found.    The definition of measure, which Boethius attributes to Frontinus
 (p. 415, 11), is in the Jena MS. (a transcript of the Arcerian) given to Balbus;
in the Gudian, which belongs to the second class, to Frontinus; and in those of the
third class, to Nipsus.
    # According to Oudin, this MS. came into Colbert's collection, and from thence
into the National Library at Paris. (Suppl. in Bellarmin. p. 313.) This leads us to
identify De Thou's MS. with the one numbered 7185 in that collection, and which
is said in the printed catalogue to have belonged to Peter Pithou and afterwards to
Colbert. It seems to be a collection of distinct MSS. bound up together. The
Arithmetic of Boethius is of the eleventh century, and the Musica of the fourteenth,

                      with the Geometry of Boethius.                                535
 Rigaltius copied what he called the Fragmenta Terminalia, but which
is an almost literal extract from the Demonstratio (p. 401, 10–403, 4).
 He most commonly refers to the second book of Boethius, but on one
 occasion he expressly mentions the revision of Boethius by Gerbert
 or some one else. Another proof is, that in a published treatise of
 Gerbert on Geometry, we meet with at least part of one of the ex
 tracts from Hyginus, which are to be found in the second Bernese
 MS. of Boethius". Blume however is of opinion that the work in
 its present form is unworthy of Gerbert also:—“For even Gerbert
—could not have dealt with the contents of the Arcerian MS. in the
 awkward and silly way in which the MSS. of the pseudo-Boethius
 represent their compiler to have done; and a part also of its contents
 must have been derived from a MS. of the second class with which
 Gerbert was not acquainted so far as we know.” He accordingly
 conjectures that some person living on this side of the Alps got hold
 of Gerbert's extracts from the Arcerian, and by the help of these and
 other similar materials, fabricated the work in question. He ob
 serves that all the MSS. of the fourth class appear to have proceeded
 from Alsace or Flanders, whilst those of the third class, on the con
 trary, had their origin in Italy: and Gerbert, who was continually
 moving to and fro between France and Italy, was in those times the
 best medium of communication on such matters, though his words
 were often mutilated and misunderstood by his ignorant contempo
 rariest.
    Ingenious and plausible as this hypothesis is, the author is unable
 to assent to it. It is obviously founded on the double assumption
 that the Arcerian is the identical MS. found at Bobbio by Inghirami,
 and that Gerbert having become acquainted with it during his
 tenure of the abbacy of Bobbio, subsequently communicated a part
 of its contents to the northern and eastern parts of France.                    At the
 time that Blume wrote his article it was universally supposed that
 Gerbert's connection with Bobbio began as early as the year 969 and
 did not finally cease till 983 #.        The subsequent researches of Hock
 have established that Gerbert did not become abbot of Bobbio till
 the year 981 or 982, and that he did not continue so above a year,
 while Gerbert's Geometry belongs to the thirteenth. According to Chasles (l.c.
 p. 505 note), there is another copy in the same collection, No. 7377 C. This
 statement is not confirmed by the catalogue, which describes the MS. as only
 containing two letters on geometrical subjects, one addressed to Gerbert, and the
 other written by him, and also a MS. with the title “Geometria Euclidis interprete
 Boetio.”
    * Pez, l.c. 81. Gerbert's work was printed from a single MS, belonging to the
 Monastery of St. Peter at Salzburg, which is manifestly imperfect at the end.
 Blume suggests that if other copies were examined, its deficiencies might probably
 be supplied. The copy in the Arundel collection contains only the first thirteen
 chapters. The only MS. of Gerbert in England that I have been able to discover, is
 one of the twelfth century, in Sir Thomas Phillips's collection at Middlehill, No. 4437.
    + Later researches have proved that Blume is mistaken in confining the MSS. of
 Boethius to Flanders and Alsace. Besides the one at Chartres above-mentioned,
 there is one at Middlehill, which came from Tours.       They are to be found at St.
 Gall, and also in the Laurentian library at Florence (Plut. xxix. cod. 19).
    # Histoire Littéraire de France, t. vi. p. 559 seqq.

 536          Mr. Soane on the connexion of Pope Gerbert
 during which time he was so engaged with secular affairs, that it
 was hardly possible for him to have bestowed any attention on the
 corrupt and almost unintelligible MS. of the Agrimensors”.
      If we cannot connect Gerbert with the Arcerian MS. at Bobbio,
 there are, it seems, no reasonable grounds for saying that he was more
 intimately acquainted with the writings of the Agrimensors than
 any other well-educated man of his time, unless such connection can
 be inferred from the statement of Goesius, that part of the Expositio
 Mensurarum, which in the Arcerian bears the name of Balbus, and
 in the MSS. of the second class that of Frontinus, was in his MS.
  attributed to Gerbert (Goes. in not. p. 142).                Goesius goes on to
 say, that he has made some corrections and additions with the aid of
 that MS., and he expresses his surprise that Rigalt had not done the
 same, as he had the same MS. lent to him by Rutgersius. Now this
  MS. lent to Rigalt was undoubtedly nothing more nor less than a
 transcript of the Arcerian, made by Nansiusi, and consequently
 Goesius was mistaken so far; but it would be too rash to say that he
 is mistaken as to what he found in a MS. which he had before him.
 His words are, “Haec in manuscriptis adscribi video partim M. J.
 Nipso, partim etiam, ut est in manuscripto, Domno Gerberto Papae
 et Philosopho.” He distinguishes between the MS. of Nipsus and
 that of Gerbert.        So far as Nipsus is concerned, the difficulty may
 be got rid of by supposing that Goesius had one or more MSS. of
 the third class, in which the preface is ascribed to Nipsus.                    With
 respect to Gerbert it is not so easy to give any satisfactory expla
 nation. The only way of accounting for it, which occurs to me, is,
 that as the matter which in the Arcerian is distributed between
 Epaphroditus, Vitruvius, and Balbus, is in the third-class MSS. given
 to Nipsus, and as a great part of it is also to be found in Gerbert,
 all Goesius meant to say was, that such was the case, and not, as
 his words would lead us to suppose, that any part of Balbus was
 expressly ascribed to Gerbert; or perhaps he only meant that there
 was a substantial resemblance between the account of measures, &c.
in Balbus, and in Gerbert #.
     Independently of the presumption against Gerbert's familiarity
    * Gerbert oder Papst Sylvester II. und sein Jahrhundert, von C. F. Hock, pp.
64-67 and 195-199.       The narrative of Richerius, who was the scholar of Gerbert,
and wrote his history at his request, as to the early career of his master, is, I
think, quite conclusive against the common opinion as to the time when he be
came connected with Bobbio.—Richer. Hist. lib. iii. c. 43 seq. in Pertz, Monumenta
Germanica Historica, t. iii. b. 616. That he had not much leisure for literary pursuits
is proved by his own words:—“Cessimus ergo fortunae, studiaque nostra, tempore
intermissa, animo retenta, repetimus” (Ep. 16). “Disparibus in BQbiense Caenobium
meritis praestant laudati viri ... Gerbertus potissimum objura abbatialia vindicata
. . . . Gerbertus scientias universas attigit: verum vix ad paucos annos (?) rem Bo
biensem moderatus est, juribus potius, quam studiis revocandis intentus.”—Peyron,
l. c. p. xi.
    f See Blume, l.c. p. 180.
    1 Blume thinks that the name of “Gerbert’ was prefixed, perhaps merely to in
dicate the possessor of an ancient MS., and not the author of the compilation,
l. c. p. 227. In the Corrigenda, p. 377, he corrects the mistake he had fallen into,
that Gerbert's name was written in the Arcerian.

                      with the Geometry of Boethius.                             537
with the Arcerian suggested, by the examination of his personal
history, the Geometry itself furnishes evidence almost amounting to
demonstration, that its author was unacquainted with it. The
most important, and, in an historical point of view, the most in
teresting proposition of the mathematical part of the manuscript, so
far as its contents are known, is the general formula for any triangle
in terms of its sides (p. 301, 11–301, 5)*. Now there is not the
slightest hint to be found in any of Gerbert's writings of his ac
quaintance with this formula; and as we know from his letter to
Adelboldf, that his attention had been pointedly directed to the rules
then ordinarily used for determining the areas of triangles, it is
highly improbable that he should have omitted all mention of it, if
it had ever come under his notice. The only rule applicable to
all triangles given by him is, substantially, that the area is equal
to half the sum of every side multiplied by the perpendicular let
fall on it from the opposite vertext. On the other hand, the extract
from Hyginus (p. 188, 14–190, 12), with which the Geometry ends,
has been taken, not from the Arcerian, but from the Gudian or some
other MS. of the second class; for not only does it agree with
the latter, where it differs materially from the first and third class
MSS., but also faithfully copies its peculiar blunders and cor
ruptions §.
    The next argument is, that Rigaltius has edited from a MS. of
 Gerbert's Geometry what is in fact a part of the Demonstratio: and
 Blume refers to Rigaltius's note in p. 240:—“Gerbertus, sive quis
 alius Boetii Geometrica sublegit, postguam ad hujusmodi negotia
 pervenit, de iis sese nihil attingere velle profitetur:” and he then
 gives the sentence which has been before quoted from the Harleian
 and Arundel MSS. This certainly creates a difficulty, which, in the
 absence of more accurate information as to the MS. used by Rigal
 tius, it is not easy to overcome. It must be observed that this sen
 tence does not occur in the Salzburg MS. of Gerbert; and in the
 Arundel, which has a fragment of his Geometry, it forms a part of
 the Boethius, and not of Gerbert.
     The last argument is derived from the Geometry of Gerbert con
 taining the identical extract from Hyginus as to the methods of
 ascertaining the true direction of the meridian by observations of the
 sun, which we find in some MSS. of Boethius. Though this ar
  gument is apparently entitled to greater weight than the rest, yet it
    * This formula is found also in the MSS. of Boethius, and has been published
 from the second Berne, by Venturi, ‘Commentari sopra la Storia et le Teorie dell’
 Ottica, p. 125. It agrees with the Excerpta Rostochiensia, when this differs from
 the Arcerian, except in 300, 11, where it has id est, a reading peculiar to itself.

  538         Mr. Soane on the connexion of Pope Gerbert
  is far from conclusive, especially as it is founded upon an assumption,
  the truth of which, in the writer's opinion, is at least doubtful,—
  that the part of the Geometry containing the passage in question, is
  the composition of its reputed author. The most cursory exami
  nation of the printed treatise will convince the reader that it could
  not possibly have emanated, in its present form, from “the wise pope
  who was the instructor of his age.” No man of sense would have
  been so absurd as to repeat the same matter twice or even oftener
  in so short a compass, or to insert in the body of his book a second
  introduction, not materially different from the one prefixed to it.
  Evidently two distinct treatises, the first of which ends with the
  thirteenth chapter, have been somehow or another confounded in
  the manuscript, and both have been published as one entire work, by
  Pez, who has overlooked the internal indications they contain of
  having originally been unconnected with one another". If then we
  have two separate tracts fortuitously united together, which of the
  two is to be considered as the work of Gerbert?                Unfortunately we
  have no weighty, much less decisive evidence on this point, and the
  only, or at least principal reason, which with our present scanty
  data can be urged in favour of the first and shorter of the two, is,
  that it is the one which bears his name, not only in the Salzburg,
  but also in the Arundel MS., which is apparently derived from some
  other source than the former.
      The writer is inclined to go a step further, and ask, Is there any
  evidence that Gerbert ever wrote a work on Geometry, or have we
  any surer grounds for asserting that either of the two treatises which
  bear his name was actually written by him, than we have for attri
  buting the work “De Divisione Numerorum, which we know to
 have been composed by him, to Bedat, viz., that in some MSS. his
 name is attached to it? Beda, Alcuin, and Gerbert were the repre
 sentatives of the learning of their respective centuries; and to each
  was ascribed indiscriminately every work of merit, the writer of
  which was unknown or forgotten.
     Granting however that Gerbert became acquainted with the Ar
  cerian at Bobbio, still that fact is far from establishing the conclusion
 attempted to be       drawn from it, as there is reason for believing that
    * This opinion seems to receive some confirmation from the circumstance that
 the Arundel MS. has only the first thirteen chapters, in other words, the first trea
 tise. At Chartres there is a MS. (No. 173), which only has chapters 14–40. The
 Arundel shows how the two works probably came to be blended into it. The con
cluding words of Gerbert are immediately followed by the opening sentence of Boe
thius, as this is in like manner succeeded by another treatise on geometry or men
suration, without the slightest indication that all three do not form one continuous
whole.
    t The “Liber ad Grammaticum,’ which Richerius (p. 618) says was written by
Gerbert, as a companion or guide to the use of the Abacus invented by him, has
been printed by M. Chasles, in the Comptes Rendus of the Académie Royale des.
Sciences, T. xvi., and is the same tract with that published in Beda's works with
the title ‘De Divisione Numerorum, Bed. Opera, t. i. 159, ed. Bas. The treatise
of Hermannus Contractus ‘De Utilitatibus Astrolabii, which has also been pub
lished by Pez, from the same Salzburg MS. is attributed to Gerbert in two MSS.
Chasles, Catalogue, p. 44.

                       with the Geometry of Boethius.                              539
 the mathematical part of the Arcerian was known long before Ger.
 bert's time. We find, for instance, a part of the problems attributed
 to Nipsus, Epaphroditus and Vitruvius, in the Propositiones Arith
 meticae, said to be by Beda, but which was probably the work of
 Alcuin”.
    In conclusion we may observe that, in the library of St. Gall
 there is an old MS. of which the following account is given by
 Haenel:--“830. Boetius in perihermenias, geometriam, de diffe
rentiis, divisionibus, cognatione, syllogismis, topica Ciceronis, Ek
kehardi IV. notae marginales, versus. Cod. membr. optimus, eadem
 manuscriptus in pergameno solidot.” The age of the MS. is not
mentioned, but as it contains marginal notes by Ekkehardus IV.,
 it cannot be later than the close of the tenth or the beginning of
 the following century!.            The oldest of the Berne MSS. belongs,
 as has been already stated, to the tenth century; and the other,
which came from Strasburg, was written in 1004. Here then we
have three MSS. almost coeval with Gerbert, and the most modern
 of which must have been written about twenty-five years after
he became abbot of Bobbio, in which the work is attributed to
 Boethius: and one of which was perused and annotated by the pupil
 of Notker, the friend of Gerbert, and probably—for he also belonged
 to St. Gall—by Notker himself. It is hardly possible to conceive
 that a new forgery, the materials for which are supposed to have been
 partially derived either from Gerbert, or taken from his work, could
in this short space of time have been palmed upon the world as
 the work of Boethius.
   * Bedae Opera, i. 133. It is printed in the Ratisbon edition of Alcuin (t. ii.
p. 442), from a MS. belonging to the Monastery of Richenau, in which it bore
the name of Alcuin. In the library of Valenciennes there is a MS. of the tenth
century, which formerly belonged to the Monastery of St. Amand or Elnon, and
 which contains the Podismus (p. 296 seq.), but whether it is derived from a first or
third class MS. I am unable to say. It is described in Pertz, Archiv der Gesell
schaft für D. Gesch. viii. 440.
   f Haenel, Catal. MSS. 712. There is another MS. of the ninth century at St.
Gall (248), which contains Boetius et Beda de Computo, Mathesi, Astronomia, Geo
graphia et vi aetatibus mundi. Haenel, 681.      Unfortunately this account does not
inform us which of the works are by Boethius. Is the Astronomia the same as that of
the old Bobbio catalogue, and the Astrologia mentioned by Gerbert, in a letter
written at Mantua probably in the year 972, “quod reperimus speretis, id est octo
volumina Boetii de Astrologia, praeclarissima quoque figurarum Geometriae, aliaque
non minus admiranda”?—Ep. 8. Cassiodorus alludes to a Latin translation of
Ptolemy by Boethius, War. i. 45.
   ! Ekkehard was born about A.D. 980 and died about A.D. 1036.—Arx in Pertz,
Mon. Histor. t. ii. p. 74. Obbarius (p. xxxvii. n. 42) suggests that this may per
haps be one of the two MSS. of Boethius, bequeathed to the monastery of St. Gall
and the abbot Hartmuth, in the last quarter of the ninth century (Ratpert. Cas. S.
Gall, in Pertz. Mon. Hist. ii. p. 72,45.). The words of Ratpert “Boethii.5 libri philo
sophicae consolationis in volum. i. Item alii 5 in altero volumine' seem rather to
mean that he gave two copies of the same work. Compare p. 70, 33. And such
was apparently the opinion of Arx, the learned librarian of St. Gall; for he has not
noticed it among the books mentioned by Ratpert, which are still to be found in
their ancient repository.

Jan. 17, TM ESEARCHES respecting the Molecular constitution
  1850.        of the Volatile Organic Bases. By Dr. A. W. Hofmann.
Communicated by Sir James Clark, Bart., F.R.S.
   Chemists, although all acknowledging the existence of an intimate
relation between the vegetable alkaloids and ammonia, are nevertheless
divided in their opinions respecting the nature of this connection,
two theories having been propounded upon the subject. According
to the one, that of Berzelius, the bases would have to be considered
as conjugated ammonias in which ammonia still pre-exists as such ;
while according to Liebig's views, these substances are represented as
amides, i.e. as ammonia in which one equivalent of hydrogen is
eliminated and replaced by an equivalent of a compound radical.
    The researches of the author prove that the theory of Berzelius is
inadmissible, at all events for the volatile organic bases, inasmuch as
in these substances ammonia ceases to exist as such. They show,
moreover, that Liebig's view, although correctly expressing the con
stitution of by far the greater number of the volatile bases known,
and presenting, when considered at the time it was first propounded,
a wonderful anticipation of subsequent discovery, represents never
theless only a special case of a much more general relation. The
result at which the author has arrived is, that ammonia is capable of
losing either 1 (Liebig's case) or 2 or 3 equivs. of hydrogen which
are respectively replaced by 1, 2 or 3 equivs. of the same, or various
compound radicals, a variety of substances apparently endless being
produced, in which its fundamental property (the basic character) is
 retained, although modified by the number of radicals introduced and
 their position in the scale of organic compounds.
    In support of this statement, he adduces the artificial production
 of thirteen new organic alkaloids, formed by a method which affords
 the means of increasing the number of these substances to an inde
 finite extent. This method consists in exposing ammonia to the
 action of the chlorides, bromides or iodides of the alcohol radicals,
 which remove 1 equivalent of hydrogen of the latter, as hydrochloric,
 hydrobromic, &c. acid, while the remaining constituents, assuming
the alcohol-radical, give rise to the formation of an organic base
which unites with the hydrogen acid.
    By subjecting the new base itself to a similar treatment, another
equivalent of the two remaining equivalents of hydrogen may be
removed, a second organic base being formed, which in its turn gives
 rise to a third.
    The changes which the ammonia undergoes in these various pro
 cesses may be represented graphically by the following simple for
 mulae, X, Y and Z, denoting generally compound radicals.

   For the illustration of these general formulae, one of the numerous
sets of experiments which the author has communicated in his paper
may be quoted in which X=Y=Z. Ammonia, when exposed to the
action of bromide of ethyl (hydrobromic ether), is converted into
hydrobromate of ethylamine, i.e. ammonia in which I equivalent of
hydrogen is replaced by ethyl, a compound which was first observed
by M. Wurtz under perfectly different circumstances. Ethylamine,
treated again with bromide of ethyl, yields a new alkaloid diethyla
mine, i.e. ammonia in which 2 equivalents of hydrogen are replaced
by ethyl, and which, under the influence of a further quantity of
bromide of ethyl, lastly is transformed into triethylamine, or ammonia
in which the whole of the hydrogen is replaced by ethyl. This is
a most powerful alkali, whose properties resemble those of caustic
potassa.
   Jan. 24.—Observations on the Freezing of the Albumen of Eggs.
By James Paget, Esq., Professor of Anatomy and Surgery to the
Royal College of Surgeons. Communicated by Thomas Bell, Esq.,
Sec. R.S. &c.
   The object of this paper is to illustrate a peculiar property of the
albumen of the eggs of birds, a property which seems to have its pur
pose in preserving them from the injurious effects of very low tem
peratures.
   Mr. Hunter observed that a fresh egg will resist freezing longer
than one which has been previously frozen and thawed; and he re
ferred this fact to the ‘vital power' of the egg in the first case, and
the destruction of that power by freezing in the second. The
author's experiments confirm those of Mr. Hunter, and prove, also,
that when fresh eggs are exposed to very low temperatures, and also
in the case of eggs which are decayed, or putrid, or the contents of
which have been much altered by mechanical force or by electricity,
a shorter time is sufficient for the freezing of such eggs, than is
necessary for the freezing of those which are uninjured.
    An examination of the rates at which heat was lost by the several
 eggs, exposed to temperatures varying from zero to 10°Fahr, showed
that fresh eggs, though they resist freezing longer than any others,
yet lose heat more quickly; and that their resistance to freezing is
 due to the peculiar property of their albumen, the temperature of
 which may be reduced to 16°Fahr., or much lower without freezing,
 although its proper freezing-point is at or just below 32°. Other
 than fresh eggs lose heat comparatively slowly, but freeze as soon
 as their temperature is reduced to 32°; fresh eggs lose heat more

542                          Royal Society.
quickly, but may be reduced to 16° or lower; then, at the instant of
beginning to freeze, their temperature rises to 32°.
   That this peculiarity of fresh eggs is not due to vital properties,
is proved by experiments which show that certain injuries, such as
mechanical violence, addition of water, and others, which spoil their
powers of resisting freezing, do not prevent eggs from being deve
loped in incubation. By the same and other experiments, which are
related, it is made probable that the peculiarity depends on the me
chanical properties of the albumen; for, whatever makes the albumen
more liquid than it is naturally in the fresh egg, destroys the power
of resisting freezing.
   The author could find no other substance possessing this property;
and in evidence of its adaptation to the purpose of preserving eggs
from the loss of their capacity of developement, which they would
suffer in being frozen, he relates experiments in which eggs were
kept for a considerable time at temperatures ranging from zero to 10°
Fahr, yet were afterwards developed in incubation. By the same
series of experiments it was shown, that, although freezing renders
the effectual developement of the germ impossible, yet the intensest
cold, if freezing does not take place, has no similar result.

   Having undertaken the magnetic survey of the Indian Archipelago
at the recommendation of the Royal Society, I think a slight sketch,
detailed as briefly as possible, of my operations may not be unin
teresting to Sir John Herschel and the Committee of Physics of
which he is Chairman, prior to the publication of the Survey. I
trust likewise I have acted strictly in accordance with the wishes of
those who so kindly recommended me for the Survey, and I hope
that my earnest efforts to do my duty will gain for me that appro
bation which I have under no ordinary difficulties incessantly striven
to obtain.
   I will in the first place mention the different stations I visited, and
then describe in a few words, the way in which the observations were
taken.
   I have made a most complete survey of Java. At Batavia I
established an observatory where observations, magnetic and meteoro
logical, were taken hourly from 3 A.M. to 9 P.M. for nine months.
In addition, about fifty stations, where observations of dip, of total
intensity, of latitude, longitude, and declination were taken; these
were always made by myself, and I am certain they can be depended
upOlm.
  ": Borneo an observatory was established at Sarawak, where ob
servations were taken quarter-hourly for three months, besides visiting

                               Royal Society.                        543
   the Dutch settlements of Sambas, Pantianak and Succadana on the
   Western coast.
       In Sumatra four months of observation at Padang, besides a mag
   netic survey comprising about thirty stations. I crossed the equator
   here as well as at Pantianak in Borneo.
       At Singapore I compared the portable instruments with the fixed
   instruments of the observatory, besides determining the horizontal
   intensity and dip, which had not been accurately determined pre
   viously from insufficiency of means.
      At the Cocos or Keeling Islands, six weeks of observation.
      At Sambooangan, in the Island of Mindanao, upwards of a week.
      At Keemah in Celebes, the same.
      At Penang, the same.
      At Moulmein, the same.
      At the Nicobars, the same.
      At Bencoolen in Sumatra, the same.
      I will now mention the instruments and the mode of observation at
  the observatories. The following instruments were registered every
  hour from 3 A.M. to 9 P.M. Two declinometers, and latterly a third
  made by Jones, a bifilar magnetometer and its thermometer; a
  standard barometer and its thermometer by Newman; a standard
  thermometer and a dry and wet bulb.
     On the survey, I employed for the observations four dipping
  needles; a portable declinometer with altitude and azimuth instru
 ment for the declination and for latitude; a sextant, artificial hori
 zon and chronometer for the error and rates of the watch, which
 was but a poor one.
     I began work generally at 6 A.M., put up the portable declinometer,
 and allowed the brass weight and stirrup to swing for a couple of
 hours thoroughly to take the torsion out of the thread, adjusting it
 from time to time so that the stirrup might ultimately take up a po
 sition in the magnetic meridian; during this period I took the dip.
 At 8 A.M. I took sights with the sextant, and putting in the collimator
 magnet, I adjusted the altitude and azimuth to it, and took altitudes
and azimuths of the sun, three on the limb direct, and three on the
limb reversed, noting the reading on the horizontal limb; at the same
time this gave me the reading of the true meridian; the magnetic
axis of the collimator magnet was then read off; these observations
were usually completed by 9 A.M.: by 11 A.M. I had finished my
observations for horizontal intensity. The small collimator magnet
being suspended, the large collimator magnet was placed at four dif
ferent distances east and west, and the deflecting collimator magnet
was then vibrated and 300 oscillations taken.
    At 11 A.M. I observed altitudes and azimuths of the sun with the
altitude and azimuth instrument for equal altitudes.    At noon I took
circummeridional altitudes of the sun, three with the limb direct,
and three with the limb reversed, for latitude; at 1 P.M. I again took
altitudes and azimuths.
    By equal altitudes from the mean of the times, I was enabled to
check the results given by the sextant for time; and by the azimuths
corresponding to the equal altitudes, I checked the observations for

544                         Royal Society.
the true meridian taken at 9 A.M. for the declination. By this means
I was always certain of the results by using different modes of veri
fication.
   If I stopped another day at the stations I repeated the observations;
if I was going to move off, I packed up the instruments and struck
the tents, which generally took me the afternoon and the greater
part of the evening, for I had no one to assist me.
   At sea, whenever an opportunity offered, I took meteorological
observations, viz. the standard thermometer, the dry and wet bulb,
and the temperature of the air and sea at 3 A.M. and P.M., and at 9
A.M. and P.M.; sights for longitude at 9 A.M. and 3 P.M., and latitude
at noon, besides the dip three times, and sometimes five times a day;
every absolute determination was made by me.
   Thus on shore as well as at sea, observations were commenced at
3 A.M., and never terminated till 9 P.M.: I had for my assistant an
Indo-Briton.
   I will not trouble the Council of the Royal Society with stories of
the difficulties I met with ; suffice it to say, that a stranger amongst
the Dutch, the necessity of conciliating the natives in seeing me em
ployed in a manner so strange to them, travelling in the monsoons
and in all weathers, sometimes for hours wet in the saddle, living
in huts for weeks, the only shelter being cocoanut leaves, and at sea
in a leaky old schooner that was perpetually in danger of foundering,
with a captain who was scarcely ever sober,-it is not surprising
that once or twice I fell sick. I am now but slowly recovering from
Java and Car Nicobar fever caught in the execution of my duty.
I take the liberty of adding for the information of the Council of the
Royal Society, that I never took a single observation unless I was by
myself and my attention undisturbed. If strangers were importunate,
I waited until they left me. If the weather was against me, I took
no observations until it settled.    I made it a rule never to be in a
hurry, and always to finish one set of observations before I commenced
another, and to be as comfortable as circumstances would admit.
I am certain that an observation is the more valuable in propor
tion to the mind being not only at ease, but able to fix itself with
undivided attention on the observations. I never, for instance, would
think of taking an observation whilst bored by an intruder, or a high
wind, or a heavy shower of rain falling. I preferred under such
circumstances invariably to sacrifice the observation rather, than
to record it.
   I have the honour of sending to the Council as a specimen of the
way in which the work was carried on, some of the absolute deter
minations made at the Cocos or Keeling Islands; they will be able
to see that often after the labours of the day had commenced at
3 A.M., they were not terminated at 9 P.M.; and in order to observe
moon-culminating stars, I had sometimes to remain up the greater
part of the night, for I had no one on whom I could place any de
pendence to awake me at the proper time.

   Jan. 31.—“An account of a remarkable Aurora Borealis seen at
Montreal on the 13th of August 1849.”        By Mr. Thomas McGinn.
Communicated by Thomas Bell, Esq., Sec. R.S., &c.
   The author having witnessed a singular aurora on the 13th of
August, in this communication gives a description of the phaeno
menon. He states that, on the evening in question, the whole north
ern hemisphere was screened by thick dark clouds, which, though
very small, were closely packed together. Shortly after sunset (7"
34") it became quite dark, and at 8 o'clock the existence of the
meteor was indicated by a mellow luminous tinge which appeared
through the openings of the clouds in the north.
   About half-past eight a similar luminous glow was observed
through the clouds which were fast disappearing in a heavy dew.
This light appeared like a belt of 2° broad, extending across the
sky from a point almost due east directly to the west, and reaching
within 5° or 6° of the horizon. As the clouds disappeared, which
they did very rapidly, the true character of the aurora became more
perfectly developed. In the north the usual dark arch from which
the columns of light ordinarily appear to issue, was for the greater
part of the time wanting; and the luminous columns seemed to rise
from the earth, extending upwards occasionally to the pole star,
beyond which no trace of them was visible. A brown vapoury
cloud, the only one now visible, extended along the horizon from N.N.E.
to a few points south of east, and maintained apparently a motion
less position, the lower part appearing to rest upon the earth, and
the upper edges, which seemed uniform, rose about 6° above the
horizon. Immediately in the east, and apparently issuing from this
cloud, rose the belt or zone of light already noticed, forming a mag
nificent arch. The light emitted from this zone was of a milky
whiteness, and the matter of it seemed to be much more compact
than any portion of an aurora ever seen by the author; but imme
diately in the zenith, where it intersected the Milky Way, it ap
peared to be far less compact. At this point, where alone motion
was observable, a constant current was seen, presenting the appear
ance of light fleecy clouds driven by a strong wind, and following
each other in such close succession as to appear in contact. This
stream of the aurora was maintained undiminished for more than an
hour, during which time the eastern part of the zone did not appear
to lose either in volume or brilliancy, nor did the western seem to
gain in either of these respects. After an hour, the dark cloud
seemed to diminish slowly, and with it the zone began to lose its
 brilliancy. In about another hour this cloud and also the zone,

546                          Royal Society.
 which throughout had maintained apparent contact with it, vanished.
 The conclusion, that the dark cloud served the purpose of a con
 ductor and fed the zone drawing off the matter of the aurora from
the north, seemed to the author inevitable. The cloud did not ap
pear to him to be more than forty or fifty miles distant. In conclu
sion he remarks that none of the prismatic tints were observable on
this occasion.
   2. “On the Development of the Retina and Optic Nerve, and of
the Membranous Labyrinth and Auditory Nerve.” By Henry Gray,
Esq., M.R.C.S. Communicated by William Bowman, Esq., F.R.S.,
&c
   The author has divided the observations contained in this paper
into two parts:—the first of which treats of “The Development of
the Retina and Optic Nerve; the second, of the Development of
the Membranous Labyrinth and Auditory Nerve.”
   In the observations on the development of the retina, which have
been made on the embryo of the chick, the author demonstrates its
mode of evolution, and also the mode of development of the various
layers of which this membrane is formed. They commence at the
early period of the thirty-third hour of incubation, at which time
the cephalic extremity of the embryo presents a slight protrusion of
its walls, which by the thirty-sixth hour is very considerably in
creased, having become more elongated and protruded outwards,
presenting a somewhat dilated end, and being somewhat constricted
at its connection with the anterior cerebral cell from which it arises.
This is the first indication of the development of this membrane.
   At the forty-sixth hour this protrusion (which the author calls
the optic vesicle) was still more distinct, and the cavity in the cere
bral cell, from the wall of which it arises, was well seen, and it was
observed to communicate with the cavity of the optic vesicle which
was also hollow. This description of the mode of development of
the retina the author considers as confirmatory of the observations
made by Baër, but not in accordance with that given by Wagner
or Huschke.
   The author then proceeds to detail very minutely the consecutive
stages of the development of the retina and parts in immediate con
nection with it, until the seventh day, when he states that on making
a section of the eye, it was separated from the other tunics as a per
fectly distinct layer. The optic nerves were also now completely
formed, being united to form the chiasma, and passed inwards in
the direction of the under surface of the corpora quadrigemina.
   The author in the next place proceeds to consider the develop
ment of the various layers of the retinal membrane, a point which
appears not to have been previously noticed by any physiologist.
This membrane on the eighth day of incubation can be seen, by the
naked eye, distinct from the other tunics. Its choroidal surface is
composed of a mass of globular nuclei about the size of the red cor
puscles of the blood, which form at this period about one-half the
entire thickness of the retina, the deeper surface consisting of some
fine granular matter and a mass of pale and delicate nucleated cells

                            Royal Society.                         547
similar to those found surrounding the fibrous lamina in the normal
structure of the membrane.
    The “Membrana Jacobi” is first observed on the thirteenth day
as a fine pale granular stratum which covers in the globular nuclei
already described. In this, at about the fifteenth day, some brilliant
yellowish granules are imbedded; they vary in size from the 5000th
to the 8000th of an inch, and around them a delicate cell-wall is
traced; they soon acquire an oval shape; then become more elon
gated; and about the eighteenth day the almost perfect rods are
formed. They are now disposed in an imbricated manner, and their
nuclei, which are of a bright yellow colour, are placed generally at
the apex, but sometimes in the middle of the rods. On the twenty
first day this membrane is similar to what is seen in the full-grown
bird.
    The first trace of the “fibrous lamina” is seen between the four
teenth and fifteenth days, as a fine pale granular lamina marked by
numerous faint longitudinal striae. On the eighteenth day this
membrane when separated from the other layers is seen composed
of numerous fibrillated meshes, in which are deposited the nucleated
vesicles which are formed as early as the eighth day. From these
observations it is seen that the retina is formed as a protrusion from
the most anterior cerebral cell, being hollow and communicating with
its cavity; that it subsequently assumes a pyriform shape, presenting
a dilated end, the future retina, and a tubular portion, the optic
nerve.    As the tubular portion becomes solidified so as to form the
optic nerve, then no communication can be traced between the op
tic vesicle and the cavity from which it is an offset. By degrees
the spherical end of the protrusion is absorbed, and the retina, being
now fully formed, becomes attached to the margin of the lens. The
optic nerve is then traced to be connected not only with the anterior
cerebral cell, but, uniting with its fellow at the under surface of the
optic lobes, is seen partly to terminate in those bodies. The deduc
tions from these observations may be thus briefly stated:—
    1st. They confirm the observations on the structure of the retina
 made by Bowman, who has shown that the essential part of this
 membrane is analogous to the cineritious matter of the brain, and is
 composed like it of a fibrous mesh intermingled with vesicles of
 grey matter, being, in fact, a portion of the cerebrum pushed out
 wards and connected with the brain by its appropriate commissure,
 the optic nerve. The mode of development of this membrane
 would show this to be the correct view of the structure of this
 essential part of the retinal expansion, and at the same time disprove
 the statements of Henle, who believed it to be more analogous to
 epithelium.                                             -
    2nd. The origin of the optic vesicle from the anterior cerebral
 cell, would show the incorrectness of the opinion of those anato
 mists who have stated that none of the fibres of the optic nerve
 could be traced to the optic thalami. The thalami being developed
 from the same centre from whence these vesicles arise, would render
 it exceedingly probable that the optic nerves had some connection
 with those bodies.

548                         Royal Society.
   The second part of the paper describes the development of the
membranous labyrinth and auditory nerve.
   The essential part of the auditory apparatus, viz. the membranous
labyrinth, consists, like the retina, of a membranous lamina formed
of the terminal axes cylinders of the nerve tubules in intimate con
nection with a layer of closely-set nucleated cells; like it also, it
may be regarded as a portion of the brain protruded outwards, and
connected with an appropriate apparatus which receives and trans
mits its peculiar impressions; its mode of development also shows a
striking analogy between it and the retinal expansion.
   At the fiftieth hour of incubation, there is seen on either side of
the medulla oblongata, (which is not closed in above and presents
an open shallow cavity,) the first rudiment of the auditory sac, in
the form of a small circular-shaped protruded vesicle, communi
cating with the ventricular cavity from the lateral wall of which it
is an offset. The vesicle was hollow, clear and pellucid, and of a
flattened circular form. At the fifty-sixth hour it had increased in
size and presented a pear-shaped figure; so that now the narrow
contracted tubular portion appeared the first stage in the develop
ment of the auditory nerve; the dilated portion, the auditory sac or
rudimentary vestibule; and the cavity still existing in its interior
and communicating with the ventricular cavity from which it arises,
by means of the tubular prolongation, the auditory nerve. The
aperture of communication soon becomes smaller and more con
tracted, and this increases as the separation between the auditory
vesicle and its parent-cell takes place. At the sixty-fifth hour, be
sides a great increase in the size of the ear-bulb, the auditory nerve
has become more distinctly formed, and is quite solidified, so
that no communication can now be traced between the ventricular
cavity and the vestibular sac. It is in this stage of the development
of the auditory apparatus that a great similarity is to be observed
between it and the normal condition of the same part in some of
the lower animals.     There are, in fact, now formed the two element
ary portions of the auditory apparatus, the auditory nerve and the
simple vestibular sac. Such is the simple condition of the organ in
the Crustacea and Cephalopod Mollusks. At the seventy-second
hour, the vestibular sac has lost its oval form and presents a con
traction around its entire circumference.     This is the first indication
of the separation of the vestibule from the membranous semicircular
 canals which are ultimately formed from the terminal portion of the
vesicle.
   The minute examination of the development of these structures,
of which a consecutive detail is given, leads the author to remark
 on the almost precise similarity in structure of the membranous
labyrinth to the retina in its various stages of development, for it
consists like it of a delicate fibrous mesh in the areolae of which is
deposited granular matter and numerous nucleated cells, its outer
surface being composed of globular-shaped nuclei arranged similar
to those covering the outer surface of the retina at an early period
of its development.
   From this description a marked similarity may be observed be

                               Royal Society.                        549
tween the origin of this membrane and that of the retina. In both
cases they arise as a protruded portion of the cerebral mass, being
hollow and communicating with the cavity of the parent-cell. In
process of time, a gradual separation takes place between them and
the parts from whence they arise. They then assume a pyriform
shape, but still communicate with the cerebral cavity. As, however,
the nerves become solidified and the separation between them is
more fully effected, then no communication can be traced between
the two cavities.
   3. “Tide Researches.         Fourteenth Series.   On the Results of
continued Tide Observations at several places on the British Coasts.”
By the Rev. W. Whewell, D.D., F.R.S. &c.
   Tide observations made at several different parts of the British
and neighbouring shores, and in some instances continued for a con
siderable period, having been discussed by Mr. D. Ross of the
Hydrographer's Office, with great labour and perseverance, a brief
statement of the results which his labours afford is here presented
by Dr. Whewell.
   The discussions here referred to relate to the height of high water,
and the variations which this height undergoes in proceeding from
springs to neaps, and from neaps to springs. It is found, by ex
amining the observations at 120 places, and throwing the heights
into curves, that the curve is very nearly of the same form at all
these places. Hence the semi-mensual series of heights at any place
affords a rule for the series of heights at all other places where the
difference of spring height and neap height is the same. For in
stance, Portsmouth, where the difference of spring height and neap
height is 2 ft. 8 in., is a rule for Cork, Waterford, Inverness, Bantry,
Arcachan on the French coast, and other places: and the tables of
the heights of high water at one of these places suffices for all the
others, a constant being of course added or subtracted according to
the position of the zero-point from which the heights at each place
are measured.
   The series of heights of high water for a semi-lunation also agrees
very exactly, as to the form of the curve, with the equilibrium
theory. A very simple construction is given for the determination
of this curve. The properties deduced according to theory from
this construction are, however, in actual cases, modified in a manner
which is then described.
   1. The tides in these discussions are not referred to the transit of
the moon immediately preceding, but to some earlier transit, namely,
the second, third, fourth or fifth preceding transit, it being found
that in this way the accordance with the theory becomes more exact.
   2. According to this construction, the difference of springs and
 neaps would be to the height of neaps above low water springs as
 10 to 24, a constant ratio for all places; but in fact this ratio is dif
ferent at different places: and the observations under consideration
show that the ratio is smaller where the tide is smaller.
   In consequence of the law of the high water, given alike by the
theory and by the observations, the spring high waters are above the
 mean high water for a longer period than the neaps are below it.

 ON THE APPLICATION OF ELECTRO-MAGNETISM AS A MOTIVE
                 POWER.      BY MIR. ROBERT HUNT.
A"      a recent meeting of the Society of Arts, the author called
      attention, in the first place, to the numerous attempts which
have been made to apply electro-magnetism as a power for moving
machines, and referred to the apparatus employed by Jacobi, Dal
Negro, M“Gauley, Wheatstone, Hjorth, and others. Since, not
withstanding the talent which has been devoted to this inter
esting subject, and the large amount of money which has been
spent in the construction of machines, the public are not in posses
sion of any electro-magnetic machine which is capable of exerting
any power oeconomically; and finding that, notwithstanding the aid
given to Jacobi by the Russian government, that able experimentalist
has abandoned his experimental trials, the author has been induced
to devote much attention to the examination of the first principles
by which the power is regulated, with the hope of being enabled to
set the entire question on a satisfactory basis.
   The phaenomenon of electro-magnetic induction was explained;
and illustrations given of the magnetization of soft iron by means of
a voltaic current passing around it. The power of electro-magnets
was given, and the author stated his belief that this power could be
increased almost without limitation. A voltaic current produced by
the chemical disturbance of the elements of any battery, no matter
what its form may be, is capable of producing by induction a mag
netic force, this magnetic force being always in an exact ratio to the
amount of matter (zinc, iron, or otherwise) consumed in the battery.
   Several forms of the voltaic battery were explained, particularly
those of Daniell, Grove, Bunsen and Reinsch, the latter being con
structed without metals, depending entirely on the action between
two dissimilar fluids, slowly combining.
   The author had proved, by an extensive series of experiments,
that the greatest amount of magnetic power is produced when the
chemical action is the most rapid. Hence, in all magnetic machines,
it is more oeconomical to employ a battery under an intense action
than one in which the chemical action is slow. It has been proved
by Mr. Joule, and most satisfactorily confirmed by the author, that
one-horse power is obtainable in an electro-magnetic engine the
most favourably constructed to prevent loss of power, by the con
sumption of 45 lbs. of zinc, in a Grove's battery, in twenty-four
hours; while 75 lbs. are consumed in the same time to produce the
same power in a battery of Daniell's construction. The cause of
this was referred to the necessity of producing a high degree of ex
citement, to overcome the resistance which the molecular forces
offer to the electrical perturbations on which the magnetic force
depends.
   It was contended, that although we have not perhaps arrived at
the best form of voltaic battery, yet that we have learned sufficient

                  Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                                  551
of the law of electro-magnetic forces to declare, that, under any
conditions, the amount of magnetic power would depend on the
change of state, consumption of an element, in the battery, and that
the question resolved itself into this, What amount of magnetic
power can be obtained from an equivalent of any material consumed ?
The following were regarded as the most satisfactory results yet ob
tained:–1. The force of voltaic current being equal to 678, the
number of grains of zinc destroyed per hour was 151, which raised
9000 lbs. 1 foot high in that time. 2. The force of current being
relatively 1300, the zinc destroyed in an hour was 291 grs., which
raised 10.030 lbs. through the space of 1 foot. 3. The force being
1000, the zinc consumed was 223 grs., the weight lifted 1 foot
12,672 lbs.
   The estimations made by Messrs. Scoresby and Joule, and the
results obtained by CErsted, and more recently by Mr. Hunt, very
nearly agree; and it was stated that 1 gr. of coal consumed in the
furnace of a Cornish engine, lifted 143 lbs. 1 foot high, whereas
1 gr. of zinc consumed in the battery lifted only 80 lbs.                               The cost
of 1 cwt. of coal is under 9 pence, the cost of 1 cwt. of zinc is
above 216 pence. Therefore, under the most perfect conditions,
magnetic power must be nearly 25 times more expensive than steam
power. But the author proceeded to show that it was almost proved
to be an impossibility ever to reach even this condition, owing, in
the first place, to the rate with which the force diminishes through
space. As the mean of a great many experiments on a large variety
of magnets, of different forms and modes of construction, the fol
lowing results were given:—
   The magnet and armature being in contact, the lifting force
Was . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 220 pounds.
                                                 distant #5 of an inch 90.6 ...
                                                             T#5                     50.7  ...
                                                              w's                    50: 1
                     • -                                       50                    40-5  ..
   Thus at one-fiftieth of an inch distance four-fifths of the power
are lost. This great reduction of power takes place when the mag
nets are stationary. The author then proceeded to show that the
moment they were set in motion a great reduction of the original
power immediately took place; that, indeed, any disturbance pro
duced near the poles of a magnet diminished, during the continuance
of the motion, its attractive force; the attractive force of a magnet
being 150 lbs. when free of disturbance, fell to one-half by occa
sioning an armature to revolve near its poles. Therefore, when a
system of magnets which had been constructed to produce a given
power is set in revolution, every magnet at once suffers an immense
loss of power, and consequently their combined action falls in prac
tice very far short of their estimated power. This fact has not been
before distinctly stated, although the author is informed that Jacobi
observed it. And not merely does each magnet thus sustain an ac
tual loss of power, but the power thus lost is converted into a new

552           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
form of force, or rather becomes a current of electricity, acting in op
position to the primary current by which the magnetism is induced.
   From an examination of all these results, Mr. Hunt is disposed
to regard electro-magnetic power as impracticable, on account of its
cost, which must necessarily be, he conceives, under the best con
ditions, 50 times more expensive than steam power.
   The chairman agreed with Mr. Hunt in his conclusion of the im
probability of any result being obtained from electro-magnetism
which could enable it to compete with steam as a motive power.
At any rate, the point to which the attention of engineers and ex
perimentalists should be turned at present was, not the contriving
of perfect machines for applying electro-magnetic power, but the
discovery of the most effectual means of disengaging the power
itself from the conditions in which it existed stored up in nature.
Mr. Faraday assured us that in a single drop of water is contained
as much electricity as is developed in a thunder-storm. The portion
of this which we can liberate by any existing battery is very small,
so small, that, as shown by Mr. Hunt's paper, its practical use
cannot be profitable. The study of electro-chemistry, he thought,
was a more promising field, and one from which might at a future
time be developed a power which should supersede even steam.
   FIBROUS HYDRATE OF MAGNESIA, NEMALITE OF NUTTALL,
                       THOMSON AND CONNELL.
   The fibrous hydrate of magnesia, which was first discovered and
named by Nuttall without analysis, but which was considered by
 him as hydrate of magnesia, has been twice subjected to analysis
with very discordant results. Thomson, having examined a speci
men which contained a portion of silica, or silicate of magnesia,
mechanically intermixed, gave for this mineral the formula
                        MgO,SiO3 +2MgO,HO,
his analysis having given him about 12 per cent. of silica. Connell
has more recently analysed the same mineral, and, happening to
 have a specimen which contained no silica, but a considerable quan
tity of carbonate of magnesia, also mechanically intermixed, he gives
as the result of his analysis the formula
                     5MgO,HO+MgO,CO2+HO,
 a highly improbable one.
    Mr. Whitney has examined a specimen of this mineral from the ca
 binet of F. Alger, Esq., and finds that when perfectly pure it contains
 neither silica nor carbonic acid, but that it is a fibrous hydrate of mag
nesia, though it often occurs mixed with the silicate and carbonate
 of magnesia. If a few fine fibres of the mineral be placed in dilute
acid, the effervescence will be found to be but momentary, and con
 fined to the extremities of the fibres, where they were in contact

with the gangue; as soon as the adhering impurities have been
removed, the mineral dissolves without effervescence.                                -
   The following results of an analysis will show conclusively that
the nemalite is essentially hydrate of magnesia, or brucite, from
which it does not differ otherwise than by being in a fibrous state :

ANALYSES OF PECTOLITE AND STELLITE, AND PROPOSED UNION
          OF THESE TWO SPECIES.                   BY J. D. WHITNEY.
   Pectolite occurs on Isle Royale, Lake Superior, in spheroidal
masses, consisting of delicate silky fibres radiating from a centre,
which exactly resemble the foreign specimens of this mineral from
Monte Baldo. The radiated stellated mineral from Bergen Hill,
New Jersey, which was analysed by Beck, and supposed by him to
be identical with the stellite of Thomson, agrees also in external
characters with the pectolite. Specimens from Isle Royale and from
Bergen Hill fuse, like pectolite, readily, with but little intumescence,
to a colourless glass. They are easily dissolved by hydrochloric
acid, the silica separating as a flocky powder.
   The following are the results of the analysis of specimens of the
pectolite and stellite :
                      I.             II.                  III.          IV.

   I. and II. are specimens from Isle Royale. No. I. contains a con
siderable portion of alumina, which is evidently not essential to the
composition of the mineral, since II., resembling it entirely in ex
ternal appearance, gives only 14 per cent. The silica in both these

analyses contained a small quantity of substance insoluble in car
bonate of soda, evidently quartz, mechanically intermixed with the
finely-fibrous mineral.
   III. is the mineral from Bergen Hill, New Jersey, analysed by
Beck. He has erroneously given 6.8 per cent of magnesia in this
mineral.    Otherwise, substituting soda for magnesia, his analysis
agrees pretty nearly with the one given above, which was done
under my direction by Mr. J. S. Kendall. Hayes had also analysed
this mineral, and corrected Beck's analysis as far as relates to the
absence of magnesia and the presence of soda. He however did not
find that it contained water, which is essential to the composition of
pectolite.
   IV. is also a fibrous mineral from Bergen Hill, which evidently
agrees in composition with pectolite. It differs from the other spe
cimen from the same locality in its fibres being straight, and not
grouped together into star-like forms. This analysis was executed
at my request by Mr. G. J. Dickinson.
   It is evident that these minerals all agree in chemical composition
with the pectolite of Von Kobell, and also in external characters.
Slight differences in the results of the analyses may easily be ac
counted for by the difficulty of procuring a finely fibrous mineral in
a state of known freedom from intermixture with foreign substances.
   The formula given by Von Kobell for pectolite is—
              3(NaO, 3SiO3)+4(3CaO, 2SiO3) +3HO,
which formula requires—
                Silica . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 52-55
                Lime . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 34.94
                Soda    .. .. .... .. .. .. .. . . ..           9.70
                Water . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   2.79
                                                               99-98
   Frankenheim considers the water in the pectolite as unessential,
and allies this mineral with the augite family, from which it differs
widely in chemical characters. The constant presence of nearly
3 per cent. of water in all the analyses of the substance dried at
 100° C., makes it highly improbable that it should be merely acci
dental. In fact, the formula given above seems to be the only one
which could be adopted for this mineral.
   The original stellite, described by Thomson as occurring in Scot
land, was probably an impure specimen of pectolite, which mineral
it agrees with in external characters, as well as in chemical com
position, merely substituting soda for magnesia. The mineral de
scribed by the same chemist under the name of Wollastonite, under
 the erroneous impression that that name had not been generally
 adopted for table-spar, is also evidently identical with pectolite.
