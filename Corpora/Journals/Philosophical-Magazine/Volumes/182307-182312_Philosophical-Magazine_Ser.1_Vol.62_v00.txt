I. An  Essay on the Question, Whether there be two Electrical
  Fluids according to Du FAYE, or one according to FRANKLIN.
  By , Robert HARE, M.D. Professor of Chemistry in the
  University of Pennsylvania”.
BYmuch
   those who allege the existence of two electrical fluids,
        stress has been laid on the fact, that light bodies,
when negatively electrified, separate from each other no less
than when in the opposite state. The absence and presence
of a fluid cannot, it is said, have the same effect of producing
repulsion.     To this it has been answered, that the separation
of such   light bodies is not the effect of repulsion, but of an at
traction between them and the surrounding medium; which
must equally ensue whether they be electrified minus or plus:
since in either case that diversity of electrical excitement be
tween them and the surrounding medium arises, which is                          al
ways productive of attraction.
     n support of this view of the question             I
                                                  propose to make
a few observations.        In an electroscope with moveable coat
ings, like the galvanometer of Mr. Pepyst, the divergence of
the leaves is facilitated in proportion as the coatings are
approximated to them, whether the excitement be resinous or
vitreous.    In this case it must be admitted that there is an
attraction between the coatings and the leaves; for, were re
     †:
pulsion between the leaves the cause of their divergence, the
approach of the coatings would not increase                 it.
 It   may however          be
                            supposed, that the repulsion between
the             excited  leaves,  being counterbalanced, more                    or
less, in   allcases,     by
                          the electric tension          of
                                                   the surrounding
medium, the coatings may permit the electric fluid              re        to
cede through them with greater facility, and thus lessen the
electric tension    inthe direction    which they are situated.

                                                             §.
   Were this supposition to avail in the case of an electrome
ter with two leaves, it cannot apply in the case of an instrument
 lately contrived by me, in                      uninfluenced by the idea
 that repulsion is the cause of electrometrical indications,                                                             I
 suspend only a single leaf.            A brass ball, one-fourth of an
 inch in diameter, is so situated that it may be made to touch
 the leaf, or retire from it to the distance ºan inch, by means
 of a screw which supports                 (See Plate      fig.
                                                         it.           This           I.           1.)               in
 strument       evidently
                      is      more   simple,    and      far more     sensitive,     is
 than any instrument with two leaves heretofore contrived                                                           *.
     It will       admitted,
                          be        presume, that the contact between
                                               I
the ball and the leaf must result from attraction, whether the
             be          plus; and that this would not cease                                                             be
                                 a or
 leaf      minus                                                                                                to

the first.

     It has
          been observed, in favour of the French theory, that,
when the hands are made the medium of a feeble discharge, a
shock is felt simultaneously in the fingers only of each hand;
that, as the shock is made stronger, it affects the wrist, the
arm, and finally the chest. This is considered as proving the
operation of two distinct fluids; for, were the shock the effect
                         º
of one current, it would be experienced equally, though feebly,
 throughout the whole of the circuit. Admitting that such a
 current were necessary to the discharge, agreeably to Frank
 lin's theory, it            to be felt most in the fingers, where it is
 most    concentrated,      as torrents flow with greater violence in
proportion as their channels are narrowed. A current passing
from one coating of a Leyden jar to another, is far from being
necessary to restore the equilibrium of               surfaces.          its

II.     Description of an Electrical Plate Machine, the Plate
    mounted   horizontally, and so as to show both negative and
    positive Electricity. Illustrated by Engravings. By Robert
    HARE, M.D. Professor of Chemistry in the University of
    Pennsylvania".
THE  power of electrical plate machines has been generally
  admitted to be greater than that of machines with cylin
ders.   The objection to the former has been, the difficulty of in
sulating the cushions, so as to display the negative electricity.
Excepting the plate machine contrived by Van Marum, I have
read of none in which this difficulty has been surmounted.        It
is still insisted upon, by  respectable electricians,  as if it had

   I presume, therefore, that a description of a plate machine,
by which both electricities may be shown, and which, after
two years’ experience, I prefer on every account, may not be
unacceptable to the publict.
    My plate (thirty-four inches in diameter) is supported upon
an upright iron bar, about an inch in diameter, covered by a
very stout glass cylinder, four inches and a half in diameter,
and sixteen inches in height, open only at the base, through
which the bar is introduced, so as to form       axis. The sum                     its

        the bar   furnished with block

a  brass cap, which carries the plate.     The glass cylinder                                                      is
liable       to     no
              strain;       only pressed where
                                        it   is        interposed                        it

between the block                  of
                       wood within and the brass cap without.
The remaining portion             the cylinder bears only

   To find one third part of the arc A.E, or of R.B.-Draw
the line Rt Fr through the centre F of both the concentric
circles. Through the point c, which bisects the radius AF,
draw the chord Req, meeting the given circle in q. With
the radius q c, and centre c, describe the lunar arc qPd, inter

vent a confusion of sines, we will pass to the other side of the
diameter AB. Through the point of intersection d draw the
augmented sine dh.          Apply the chord of the arc Ad to the
arc Pd (as for the       quadrant)    from P to c, and through this
latter   point   c draw the sine   cg,  intersecting the given circle in
the    point   u.   The sine   ug   is the true sine, or is the sine of
 #d of the arc     AE,   or of Ad of the arc RB, and consequently

V. On     a Method     of  observing Solar Eclipses by means of the
   Altitude   and Azimuth Instrument.          By A CoRRESPONDENT.
    To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
A DAY  defence
                or two ago, after perusing Mr. Troughton’s able
                  of the altitude and azimuth instrument, it struck
me that it might be advantageously employed at the end (and
probably at the beginning) of the next solar eclipse to ascer
tain the moon's declination and right ascension, as well as the
longitude of the place of observation.
    The instrument being carefully orienté, observe the azimuth
(from the north) and the zenith distance of the point of con
tact, and correct the latter for refraction.
     With this datum, the calculated zenith distance of the sun’s
centre affected by parallax, and his semi-diameter (diminished
by irradiation?), find the angle formed at the sun's centre be
tween the zenith and the point of contact.                This angle, toge
ther with the (parallawed) Z. D. of the sun, and the sum of
the apparent semi-diameters, will give the moon’s azimuth and
 (parallawed) zenith distance.
    Admitting the earth to be a spheroid, the difference of the
true and apparent zeniths, together with the azimuths and
 zenith distances, afford data to diminish” the former and               in
 crease the latter to the quantities due to the reduced latitude.
     The parallaxes being subtracted from these transposed
 zenith distances, we find (as in lunars) the distances of the cen
tres of the sun and moon, and consequently the longitude
 of the observer.        The method of deducing the N. P.                di
 stance of the    moon,   as well as the right ascension, is sufficiently
 obvious.
     The apparent time of the end of the eclipse being known to
 great accuracy, it might serve to calculate the azimuth of the
 sun's centre; and consequently the semi-diameter. By com
 paring the two methods, we might learn the value of the irra
 diation.                                                               -
     An observer in possession of a well regulated chronometer
  furnished with a micrometer (or merely with vertical and
 luorizontal wires) might arrive at the same results by com
 paring the point of contact with the proper parts of the sun's
  disk.

rising so high as it now does near the bridge, and that there

and if London Bridge be removed, so that there be no ma
terial dam at low water, we have also to fill the pond now
caused by that dam.          This pond is from 4 to 6 feet deep at
the bridge, at low water; and we find that the level of low
water above bridge meets the bottom of the Thames between
Putney and Kew, viz. 10% miles above bridge: taking this as
the head of the pond, the average breadth at 600 feet at low
water, the mean depth to be filled at 2 feet, we have an addi
tion of 75 millions of cubic feet, or 1-57th of the quantity of
tide-water between London and Gravesend, or only 1-284th
of the whole quantity of tide-water within the Nore; therefore
the whole water which must pass the New Bridge, to raise the

  said bridge dangerous and destructive to the lives and proper
  ties of His Majesty's subjects”.” By reference to the Reports of
  the Committees of the House of Commons, of the sessions 1820
 and 1821, relating to this bridge, ordered to be printed May
 and June 1821, and upon abstracting from the evidence therein,
 relating to the loss of life and property in the last twenty years,
 the promoters of the demolition of the bridge cannot produce
 a statement of a greater number of persons drowned than 17,
 nor damage to property exceeding 4000l. by accidents at Lon
 don Bridge during that time. The evidence, with respect to
 the danger of the navigation through the bridge, of the lighter
 men examined, many of whom have navigated the river for
 forty years, is directly at variance with the opinions of those
 who are desirous of a new bridge, and attributes the accidents
 which occur, to mere ignorance and drunkenness.
     The sufficient stability of this bridge was ascertained in 1759,
 when the large arch was made, and unquestionably confirmed
 by the late examination of the structure of the piers +.
     The sufficient width of the bridge as a roadway, is main
tained by Mr. Rennie's evidence (16th April 1821), who, upon
 being asked, “What would you propose to make the width of
 the new bridge?” answered, “The same width as the old one;”
and added, London Bridge is wider than either Southwark,
 Blackfriars, or Waterloo Bridges. The width of the bridge, in
the clear of the parapets, in the design which received the first
premium, is only 44% feet, a less width than between the para
pets of the present bridgef; so that the mechanics and trades
men who urge the necessity of a new bridge, in the hope of
having a freer thoroughfare for themselves and their carts, will
Öe grievously disappointed.

    In the late application to architects and engineers, it seems
remarkable, that it had not occurred to the Bridge Committee,
that the supposed evil might have another remedy than a new
bridge; and out of the course of ordinary proceeding. It might
have suggested itself to some engineer, contemplating the di

 34.               Observations    on  taking down and
 rection of the mid stream of the Thames towards Pepper-alley
'stairs, and the bank of gravel that directs it in that course; or
 to some antiquary, who recollected King Canute's mode of con
 veying his fleet from the east side to the west side of London
 Bridge; or the direction of the cut which was made in 1173,
 when this bridge was rebuilt, that an auxiliary cut and bridge,
 round the foot of the present structure, north of Tooley-street,
 might be a cheaper mode of obtaining the proposed object than
 a new bridge; especially upon finding, upon inquiry, that be
 tween the linear waterway (690 feet) required, and the abso
 lute linear waterway of the present bridge (545 feet), there is
 only a deficiency of 145 feet; and between the superficial water
 way of London Bridge, and that of the section of the whole
 river, from Old Swan-stairs to Pocock's Flour wharf, at high
 water, there is only a deficiency of about 4000 feet.
     Others, deprecating the removal of the dam, but desirous
 of rendering the navigation, even when intrusted to unskilful
 and drunken lightermen, safe, and accustomed to view the
 locks on other rivers, and even upon this, may surmise, that
 the object might be obtained by locks”.
     It appears, that there are about 750,000l. in embryo
 for the new bridge, squaring, of course, with the estimates;
 but, upon referring to the bill brought into parliament, this
 session, for rebuilding London Bridge, there seems to have
 been originally some doubt as to the sufficiency of meanst; for
 it will be found, that the Commissioners of His Majesty's Trea
 sury were to be allowed to issue exchequer bills for the ap
 proaches, and they were also to be allowed to pay the expenses
 of the act, and direct taxes were to be levied on the public, on
 coals and wine imported into the city of London, for liquidat
 ing and paying the interests of these exchequer bills, under
    * Had the instructions to these candidates been unfettered, there might
 have been a renewal of Messrs. Douglas and Telford’s scheme for a cast-iron
 bridge of 600 feet span, with a rise of 65 feet above high water, for vessels
 to sail above London Bridge, and only at the cost of 262,2891.       The practi
 cability and advisableness of this bridge was certified by twelve out of fif
 teen mathematicians and engineers, though, at that time, neither the de
 signers, nor the committee,nor any of the mathematicians or engineers, knew
                                                                        .#
 the strength of cast-iron; and those who supposed they knew something of
 the matter, thought it forty times stronger than it since has been            to
 be: so easy is it to ask and receive opinions. But where a favourite object
 is to be carried, the data, upon which such opinions must be founded, are
 kept out of sight or mis-stated, or an inquiry into them is refused.
    + The amended bill makes the doubt approach to a certainty; for it is
 said to contain a specific clause, that no one shall be entitled to compensa
 tion for any nuisance, obstruction, or injury, on account of the bridge re
 maining unfinished, in case the sum or sums of money, to be raised and ad
 vanced, prove insufficient to complete the same.
                                                                             the

the screen of what is called the Orphans’ Fund, and indirectly,
by the introduction of a clause to exempt the corporation “from
the payment of any damage to persons, or their houses, estates,
vessels, or property, by reason of the increased rise of the tide
of the said river above the said bridge, or the alteration of the
channels or currents of the said river, or of the want of water
for navigating the same, nor for any nuisance, obstruction,    -
                                                                           or
injury, to be occasioned thereby”.”
    But it being understood that the direct taxes might be                                                       in
                                                                       .
digestible, that part of the bill is struck out, and a less visible
mode of taxation is to be adopted, by allowing the Commis
sioners of Customs and of Excise,              England, Ireland, and
Scotland, with consent of the Lords of the Treasury, to remit
taxes on stone, brick, timber, or other materials used in build
ing the bridge, and                 its
                            appurtenances.       For this purpose, the

     water, at high water, is 46 feet.
2. The approaches are to be made through property of great
     value, and in a thoroughfare of persons and carriages as
     close as sheep in a flock.
3. On removing the old bridge.
    * Many great losses will be sustained by individuals under the heads of
 these items, but for which they will be shut out from having any compen
sation from the City; nevertheless they must be considered part of the cost
of the new bridge. It may be proper to inquire, who are to be subject to
these actions, suits, indictments, claims, and demands, which are thus shifted:
from the mayor, commonalty, and citizens?               On the northern shore, we

4. On raising about 40 miles of river wall, varying from 24
    to 26 inches in height, and strengthening the banks by
    wharfing and piling, in order to provide against the effects
    of frequent floods, expectant on giving a freer water-way,
    and increased velocity and height, to the current.
5. On dredging out a channel for the current at low water, for
-   the navigation.
6. On the necessity of narrowing the river in several parts.
7. On removing shoals and sand-banks, caused by the altera
    tion in the directions of the mid stream.
8. On the erection of starlings round the piers of the different
    bridges, and especially round Vauxhall and Westminster
    Bridges, which do not stand upon piles. . The bridges
    above London Bridge generally stand in shallow water,
    and the foundations of them are very little below the bed
    of the river, which may be undermined; for a greater
    depth must be effected artificially, in the first instance,
    for the navigation, and subsequently, by the increased
    velocity of the stream, in a manner
                                   -      which cannot now be
    guessed at".

    up the water, as a substitute for the dam taken down, the
    necessity for which, the locks up the river, beginning at
       Teddington, prove f.
10.    On the damage to shipping below the bridge, in times of
    frost, by ice now stopped, at such times, by London Bridge.
11. On compensations to persons possessed of wharfs, adapted
    to the present state of the river above and below the bridge,
    for damage to them by the alterations in the course of the
    stream, and the shifting of the sand banks.
12. On compensation to persons whose trades are dependent
    on the free thoroughfare over the bridge, living south and
    north thereof, for seven years, during the erection, or while
    it remains unfinished for want of funds to complete                                             it.

44                Summary Review                  of the late Investigations
     “In taking the temperature of the water in the different
levels of mines, care was generally observed to select the largest
streams, and to put the thermometer at or near the places where
they first flow into the mines, so that the influence of any heat
from the miners seems to be put out of the question.”

     remarkable double star. . According to Piazzi the pre
     ceding star is 3.4 mag., the following 3 mag., diff R.A.
     5"-8 determined with the utmost care: diff. Decl. 0"-0.
     In a note he remarks, that Dr. Hornsby first determined
     the distance of the stars in R.A. = 3"-8, which measure
     remained constant for 20 years. Castor is the first of Sir
     W.     Herschel's 2nd class          of double stars, and in his           ori
      ginal catalogue (Phil. Tr. 1782) he sets down the distance
      5":156 diameters included.          Pos. 32°.8 m. prec. In the
      volumes for 1803 and 1804, this indefatigable observer
      stated the results deduced from a series of observations
      from 1783 to 1803, viz. –that the two stars revolved
      round their common centre of gravity in 342 years; in a
      plane nearly perpendicular to the visual line. This dis
      covery, which appears to have been wholly unknown to
      Piazzi, will account for the discordance between his mea
      surement and that of Hornsby.

 XII.   Observations on M. LAPLACE’s Communication to the Royal
    Academy of Sciences, “Sur l’Attraction des Sphères, et sur
    la Répulsion des Fluides élastiques.” By John HERAPATH,
        Esq.                                                                      -
     the first of May 1821, I published in the Annals of
 ONPhilosophy   a theory of gaseous bodies, mathematically
drawn from the Newtonian theory of heat. An announcement
of the publication and objects of the paper which contained
this theory, and which had been in the hands of the principal
members of the Royal Society from the May preceding, was
sent to the Marquis de Laplace in June 1821.             On the 10th
 of the following September, this nobleman communicated to
 the Royal Academy of Sciences a paper, whose professed ob
ject is to demonstrate from the principles of caloric the known
laws of permanent airs, the same that my paper contained.
Unfortunately                I
                    did not meet with M. Laplace's paper until
towards the fall of 1822; at which time             first saw it in the           I

 object of M. Laplace's paper with that of a part of mine, and
 itsbeing presented         the Royal Academy           long after the

manifest that any molecule whatever of this gas will every

to maintain the temperature unchanged, it must radiate as many
rays as it stifles. In any other space of the same temperature
the molecule will be struck by the same quantity of calorific
rays; the same part of which as before it will absorb and re

66                 Mr. Herapath     on Elastic Fluids.
decided by experiment. According to his conclusions, the
march of an air thermometer is a correct indicator of the            in
 crease of caloric; and according to my theory the said march
 is proportional to the difference of the squares of the true tem
peratures. If therefore equal weights of any two bodies were
 mixed at the Fahr. temperatures 32° and 212°, by his theory
 the resulting temperature
                     -            should be 122°, the arithmetical
 mean; and by mine 118}^+ (
                                      w"A48+ 32
                                                +  :/º)"—as.
 With a greater interval of temperature, a greater difference
 would exist.      Now as far as experiments go on this subject,
 they are unequivocally in my favour.              Every philosopher
 who has tried such an          experiment    has,   I   believe, found
 the   resulting   temperature     beneath the arithmetical mean.
 Even Crawford, who made experiments in a manner the most
 unaccountable for any one who had hopes of success, found
 his results less than M. Laplace's theory would give; and by
 the only two of De Luc's experiments that I have yet seen,
 there are variations from M. Laplace's theory of 3° and 24° in
 defect, and from mine of only #8 and Tº" in excess. I have
 also made some experiments on this subject myself, which
 accord with the conclusions       I have drawn equally as well as
De Luc's; but in consequence of being deprived of the means
of deciding the value of some corrections through a material
                                I
accident to my apparatus, have not yet been able to put them
in a condition for publication.
    It were much to be wished that some decisive experiments
of this kind were undertaken by those who have proper appa
ratus and opportunities. A determination of the true quantity
                                                                          *
of deflection from the arithmetical mean of equal weights of
the same body mixed at unequal temperatures, would at once
settle the grand point respecting the real indications of thermo
meters; and consequently establish laws of the highest impor
tance IIl SCIence.                                  -                   º

   It has often been remarked that those things which suc
ceed in model often fail entirely when tried on a large scale;
and it is equally true that many things succeed on the large
scale which promise very little when tried in model; one of the
most striking examples of the latter kind is a ship. What can
afford less prospect of stability than experiments made on a
small floating body?—what individual, not deeply versed in
the theory of statics, would have ventured to construct a ship
on such experiments?         The machine described in the pam
phlet before us is of a similar nature: in a drawing, or small
model, it seems as if nothing less than the most nice equili

    This   new    railway    consists of a single rail supported by
equidistant pillars; it is raised above the common surface of
the ground to the height of about 3 feet; and the load is sus
pended from the axles of two wheels which run one before
another on the upper edge of the rail. The construction of
the frame is such, that the centres of suspension of the load
are below the virtual centre of support; therefore the equilibrium
is always stable, the virtual centre of support being equivalent
to the metacentre of a ship”.          But since the load on each side
of the rail may happen to be unequal, the change of position,
which would be a necessary consequence of this unequal distri
bution, is counteracted by the breadth of the surface of the rail;
and the stability may be greatly increased, if necessary, by add
ing braces to the bars which suspend the load to the axles.
    By adopting this railway, a perfectly even and adjustable
plane with a very small degree of resistance may be obtained:
elevated so as to be free from dust, or other extraneous mat
ters, “no further preparation is requisite for the moving power
than an ordinary towing-path.            The horse draws by a towing
rope connected to the carriages, and proceeds on one side of
the rail; and as his height will vary with the natural undula
tions of the surface of the ground, he will sometimes be below
the surface of the rail, and is consequently provided with a
length of rope which allows a considerable variation of -height
without much altering the angle of traction.”
    The various contrivances that may be employed to ren
der loading and unloading, passing, crossing roads, brooks,
rivers, ravines, &c. easy and simple, are fully described, and
illustrated by two beautiful engravings.             But the author has
not confined his work to a description of his ingenious rail
way alone; he gives some interesting particulars respecting
other kinds of railways, with a table of experiments showing
the effect produced by a given power on different kinds of rails,
Also some very curious remarks on the friction of axles, and
a description of an improved dynamometer on a principle
analogous to that which Coulomb employed to check the irre
gular oscillations of delicately suspended needles in his ex
periments on magnetism.
    It appears, from the experiments described in the work,
that, allowing the force of a horse to be 150 lbs, one horse will
be capable of drawing about 20 tons upon a level railway on
Mr. Palmer's principle; on a good hard and level turnpike
   * Our readers will find this principle of stability illustrated in a recent
work on the Elements of Natural Philosophy, by Professor Leslie, where it
is applied to explain the curious phaenomena of rocking or laggan stones.

son, and S. Esk in the county of Forfar, with some general
Observations on the Geology of that County: accompanied
with Specimens; by Charles Lyell, Esq. Sec. G.S.
     The county which formed the principal subject of this com
munication is situated on the southern flank of the Grampians;
it is occupied by old    red sandstone,             and argilla
ceous schist, with their associated porphyries.   The strata are
clearly exposed by the rivers that cut through them.       They
are  very highly  inclined,  and  dip for the most part  towards
the south. The old red sandstone may be described as con
sisting of two formations of sandstone, with a formation of
conglomerate of great thickness interposed between them. An
extensive formation of felspar porphyry occurs in the lower
part of the conglomerate; and it is from the broken and rolled
fragments of this porphyry that the conglomerate is for the most
part composed.      Between the porphyry and the conglomerate
a rock  prevails of a mixed character, which seems intermediate
between the   two,  and which it is difficult to describe or ac
count for. The lower red sandstone which is beneath the
conglomerate is in many parts seen to be traversed by a mass
or dyke of greenstone, which passes into serpentine,          in which
form it continues    through   a  great   part  of      course;    its
                                                                    lies      it
parallel with the strata.      The lower red sandstone, which                      is
for the most part schistose and not            great thickness, alter

 Alexander Caldcleugh, Esq. M.G.S.—The mountains in the
neighbourhood of Rio de Janeiro are for the most part com
   osed of gneiss, intersected by granite veins.  A   siliceous sta
          was observed by the author to form in this district, from
the overhanging masses of gneiss; specimens of which were
presented to the Society. As the absence of hot springs makes
the occurrence of these stalactites of very considerable interest,
 Mr. Caldcleugh offers the following hypothesis to explain their
 formation: The water, which in Brazil constantly trickles
down the bare sides of the hills, often reaches a temperature
as high as 140° or 150° of Fahr.: this warm water descending
on decomposing strata of gneiss, such as is the case with that
from which these specimens are taken, seizes the potash of the
felspar, and then acts upon the quartz, and forms a siliceous
 stalactite.   Some of the hot springs, or geysers, of Iceland do
 not reach the boiling point, and perhaps the quantity of silex
 dissolved, the inverse of what is shown to be the case with car
 bonate of lime, may in a great measure depend on the tem
 perature of the alkaline solvent.
    June 27.—A Paper was read, entitled “Observations on
 the Quartz Rock Mountains of the West of Scotland and
 North of Ireland, more particularly those of Jura, with an      Ac
 count of the ancient Beaches and Trap Dikes of that Island,
 accompanied by a Plan and Sections.”—The quartz rock is
 traced in a succession of districts, from Lerwick in Shetland
 to the county of Donegal in Ireland, and in Jura the thickness
  of the mass is estimated at 10,260 feet. The similarity and

singularity of form assumed by quartzrockmountains, in districts
remote from each other, is deduced from the peculiar construc
..".
tion and material of the mountain mass, acted upon by powerful
aqueous currents. Quartz rock is of great extent in the county
             where in one instance it rests immediately on gra
nite; and at the murkish mountain contains a bed of pure
siliceous sand of considerable thickness.-The author proceeds
to notice the ancient beaches of Jura, which appear hitherto
to have escaped observation: these occur on both shores of Loch
Tarbert, and are disposed in six or seven terraces, rising re
                           -
gularly from the present shore, above which the highest is ele
vated about forty feet: the breadth occupied by these beaches
in some instances amounts to three-fourths of a mile, and their
line or extent has been traced eight or ten miles.—The author
concludes with a description and remarks on the trap dikes of
Jura: these are extremely numerous, and remarkable for pre
serving courses nearly parallel to each other, and nearly in the
line of dip of the quartz rock which they traverse; which gives
occasion for offering some reasons to account for that particu
lar disposition.

 M. Seebeck. They consist of a series of bars, alternately of
brass and of iron; of conductors of different sizes, one of which
is reduced in the middle to a very small thickness, and which
are to form a communication between the two ends of the pre
ceding apparatus; and of one piece to form a communication
by very fine wires of different lengths.

    Lieut. Col. Wright of the royal engineers, who lately came
over land from India, brought a small quantity of this natural
production from Persia. The natives apply it to the same uses
that lemons and limes are used for elsewhere, namely, to make
their sherbets, of which considerable quantities are used, they

being prohibited the use of wine. The acid earth is found in
         quantities at a village called Daulakie, in the south of
   ersia, between three and four days’ journey from Bushire
on the Persian Gulf.
    Some analytical experiments made on a few grains of it b

W. H. Pepys, Esq. gave the following results:—About one fift
is soluble, by trituration, in boiling distilled water. The solu

yields copious precipitates with nitrate and with muriate of
barytes—indicating the presence of sulphuric acid. The
triple prussiate gave a strong blue precipitate; and the sul
phuret of ammonia a copious blackish brown precipitate—
proofs of the presence of iron. The solution, when evaporated
nearly to dryness, yielded crystals, which by their figure and
taste seemed to be acidulous sulphate of iron.               The earthy
matter was not     examined,—the      principal  aim of the experiments
being only to ascertain the nature of the free acid in a product
so abundant, where it is found, that it might be taken up in cart
loads.
       VARIETIES OF THE LYNX IN THE NORTH OF EUROPE.
    The subjoined observations on some varieties of the Lynx
occurring in the north of Europe are extracted from Mr. De
Capell Brooke's Travels through Sweden, Norway, and Fin
mark, to the North Cape; a work which contains many                                     in
teresting notices respecting the zoology of those countries.
They may assist, perhaps, in removing from the history of the
smaller feline animals principally characterized by having tufted
ears, a portion of that obscurity which seems at present to
pervade    it.                                                     -     -

great pleasure in acquainting you, my dear friend, of my safe
arrival at Fez, after having been detained at Tangier till a
letter had been forwarded from Mr. Douglas, His Britannic
Majesty's Consul at Tangier, to the Minister at Fez, to obtain
permission from the Emperor for me to approach his capital.
As soon as a favourable answer was received, we started for
this place, and in ten days arrived here in safety with my better
half, who, having succeeded in persuading me to take her as
far as Tangier, has also enforced her influence to proceed to
Fez; but this, though much against her will, must be her me
plus ultra. Yesterday, I had the honour to be presented to His
Majesty the Emperor, and was highly gratified with his recep
tion of me.—He was acquainted that had letters of introduc I
tion from Mr. Wilmot Horton to the Consul in Tangier,
from whom I received the greatest hospitality, and who did all
in his power to promote my wishes.        The fortunate circum
stance of my having known the Prime Minister of His Majesty
whilst at Cairo, on his return from Mecca to this country, is
also much in my favour; and though a great deal has been
said against my project by the commercial party, particularly
by the Jews of this country, who monopolize           the traffic               all                    of
the interior,   obtained His Majesty's permission

78                Obituary.—Coloncl   Lambton.
testimony to the extent and importance of the labours of Co
lonel Lambton, in his measurement of an arc of the meridian
in India, extending from Cape Comorin, in lat. 8. 23. 10. to
a new base line, measured in lat. 21.6., near the village of
Takoorkera, 15 miles S.E. from the city of Ellichpore, a di
stance exceeding that measure by the English and French
Geometers, between the parallels of Greenwich and Tormen
tara in the Island of Minorca.
   It was the intention of Colonel Lambton to have extended
                                             sº
the arc to Agra, in which case the meridian line would have
passed at short distances from Bhopaul,
 Gualiar, and Dholpore.
                                                        Nurwur,
                             At his advanced age, he despaired
of health and strength remaining for further exertion; other
wise it cannot be doubted that it would have been a grand
object of his ambition to have prolonged it through the Dooab,
and across the Himalays, to the 32d degree of north latitude.
If  this vast undertaking had been achieved, and that it may yet
                                                        j
be completed is not improbable, British India will have to
boast of a much larger unbroken meridian line than has been
before measured on the surface of the globe.
    Though the measurement of the Arc of the Meridian was
the principal object of the labours of Colonel Lambton, he
extended his operations to the East and West, and the set of
triangles covers great part of the Peninsula of India, defining
with the utmost precision the situation of a very great number
of principal places in latitude, longitude, and elevation; and
affording a sure basis for an amended Geographical Map,
which is now under preparation. The triangulation also con
nects the Coromandel and Malabar coasts in numerous im
                §.
portant points, thus supplying the best means of truly layin
down the shape of those coasts, and rendering an
service to navigation.
   It was the             intention to have himself carried the
meridian line as far north as Agra, and he detached his first
assistant, Captain Everest, of the Bengal Artillery, to extend
a series of triangles westward to Bombay, and when that ser
vice should be completed eastward to Point Palmyras, and
probably Fort William, by which extensive and arduous ope
ration, the three Presidencies of India would be connected,
and several obvious advantages gained to geography and navi
   tion. But it is in the volumes of the proceedings of various
 earned Societies, that the accounts of the labours of this ve
teran philosopher, whose loss we lament, must be looked for,
and who for 22 years carried on his operations in the ungenial
climate with unabated zeal and perseverance, and died full of
years and conscious of a well deserved reputation.—Madras

mass must have subsided into a state of repose which could no

          If
         we admit that water is one of the principal agents in

  which it acts, upon either of the hypotheses we have just laid
 down concerning the heat of volcanic furnaces. If we sup
  pose, according to the first hypothesis, that the earth continues
  in a state of incandescence, at a certain depth below                       sur                           its

  that depth; for the temperature               the earth having formerly

cano, or at the surface of the earth by means of air, hydro
chloric acid must necessarily be produced.                  Messrs. Monti
celli and Covelli have in fact observed the production of
acid vapours in crevices, nearly incandescent; but they took
them for sulphurous acid. I am, on the contrary, convinced
that they were essentially composed of hydrochloric acid. It is
allowable to doubt the accuracy of their observation, since they
have expressed considerable uncertainty as to the nature of
these acid vapours, whether they were sulphurous or muriatic.

     Thenecessity which appears to me to exist for the agency
of water in volcanic furnaces, the presence of some hundred
parts of soda in lava, as also of sea-salt and of several other
chlorides, renders it very probable that it is sea-water which
most commonly penetrates into them.        One objection, how
ever, which        I
                 ought not to conceal, presents itself; namely,
that it appears necessarily to follow from this supposition, that
the streams of lava would escape through the same channels
which had served to convey the water, since they would expe
rience a slighter resistance in them than in those through which
                                                                               j
they are raised to the surface of the earth. It might also be
expected that the elastic fluids formed in volcanic furnaces be
fore the ascent of lava to the surface of the earth, would fre
quently boil up through those same channels to the surface of
the sea.       I
             am not aware that such a phaenomenon has ever been
observed, though it is very probable that the mophètes, so
common in volcanic countries, are produced by these elastic
                                                     -
fluids.
   On the other hand, we may remark that the long intervals.
between the eruptions and the state of repose in               volcanos
remain for a great number of years, seem to demonstrate that
their fires become extinguished, or at least considerably dead
ened; the water would then penetrate gradually by             own pres              its

was so dense that our candles were of little use: it had the temperature of
74°, and was extremely oppressive, which induced us to descend by another
route.”
      i “The adit is 32 fathoms deep: the water here (at the distance of 260
 fathoms from the mouth of the pump by which it is drawn up) was 54°;

 of the air of a small mine, I found the air in the adit, on our return, 1°

 contiguous to them than the others.”
     | This was in a confined end; here the water issuing from two small

   “Since the temperature of the different parts of this mine[Oatfield] has been
 taken, the pumps have been drawn up from the deepest part, and the shaft,
below the depth of 182 fathoms, has been for some months full of water. At

   “In    making     few observations on the foregoing experi
                         a
ments,”    Mr. Moyle continues,                         “I
                                         must remark, in the first
place that in mines which are at work scarcely two places of
equal depth below the surface, and under similar circum
stances, exhibit the same temperature; nor can I find, where
it increases with the depth, that there is any certain ratio; it
being often, as in Oatfield, colder at 70 than at 40 fathoms
deep. As these differences and irregularities of temperature
always occur in mines which are at work, they must arise from
adventitious causes.       I am therefore of opinion that the true
temperature of any part of a mine in the full course of work
ing, is difficult of attainment, and that we must have recourse
to those mines, and parts of mines, which have been long since
quitted by the miner, in order to obtain any thing like a true
datum.”
   “Most of the deep mines now at work show an increase of
temperature of more than 1° for every 10 fathoms of descent;
at least it amounts to this on the whole, although                    pro                       its

   “Mr. Fox commences at 50 feet, and Dr. Forbes at 200
feet below the surface; and from the extreme temperature ob
served in our deepest mines, would deduct 6° for artificial and
extraneous causes of heat, thus reducing the actual degree at
about 1300 or 1400 feet to from 72° to 74°4; and after the
ratio of 1° for every 50 feet, it would be at the depth of 1044
feet, 689.   Now reverse the order of calculation, and we shall
find Mr. Fox to make it 69%", and Dr. Forbes 664° for the
same depth. This is the precise depth of the lowest of the
three levels driven under Trenoweth from Crenver, the tem
perature of which is actually only 58°, although a spot not
in the course of working, yet has a distant communication
with the mine in general, and at a working spot on the same
level, the temperature is but 68°, after being exposed to                                                             all

instances of the above kind, which Dr. F. brings forward in sup
port of his conclusions, viz. those of the collections of water in
the mines of Botallack and Little Bounds; observing, with re
spect to the first, that “the heat of this water at the bottom of the
working is not given;" and asking, as to the second, the tempera
ture of which, Dr. Forbes states, “as discharged by the pumps
 in 1822, is 56}.”—“Pray what has this to do with the tem
perature of the central part or bottom of the collection?”—
 “And yet Dr. F.,” continues Mr. M., “in nearly the following
page, states, that a large body of water resembling the last
 has accumulated in the old wrought part of Ding-Dong mine;
 at the depth of 444 feet below the surface, the workmen had
just cut through the barrier which divided them from this old
working, and the stream of water which issued forth (and
which was the bottom of the large collection) was only 524,

arises from the decomposition of pyrites, which abounds in
coal and the accompanying strata, and that this is the cause
of the high temperature of hot springs. This opinion, how
ever, does not seem to be well founded.   Although in the very                             .
extensive coal-mines of Great Britain, pyrites abound in great
quantities; yet in no instance was pyrites ever found decom
posed in situ, although the coal abounds with water, and gives
out carbonic acid gas and carburetted hydrogen, but never
atmospheric air, and the pyrites only decomposes when ex
posed to the action of oxygen.       Had pyrites been liable to
decompose in situ, the greater part of the coal-fields in the
world would have been destroyed by spontaneous ignition;
but this spontaneous ignition only takes place in coal-mines
where the pyrites is thrown into the waste, and exposed to
the action of atmospheric air, and the moisture of the strata.
If pyrites is the cause of the high temperature of hot springs,
these springs would vary continually, both in temperature and
composition, according to the extent of surface exposed to the
decomposing action.”         -

     EMBRACE         this opportunity of sending you part of a se

 Electro-magnetism.
    It will be recollected, that in my former paper observed             I
that there were eight parts on each side of the equator of the
needle which appeared to be attracted and repelled by the con
necting wire of the Voltaic apparatus.
     I
     also closed that paper by showing, that these attractions and
repulsions were the reverse on that part of the wire connected
with the zinc (or positive) side of the apparatus, to what they
were with the part connected with the copper (or negative) side.
     Inext wished to ascertain if it were possible to demonstrate
an uniform direction of any particular part of the needle
round the positive and negative wires.

  I now wished to see      what effects would be produced on the
needle by the positive wire; for which purpose,
   Erp. 5, It was brought near the left side of GH, Fig. 13
(see last Number), in which situation it ascended.
   Exp. 6. It was then removed to the under part of the wire,
when it turned to the left.                   -
   Erp. 7. It was next placed on the right side: here it descended.
   Erp. 8. And finally, when it was brought above the wire, it
passed off to the right : which may be represented by Fig. 2,
in which it will be seen that the motions of the needle at the
positive wire are the reverse of those at the negative wire: and if
the south end of the needle be made use of, all the above effects
are reversed; from which it must appear, that there was an
evident tendency of the needle to rotate round the positive and
negative wires, but in opposite directions.
   Erp. 9. Having shown, in a lecture which I delivered be
fore the above Society, that when an electrical discharge of a
battery of five jars, equal to twenty-one coated feet, was inade
to traverse a helix which was coiled from left to right, and
which contained pieces of steel, it               not
                                            only communicated                             to
them magnetic properties, but their north poles were directed
towards the positive side      the battery.

 this cave than in any other, excepting Kirkdale. To these
 waters, however, we must still refer the introduction of the
 brown loam, and the formation or laying open of the present
  mouth of the cavern; from                   its

it might be found in many other places; certainly it must have
been formed in the old Franklin furnace, in Sussex county
New-Jersey, where so many fruitless attempts were made to
work the Franklinite.
   Before        I
              conclude these remarks, I must observe, that it
does not   appear that the presence of zinc affects the properties
of iron. In   Belgium   the iron is of good quality; and it is an
interesting fact, that the bar-iron of Ancram is in great de
mand at 8120 per ton, a higher price than is at present paid
for any imported iron. The castings from the Ancram fur
pace are in such a repute, that no other pigs are used at the
 West Point Foundry for the heavy guns (32 and 42 pounders)
now casting for the United States' navy.
   The Ancram furnace equals, in beauty of workmanship, and
economy of means, any that we have seen; and we entertain
no doubt, that               all
                    works carried       with such admirable per    on
fection, must and will always prove equally honourable and
profitable     to
              their owners and directors.

   Note.—The periodic times of the planets and satellites were taken from
the fourth edition of Laplace's Système du Monde, the time being converted
from solar to sidereal days in the proportion of 1°0027378 to 1. The mass
or attractive power of the sun, and planets, was also taken from the same
work, from which with the                time, and constant product, the distances
of all the satellites from t eir primaries were computed. The distance of
the ring of Saturn, is the distance from the centre of the planet to the
centre of attraction in the cylinder of the ring, or the centre of gravity of a

XXVI.       Notice of the Fusion of Plumbago, or Graphite,

INanda former  letter published in my Journal, (vol. v. p. 108,)
        in an additional notice, (p. 361 same vol.) I gave an ac
count of the fusion and volatilization of charcoal, by the use of                                           .
your Galvanic Deflagrator. I have now to add, that the fusion
of plumbago   was accomplished yesterday by the same instru
                          I
ment, and that have again obtained the same results to-day.
For this purpose, from a piece of very fine and beautiful plum
bago, from North Carolina, I sawed small parallelopipeds,
about one eighth of an inch in diameter, and from three fourths
of an inch to one inch and a quarter in length : these were
sharpened at one end, and one of them was employed to point
one pole of the deflagrator, while the other was terminated by
prepared charcoal.          Plumbago being in               natural state     its                      a
conductor, (although inferior             prepared charcoal,)         spark

 plumbago, which had been in the focus of heat; but this point
             a hemispherical excavation, and the plumbago there
   ad the appearance of black scoriae or volcanic cinders. These
 were the general appearances at the copper pole occupied by
 the plumbago.                                                              -
    On the zinc pole, occupied by the prepared charcoal, there
 were very peculiar results.       This pole was, in every instance,
elongated towards the copper pole, and the black matter, ac
cumulated there, presented every appearance of fusion, not
into globules, but into a fibrous and striated form, like the half
flowing slag found on the upper currents of lava. It was
evidently transferred, in the state of vapour, from the plum
bago of the other pole, and had been formed by the carbon
taken from the hemispherical cavity. It was so different from
 the melted charcoal, described in my former communications,
 that itsorigin from the plumbago could admit                          of

                         them, and generally they were those most
remote from the focus, were                jet black, like the most per

the zinc   pole  were   perfectly  black,    while   very few    those       of             on
the copper pole were otherwise.               one instance, when

 dish, they rolled about like shot, when the vessel was turned
 one way and another.          To detach any portions of unmelted
 plumbago which might adhere to them, I carefully rubbed them
 between my thumb and finger in the palm of my hand.                                    I
 then placed them upon a fragment of Wedgwood ware, floated
in a dish of mercury, and slid over them a small jar of very
pure oxygen gas, whose entire freedom from carbonic acid
had been fully secured by washing it with solution of caustic
 soda, and by subsequently testing it with recently prepared
lime-water; the globules were now exposed to the solar focus
from the lens mentioned volume v. page 363.                 It was near
 noon, and the sky but very slightly dimmed by vapour; al
 though they were in the focus for nearly half an hour, they
 did not melt, disappear, or alter their form; it appeared, how
                                        º,
 ever, on examining the gas, that they had given up part of
 their substance to the oxygen, for carbonic acid was formed,
which gave a decided precipitate with lime-water.                 Indeed
 when we consider that these               had been formed in a heat
 vastly more intense than that of the solar focus, we could
 not reasonably expect to melt them in this manner, and they
are of a character so highly vitreous, that they must necessarily
 waste away very slowly, even when assailed by oxygen gas.
 In a long continued experiment, it is presumable that they
would be eventually dissipated, leaving only a residuum of
iron. That they contain iron is manifest, from their being at
tracted by the magnet, and their colour is evidently owing to
this metal.     Plumbago, in            by

     The opinion which                     stated as to the passage of a
 current from the copper to the zinc pole of the deflagrator, is
in my view fully confirmed. Indeed, with the protection of
    een glasses, my eyes are sufficiently strong to enable me to
look steadily at the flame during the whole of an experiment,
 and   I  can distinctly observe matter in different forms passing
 to the zinc pole, and collecting there, just as we see dust or
 other small bodies driven along by a common wind; there is
 also an obvious tremor, produced in the copper pole, when the
 instrument is in vigorous action, and we can perceive an evi

 134    Professor Silliman's Eaperiments with the Blowpipe
 rived, as the combustion of part of the carbon may have
 somewhat diminished the proportion of that substance.     find    I
 that the fusion of the plumbago by the compound blowpipe
 is by no means difficult, and the instrument being in good
 order, good results may be anticipated with certainty. As
 the press is waiting while     I
                            write, it is not in my power to de
 termine the nature of all of these various coloured globules,

bules are owing to earths combined with the plumbago, or
whether they are a different form of carbon. If the former be
true, it proves that no existing analysis of plumbago can be
correct, and would still leave the remarkable white fume, so
abundantly exhaled between the poles of the deflagrator, and
so rapidly transferred from the copper to the zinc pole, entirely
unaccounted for.          I
                       would add, that for the mere fusion of
plumbago, the blowpipe is much preferable to the deflagrator,
but a variety of interesting phaenomena in relation to both
plumbago and charcoal are exhibited by the latter and not by
the former.
            Postscript, April 18. Fusion of Anthracite.
    The anthracite of Rhode-Island is thought to be very pure.
 Dr. William Meade (see Bruce's Journal p. 36) estimates its
 proportion of carbon at ninety-four per cent. This anthracite
I  have just succeeded in melting by the compound blowpipe,
 It gives large brilliant black globules, not attractable by the
 magnet, but in other respects not to be distinguished from the
 dark globules of melted plumbago. The experiment was
 entirely successful in every trial, and the great number of the
 globules and their evident flow from, and connexion with, the
 entire mass, permitted no doubt as to their being really the       *  *
 melted anthracite.
    The Kilkenny coal gave only white and transparent globules;
 but it seems rather difficult to impute this to impurities, since this
 anthracite is stated to contain ninety-seven per cent. of carbon.
    I have exposed a diamond this afternoon to the solar focus
 in a jar of pure oxygen gas, but observed no signs of fusion;
nor indeed did      Iexpect    it,

   IF melted charcoal, plumbago and anthracite do really ap
proximate towards the character of diamond, we ought to ex
pect that, in consequence of fusion, there would be a diminu
tion of conducting power, with respect both to heat and to
electricity. This I find to be the fact. . As soon as the point

                                                       is                                                                 it

M      *
           LAPLACE        tells us that an air thermometer may be.
         regarded as the true thermometer of nature, and finds
that his function II(t) is proportional to the expansion of a given
volume of gas under a constant pressure.              From this it follows
that his equation P= ig II(t) becomes
                                                                   -         -

 a constant. Taking therefore for granted, what has been ex
perimentally demonstrated over and over; namely, that vapours'
at   alltemperatures equal                    to
                                     and above that        their tensions,      of
follow the same laws              gases; as

joint determination           two other French philosophers, MM.
                                   of
Clement and Desormes.
  It   is   curious fact that these two results

have been corroborated                        by
                                    the subsequent inquiries          such                     of        a
man         Laplace, are the identical cases which some
           as                                                            our                        of
 English philosophers have opposed.
          Laplace observes,                        “It
                                           results from equation 2,”

 homogeneous; and also when the compressions do not pro

 the rise of temperature should be 27 times greater than in an

 water and mercury; and likewise that a due allowance has
 been made for the temperature evolved by the condensation of

         This allowance                I

   ata    have heretofore    published.
     Let philosophers try this very striking case; and, if the ex
periments are too delicate to define precisely the amounts of
 the elevations of temperature, they will,                           I
                                                    think, at least per

 drawn of the superior rise of temperature by mercury is cor
rect; and consequently that the result of M. Laplace's theory
is erroneous, which makes equal compressions, however made,
produce the same rise of temperature.
      In M. Laplace's equation 1 {P= 2* HKg"c"; P is the
pressure or elasticity of the gas; 2n is double the ratio of
the circumference of a circle to its diameter; “ H est whe

qui semble ainsi devoir etre la même pour tous les gaz;” K is

      O discover convenient and    efficacious means for opening a
     spacious subterraneous communication between the shores
of a great river, without occasioning any obstruction to the
navigation, has long been a desideratum of considerable im
portance with the public, and in the estimation of scientific
engineers. The difficulties which have opposed themselves to
every attempt that has been hitherto made to execute a Tunnel
under the bed of a river, have been so many and so formidable

   In order that    a sufficient number of hands may be employed
together,    and with perfect security, each perpendicular frame
is divided into three small chambers, which may properly be
denominated cells. By this disposition, 33 men maybe brought
to operate together with mechanical uniformity, and quite                                                       in

back, present in front against the ground a complete shield
composed of small boards, which admit of being removed
and replaced singly at pleasure.
    It is in these cells that the work of excavation is carried on..
There each individual is to operate on the surface opposed to
him, as a workman would cut out a recess in a wall for the
purpose of letting in a piece of framing, with this difference
only, that instead of working upon the whole surface, he takes
out one of the small boards at a time, cuts the ground to the
depth of a few inches, and replaces the board before he pro
ceed to the next. . When he has thus gained from 3 to 6
inches over the whole surface, (an operation which it is ex

  M. Dupin read the conclusions of the Report made by him
in the name of a Commission, consisting of MM. Laplace,
Prony, Ampere, Giraud, and Dupin, on the use of low and
High Pressure    Steam Engines, considered particularly with a
view to the public safety. M. Gay-Lussac, whose opinion on the
subject differed in many respects from those adopted in the Re
port, had requested to withdraw from the Commission.       The
conclusions adopted by a majority of the Academy were as
follows:
   “1. Two safety valves to be adapted to the boiler. One of
them to be so disposed as to remain out of the reach of the
workman who attends the boiler and the working of the engine;
the other to be placed under his controul, in order that as oc
casion may require he may be able to lessen the pressure;
whilst he would be unable to increase this pressure, as the
valve to which he has no access would give vent to the steam
at a lower pressure than that at which he might imprudently
all Il.
     “2. We  propose that the strength of every boiler should
be proved by means of the hydraulic press, submitting it to a
pressure four or five times greater than that which it would
have to sustain in the usual work of the engine, so long as the
pressure is between two and four atmospheres; and that above
this term, the pressure in proving should be as many times
greater than the usual pressure exerted by the steam in the
work of the engine, as that pressure exceeds the simple pres
sure of the atmosphere.
   “3. We propose that every manufacturer of steam-engines
should be obliged to make known his method of proving, and
every thing which can ensure the strength and safety of the
engine, especially of the boiler and             its
                                              appendages.    The
manufacturer      be obliged
                     to         make known
                                    to                      to

as  well  as the public, the usual pressure
               to                               which the engines
                                                       at
should be worked.

was much cirrostratus           the  eastward,    which            great                in   a
measure obstructed the sun's    rays. This modification afterwards
increasing, totally obscured the sun, and prevented my seeing
the beginning           of
                    the eclipse; but        29" mean time the sun

to this part of the globe; and as the atmosphere became more
bright,   I was enabled, by an excellent achromatic telescope
 .#    power of 50, to observe the eclipse with great advantage,
and found the appearance, &c. of this phaenomenon to cor
respond with the type, &c. in Moore's and others of the Book
Almanacks published by the Stationers' Company.             At 39
minutes after five, the sun became perfectly clear of clouds,
and continued so to the end of the eclipse, which took place
at 5° 46" 10° mean time, according to the meridian of Epping.
   The rate of the clock was found by altitudes of the sun,
taken before and after the eclipse with Troughton's Reflecting
Circle on an horizon of oil, and the times computed for the
latitude of the place of observation, which is 51° 41' 41"-6
north.

   P.S. The    appearance   of this eclipse was an exception to the
  eneral rule; for it began and ended on the eastern side of

              ERUPTION OF GALOENGOENG          IN JAVA.
    The Government has received a detailed account of the
eruption of the volcano Galoengoeng in October last.             In
this terrible visitation, one of the greatestmisfortunes that have
befallen Java within the memory of man, 4,011 persons
perished; and 114 campongs were destroyed; 2,983 rice plan
tations totally destroyed, and 5,361 injured; the number of
coffee trees destroyed amounts to 775,795; that of those which
have suffered more or less to 3,871,742.

                 CAPTAIN SABINE’s EXPEDITION.
    Accounts have been received of the progress of the Griper,
Captain Clavering, on board of which Captain Sabine sailed
from the Nore in the month of May last, for the purpose of
carrying on the series of observations on the pendulum, in the

 Cape, after a tedious passage, the beginning of June, and pro
posed to remain at Hammerfest about three weeks.             From
that place they would go to Spitzbergen, as the second

Greenland, intending to make their way to the most northern
part of that unexplored coast, as far as the obstruction of per
manent ice would permit the ship to pass.       It is intended to
land the instruments for observation at the highest point they
should reach in Greenland, and afterwards to navigate down
this hitherto almost unknown coast southwards.       On quitting
Greenland, they would visit Iceland, and then cross to Dront

be completed, previous to their return in the month of                                   No

The zeal and interest which M. Inghirami has always shown
in this science, are well known to most of your astronomical
readers; and entitle him to their warmest thanks'   It is in the
formation and calculation of these and other useful tables that
he exercises the talent and ingenuity of the pupils of the
School of Astronomy at Florence, over which he so honourably
presides. I hope, before long, to be able to obtain a copy of
the general tables, from which these annual computations are
made.

 because it    prevents     the metal from    falling    amongst    that from
 which it has been separated.          All the cadmium is not yet out
 of the powder; to procure the remainder, dissolve in muriatic
 acid and precipitate with a plate of zinc: this precipitate, which
 consists of iron and cadmium, may be submitted to the subli
 ming process; or if a pure salt of the metal is required, it may
 be dissolved in nitric acid and evaporated to dryness in the
 proper way to peroxidize the iron, which remains behind
 when the nitrate of cadmium is dissolved in water.
     Another property of the pure metal, besides those published
 by Stromeyer and myself, is, that it makes a cracking noise like
 tin when bent; and, although not to the same extent, yet, from
 its general similarity to that metal, it is likely to be mistaken
for it by those unacquainted with chemistry: it may therefore
be advisable to have a ready test, by which they may be di
stinguished.             If
                       a piece of tin be placed in nitric acid, it is
   uickly converted into white oxide, but not dissolved, whereas
   he solution    of cadmium goes on with rapidity in the same
acid.
    The late Professor Clarke was considerably embarrassed in
consequence of operating upon precipitates which contained
other metals; in the mode above laid down, in which its vola
tility is made use of to purify           there   it, very little danger
                                                             is                               of

Now by substituting the real quantities we shall have
                B = b +ea
                B = B.-Hea C, = c-Heb,

    aw”-Hbr-Hc= avº-F(b+2ae)v-H (c.--be-Hae").
  Ea. 2. Transform the cubic function wº—brº-H cr—d into
another in ar—e=v.
  Here A = 1, B= —b, C=c,              D= —d,
  B = —b-H    e

   In the derivative table the values of B, B, are found by
adding the quantity e successively. Again, by multiplying the
value of B, by e, and adding the product to c, the third co
efficient of the original equation, gives the value of C,; and
multiplying the value of B, by e, and adding the product to
C., gives the value of C, ; and by multiplying the value of C,
by e, and adding the product to —d, the absolute number of
the given function, gives the value of D, the absolute number
of the transformed function, which is of the same form as the
original; instead of demonstrating by successive steps, as has
been done, the method may be derived from two consecutive-
equations, as is in the following

     THE    observations      which have been made during the last
 summer,     confirm in a very decided manner the results which
 formed the subject of my last communication; in which I laid
 before the Society the nature of the differences that exist be
 tween the computed places of the principal stars of the Green
 wich catalogue, and those deduced from actual observation.
  It is not my present intention to offer any explanation of the
 cause of these phaenomena, although many obvious conjectures
 present themselves, the value of which it will require perhaps
 many years to determine.               It is now my principal object to
 consider the force of that explanation of the differences in
 question, which will most readily occur to every astronomer,
 namely, that the whole may arise either from error committed
 by the observer, or from defect in the instruments of observa
 tion: this objection being the more weighty from the circum
 stance, that the observations of three distant periods are em
 ployed, and that an error in those of either period (but parti
 cularly of the two latter) would materially affect the result     -      now
 under consideration.
     I believe that every person, in proportion to his experience
 in the use of astronomical instruments (even of the most un
                                                                exceptionable

exceptionable construction), will be cautious in admitting the
accuracy of any results, with whatever care the observations
may have been made, which appear to militate against any re
ceived theory of astronomy; and                                I
                                       shall have occasion myself
to show,   from the  great  discordances between instruments of
the highest reputation, that this distrust is but too well founded.
More particularly ought our suspicion to be excited, when
such anomalies are found to exist, as bear some direct pro
portion to the zenith distances of the stars observed.         In all
such cases we should never hesitate, I think, to ascribe the
anomalies to defective observation.           therefore in the pre  If
sent instance  any  part of the discordances in question can be
shown to   depend on  polar  or zenith distances,     shall willingly              I
admit, as to such part of them at least, that they are no other
wise of importance, than as affording data for leading to the
detection of some hitherto undiscovered errors.         The anoma
lies, however, that have led me on to this inquiry, and to which
           I
alone attach any importance, are found to depend rather on
the right ascensions, than on the declinations of the stars.
Accordingly             I
                 found, while collecting observations to form a
catalogue for the present period, that could more nearly pre        I
dict the deviation of a star from                             its
                                         computed place, by know
ing
         to its
         right ascension, than         declination. Now  its       not                       it   is
easy     conceive       what     in the error of an instrument for
measuring declination, fixed  ...] the meridian, can     in      ocea                         be
sioned by any circumstance depending              the right ascension    on
of star to be observed.

               is                 But     these six stars there are two,

                                        y     which deserve further con
sideration. These two stars are within less than one degree
of   each other          polar distance, and consequently pass over
the meridian                   at in
                         nearly the same altitude. The observations
of   Bradley              on
                     the stars north        the zenith are not of           nume                        so

carefully recomputed the predicted places                    these stars, and        of

dicted place, and y Ursae Majoris half a second to the north.
Now I am quite at a loss to conceive how this difference in so
small an arc can arise from error of observation, and I can
     #.
only attribute it to that cause, whatever it may be, which seems
SO            to depend not on the polar distance, but on the
right ascension of the star.
    2. The second group which I shall consider, contains the
stars & Arietis, Arcturus, and Aldebaran, comprehended within
 an are of about six degrees and a half. Of these three,
 Arcturus alone has yet been observed by reflection; but from
 the present very perfect state of the Greenwich circle, which
 the method of reflection has enabled me to ascertain, it can
not be doubted that the places of the two other stars are well
 determined”.         In Arcturus the southern deviation is nearly
 insensible, but in the two other stars it is very considerable,
 being in each not less than 1":5. Now these three stars, but
particularly the two latter, are among those that have been
most assiduously observed by Bradley and myself at each of
the three periods.         Let us suppose then, if it be possible, that
the whole of these deviations arise from error of observation :
or, in other words, that no systematic deviation has really taken
place in the stars, but that their proper motions are uniform.
 Then we must admit that the mural quadrant and the mural
 circle have at each period given the polar distance of Arcturus
 correct, or at least subject to the same constant error; and as
this star has been observed at each period, at                times     all
                                                                         the            of
 day, and     at   all
                     seasons    ofthe   year,  the observations     may                      be
 considered     as perfectly exempt from accidental error.              will,      It
I  believe,   be readily conceded that both instruments are               far           so
perfect, that       the error      either nothing,
                                  be                       given quantity
                                                                   or
                   of if
                                                                    a
    one point        the arc, the errors must              as be
at                                                    very nearly indeed
the same within           moderate
                           a          distance,       within      degrees,    15
for   instance,      ofthat point.    Upon    this supposition,   how can
we possibly reconcile the great errors that must have been
committed       in stars, adjacent          aspolar distance, but
                                                 to                      op         of
    site right ascensions?     I       do
                                      not wish      press these remarks,
                                                          to
in  order  to   obtain greater confidence than they deserve, for ob
servations which can never             be
                                       regarded with too much suspi
cion; but the arguments         I  have used appear         me          to
                                                                     follow    to
logically from the data before us, and strongly                          to
                                                              indicate the
probability that some cause purely astronomical has,                  least,       at
some share      in producing these unexpected deviations.

of stars, let            us

matter quite accidental, depending on the unequal elevation or
depression of the object-end or eye-end of the telescope, in
consequence of the unequal strength of the materials.             If we
suppose error to exist in each of the catalogues, this cause
must have had an opposite influence in the two cases: if we
compare the Greenwich observations with those of Dr. Brink
ley, we shall arrive at the same conclusion; namely, that the
differences must be caused by flexure in one or both of the
instruments; since here also we find that the stars in the neigh
bourhood of the zenith are affected by only half the difference
in polar distance, that is observed in the stars near the equator;
and the same conclusions may be drawn from comparing the
 Greenwich observations with those of Mr. Bessel.             The polar

    least another year's observations, to render it of equal value
    with that of 1813, which is the result of two years observations
   with six microscopes, and in four positions of the telescope.
        I am persuaded that the more this subject is considered, the
  more distinctly it will appear, that if any doubt can be enter
  tained, founded on any circumstance arising out of the Dublin
  observations, that doubt must relate, not to the accuracy of
   former catalogues, but to the present position of the stars;
   since it is with respect to their present position that the two
   instruments are really at variance.           This circumstance is very
   fortunate, as time may confirm the present or suggest some
   more satisfactory method of investigation, if what have now    I

          LAPROTH           has already given us, in his valuable “Con
           tributions,” an examination of this metallic salt, from
   which mine considerably differs both in the proportions of the

   them.
       I  obtained for analysis, through the kindness of M. Lenz,
   some very beautiful regular crystals of this substance.               They
  were     rectangular     four-sided prisms,   the lateral planes    of which
  were uneven, dull, rough, and covered with a little carbonate
  of lime of a yellowish-white colour. The terminal planes, on
  the contrary, were smooth and shining, with a resinous lustre,
 The fracture was compact and obscurely lamellar. The colour
 of a wax-yellow. It was found at Bleiberg in Carinthia.
      The crystals which were to be decomposed were first washed
in dilute nitric acid, to separate the carbonate of lime adhering
 to them; then carefully washed in water, and dried.
      I.—100 grs. reduced to a fine powder, and placed with sul
phuric acid in the vacuum of an air-pump for 24 hours, only
lost 0.02 grs.; their loss in water was equally small.
      II.-100 grs. were dissolved by heat in dilute muriatic
acid. When cool, a number of crystalline particles of chloride
of lead were precipitated, and the precipitation was completed
by a gentle evaporation of the liquid.              The precipitate, col
lected on a       filter,  dried and  ignited,  weighed    72.5 grs.     Now

XXXIX.       Remarks on the Identity of certain General Laws

     M.A. F.L.S.*
     HE    naturalists of the present day have in one respect a
       peculiar claim to the appellation of disciples of Linnaeus;
inasmuch as they direct their chief attention to what this
  reat master declared to be the end of all his immortal labours
in botany. His admirable maxim, that the natural system is
the “ultimus botanices finis,” is now not only universally ad
mitted, but on               all
                        sides acted upon. The natural system                                              is
in fact not   only  made the remote consequence, but the imme

   Having such ideas both of the dignity of natural history and
of the importance and feasibility of a more extended research
into the natural system than has yet been made, we can scarcely
fail to be interested by a late work”, of which the perusal has
induced me to address this learned body. Although this work
is confined to a department of botany not very generally studied,
its  author has evidently not been satisfied with the specific
discrimination               of

his Elenchus ºoophytorum, has well observed that Bonnet,            or                                   in
der     complete his linear scale

           the Natural Distribution of Insects and Fungi.                195
    The next work in which the distinction appeared was the
Mémoires du Muséum d’Histoire Naturelle; in a part of which,
published in the autumn of 1821, a paper was inserted by
M. Decandolle on the natural family of Crucifera. Here this
botanist states, that he finds it possible to express in a table all
the affinities existing in this family of plants by what he terms
a double entrée, in other words, he supposes that there are
transversal affinities as well as direct ones,—a notion of the
reality however which appears to be much more confused than
that previously entertained by M. Agardh and explained as
above in his Botanical Aphorisms.
    In the same year (1821) likewise appeared the abovemen
tioned work of M. Fries on Fungi, which is explicit on the
subject, and wherein the very same expressions of affinity and
analogy are used to designate these different relations, which
I  had applied to them two years       -
                                          before in treating of Lamel
licorn Insects *.
    The theoretical difference between Affinity and Analogy may
be thus explained:t. Suppose the existence of two parallel
series of animals, the corresponding points of which agree in
some one or two remarkable particulars of structure.               Suppose
also, that the general conformation of the animals in each series
passes so gradually from one species to the other, as to render
any interruption of this transition almost imperceptible. We
shall thus have two very different relations, which must have
required an infinite degree of design before they could have
been made exactly to harmonize with each other.                     When,
therefore, two such parallel series can be shown in nature to
have each their general change of form gradual, or, in other
words, their relations of affinity uninterrupted by any thing
known; when moreover the corresponding points in these two
series agree in some one or two remarkable circumstances,
there is every probability of our arrangement being correct.
It is quite inconceivable that the utmost human ingenuity could

 logy consists in a correspondence between certain parts of the
 organization of two animals which differ in their general struc
 ture.     In short, the test of such a relation is barely an evident
 similarity in some remarkable points of formation, which at
 first sight give a character to the animals and distinguish
 them from others connected with them by affinity; whereas,

should we not be justified in affirming that the rule, so far as
concerns Insects and Fungi, is one and the same? The pos

is the way in which we ought to take the rule that only now

the place of whose existence is space, and the period of it
time, whose continuity constitutes eternity; the writer ventures
to conclude, that a Binary Distribution of natural objects was
at least the primaeval one *, however altered or modified by
causes and effects of subsequent occurrence, and themselves
amenable to ulterior variations.    And it is very remarkable
that most, or all, of Nature's superior divisions, are actually,
or virtually, either duplications, or multiples, of the numeral
Two.                          -                         -

according to the elaborate theory of MacLeay in his learned
Horae Entomological recently published.
   Of the two supernal divisions, the first, that        MIND          is,       or
SPIRIT,    is      an
                unit and absolutely indivisible, although creation
is replete with         it;

every animated form; “ubique varians, semper tamen eadem.”
But the other supernal division, MATTER, separates into                          no
less than three modifications, viz.

                  just subject of complaint with sportsmen who
             been a
                         lock to their guns, that    thepowder
 made with the chlorine        potass has a tendency to promote
                                        of
 rapid oxidation in the barrel and lock; besides generating dirt
 from the charcoal, after firing.        have found this incon    I
 yenience myself, and was induced to seek a remedy by adopt
 ing a different substance, in which succeeded to my satisfac     I
 tion; and       I
               shall feel obliged if you will allow me, through
 your means, to make known the discovery, which may not
 only prove interesting to sportsmen, but to many of your sci
 entific readers also. In November last Mr. Murray delivered
  his scientific and instructive lectures on chemistry in this city;
  and in consequence of his observations on fulminating mer
                                        I
  cury, some experiments had made with that substance several
  years ago in firing gunpowder, were recalled to my recol
  lection; and soon after he left us                              I
                                                was induced to make the
  powder, and try it with the copper caps, when                  found it in                I
  every respect superior to the chlorine of potass preparation,
  and shot with it the remainder of the winter.                   advantages                Its
  are:—It does not create rust         rapidly     so

permitting the powder to subside each time before the water
is poured off, so as to free the substance as much as possible
from the acid; and then I pour it on a piece of filtering paper,
and place the powder in an airy room to dry. It should be kept
in a corked (not stopper) bottle. Sometimes the powder is
quite white, and often light brown, in colour; but this is of no                                                          \

Biot, in his Traité de Physique, cites from the manuscripts of
 that celebrated philosopher the observations upon which he
 was induced to found this conjecture.
    An experiment made by M. Libes with gummed taffeta
seems to accord with this view of the subject. This experi
ment consists in taking a disk of metal, which is held by an
insulating handle, and pressing it on gummed taffeta; the
taffeta acquires the vitreous electricity, and the disk the resi
nous electricity. . The effect is the more striking in proportion
as the pressure is stronger; but it ceases as soon as the taf
                                                                            is its
feta has lost that glutinosity which renders                    surface easily
compressible.             If,
                       on the contrary, the metal                rubbed over
the taffeta, the metal takes the vitreous, and the taffeta the
resinous electricity.      Having recently had occasion                 repeat            to

    other, . After withdrawing them from contact, the quantity of
    electricity acquired by them is ascertained by the electroscope.
    A single contact is usually sufficient to repel the small disk of
    the electroscope of Coulomb; but on repeating these contacts,
   any electroscope whatever may be strongly charged. Some
    times the electricity is so strong, that the disk immediately
   attracts the small light bodies which are presented to                 Let

 probably because the two surfaces are not identically the same:
in   fact, unless the instrument with which they are cut, sepa
 rates them with extreme precision,                 must follow that the state
                                                                 it

                        is
 sealing-wax. There are, however, exceptions; for the same
 philosopher discovered that paper, cotton, wax, and wool, are
 always electric             by
                           contact, whatever precaution may                   taken                be
 to  equalize their temperature.
    If  we keep the temperature               one     of              of
                                                         the disks higher than

to be established between the two bodies, them, on the pressure
ceasing, neither of them will have acquired any electricity.
It is therefore clear that the development of electricity in this
case takes place only during the passage of caloric from the one
 body to the other; as soon as that has ceased, we see no more
 electric effects. Thus, then, when two bodies pressed one
 against the other retain no sensible electricity after compres
sion, before we pronounce on their want of the electric property
 We must ascertain whether a change of temperature in one of
 them would not suffice to render them electric.
    The hygrometric water which usually adheres to the surface
 of bodies, sometimes destroys the electric property of pressure:
for example, sulphate of barytes, sulphate of lime, mica, &c.
must be freed from this water before they are subjected to the
experiment; without this precaution, no development of
electricity will be obtained: for want of having taken            some                       it,

   If we describe a circle,       to pass through the points ADB,
 then every point of this circle will describe a straight line
                                                                        º
 passing through the point D; for it is only the reverse opera
 tion to describing a circle by an angular point” (see Emerson's
 Geom. Prop. 41. B. iv.). Therefore the extremities of any dia
 meter of that circle might be taken as the moving points: con
 sequently we can always draw a straight line from a tracin
 point situate any where in the moving plane to pass
 two points in this circle; and lines being drawn from these
 points to the point D, we may consider these the fixed lines
 on the fast plane, and our equations become general. Hence
 we arrive at the conclusion, that any point in the moving plane
 will describe an ellipse, a circle, or a straight line.
    When the tracing point is in the line A B but not between
 the moving points A B, the principle is identical with that of
 the common trammel. Also, when the point is in the line,
 and between the points AB, the mode of describing an ellipse
is well knownf and interesting to me, because it is the tra
jectory of the centre of gravity of a beam when it moves be

IF the      distances of the planets from the sun, and that of the
    satellites from their primaries, be estimated by the radii or
semiaris major of the earth's orbit, equal to unity ; and the
velocities of the planets and satellites be taken for one sidereal
3year, the constant quantity thus obtained (viz. Vx w D &c.)
 will always be equal to the circumference of the earth's orbit,
 or equal to the circumference gf a circle whose radius is unity.
   It has been demonstrated by La Grange that, amid the
changes which arise from the mutual actions of the planets,
there are twothings which remain perpetually the same, namely,
the greater axis of the orbit which the planet describes, and
 itsperiodic time;             so
                         that the mean motion           planet, and      of a                          its
mean distance, are invariable quantities.

and which      his
                in opinion  possesses extraordinary advantages
over every other instrument employed for the same purpose.
But      as
        these advantages are scarcely enumerated, much less

                      Mr. Meikle               on an      Air         Barometer.                          215
minutely described, I have somehow either undervalued them
or failed in discovering what they are; for the common
portable barometer seems still to be the more convenient of
 the two, especially considering the very troublesome correc
tions his instrument requires for change of temperature, &c.
     In Mr. Murray's barometer, the rise of the mercury, on
being carried to a higher station, will, in general, be less than
the corresponding depression in the common barometer.                        Its
sensibility will therefore be less; and unfortunately there does
not appear to be any means of remedying this defect, which
is occasioned by the following causes: The included air, hav
ing most likely become colder on reaching the upper station,
 will be less elastic, and the sinking of the mercury in the
 cistern, occasioned by            rise   itsthe tube, and
                                                         in          contrac            by     its
                 cold,          enlarge                                                      by
 tion from                must             the space occupied         the air,
 and still further diminish                        its
                                        elasticity, which will not, there
 fore,     be          raise the mercury         the proper height. Some

 but the whole           the requisite corrections could be more easily

 within the cistern be varied,              new source   a     error will be-
 introduced.

a a temperature intermediate between that                  the mercury and    of

      In       its
               present form,        do not see how

 use       measuring altitudes. Perhaps Mr. M. may hereafter

vernier, and of reading off the observation, being so nearly
the same as in a portable barometer, need not here be parti
cularly described ; and it is scarcely necessary to remark,
that since the surface of the included air in contact with the
mercury is so very small, the temperature of the mercury can
not sensibly affect this instrument.                               -
   If the air-ball be quite exposed to the air, and be at the same
time kept in the shade, it may be presumed that the included
air will be at least as near the temperature of the surrounding
air as the detached thermometer is ; and if so, an attached
thermometer may be dispensed with. Indeed, after all the
precautions that have been used, it may be questioned whe
ther the thermometer attached to a mountain-barometer may
not sometimes differ considerably from the temperature of
the mercury in the barometer, especially when the two ther      -
mometers themselves disagree.
   A difference in the temperatures of the included air at the
two stations, will affect the elevation so much more than the
same difference would in the temperature of the common baro
meter, as the effect of heat on air is greater than on mercury.
Yet as the temperature of the air seems to admit of being
ascertained with greater precision than that of the mercury,
it may be presumed that this instrument will not on account of
heat be less to be depended on than the mercurial barometer.
   If  a lighter fluid could be employed in place of mercury, the
sensibility of the instrument might be greatly increased; but
the evaporation, viscidity, capillary attraction, or some such
defect, almost precludes the use of any thing else. The range
or scale of this barometer might be made of almost any mag
nitude, though it is doubtful if             its
                                          sensibility can     increased       be
quite    inthe same   proportion.   Still, when   of large dimensions,
 itssensibility may much exceed that          the common barometer;

 cludes his additions to the first Essay, with valuable remarks,
 rules and examples for arranging the numbers of the teeth,

    The second Essay is on the shafts and gudgeons, and the
journals (or neck-bearings) of machines, and is accompanied
 with additions, not less novel nor less important than those we
 have noticed in the first Essay: the subjects are exemplified
 by rules, tables and examples, and are treated quite in a new
 manner, on principles which the Editor has established, in an
 Essay which he lately published (and of which a second edi
 tion is in the press) on “the Strength of .Cast-Iron.” The
 second Essay is concluded by one of the most complete tables
 of the strength of metals that has ever been published, with
 references to the original works of the experimenters.

 since the time                     ascertained,   that overshot water
 wheels,     donot produce the greatest effect, when the water

 corresponds       the greatest effect; and shows that each parti

 suit the fall. Mr. Smeaton employed only one sized model,
                      .
 he  could not therefore obtain general maximum, and the ve

 locity which         he

 generalizing from too limited experiments;              fact,   has long      in         it

and there is one new plate: the work is handsomely, although
 somewhat too widely printed; and the publisher deserves
praise, for having placed Mr. Buchanan's work in the hands
of an Editor, of a more scientific character than the author,
by which we have a combination of views on the same sub
jects, very favourable to their improvement. At the com

writings.

    From the judgement which Dr. Horsfield has displayed, we
are disposed    to       that his inquiries would have led,           some                     on
 occasions,    todifferent conclusions, had his materials for com
 parison been more extensive: but this         not his fault;-what

Numerical Games: intended for the Improvement of Young
    Persons. By Thomas Halliday. Hunter, St. Paul's     -   Church
     <U+017F>ard, &c.
      his small work is evidently the result of much thought,
labour, and ingenuity; and we are induced to notice it as being
adapted to facilitate the early acquisition of readiness and skill
in those numerical calculations which are requisite not only
in the usual avocations of commercial life, but also in the pur
suits of science.   The exercises supply a great variety of re
creations, at once instructive and entertaining; and from the
rational occupation and exercise which they furnish to the
mind, we are disposed to recommend them to the notice of
those who withhold from young people games of chance, as
being likely to be particularly useful in habituating young per
                                 -
 sons to mental arithmetic, and in cultivating that quickness of
apprehension and combination which are the best preparatives
for the successful cultivation of the higher branches of know
 ledge.    The games are played with the assistance of appro
priate cards and counters; and we can add, from our attentive
observation, that children will take great interest
                                                -         and derive
much entertainment from them.

  Amelanchier as a distinct genus, containing, with this plant, Pyrus botrya
      .
 pium, ovalis and cretica; while on the contrary Sir J. E. Smith has thought
 it best to reduce the whole order in which it stands to the two genera,
  Mespilus and Pyrus.        Erythrina caffra, native of Southern Africa, flowered
 for      first time in this country last year; and now figured,as is supposed, for
 the first time.     Arum Italicum, frequently confounded with A. maculatum.
 “It was in this species (adds the Editor) that M. Lamarck observed an ex
 traordinary degree of heat, amounting almost to burning, in the spadix, at
 a certain epoque, probably that when the fecundation of the germens takes
 place.     This high temperature continues only for a few hours, and when
 several spadices come from the same root, the heat is evolved from each,
 in succession, as they arrive at the proper epoque, while the rest remain
 at the same temperature as the surrounding atmosphere. This observation
 is said to have been confirmed by Desfontaines.
     “We are not informed, however, that the fact was proved by the ther
 mometer; and, if not, it is possible that some pungent vapour might occa
  sion the sensation of heat in the fingers, without really increasing the tem
 perature of the surrounding air. We hope some of our readers may be
 induced to attend to this curious phaenomenon.”

what he formerly denominated the binominal calculus, and
which he now wished to call the Irish calculus (calcul d’Ir

                       NEW WOYAGE OF DISCOVERY.
   Portsmouth, Sept. 22.          –
                               We have just been visited by a
navigator of great celebrity, who is going on his third voyage
round the world,—Captain Otto Won                      who accom
panied Captain Krusenstern, and afterwards made a voyage
to the South Sea, and North East coast of Ameriea, in
a small vessel fitted out at the expense of that munificent
patron of science Count Romanzoff.            On the present oc
casion he is sent     by  the Russian  Government,     and nothing
has been     neglected    to insure the success of the voyage.
The    ship  was built last winter expressly for the voyage.
She is a corvette, called the Enterprise, carrying 24 guns,
and manned with a crew of 80 men and 13 officers, all
volunteers from the Imperial navy; she has on board two
physicians, both well versed in Natural History—one of them
is Dr. Eschscholz, who accompanied Captain Kotzebue on his
late voyage.     The Astronomer is Mr. Preiss; Mineralogist,
 Mr.   Lintz;  and professed Naturalist, Mr. Hoffman.         These
 gentlemen are         all
                      from the University        Dorpat. ofImmedi
 ately     on
           his arrival, Captain Kotzebue went        London      reto             to
 ceive the astronomical instruments and the chronometers,
 which had been previously ordered by the Imperial Govern
 ment for this expedition.     The astronomical instruments are
               to by

            NEWLY DISCOVERED MINES IN FRANCE.
   There have lately been discovered in the environs of Con
folens, in the department of the Charente, and at Melle, in
the department of the Deux Sevres, several mines of zinc and
lead. The presence of a great mass of metallic matter has
been ascertained by a Company formed to make experiments.
 Sulphat of zinc and lead, in combination with silver, have
been found, and submitted to analysis by the most distin
guished chemists of Paris: it has been from 3 to 34 ounces
of silver to the old quintal. Cadmium, a metal lately dis
covered in Hungary, has been detected in these minerals; the
uses to which it may be put are, however, not yet very well
known.     These mines are situated in a country where fuel is
abundant and cheap.     The Charente and the Vienne flow
close by the spot where it is purposed to place the machines;
and the high-road is not far off. Some specimens of the pro
duce of these mines are now to be seen in the Louvre; and
some rich capitalists propose to work them on a grand scale.

 FORMATION OF PRUSSIC ACID BY THE IGNITION OF A CAR
       BONACEOUS SUBSTANCE WITH NITRATE OF BARYTES.
    In our last number, we gave an extract from Silliman's Jour
nal, respecting the production of cyanogene by the action of
nitric acid upon charcoal: the subject has recalled to our re
membrance a notice found among the late Mr. Gregor's papers
by Dr. Paris, and published by him in the first volume of the
                 of the Geological Society of Cornwall, in which
certain effects are described that must have resulted from a si
milar action; and as we believe the notice in question to be
little known, it may be useful to republish                 it.

 Gregor's death            I
                      have examined his chemical memoranda,
 and am   thereby  enabled to extract the following facts. . From
 different experiments the specific gravity of this substance
 appears to be 1.627.       Fifty grains of the coal were mixed
 with 200 of nitrate of barytes, reduced to powder, and placed
in a platina crucible, which was set in a common fire: before
the crucible became red hot, a violent detonation took place,
with the disengagement of a brilliant light and vivid heat,
which rendered the crucible and           cover red hot;
                                                       its     porous                a
light greyish mass, mixed with black streaks, remained, which
smelt      prussic acid. This was separated from the crucible
           of
and pulverized, when        was introduced into
                                    it               mattrass.   Mu     a
riatic acid   operated   upon   the  powder,    and     considerable        a
quantity        of   an
                   elastic fluid was disengaged.       The solution
assumed      dark blue colour, and very light powder was sus
            in a
                                                   a

composed mineral, which, when dried, weighed 23# grains.
This residuum was mixed with 100 grains               nitrate      ba   of               of

                                          a
was treated with muriatic acid as before: there was now no
blue powder separated, but the lixiviated mass became opa

this was again mixed with         grains 50  the nitrate     barytes;

three lines intersect in one common point within the triangle,

bringing in to his aid any proposition beyond the 47th itself.”

                   ELECTRO-MAGNETIC ROTATION.
   The electro-magnetical revolving cylinders of zinc and copper
as first contrived by M. Ampère, and improved by Mr. Marsh
of Woolwich, certainly rank among the most pleasing instru
ments for exhibiting electro-magnetic rotation that have yet
been contrived.      It gives us pleasure to introduce to the public
                                               <U+017F>º
a still further improvement upon this apparatus.
   Mr. Sturgeon, a pensioned artil-
leryman of Woolwich, who has suc-               <U+017F> ).
cessfully devoted himself to scentific
pursuits, has constructed the appa
ratus with two sets of revolving cy
linders, one suspended on each pole
of an inverted horse-shoe magnet, as
the annexed figure illustrates. Upon
the usual insertion of the diluted ni
tric acid the two sets of cylinders    si
multaneously enter into rotations in
a very interesting or striking manner.
This form of the magnet gives the ad
vantage of increased power on a re
duced altitude, and the proximity of the poles materially aug
ments the rotation of the opposed cylinders.         The effect is the
most pleasing we have ever seen, and was witnessed at the
house of Messrs. Jones, opticians, Holborn.
                            FASCINATION.
   A  very  singular  fact occurred at Manchester (U.S.), a few
days since.     As Mr. Samuel Cheever was at work in the
field, his attention was arrested at the sight of a number of
fowls, with heads erect, and wings extended, standing in a
circular manner. On going near to ascertain the cause, he
saw a large black snake of five feet in length within the circle,
and his squamous head elevated eight or nine inches above
the surface of the earth, while his posterior parts remained in
a spiral form. And so complete was the fascination, that
 Mr. Cheever was under the necessity of getting a pole to
disperse the fowls, in order to kill the snake, in which he
happily succeeded.—Salem Register, Aug. 2.

18-29.   August 1, 10-29.   The variations of temperature have
been   unusually great;  the thermometer frequently varying

the nights of July 7th, 17th; August 9th, 10th, and 13th.
   An exact resemblance between July and August in the num

observed at Kiel in Denmark.         It was seen almost at the

ERLAN.—THIS          mineral varies in lustre from glistening to
               dull; in the streak it has a resinous lustre: its
colour is greenish-gray, usually light, the streak is white. It
occurs massive; and in small and fine-granular distinct con
cretions, from which it passes to compact.    Its fracture varies
from foliated to splintery and even.  Hardness from 6:25 to
7.f Specific gravity from 3-0 to 3-1.
B.     Observations           respecting the   History and Discovery of Erlan.
     I first                                of 1818, lying as a
               saw this mineral in the autumn
flux at the   smelting-furnace   (Hüttenhose) of the Erla Iron
Works (commonly called Erlhammer) near Schwarzenberg,
in the Saxon Erzgebirge; I was then convinced that it was
not limestone, for it was much too angular, too hard, and too
heavy. It has been made use of as a flux in these extensive
iron-works for above two centuries, as well as in some neigh
bouring works; but although they have often been visited by
mineralogists and chemists, yet no one ever doubted but that it
was limestone.            I
                   immediately sought for the place where it was
found, and ascertained that erlan mixed with mica constituted
part of the oldest gneiss-formation. In one place there were also

   Division is performed in the usual way, viz. by arranging
the parts of the dividend in a line according to the natural or
inverse order of the powers of the variable, and the parts of
 the divisor in the same order.
    Divide the first part of the dividend by the first part of the
 divisor, and the result is the first part of the quotient.
     Multiply the first part of the quotient successively, by every
 part of the divisor, and place the products so that the powers of
 the variable may be under the same powers in the dividend.
    Draw a line underneath and write in a line below the line
 thus drawn the same powers of the variable as those imme
 diately above, except in the first place, and prefix a new let
ter to each power as a coefficient which will form the first re
 mainder.
    Annex the next part of the dividend from which no sub
traction has been made to this remainder, and consider this
remainder so increased as a second dividend; then proceed to
find the second or next part of the quotient, and the third or
next dividend as before; and so on, as far as may be neces
sary.    In any convenient place write the letters            substi- .    º:  is,
tuted, and their values, in the form of equations; that        every

responding power above, considering the sign            the lower     of              of
these two   changed   by subtraction.
   Then the table thus formed will show the law of derivation
by  which the real quotient may               be

LI.      Discovery of the secret Destroyers                of the Trees in St.James's
                                           Park.
     To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
THE        alterations which are now taking place in the Parks,
       and particularly in St. James's Park, evidently excite a
    ood deal of public interest.   Few persons, however, seem
 aware that the greatest change which is about to be effected
 in the appearance of these “Lungs of London,” is one which
 is contemplated by none with less pleasure than by those who
 have the care of them.       Few persons suspect, for instance,
 that in a very short period St. James's Park will be clothed
in the dapper dress of a nursery plantation, and will have lost
 those shady avenues and that antiquated appearance which
 are all associated with the recollections of times gone past.
 So rapidly, however, is it advancing to this state, that every
person who is in the habit of entering it must perceive that,
unless some remedy be quickly applied, a few months have
only to elapse when there will be scarcely any thing green
in it but the grass. Of the saplings which have been lately
planted I do not speak; but it is manifest that every thing
deserving the name of a tree, a few limes only excepted, is
rapidly disappearing. . In spring we see the leaves sprout
forth from the venerable trunks in                    all
                                          the luxuriance      vege                      of
tation, when         sudden they are blasted
                    of   a                               lightning,  as   if      by
the bark falls from the stem, and long ere winter the finest
tree perhaps      the park
                    in        only              fit
                                     for fire-wood. Whole rows
                                      is
have thus    disappeared   and are still rapidly disappearing                                      in
the Mall and Bird-Cage Walk; and                            as
                                                  anticipated that
                                                                     of is

the   public will esteem this  open condition      the park                                   to   be
little conducive         to   its
                        beauty, even        should addif it   salu                 to   its

cause    of the mischief.

 that no more of the tree was barked from the ground than
 what was easily within the reach of a soldier's bayonet; and
this was sufficient to throw suspicion on some unfortunate re
cruits, of whom more than one was arrested without pro
ducing any diminution of the evil. In vain were persons em

    the first place, M. Fries lays it down as a rule, which is
           above, that he admits no groups whatever to be na
tural unless they form circles more or less complete.          Let us
then apply this rule to what he terms his central group, and
which he makes always to consist of two.            Does this form a
circle?         If
              not, the group cannot be natural according to his
own definition.                                                        -

circles, then these are natural.        Thus the Ptilota will not
form one    circle,  but two;  consequently   they form two natural
groups, which       furthermore proved        their parallel relations   by
of analogy.         we turn

 256    Mr.W.      S. MacLeay on certain general Laws regulating
indicat; perfectissima enim sunt in quâvis sectione ab omnibus
aliis remotissima. Sic perfectissima animalia et vegetabilia,
quae     maxime a se invicem remota; infima, quorum limites
 confluunt.” . Hence it follows, that the centrum, or perfection
 of a group, is in fact that part of the circumference of the cir
 cle of affinity which is furthest from the neighbouring group,
 and exactly the same thing with what in the Horae Entomolo
gicae has perhaps more happily been called Type.
    Indeed the confusion arising from the use of the word cen
 trum, as applied to a point in the circumference of a circle, is
 still increased by applying the word radii to those groups like
 wise in the circumference which lead from one centrum or
 type to another, and which I have termed annectent groups”.
 The use of these terms centrum and radii is the more unfor
 tunate, as our author never for a moment takes them in any
other sense than that in which                    I
                                        have used the expressions
type and annectent groups. When, therefore, he says that in
every group, whether class, order, &c. there are a centrum and
radii, we must understand him as meaning, that there are in
 every circle first a type or normal form expressing the perfec
 tion of the superior group to which it belongs; and secondly,
annectent groups connecting this type with other groups. Or,
to take his own words,             “In
                                   centrum quod species plurimas
continet, character optime quadrat. Radii ad reliquas classes
(scilicet ordines, genera, &c.) abeuntes, utriusque classis cha
racterem conciliant, sedad illam (viz., the typical       group) cujus
                                                  ->
character maxime eminet referuntur.”
   If    then the determinate number in which Fungi are na
turally grouped be four, and if it thus appears that, according
to M. Fries, every natural group is a circle, having in             cir     its

M. Fries's observation: “Centrum abit          semper      duas series,in

                                                                                  alto

            known that two   laminae of mica suddenly separated
       the      give out light.    No attempt had been made
to ascertain any thing beyond this fact; but if the precaution
is taken to make the experiment with each lamina fixed to an
insulating handle by means of a little mastic, it will be seen
that         in separating, carries with it an excess of con
trary electricity, and that this excess is greater in propor
tion to the velocity of the separation.     These results are                                        al
ways obtained, however thin the lamina of mica may be; it
is therefore probable that they would still be obtained in sepa
rating two molecules from each other. The foliated talc of
St. Gothard, and the limpid sulphate of lime of Montmartre,
give similar electric results by exfoliation; and it is probable

different electrical states; but this property lasts for a few mo
ments only after exfoliation.       If we wish to restore it to them,
it is necessary to raise the temperature of one of the laminae.
From this it appears, that when two thin laminae of mica are
abruptly separated,they are not both at the same temperature;
since after some instants, that is to say, when an equilibrium.
of temperature has established itself between the two laminae,
it is necessary slightly to heat the one in order that the pres
sure may develop electricity.        This agrees with our remarks
upon what takes place when two bodies identical in                     re                                    all

these causes, in this              if we desire to discover the
electric phaenomena which relate to them.
   The researches concerning the development of electricity.
have hitherto been confined to the discovery of the means of
setting in motion the electric principle, and the inquiry into the
circumstances under which this phaenomenon was modified;
but it has never been attempted to measure                   effects when          its
one   of the influential causes varied.              certainly  something

of it.

beam   of the balance rises and falls at will by means of a
screw.    The apparatus is then placed in such a manner,
that the beam may be in a horizontal direction when the two
bodies subjected to pressure just touch each other. Things
being thus arranged, the pressure is applied; after which, in
order to withdraw the bodies from pressure, two springs are
used, disposed in such a manner as to receive a determinate
tension. The springs, returning to their original state, draw
with them the beam; the bodies are therefore withdrawn from
compression with a velocity equal to the tension of the springs.
The body placed at             the extremity of the tube being with
drawn from      compression,       it is necessary to present it to the disk

zontal shelf.
     The circumstance of the  case being more or less cylindrical,
can in no  respect alter the value of the degrees. The position
of the arm of the lever which carries the disk of gilt paper, is
exactly determined by means of a vertical rule placed on a
circular foot, which is passed along the circumference of the
 circle, and whose centre corresponds to the prolongation of the
 wire of torsion.
    Let us now see the effect of the equal division of electricity
 between the two disks.            It is well known that the total force
 of the    repulsion   varies,   at each distance, in the same ratio as
 the quantities of electricity which contribute to this repulsion:
 it follows therefore that the expression of                 force, which            its                          is

274.             On the Development                         of Electricity              by Pressure.
    In considering the manner in which the development of
 electricity increases in bodies by the augmentation of pressure,
 ought we not to refer to this cause certain luminous phaeno
 mena, the origin of which is as yet imperfectly known 2 It is
 said, for instance, that in the polar seas it often happens that
 light is elicited by the shock of blocks of ice. These enor
 mous masses come in contact with a considerable quantity of
 motion; they must therefore experience great compression,
 which induces upon each of them two different electric states.
 At the moment when compression ceases, the two fluids im
 mediately recombine on account of the conductibility of the
 ice.

        Is not the light disengaged to be attributed to the sud
den recomposition of these
    Iron struck with repeated blows also becomes luminous:
are not the same electric phaenomena of pressure produced in
this instance, as when two masses of ice are dashed together?

280               Dr. Tiarks    on a Method    of reducing
LVII.      An easy Method of reducing Sidereal into Mean Time.
                         By Dr. T. L. TIARKs.”
THE         following tables are useful to those who, having
      clocks or time-keepers that show mean time, have fre
quently occasion to calculate the time of transit of stars over
the meridian, for reducing observations taken out of the me
ridian, or for ascertaining time by the altitude of a star, &c.
   The right ascension of the star is to be taken from Table        III.;
and then, by applying the variation and periodical equations,
to be reduced to the day of observation.               From this right
ascension thus reduced a number is to be           subtracted,   which is
found by Tables I. and II., the quantity for the next preceding
day in Table I. being increased by the quantity corresponding
              .a}
to the number of additional days in Table II., and this sum
is then                          by the mean motion of the sun in
right ascension for the longitude of the place of observation
    West
                of Greenwich.
 {   eaSt   }
   If this number      exceeds the right ascension, 23° 56'4”-09 is
to be added to the latter, or the number is to be calculated
for the next day, and the right ascension to be increased by
24 hours.

                    NEW EXPERIMENTS OF M. DOEBEREINER.
In    the course of the last month some new and most interest
     ing chemical experiments by Professor Doebereiner of
     Jena have engaged the attention of the scientific world.
   These were first announced in this country in the short no
   tice which we extract from the Quarterly Journal, in which
   Mr. Faraday states that he had verified these experiments.
   The last number of the Annales de Chimie which has
   reached us, also contains a note on the subject by MM. Du
   long and Thenard, read to the Academy of Sciences on the
    15th of last month, a translation of which we subjoin. The
   phaenomena discovered by M. Doebereiner were known to
   those gentlemen only by a paragraph in the Journal des De
   bats; they have however been earnestly engaged in researches
   on the subject, which will be read with great interest. Tothese
   we are enabled to add a paper read before the Bristol Philo
   sophical Society by W. Herapath, Esq., for which we are
    obliged to the author and to that new institution.
Since these were prepared for the press, we have been so for
    tunate as to obtain Professor Doebereiner's own account of
   his experiments, and we are very happy that it has arrived
   just in time for insertion in the present number.
     “A   most extraordinary experiment has been made by
M. Döbereiner. It was communicated to me by M. Hat
chette, and having verified                       it,

goes on slowly, the temperature rises little, and water soon
appears condensing on the vessel. Platinum in the spongy state
strongly calcined, loses the property of becoming incande
scent; but in this case, it causes the combination of the two
gases slowly and without a very sensible raising of the tem
perature.       The finely-divided platina, obtained by a well
known chemical process, has no action, not even the slowest,
at the ordinary temperature. The result with wires or laminae
is the same. The comparison of these observations might
give rise to the idea that the porousness of the metal was an
essential condition of the phaenomenon; but the following
facts destroy this conjecture.

about 464° F.
    Gold and silver in thin leaves act only at high temperatures,
but always under that of the ebullition of mercury.        Silver is
less efficacious than gold.     A thick lamina of the latter does.
indeed act, though with more difficulty than the leaves; and
   thick lamina            has an action so weak as to be doubt
 .ul.
    We have also tried if other combinations could be effected
by the same means. Carbonic oxide and oxygen combine, and
nitrous gas is decomposed by hydrogen at the common tempe
rature by contact with platinum in the spongy state. The fine.
leaves of the same metal do not produce the combustion of the
first-mentioned gas, exceptat a temperature above 572°F. Gold
leaf causes it also at a degree near the boiling of mercury.
    Finally, olefiant gas mixed with a suitable quantity of oxygen
is completely transformed into water and carbonic acid by
platinum in the spongy state, but only at a temperature of more
 than 5729 F.
    We would call to mind, on the subject of the preceding ex
periments, that one of us showed long since that iron, copper,
gold, silver, and platinum, had the property of decomposing am
monia at a certain temperature, without absorbing either of the
principles of that alkali; and that this property appeared       in
 exhaustible. Iron possesses it in a higher degree than copper,
 and copper more than silver, gold, and platinum, in proportion
to the surfaces.
    Ten grammes of iron wire are sufficient for decomposing,
 within a few hundredths, a current of ammoniacal gas rather
 rapid, and kept up for eight or ten hours, without the tem
 perature passing the limit at which the ammonia completely
 resists decomposition. Thrice that quantity of platinum wire of
 the same thickness, does not produce nearly a like effect-
                                                               even
 at a higher temperature.
     The remarkable results of this experiment depend, perhaps,
 on the same causes as those which make gold and silver effect
 the combination of hydrogen and oxygen at 572°F., solid pla
 tinum at 518°F., and spongy platinum at the ordinary tempe
 rature.
     Now, if we observe that iron, which so well decomposes
ammonia, does not effect, or but with difficulty, the combi
nation of hydrogen with oxygen, and that platinum, which is
 so effective for this latter combination, produces but with dif
 ficulty the decomposition of ammonia, we are led to believe
 that among the gases some have a tendency to unite under
 the influence of the metals, while others- have a tendency to
                                                         separate ;

separate; and that this property varies according to the nature
ofeach. Those of the metals which would best produce the one
effect would not produce the other, or but in a less degree.
    We shall abstain from offering some further conjectures
to which these singular phaenomena give rise in our minds,
until we shall have terminated the experiments which we have
undertaken in order to verify them.

                                 -                                                   October 20, 1823.
THE       philosophical publications and newspapers have lately
     announced an experiment by Doebereiner with hydrogen
gas and platinum in a finely divided state.       Those announce
ments were either not accompanied by a description, or by one
evidently so inaccurate as to cause chemists in general to treat
it as an attempt at the marvellous: the impression made upon
my mind was, that Doebereiner himself had not discovered the
changes which were effected; and                               I
                                          regret that Mr. Faraday
of the Royal Institution did not prosecute his inquiries further
than verifying the one experiment.
    I therefore made a series of experiments, to make myself ac
quainted with the phaenomena; and, as they throw some light
                             I
upon the subject, beg to offer them to this Society for                                          its   in
formation: but       shall first premise, that
                           I                      was before known         it
that oxygen, iodine, chlorine, and sulphur, would,            some                          in
cases, where they rapidly united, give out caloric and light suf
ficient     produce those effects which have been termed igni
           to

                                      could not but conclude, from
 this most remarkable       phaenomenon,     that the finely-divided
metallic platinum which is        produced   by the igneous decom
 position of the ammonia-muriate, would perhaps exhibit this
singular effect upon the detonating mixture; and, to my great
satisfaction, this supposition was confirmed by the experiment.
Some platinum powder, prepared from the saline precipitate just
named, was wrapped up in white blotting-paper, and brought
into contact with the hydrogen gas; and, as might be expect
ed, no absorption took place, nor any other perceptible mu
tual action.     Upon this I caused atmospheric air to have ac
cess to the   platinum     powder in contact with the hydrogen,
and after the    lapse   of a few moments that remarkable reac
tion took   place;   viz. the gas diminished in volume; and in ten
minutes all the     oxygen    of the atmospheric air admitted had
condensed with the hydrogen into water. I afterwards mixed
pure oxygen gas with the hydrogen in contact with the pla
tinum; a condensation of both immediately took place, and the
platinum heated to such a degree, that the paper in which it
was wrapped was suddenly charred. These experiments were
repeated about thirty times on the same
on which I discovered this remarkable
with the same success every time. .

  It   is impossible to conceive a more simple process than that
of determining with the mural circle the difference of polar
distance between these stars. From their proximity in right
ascension, the operation is the same as that of measuring the
angular distance of two terrestrial objects, about 12° asunder,
with a theodolite surrounded by six microscopes: for the
mural circle, in principle, exactly resembles a vertical theodo
lite; with this difference, that
                  on
                                                        its

                                I

        I can show however   in the present as in the former process,
    that no error from temperature, affecting the instrument, has
    introduced itself into this series of observations; for    obtainI
     the same result from the    readings  with two   microscopes   as
     from those made with six.
        In the case of two microscopes, the angular distance is
     measured upon two arcs only.        Now it cannot be for a mo
    ment contended that an error from temperature, so great as
     not to be corrected by six microscopes, will not be much ex
    aggerated by employing only two. The errors then, if any,
     must arise from the effects of temperature on refraction, and
     not from the changes it occasions in the instrument.         But
     from the season which        I
                                 have chosen for this investigation,
    and from the care that has been taken to equalize the tempera
    ture, the errors arising from the latter cause must be almost
    insensible.    My observations, thus conducted, indicate in the
     most decided manner, that the parallax of a Lyrae cannot ex
     ceed a very small fraction of a second.    The advantages and
     disadvantages of the Dublin and Greenwich methods are in
     this process much more nearly balanced than in the former.
    The Dublin instrument has the great advantage of determin
    ing the zenith distance in the course of a few minutes; whereas
     at Greenwich twenty-four hours at least, and frequently seve
     ral days elapse, before a complete observation of the double
     altitude can be obtained by the method of reflection. This
     disadvantage attending the Greenwich method could only be
     remedied by employing two mural circles for observing a star
     on the same night, both by direct vision and by reflection. .
        I  have now to consider that argument on which the greatest
    reliance in favour of parallax has been placed, namely, that
     founded on the actual determination of the solar equation from
     the observations made with the Dublin instrument.
        This argument may, I think, be thus stated. By a series
     of observations made with a given instrument two equations
     have been disengaged, previously considered as unknown in
     amount, but known only as to the law of their variation.       Of
     these, one is much smaller than the other. Hence it is inferred,
     that as the instrument has faithfully disengaged the smaller
     equation (respecting which there is no dispute), it must be
.    admitted with equal fidelity to have disengaged the larger,
     which might be supposed the easier operation of the two.
      This reasoning is strictly logical, as proving the disengage
      ment of two equations; but it by no means proves the larger
     equation to be caused by parallax. The larger equation here
     to be disengaged is after        all   so
                                      small, that       impossible,
                                                            it
                                                            is            in
     different points of   its
                             period,    show that the law assumed

296                 Mr. Pond          on the Parallaw          of a Lyrae.
 coincides with observation; it is only a rude agreement at
the points of the greatest and least variation that can be de
 monstrated. . The disengagement of the larger equation only
proves therefore the existence of some regularly recurring
CauSe, acting with greatest effect at the extreme seasons.
    The reason, I conceive, why Dr. Brinkley does not find
parallax in y Draconis                 is,
                                  that with respect       the zenith point,
                                                                         to
 his  instrument,     like  every  one        similar ofconstruction,                             isa
perfect instrument.          No portion            of a
                                               the arc      employed, noris
can    temperature      here occasion   any  errors   by       changes. As    its
the star       be examined recedes from the zenith, the instru
               to
 ment becomes less and less perfect; and                     finds        he

reason for suspecting that the discordances observed arise
from temperature             this: the greatest supposed parallax
                             is                                                                    is
found   in  those stars whose maximum and minimum                   parallax         of
would fall       the extreme seasons, and

that irregular refraction, arising from the unequal state                 the                 of
temperature within and without the Observatory, may have had
a  considerable share           occasioning the Dublin discordances,
                                  in
combined, perhaps, with the effect                                 tempera

                                                               is   a
hitherto sufficiently noticed by astronomers, that there are
many cases where the smallest disturbing cause will produce
 an  error quadruple          of      its
                                 own amount; and consequently, that

that we can detect between the most discordant of them. Of
such  a    nature are those disturbances which, like refraction
for   instance,    introduce errors, both positive and negative,
into the determination              either extremity

in the particular case of a Lyrae as undecided, and as per
fectly open to future investigation; but the observations of
the present year have produced on my mind a conviction
approaching to moral certainty.       The history of annual
parallax appears to me to be this: in proportion as instru
ments have been imperfect in their construction, they have
misled observers into the belief of the existence of sensible
parallax.    This has happened in Italy to astronomers of the
very first reputation. The Dublin instrument is superior to
any of a similar construction on the continent; and accord
ingly, it shows a much less parallax than the Italian astrono
mers imagined they had detected.       Conceiving that I have
established, beyond a doubt, that the Greenwich instrument
 approaches still nearer to perfection, I can come to no other
 conclusion than that this is the reason why it discovers no
 parallax at all.
LXII.   On a new Steam-Engine Governor.       By Mr. J. PREUss,
    of Hanover, Engineer, late Inspector-General of French
    Imperial Forests, Fellow of several learned Societies".
ITwell-known
   has been observed by Mr. Doolittle of America, that the
             centrifugal steam-engine governor, invented by
the celebrated James.Watt, is a less perfect regulator of velocity
than might be wished for, particularly for purposes which re
quire a great regularity and nicety in the motion of the steam
engine; as for instance, in cotton mills, &c. Indeed the cen
trifugal forces of two equal masses which perform their revo
lutions round a central point in equal times, being to each
other as the radii of the described circles, it follows, that if
the two balls revolved with an adequate speed, so that their
centrifugal force, which tends to make them           asunder, was fly
exactly counterbalanced by their weight, which tends           make                   to
them collapse, they would continue        their places, but without
                                                   in
exerting any pressure upon them.
    Let      us
           suppose now that their speed happened            increase          to
by quantity, however small; the balls would then
    a                                                            out,                  fly
and       long
            as           as
                    the motion was carried                    on
                                                    with the same
speed, their centrifugal tendency would increase        the interval   as
 increased which separated them.
    Let      us
           further suppose them              to

 double, and it will be necessary that their speed should be
diminished by half, in order to restore the equilibrium be
tween their centrifugal force and their weight, and a still more
considerable decrease of speed would be requisite to make the
balls collapse. Hence the speed must oscillate between the
maximum and the minimum; while, in order to have an equal
motion of the machine, the difference between the two possible
extremes ought to be as small as can be.
   I  have endeavoured to invent a contrivance which might not
be subject to the inconveniencies now stated: how far       I  have
succeeded in my task,    I leave to practical engineers to decide.

                            Description.
a. Is a water-pipe connected to a small forcing-pump, which
   draws water, in order to supply the hot-water pan, out of
   which the boiler is fed. This water may either be drawn
   from the condensor or from a well.

      water flows out of the tank into the hot-water pan. The
      cock can be adjusted upon the scale of the sector, so as to
     transmit the requisite quantity of water in a given time.
  d. A float or close box of copper, or varnished sheet-iron, or
     tin, filled with atmospheric air.
  e. Lever connected on one side to the rod at the top of the
     float, and at            its

A   History and Description of the French Museum of Natu
    ral History. 2 vols. 8vo, published at Paris, and sold by
    George Sowerby, 33 King Street, Covent Garden.
      HIS   work has just been published in Paris under the im
     mediate auspices, and indeed by the direction, of the learned
professors of that noble establishment. At a time when the
singular management of the British Museum has been so com
pletely brought under the public notice, our continental neigh
bours may well feel proud at the appearance of this work. It
commences with a history of the Jardin du Roi, which we
could wish that every person intrusted with the government
of a National Museum would carefully peruse. The reader
indeed will see that, notwithstanding the proud edifice France
has now raised for the study of Natural History, the Jardin
du Roi in          its
                 early days had many difficulties           contend with,          to
owing     to the  trustees, superintendants,         governing     persons,

oblongo-ovatis acuminatis reflexis, spicis axillaribus brevibus
               ºfrom
laxiusculis, lacinia calycis dorsali corolla longiore.” The genus
AEtheilema,                     Ruellia by Mr. Brown in his Pro
 dromus, he has since found to be the same with Willdenow's
Phaylopsis.     This plant was raised by the Horticultural So
ciety from seed from Sierra Leone. Prostanthera lasianthos,
a New Holland plant: Mr. Brown has recorded 13 species
of this genus. Iris neglecta. Salvia mutans. Polygala amara.
This species and vulgaris are often mistaken for each other,
from their variableness, and the difficulty of finding good      di
stinguishing characters: the taste, however, will at once decide,
the vulgaris being slightly acrid without bitterness, whilst the
amara is intensely bitter. Polygala cordifolia, the fruticosa of
Bergius:–Cape of Good Hope. Protaea laevis, from the moun
tains at the Cape of Good Hope. This is the same plant which
Mr. Salisbury gave in the Paradisus Londinensis as longifolia,
“a name already occupied by a very different species, of which
there are three varieties figured in the Botanist's Repository.”

Schizanthus pinnatus, now first drawn from the living plant;
the figure of Ruiz and Pavon, who established the genus Fl.
Peruv., being from a dried specimen. Astelma fruticans, the

“foliis ellipticis acutis, scapo stricto ramoso, perianthii laciniis

columnae alis rotundatis.” An unrecorded species from South
America. Daviesia alata, Smith Linn. Trans. ix. A very rare
plant. Berberis Chitria, the aristata of Decandolle, Syst. Veg.
Under this head we find some animadversions on the work
of the Genevan professor in a spirit of asperity and of exulta
tion at the presumed failure of his undertaking (too great, no
doubt, for any man to hope to accomplish), which we wish had
been spared, and which may perhaps call for some observations
at a future time.     Brewia madagascariensis, a species not de

Tredgold also proposes that the strength of the rafter shall
be obtained by making it flat rather than deep, as he con
ceives that the great depth of the rafter produces a shade in
the house at the period when the sun is low in the horizon;
and at the time when he is at his greatest altitude the obstruc
tion of his beams by the flat rafter will rather be advantageous
 than otherwise.

Dunlop, an ingenious maker of telescopes from Ayrshire,
       ji.
who went out to New South Wales with His Excellency Sir
Thomas Brisbane, as a scientific assistant. Mr. Dunlop was
examining the heavens with a sweeper, when he encountered
this            body. We state this fact on the authority of
Sir Thomas Brisbane, who has recently transmitted to the
Royal Society of Edinburgh a series of valuable astronomical
observations made at Paramatta. It is impossible to speak
too highly of the zeal and talents of this eminent astronomer,
whose appointment to the government of New South Wales
has given such universal satisfaction.     Great credit is due to
him in doing this justice to our modest countryman. Baron de
Zach, who considers the rediscovery of this comet as one of
the greatest efforts of modern astronomy, ascribes            the                                    all

which is much at your service, if it should be thought to merit
insertion in your valuable Journal.
                       I am your obedient servant,

   In prop. 47, produce DB to      meet FC in M, and EC to
meet KB in N.        From the    point    E draw EO parallel to
 CM; and from D draw DP parallel to BN (prop. 31st):
Then will the parallelograms DBCE, DBNP, and - ECOM,
be equal to one another                    G
(props. 35 and 36). The
  arallelograms    DB    TL,
   BRS, and OMRS, are
                             E"
also equal to one another.
For the same reason, the
parallelograms
SRCE, and SRNP, are
                   LT    CE,
equal to one another. Now
LT    is equal to SR (prop.
34); consequently LS is
equal to TR. But the side
SR is evidently common
to the four parallelograms
DBRS, OMRS, ECRS,
and   PNRS;    therefore the
                                        -
                                       ID        LT     E.
lines   FC, KB, and AL, intersect one another in the point
R; or otherwise the opposite sides of parallelograms could
not be equal. But further; draw BL, BS, CL, and C.S.
The triangle FBC is equal to the triangle BDL (props. 34
and 47), or equal to the triangle BSR (props. 37 and 38).
For the same reason, the triangle BKC is equal to the trian
gle CLE, or is equal to the triagle CSR. The three triangles
LDS, LBS, and TBR, are equal to one another (props. 37
and 38). Again, the three triangles LES, LCS, and            Fei.
are equal to one another.   Hence we perceive that the two      tri
angles LBS and LCS, which meet in the point S, on the line
LA, are respectively equal to the two triangles DLS and ELS,
which meet likewise in the point S; or
equal to the two triangles TBR     and
                                             §.

                                                  are respectivel
                                                whose sides B
and CR meet in the point R, on L.A. Besides, we perceive
that because OM is equal to BD, BM is equal to OD.
Therefore the triangles MRB and OSD are equal to each
other, and the triangles NRC and PSE are for a similar
reason equal to each other (prop. 38); consequently the lines
FC, KB, and A L, intersect one another in the point R.

312 Mr. Groombridge's Transit Circle.—Polar Expedition.
          MR. G.Room BRIDGE's TRANSIT CIRCLE.
   Whilst admiring the mechanical skill of him who con
structed the Greenwich mural circle, we were much concerned
to hear that there were some grounds to suspect the accuracy
of another instrument made by the same artist, and generally
considered little inferior to the Greenwich circle itself; we allude
to the four-feet meridian transit circle, late the property of
Mr. Groombridge.          On this gentleman's retiring from the
duties of an active observer, the instrument was disposed of,
liable, however, to an examination on the part of          maker,                   its          as

       efficiency    inefficiency; which investigation being con

gave reason               to
                  fear that some alteration         figure had beenin    its
sustained.    Accordingly, future and more minute examination
was deemed necessary; and             length      was resolved, that
                                                 at                it

          it
and the results      many weeks' observations proved, that those

use the words       the Astronomer Royal, “as coincident with
                           of

the Greenwich mural circle were with themselves.”          Knowing
that the reports     the suspected inaccuracy have extended far

    One of these thunder storms occurred at Rotterdam a few
 days previous, and presented in            progress some interesting

                                                                            4

          to

                                5    it
 the north was frequent. Clouds then suddenly began                drive               to
 from the east, carrying with them along the ground              vapour           a
 like blue smoke, which rose upwards and soon became tinged
of a   deep dusky red.      The lightning was now continual, the
 air seemed on fire, and the thunder rolled               one unbroken  in
 and   unceasing  peal.        grew
                                 It  very   dark,  and the rain poured
 down   in torrents. The storm passed directly over head, but
 at
 a     great height, and the lightning did not strike the earth.
 The air shortly after became clear            the NW., the thunder

Cutting of Steel by soft Iron.—Purple Tint                of Plate Glass. 317
Tenthredo of modern entomologists, or to the Linnaean genus,

tish genera, according to Dr. Leach's division, as given in
Mr. Samouelle's Entomologist's Compendium.
                 CUTTING OF STEEL BY SOFT IRON.
    Mr.  Barnes,   of Cornwall, Connecticut, has ascertained a
singular property of soft iron in cutting hard steel.           He had
fixed a circular   plate  of soft sheet iron on an   axis,  and putting
it into a lathe,  gave   it very  rapid   rotatory motion,    applying,
at the same    time, a file to it to make it      perfectly  round and
smooth; the file, however, was cut in two by the plate, the
latter remaining untouched; and it was found not to have
been much warmed in the operation, though a band of intense
fire surrounded it whilst in action.
    A saw made of a very hard plate, which required altering,
was cut through longitudinally in a few minutes, and after
wards teeth were cut in it by the same means.              Had the file
been used to produce the same effect, it would have required
a long and tedious operation.
    Rock crystal applied to the plate cut it readily.—Silliman's
Jour. vi. 336.
    Mr.Jacob Perkins, of Fleet-street, has verified this remarkable
and useful observation. A piece of a large hard file was cut by
him into deep notches at the end, where, also, from the heat
produced by friction, it had softened and been thrown out like
a bur.    On another part of the file, where the plate had been
applied against              its
                       flat face, the teeth were removed, without
any sensible elevation        the temperature

plate, which had previously been made true, was not reduced
either     in
           size    weight during the experiment, but
                    or                                         had, ac

pable of exhibiting this change; one of them was of a
slight violet tint, the other two purple or pinkish, but the tint
scarcely perceptible except by looking at the edges.         They
were each brokeninto two         pieces; three of the pieces  were
then wrapped up in paper and set aside in a dark place, and
the corresponding pieces were exposed to air and sunshine.
This was done in January last, and the middle of this month
(September) they were examined. The pieces that were put
away from light seemed to have undergone no change; those
that were exposed to the sunbeams had increased in colour
considerably; the two paler ones the most, and that to such a
degree, that it would hardly have been supposed they had
once formed part of the same pieces of glass as those which
had been set aside.     Thus it appears that the sun's rays can
exert chemical   powers   even on such a compact body and per
manent   compound     as glass.”

delicate cases may be neutralized by the small magnets ns, ns

tation will commence, either to the right or left, according to
circumstances, and which will be reversed by reversing the
pole of the magnet.    Fig. 7 shows the same stand with two
magnets.
  This being premised, the reader will easily follow          me in the
detail of the following experiments, observing that when the
motion is said to be to the right or left, he must imagine him
self coinciding in position with the wire about which the ma
chine turns.
   Exp. 1. The rectangle, fig. 2, being applied upon the
stand, fig. 6, and the lamp at É. the rectangle was projected
to the right till D reached the lamp”; it was then propelled
back again, and after a few oscillations it remained at rest at
right angles to                    its
                       first position.

 commenced to the right, which soon increased to 30 revolu

    Exp. 18. The rectangle adjusted as before, and the lamp
 applied at D, the rotation to the left, at the rate of 30 revo
lutions per minute.
    Exp. 19. We now suspended the compound rectangle,
fig. 8, and opposed to it the north end of the magnet, as in
fig. 9, and applied the lamp successively at E, D, G and F.
H.     following were the results:
       Lamp at E, rapid rotation to the right.
       Lamp at D, rotation to the left, 30 per minute.
       Lamp at G, rotation to the left, ditto.
       Lamp at F, no tendency to rotation.
    Erp. 20. The magnet reversed, the lamp applied as before.
       Lamp at E, rapid rotation to the left.
       Lamp at D, rotation to the right, 30 per minute.
       Lamp at G, no tendency to rotation.
       Lamp at F, rotation to the right, 30 per minute.
    Exp. 21. The same experiments were repeated with two
magnets with contrary poles opposed, as shown in <U+017F>ig. 10.
    The results as above, but more rapid: in the last experi
ments we obtained about 30 revolutions per minute, but it was
impossible to count them in these, when two strong magnets.
were employed.
    It should be observed that in no case could any strong ten
dency to rotation be observed when a magnet was employed for
a support, and the exterior magnet removed: fig. 17, in which
one branch is carried further from the magnet, showed the
greatest tendency.
     Apleasing exhibition of a compound motion of this kind is
shown in fig. 16, in which NS is a horse-shoe magnet with
an agate at each pole to rest the wire                and          lamp   in,        i:   a

It must already have struck the reader as remarkable, that         out
of the four positions in which the lamp may be applied in          the
double rectangle (fig. 9), two of them give a rotation in          one
direction, and one of them in an opposite one, and that at      the
fourth point there should be no tendency to rotation what
ever, but on the contrary a decided direction; this latter point
is to the right of the north pole, or to the left of the south pole
of the magnet, the observer assuming his position to coincide
with the axis of motion, as already suggested in the preceding
part of this article. A satisfactory illustration of this singular
phaenomenon will, it is presumed, be considered a strong test
in favour of the hypothesis on which it is founded, particularly
if the same hypothesis should be found competent to the             il
lustration of every other electro-magnetic phaenomenon             hi
therto observed.
    In my “Essay on Magnetic Attractions and on Electro
magnetism,” I have shown that, by supposing the galvanic
conducting wire to act upon the magnet with a tangential force
varying inversely as the square of the distance, we may not
only illustrate but compute the effect of any proposed combina
tion; let us then see how far this same supposition will assist
us in explaining the singular anomaly above mentioned.
    The platinum being positive to the silver; when the lam
is  applied   at the union of the two metals, the fluid will be
 transmitted through the silver wire under the same circum
stances as in a galvanic apparatus, with two plates, it is trans
mitted through the conducting wire from the copper side to
j
the zinc; it ought therefore, when thus transmitted, to project
the north pole of the magnet to the left, the observer now
 coinciding in position with the wire through which the circuit
 passes.    Or the magnet being fixed, and the wire free as in
 our case, this latter ought to be projected to the right hand.
 Thus referring to fig. 9, and conceiving the lamp to be ap
 plied at E, the point E ought to be projected to the right hand
 of the observer, looking towards the magnet, while the points
 F, D, and G (the circuit in these being descending) ought to
 be projected to the left, the observer conceiving himself coin
 ciding in position with these respective wires and always
 looking towards the magnet. On the contrary, when the light is
            at F, then the circuit being ascending at F, and de
 scending in  all   the other branches, this ought to     projected
                                                         be
to   the right, and     all        to
                          the others    the left; and
                                                    so  on, for any
 wire to   which the lamp     isimmediately applied: and      of
                                                             course
 the contrary    to   all
                        this ought to   happen when the south pole
is  applied.     Let figures 11, 12, 13, 14, represent the four ap
 plications of    the lamp    as stated in experiment 19; and
                                                                   º

water being first at zero temperature, V will be the product
of this number of grammes and the quantity Q, given by (10);

  The unity to which V           has respect is the quantity of heat
necessary to elevate the      temperature    of a gramme of water one
degree, which, as we know, is 75 times that requisite to liquefy
a gramme of ice at zero. Consequently, if we assume this last
quantity to be the unity of heat, we must multiply the above
value for V by 75.
   In steam engines, in which this fluid is employed in a state
of saturation, Q does not sensibly vary: the ratio of V to h,
or of the quantity of heat usefully employed in pressure on the
piston, is then,                  all

the whole pressure *76, and not at the particular tension of
the vapour, a case which they have left undecided, Annales de

been wrought out to 128 places of figures 1 (a number far too
great, either to be used or appreciated), without coming to a
conclusion.     For still the Utopian phantom, like the “Cube's
Duplicature,” has always eluded their most sanguine grasp,
although the imperial largess of Charles the Fifth tempted their
efforts with a bait of a hundred thousand crowns ! And the
States of Holland, at a respectful distance followed the Em
peror's example.
   The last of these elaborate operations was that of De
Lagny, a late mathematician of France, and is one of the
many proofs in Nature, that great learning is not always
competent, nor needful, to explain simple matters; for had he

    And as this matter seems heretofore either to have been
totally unnoticed or forgotten, perhaps the reader will pardon
even a mechanical demonstration of this sine qua non, which may
 be given by placing any number of slender rods of known
and uniform dimensions endwise in a row; letting each be
an inch, a foot, &c. long. Suppose, for example, nine such
 of a foot long were to be taken; it is very evident that, if
placed in a STRAIGHT line, they would extend nine feet, as
 indicated by the first power of figures; but should any bend,
 curve, or angular deflection arise in placing them, it is equally
plain that they would fall short of their proper extension, and
that the said discrepancy must be proportioned to their aber
ration from the right line. And if numbers were alike sub
ject to these tortuosities, their conclusions would be equally
indefinite and defective; i.e. unless their indications have a
plenary effect, by operating in STRAIGHT lines, their assump
tions cannot be true / But it is very obvious that figures, as
symbols, of whatever they be made the representatives, must
be true; indeed they are the very and ultimate tests of truth
itself! And in this case they would be considered as unities
of length, or lineal measure, and therefore the measured nine
feet must accord with the numeral nine feet, or concede the
point of infallibility to figures, whose first power it is pre
sumed , is herein satisfactorily identified and demonstrated.
 And with this rectilineal
power, it is that the men
 suration of the perimeter
 of the circle has had to
do; a power which is to
tally incompetent to take
 cognisance of bent or
 curved lines, which the
 segment S of the circle
 would be if the chords
 thereof were extended to
 a thousand millions ! (see

          Mr. J. Snart            on the Quadrature                of the Circle.                343
and 6, and whose differences are therefore found by subtracting
them from 360 degrees.
   Then, as the area of any circle is found by multiplying half
the circumference(in this case= 1.570796825) by half the diame
ter (= 5) we obtain '7853981625 for area of such circle, whose
 w/(=-886226925) squared is 785398162594955625, which
product may be called a quadrature of the circle, as being a
square, whose area is so nearly equivalent thereto, that it is
perfect up to the 1000 millionth place of figures. And as the
thing cannot be done to absolute perfection, discretion must
always adjudge the proper maximum of approximation thereto,
which may be exemplified by the following
                                            Scholium.
    As it has   been demonstrated that the circumference of the
circle can    only   be mensurated by the sum of the sides and
                             greatest inscribing and inscribed poly

gons; so,                     of its                                 taken,        to   be
               if
                those       the inscribed heavagon were
the perimeter would                    be
                                exactly the same        the triple diame

or    half the diameter. Therefore         sweeping     the outer circle
circumscribing the hexagon (fig.                             1),

   Thus, by continual bisections, the sides of the polygon may
be so augmented as to vie with the perimeter of the circle                                              it
self, because the segments are lessened in the same ratio that
the number of sides is increased; but still the smallest por
tions of an arc will eternally be curves, while the chords of
the polygon will as constantly be straight lines, and which
curves can never be assimilated with a polygon of any definite
number of sides whatever.
   And had it not been for the sake of the collateral branches of
science, the mechanic might as well have found this approximat

the mathematician, at least as far as use goes, merely by rolling

countofthe manner in which the analysis was performed, it is the

ing and disposing them, by modes of motion, into outward
forms corresponding to such interior or inward forms.
   Matter,         then, considered in itself, is a passive substance,
 created as an       instrument,    or medium, for the development of
an     active,   living,   immaterial substance, in the ultimate or
 lowest degree of existence, namely, in nature; and this by
 being made the passive subject into which such living and
 active subject may enter and manifest itself. Would not such a
 doctrine, if fully developed, satisfactorily explain some of the
 first principles of the economy of nature, and prove the presence
 of the invisible in the visible world, and the order of life therein?
 Under this view, the natural universe is primarily divisible
 into two universals or principles which enter into every par
 ticular of which it is constituted; namely, the active, imma
 terial, or spiritual; and the passive, material, or natural; the
 latter being created from, and for the use of the former, and
 being the last result of the Divine Operation.
   I   now proceed to offer some further proof of the defective
state of science respecting the solidity and divisibility of ele
mentary matter, by examining the doctrine upon these sub
jects, as laid down in a standard work on natural philosophy
not long since published; in doing which                               I

 gin; the larger one was of about nine, the smaller of about
 three lines in length. On some casts the impressions of the
 abductor muscle were very strongly marked.
    Many of the Bivalves and Univalves were frequently found
with round holes bored into them, which indicated the pre
sence of some predaceous Trachelipodes (? Bohrmuscheln), al
though none of them were found. We met with, however,
a cylindrical irregularly bent tube, which might have origi
nated from a Teredo, but perhaps from a Serpula.
   Dentalites were dispersed about in great numbers, yet always
as casts only, very rarely in single fossil fragments. They
were an inch in length, two lines wide at the base, their trans
verse section circular, and tapered uniformly and with a gradual
flexure towards the apex. The shell appeared to have been
 smooth.                                                    -
   Of Corallines single bits of Madrepores and Millepores were

gether, without a mutual trunk; and the hollow spaces of
which were every where filled with sand, which prevented an
examination of the surface of these branches. They formed,

Rhododendrons, Azalias, Andromedas, and other plants gene

Wimbledon Common, and was of that kind known by the

derable sum for berries picked up from barren wastes and in

the trial to supply the market in a more certain and regular

 Sir E. Home, V.P.R.S., was read, illustrative of the subject of
muscular motion by the structure of the brain in man and va
 rious classes of animals, as microscopically examined and de
lineated by Mr. Bauer; a series of whose drawings were an
 nexed. Part of a paperwas read, entitled, “Some Observa

    The first meeting of this Society, after the summer recess,
 was held on the 4th of November, A. B. Lambert, esq. V.P.,
 in the chair. A great many valuable presents were on the
 table, consisting of works (chiefly foreign) on Natural History,
 and of 85 species of birds sent from the East Indies by Ma
jor-general Hardwicke, F.L.S., among which were a great
 many rare and several new species: with them were also the
 head of Antelope quadricornis (the Chikara of Bengal,) a de
 scription of which had been read to the Society on the 17th
of last June, and a curious species of Musk Rat.
    Two papers from W. Fothergill, esq., communicated by Dr.
 Sims, were read:—A Description of the Swallow-tailed Fal
 con, Falco furcatus Linn., taken near Hawes in Wensley
 Dale, Yorkshire, in 1805; and a Description of a Bird, sup
posed to be the Rallus pusillus of Latham, shot at the same
place in 1807. Read also Observations on the Genus Onchi
dium of Buchanan, with a Description of a new Species; by
the Rev. Lansdown Guilding, F.L.S.             An improved generic
character is given of Onchidium, belonging to the class Mol
lusca, order Cephala, div. Gasteropoda ; “Corpus oblongum,
repens, subtus planum. Penula carnosa pedem totum tegens.
 Os anticum, longitudinale. Anus posticus, infra. Tentacula
duo retractilia.     Oculi terminales.”—Six species are enume
rated, including a new one thus characterized: “O. occiden
tale dorso fusco, atomis brunneis elevatis sparsis, ventre pal
 lido, lateribus lividc-maculatis, brachiis apice divisis.” Found
 in moist places of the mountainous parts of St. Vincent's.

  Nov. 7.—A letter was read, dated May 10, 1823, from
George Cumberland, esq. Hon. Mem. G.S., “On a Fossil of
the Chalk,” accompanied by a drawing.
   A letter was read, dated July 14, 1823, from George Cum
berland, esq. Hon. Mem. G. S., “On a new Species of         En
crinus found in the Mountain Limestone near Bristol.”
   A notice was read, containing an Analysis of the Aluminite
of St. Helena, by Dr. Wilkinson of Bath. Communicated
by Col. Wilks, M.G.S.
   On this analysis Col. Wilks observes, that there is a re
markable difference between the component parts of the alu
minite of St. Helena, and the sub-sulphate of alumine found
at Newhaven and Halle, as given by Phillips, page 111.
   A paper was read “On the Geology of Parts of the Islands
of Madeira, Porto Santo, and Baxo,” by T. E. Bowdich, esq.
   From the investigations of Mr. Bowdich, it appears that
such parts of these islands as he examined, consist principally
of horizontal strata of limestone and sandstone, containing
fossils, intersected and sometimes capped by basalt.
   Nov. 21.——An extract of a letter was read from the Rev.
Lansdown Guilding, M.G.S., containing “An Account of a
Fossil found in the blue Lias at the Berkeley Canal, near Glou–
cester,” accompanied by the fossil.
   A paper was read “On the Lias of the Coast in the Vici
nity of Lyme Regis, Dorset.”       By H. T. De la Beche, esq.
 F.R.S. F.L.S. and M.G.S.
   In a former communication in the first part of vol. i. second
series of the Society's Transactions, the author had presented
an outline of the geological features of the coast near Lyme
Regis. The present paper is intended as supplementary, and
the sections before published are referred to. Mr. De la Beche
now enters into a detailed description, illustrated by a draw
ing, of the various strata composing the lias formation.
   This formation consists of about 110 feet of lias, composed
of more than 72 beds of limestones alternating with the same
number of marl beds, surmounted by about 500 feet of lias
marls.    An account is subjoined of the various fossil shells,
and other organic remains found in the lias, accompanied with
several descriptive drawings.
                   ASTRONOMICAL    SOCIETY.
   Nov. 14.—This Society held     its
                                 first meeting after the late
recess this evening. Many  valuable presents     books, &c.

      Meteorological Society.—Mr.      Pond and M. Bessel.       389
were received, and among these were an elegant inkstand for
the Society's table, presented by an unknown donor, and some
curious specimens of glass for object-glasses,       made by a new
process by a foreign artist, we believe residing at Neufchatel.
    It was announced from the chair, that the Council had
awarded the honorary Gold Medals of the Society to Charles
Babbage, Esq. for his invaluable invention of applying me
chanism to the purposes of calculation; and to Professor
for his investigations relative to the comet which bears his
                                                               É.
name.—Likewise         similar Silver Medals to Mr. Rumker for
the   rediscovery  of M. Encke's comet in 1822; and to M. Pons
for the discovery of two comets in the same year, as well
as for his indefatigable zeal in cometary astronomy.—Such
medals to be presented at the anniversary of the Society in
February next.
    A paper by George Dollond, Esq. was read, descriptive of
a new equal altitude instrument of his invention and con
struction; and the instrument was at the same time exhibited
in the room. It is applicable to every purpose of measuring
vertical angles or those in azimuth, and, by the adoption of two
telescopes and an artificial horizon, affords no less than thirty
two readings of the same observation, if required; while the
usual attention to adjustment of the levels of the instrument
ceases to be necessary, on account of the object being seen by
direct and reflected rays at the same time.
                     METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY.
    The second meeting of this Society took place on Wednes
day, the 12th instant, pursuant to the resolutions given in our
last Number, p. 306, and was numerously attended.           Among
the new members enrolled were Dr. Bostock, F.R.S., Messrs.
 H. T. Delabeche, F.R.S., J. F. Daniell, F.R.S., W. H. Pepys,
 F.R.S., &c. The Society proceeded to appoint a Council and
 Officers, a list of whom, with further particulars of the business
 of the evening, will be given in our next. Dr. Birkbeck was
 elected President.

but also those of other astronomers. In short, the catalogues
of Mr. Pond himself, as published at various periods, differ
from each other in some instances, by as large quantities as
 those above alluded to: and until the comparative catalogues
assume a greater degree of consistency, and become more
free from oscillations, it will be in vain to attempt to reconcile
these fluctuating and minute discordances; which, after all,
perhaps depend<U+017F> on circumstances unconnected with the ob
server or the artist.
   It is fortunate, however, for the interests of astronomy, that
the progress of the science is not arrested till those minor ano
malies are adjusted.       For, whilst we are amusing ourselves
with these minute discussions, and commenting on the ever
varying comparisons, the continental astronomers are, with
rapid strides, enlarging the bounds of the science, as well by
                 .

searches into various interesting points of physical and prac

nine hours.       It was an heroic achievement, and was wit
 messed by crowds of citizens on the shores of New Jersey and
 Delaware, and by the persons on board the flotilla of vessels
 in the bay and offing. During the scuffle, the wings, side
flaps, or vast alated fins of the monster lashed the sea with
such vehemence that the spray rose to the height of 30 feet,

metal itself.   This powder, with the aid of oxygen, has the
property of gradually converting alcohol into acetic acid.

                                                       of the patient.§.
Mr.Murray, in protesting against the hopelessness which seems
to invade the minds of the medical profession in general, goes
on to suggest the expediency of making trial of the prepara
tions of the above-mentioned gas in that most dreadful of dis
eases, rabies canina, or hydrophobia. , Brugnatelli of Pavia
has recorded the cure of four persons in the hospital there, bitten
by a rabid wolf Aqueous solution of chlorine was administered
in these cases. In Troillet's cases, however, solution of chlo
 rine was of no use. In connexion with the history of hydro
 phobia, he gives the case of a woman who was bitten whilst in
 a state of pregnancy, but was not affected till several weeks after
 her delivery, when hydrophobic symptoms manifested them
 selves, and she very soon fell a victim to the malignant virus.
 A sow in farrow, two horses, and a dog, were bitten at the
 same time: the horses and dog died not long after, whilst the
 sow in farrow continued free from the disease till some weeks
 after she had farrowed, when the poison became fatally active.
 The offspring in both these cases were unaffected.        The treat
 ment Mr.M. would deem advisable in a case where hydrophobic
 phaenomena were already manifested, would consist in admini
 stering the solution of chlorine or chlorate of potassa inter
 nally, and galvanism and the nitro-muriatic bath externally,
 besides exposing the patient to an atmosphere weakly charged
 with chlorine: this latter remedy appeared to have some                   .#.
 in allaying the hydrophobic symptoms in a dog, although it
 was not resorted to till four days after the first attack of the
 disease. The animal subsequently died; but
                                                             in its
                                                       death, Mr. M.
 thinks, might        be
                    owing rather           to
                                      obstruction     the alimentary

 being a    consequence          of

 the animal had swallowed         the incipient stage

LXXXIII.    On the Management of Cauliflower Plants, to secure
  good Produce during the Winter.  By Mr. GEORGE Cock
  BURN, Gardener to W. S. Poyntz, Esq.”
     HAVE    the honour to send herewith a head of Cauli
     flower, which I shall be happy to have laid before the
Horticultural Society, as I believe it has seldom been ex
ceeded in size and beauty at this season of the year; and at
the same time I trouble you with a brief account of my mode
of cultivation, which, if you think proper, may accompany                                               it.

        Y success for several years past in protecting cauliflower
        plants, in earthen pits, from frost and snow, during win

   The frames are always kept under shelter in summer, be

ing perfectly dried before they are put up, and with proper
care will last for several years.
   When the plants are put into the pits, the frames are laid
over them.      My method of giving air is by placing in the
  round, near the centre of       pit, a forked stick about four
#. or more in length, strong enough to support the frames
                                       lid

   # am far from thinking that these straw frames will bear                                                   a
 comparison with glass for neatness            appearance; but theyof
have other     advantages    besides their   cheapness:       when they
are raised, the plants          the pits have the full advantage
                                          in                                                                  of
 airand sun, and are but little exposed           wet, the rain being   to
mostly thrown off         the backon   the frames; and when they
                                                     of

    Fig. 1 is also a section of a side of a different construc
tion, but inferior, and less applicable, though being more
simple and on nearly the same principles, I will describe the
nature of that first, or rather both together; the same rea
soning applying to each.          BC is the side forming an acute
angle with the water, and extending some way under the
water, but not far, as balls do not generally penetrate that
part of a ship which is far below the surface of the water;
ST is a board placed as shown, so that there shall be a va
cancy existing between itself and the side of the ship; this
vacancy grows progressively less upwards, till there is only
room left for a ball to pass, and the board is fastened by dif
ferent supports in places to the ship, but these are not put
in this figure, as they would hide the operation. The part
W is so curved as to return the balls after they have struck
the inclined part; but as in this construction the return part
might be struck by balls coming directly against                     without            it,
their having struck the inclined part,               might         required
                                                                    it               be

4,   10             Mr. L. Gompertz's Method of defending
 would not be so hard as assumed, the effect would not be exactly
 as described; though as there would be a continual tendency
 for it to be so, according to the hardness of the side, it would
 be produced to a certain degree, and the ball would accord
 ingly continually widen the indentation, and come out at
 some other point T, instead of I (fig. 2); and as the new                                                          di
 rection would, by the yielding of the substance, be less per
 pendicular than when the material was extremely hard, the
 ball would be the more inclined to follow the curvature of
 the side, and to return, and the less inclined to fly over the
 top of the ship; as the angles of reflection would thereby be
 come still more obtuse every time that the indentations it
 would produce in                   its
                              course would widen,           just alluded            as                           to.

inside of the board ST was (perhaps improperly) coated with
iron; the bullets were of lead, and about one-third part of the
weight of a musket-ball, and they were fired from a blunder
buss well charged.        They made very slight long dents not
 1-8th of an inch    deep  in the deal; and when the additional
board TS was not        used,   they flew upwards and perforated
the iron return part W.; but when the board TS was added,
they each made a dent also near the narrow part I, and fol
lowed the return part W.; and then they returned against a
deal board placed behind the stock of the blunderbuss, and
left moderately deep impressions on                                it.

peared to boil, and again produced the bright coloured                                            at

     By putting the hydrate into a bent tube, afterwards herme
 tically sealed, I found it easy, after decomposing it by a heat
 of 100°, to distil the yellow fluid to one end of the tube, and
 to separate it from the remaining portion.                   In this way a
 more complete decomposition of the hydrate was effected, and,
 when the whole was allowed to cool, neither of the fluids so
 lidified at temperatures above 34°, and the yellow portion not
 even at 0°. When the two were mixed together, they gra
 dually combined at temperatures below 60°, and formed the
 same solid substances as that first introduced.                    when the    If,
 fluids were separated, the tube was cut              the middle, the parts

4 16              Mr. Faraday   on the Condensation
hydrate; or that a decomposition of water would occur, and
euchlorine and muriatic acid be formed; or that the chlorine
would separate in a condensed state. This last result having
been obtained, it evidently led to other researches of the same
kind.     Ishall hope, on a future occasion, to detail some ge
neral views on the subject of these researches.         I
                                                        shall now
merely mention, that by sealing muriate of ammonia and sul
phuric acid in a strong glass tube, and causing them to act
upon each other,       I
                       have procured liquid muriatic acid : and
by substituting carbonate for muriate of ammonia, I have no
doubt that carbonic acid may be obtained, though in the only
trial I have made the tube burst.      Ihave requested Mr. Fara
day to pursue these experiments, and to extend them to all
the gases which are of considerable density, or to any extent
soluble in water; and I hope soon to be able to lay an ac
count of his results, with some applications of them that          I
propose to make, before the Society.
  I  cannot conclude this note without observing, that the ge
neration of elastic substances in close vessels, either with or
without heat, offers much more powerful means of approxi
mating their molecules than those dependent upon the appli
cation of cold, whether natural or artificial: for, as gases      di
minish only about r}r in volume for every — degree of Fah
renheit's scale, beginning at ordinary temperatures, a very
slight condensation only can be produced by the most power
ful freezing mixtures, not half as much as would result from
the application of a strong flame to one part of a glass tube,
the other part being of ordinary temperature: Má when at
tempts are made to condense gases into fluids by sudden
mechanical compression, the heat, instantly generated, pre
sents a formidable obstacle to the success of the experiment;
whereas, in the compression resulting from their slow genera
tion in close vessels, if the process be conducted with common
precautions, there is no source of difficulty or danger; and it
may be easily assisted by artificial cold in cases when gases
approach near to that point of compression and temperature

of liquid muriatic acid was described. Sir Humphry Davy

ments, which         I
                    have done under his general direction, and
the following   are some of the results already obtained:
                               Sulphurous         Acid.
   Mercury and concentrated sulphuric acid were sealed up
in a bent tube, and, being brought to one end, heat was care
fully applied, whilst the other end was preserved cool by wet
bibulous paper. Sulphurous acid gas was produced where
the heat acted, and was condensed by the sulphuric acid
above; but when the latter had become saturated, the sul
phurous acid passed to the cold end of the tube, and was con
densed into a liquid.     When the whole tube was cold, if the
sulphurous acid were returned on to the mixture of sulphuric
acid and sulphate of mercury, a portion was reabsorbed, but
the rest remained on it without mixing.               -
    Liquid sulphurous acid is very limpid and colourless, and
highly fluid. Its refractive power, obtained by comparing it
in water and other media with water contained in a similar
tube, appeared to be nearly equal to that of water.           It does
not solidify or become adhesive at a temperature of 0° F.
 When a tube containing it was opened, the contents did not
rush out as with explosion, but a portion of the liquid evapo
rated rapidly, cooling another portion so much as to leave it
in the fluid state at common barometric pressure. It was
however rapidly dissipated, not producing visible fumes, but
producing the odour of pure sulphurous acid, and leaving the
tube quite dry. A portion of the vapour of the fluid received
over a mercurial bath, and examined, proved to be sulphurous
acid gas. A piece of ice dropped into the fluid instantly made
it boil, from the heat communicated by                      it.
    To prove    in   unexceptionable manner that the fluid was
                         an
pure sulphurous acid, some sulphurous acid gas was carefully
prepared over mercury, and           long tube perfectly dry, and
                                          a
closed  at   one end, being  exhausted,   was filled with       more   it;
sulphurous acid was then thrown                        by

                              or
perfectly clear and dry; but            on

 a very liquid, limpid, colourless state; and so volatile that the
 warmth of the hand generally makes it disappear in vapour.
 The application of ice and salt condenses abundance of it into
 the liquid state again. It boils readily by the difference of
 temperature between 50° and 0°. It does not appear to have
 any tendency to solidify at –10°. . Its refractive power is very
 much less than that of water, and less than any fluid that has
 yet been obtained in these experiments, or than any known
 fluid.  A tube being opened in the air, the nitrous oxide im
‘mediately burst into vapour. Another tube opened under
 water, and the vapour collected and examined, it proved to
 be nitrous oxide gas.   A gauge being introduced into a tube,
 in which liquid nitrous oxide was afterwards produced, gave
 the pressure of      vapourits   equal    above as  atmospheres

    In No.       the levigated powder was decomposed by con
                1,
 centrated muriatic acid, in which it was boiled for three days
consecutively, after which the silica remained behind in gela
tinous lumps. In No. 2, on the contrary, the mineral was
treated with carbonate of potassa, and exposed to a red-heat in
a platinum crucible.        In other respects both were proceeded
with in the following manner:
    The acid fluid, after the separation of the silica, was precipi
tated by a trifling excess of caustic ammonia; the precipitate,
after the lapse of some hours, was placed on a filter, and
washed with boiling water, and then boiled for an hour with
 caustic potassa.        he alkaline solution of alumina was super
 saturated with muriatic acid, and the earth precipitated by
 carbonate of ammonia, washed and exposed to a red-heat.
 The oxide of iron left undissolved by the caustic lixivium,
was dissolved in muriatic acid; the solution mixed with a little
nitrous acid was made boiling hot, then neutralised with caustic
ammonia, and precipitated with succinate of ammonia. The
succinate of iron was converted to a red oxide in an open
platinum crucible. The fluid obtained after the first precipi
tation by caustic ammonia was diluted, warmed, and precipi
tated with a solution of oxalate of potassa; the precipitate col

that a    bridge    on  nearly   the same   principles   was projected
some    years   back by  a gentleman   of the name of    Anderson,  and
a similar one by another gentleman of the name of Loudon.
The plan of the latter is accompanied by some geometrical
references, but which          I do not think are quite explicit, or
calculated to     place  the merits of the question in the clearest

    THE first suspension bridges that         were ever formed, were
probably nothing more than two or three ropes or flexible
chains stretched across a river from two eminences, upon
which boards were placed, and thus formed a tolerably easy
communication between the opposite shores: something of
this kind we are informed were the bridges of the Peruvians
and other primitive nations.
    But when suspension bridges became objects of attention
to more polished nations, the plan of forming the roadway
upon the chains themselves was soon perceived to be attended
with many inconveniences; a much more eligible plan was
therefore early adopted, namely, the forming the roadway in
a perfectly horizontal straight line, and suspending it by
means of chains attached to high towers placed at the ends of
the bridge.       On this plan a suspension bridge has lately been
built over the river Tweed: and the noble structure intended
to form a communication between the opposite shores of the
Menai is proposed to be executed in a similar way.               Fig. 1
is an elevation of a      suspension   bridge  of this   description:—
ACB represents the chain in the form of the catenary curve;
the horizontal roadway EF being supported by vertical rods
attached to the suspending chain.

                Mr. Seaward              on Suspension Chain Bridges.                                    427
    Notwithstanding the great change that has been made from
the primitive plan of the suspension bridge as above described,
still the original form of the suspending chain has been                                                     in
variably preserved: why it has been so preserved is not easy
to determine, because it is quite certain that a suspension
bridge can be built equally well without having the suspend
ing chains in that particular form.                                     -
   Fig. 2 is the elevation of a suspension bridge, wherein the
catenary curve is not employed; the platform of the roadway
being supported by straight diagonal rods attached to the tops
of the two towers.      A suspension bridge may be built on this
plan, with the same quantity of materials, that shall possess
double the strength of one formed on the common plan, as
will be fully demonstrated in the course of the following ob
servations.
   It is well known that the strain or stress on the chain at
the two points A and B (fig. 1.), supposing them to be at the
same altitude, is as the co-secant of the angle CBH, formed
by the direction of the chain, at the point of suspension, and
a horizontal line BH; radius being as half the weight of the
whole bridge, including the chains and               adventitious load    to all
ing.                       great importance

possible the height         the towers,       generally happens that

the aforesaid angle CBH becomes very small; and conse
quently     itsco-secant very considerable, compared with ra
dius; which        the reason that
                     is                    many cases the strain
                                                           in                                                 at

absolute   weight         of
                      the whole    bridge.
   But what particularly deserving
                  is                           notice,      that of   not               is,        it   is

 be  supported under this small disadvantageous angle CBH;
but the whole roadway and loading from end                  end (E                      to              to   F)

plain that the stress upon the different rods will vary consi

gether, were equal to the strain on the catenary curve at B
(fig. 1.), yet as the rods kB, iB, &c. (supporting equal portions
of the load) are much shorter than the others, there would
from that circumstance alone arise a very considerable saving.
 But taking into account the diminution of the strain on the
shorter rods, as also the dispensing with the vertical rods                          al
together, it must be quite clear to every one, on a little re
flection, that the advantages in point of strength must be
decidedly in favour of a bridge built on the new plan.
                                                                           j
   But as it will be much more satisfactory to illustrate what
has been stated above by a practical example,              will proceedI
to  describe,  as far as is  essential,  a suspension     bridge  which
has been proposed to be erected in a distant part of England
on the common principle of the catenary curve: and com
paring it with one recommended to be built on the new
with the same quantity of materials, the superiority of the                         P.
latter will readily appear.
   The bridge in question is proposed to be 400 feet between
the points of suspension A and B (see fig. 1.); the height of
the points of suspension from B to F 33 feet; the                   sine
or deflexure of the curve H to C 27          feet;   and from the ver
tex of the curve to the top of the platform C to D 6 feet; the
length of the platform or roadway from E to F about 892
feet.   The weight of the timber platform, the tram plates,
fencing, vertical rods, the chains between the points of sus
pension, &c., is estimated to amount to about 150 tons; and

the roadway, and allowing a strain of 15 tons on every square
inch of sectional area of the chains.
   We will now suppose another bridge to be built of pre
cisely the same dimensions as the one already described; but
instead of employing the catenary curve, the roadway in this
case to be supported by means of 20 straight diagonal rods as
shown in fig. 11, and let the weight of the roadway, chains,
adventitious load, &c., be still equal to 300 tons. Now if the
platform from E to F be divided into 21 equal parts, as ab, be,
cd, &c., and the rods a B, bb, cB, &c., attached to the points
a, b, c, &c., then will each rod bear a twentieth part of the
300 tons, or 15 tons pressing perpendicularly.
   But the strain upon every one of the diagonal rods a B, bR,
&c., compared with the absolute weight (15 tons) pressing per
pendicularly, will be as the co-secant of the angle a BH, bRH,
&c., to radius; but the co-secant of the angle a BH is as the hy
pothenuse a B of the right-angled triangle anB: therefore it is
plain that the stress upon each of the diagonal rods will be
directly as the length of the rod itself, radius being equal to
                                                                      be,

is reduced one-half, while the load is uniformly distributed
over the bridge; yet it is likely to happen that such an accu
mulation of weight may take place at some one point, as would
produce a greater strain than could possibly occur in the
catenary curve; because under such circumstances the whole
weight would have to be supported by one set of rods only;
whereas in the catenary curve every part of the chain would
be called into action, and therefore the strain upon the latter
would be proportionably much less.”
   In answer to this objection it is proper to remark, that the
greatest accumulation of weight that could possibly occur to
affect the suspending rods on the new plan, would most likely
be by two heavy road waggons going over the bridge at the
                                                       i.
same time in contrary directions, and passing each other ;
it being presumed that, in such case, the whole weight of the
two waggons would be thrown on one set of rods
   Now the weight of two large road waggons, with their load
ing included (as limited by act of parliament), is 13 tons; but
which may be stated at 15 tons, to compensate for any casual
over-weight: and the weight of every portion of the platform
a b, b c, c d, &c. is about 7% tons, making together 22% tons,
which, under these circumstances, may be thrown on one set
of the rods. But it has already been shown, that a weight of
 15 tons passing perpendicularly would cause a strain of 7 tons
per square inch of sectional area on the diagonal rods; of
course a weight of 22% tons would increase the strain to 10%
tons per square inch.     Whence it would appear that circum
stances   might  occur to throw a strain on the rods of 3% tons
per square inch more than what it was proposed they should
sustain: and thus the presumed merits of the plan would be
 considerably diminished.
    Now admitting, for the sake of argument, that the above
 conclusions are just, it is but fair to remark, with respect to
the catenary curve, that it is quite as likely this latter may be
affected by a strain of 15 tons per square inch, as that the
diagonal rods, according to the foregoing reasoning, may be
affected with a strain of 10% tons per square inch. Therefore,
allowing the full force of the objection, it is still manifest that
the advantages are decidedly in favour of the new plan.
    But on examining the matter a little more closely, it will be
 found that the objection rests upon two assumptions which
 are quite inadmissible.    In the first place, it is assumed that
 the whole weight of the two waggons must necessarily be
 thrown upon one point of the bridge, and consequently sus
 tained by one set of rods only.     #.    the weight of the two
 waggons never can be so drawn into one point;

 hinder wheels of a waggon are generally 7 feet, apart from
 the others; and therefore when the fore wheels of the two wag
 gons come in a line with a set of rods, it follows that the whole
 weight will not press upon that set of rods only, but a con
 siderable part will be thrown on the contiguous rods: and
 place the waggon in any other relative position, the effect pro
 duced will be nearly the same.
    In the next place, it is assumed that the platform of the
 roadway will be made of such flexible materials, that a weight
 coming upon any particular point, that point must necessarily
 be pressed down, without communicating any motion to the
 adjacent parts, and thus        the weight would   all thrown                            be                on
 one set    rods only.

      is presumed that what has been stated is quite sufficient
 to show that the objection is altogether groundless. And now
 to conclude, with a short recapitulation of the merits of the
question: It is to be noted, on the one hand, that in the sus
pension bridge built on the principle of the catenary curve,
the weight of the platform, chains, &c. (without any loading),
will throw a strain of 7% tons per square inch on the suspend
ing chain; and that this strain may with great probability be
increased to 15 tons : while, on the other hand, by employing
the diagonal rods, the weight of the platform would produce
a strain of only 3% tons per square inch, which strain could
never exceed 7 tons per inch.       In short, the strain in the
new plan would, under a parity of circumstances, be always                                                       -

                      to                       that time prevented       at

which was just before Mr. Holdred had communicated                me                                 to

            Upon my first examination of the figurate method,                                    I    per
  ceived that the same process which served to transform equa
  tions by diminishing their root would also extract their roots,
  if each root were continually diminished by a figure at a
  time. It was therefore evident to me, that whether Sir Isaac
  Newton's method or my own were applied, the object would
  be accomplished by either; but as the theorem which                  had                       I
 already discovered was also a theorem for the summation of
  figurate numbers,                      I
                            immediately reduced Newton's method
 to my own formula, and from this source alone derived the                             I
                          I
 rule which have applied to the non-figurate method in my
  own publications.
     This general method of transforming functions first oc
  curred to me when writing my Introduction to the Method of
  Increments, published in 1817 by Davies and Dickson.                  In
 page 126 of this Introduction, my general method of trans
 formation is hinted at; and in the same page an example of

     Take the square root of the last figure 3, which is 1, and
  proceed as if it were required to diminish the root of the
  quadratic equation a’ +0a–3=0 by 1.

XCII.      On the Law according to which the Electro-Magnetic
   Power of the Connecting Wire of the Voltaic Pile is aug
   mented by Schweigger's         Multiplier.     By L. F. KAEMTz,
   Phil. Doct., of Halle.*
  1.   IMMEDIATELY               after Oersted's discovery had be
          come   known,   the idea occurred to Professor Schweigger
of increasing the electro-magnetic power of the voltaic pile
by winding the connecting wire around the compass; he
showed at the time, in his lectures, some experiments, with
intent to examine in what degree the electro-magnetic power
would be augmented by each additional convolution of the
wire around the compass.          The experiments, however, which
were made here soon after the invention of the multiplier,
were unsuccessful as to the discovery of a determinate law
for this increase: (see Schrader de Electro-magnetismo, $2.
                                               I
 Schweigger's Journal, N.R. bd. i. p. 6.) considered, therefore,
 that it would not be superfluous to ascertain this law by more
 exact experiments.
     2. Before   I proceed, however, to the description of the ex
     * From Schweigger and Meinecke's   Nues Journal, band viii. p. 100.

4:42                  Dr. Kaemitz on the Augmentation of
periments themselves, I will develop a few formulae by which the
amount of the electro-magnetic power may be found from the
given angles of attraction or repulsion of the magnetie needle.
   M may therefore denote the power of the terrestrial mag
      netism;                                -
   m the magnetic power of the needle, whose length is = 1.
   Now if the dipping needle is brought round an angle c out
of the magnetic meridian, then the terrestrial magnetism strives
to bring the needle into the meridian again, and with a power
too which is equal to
                                                M    m. sin. c.

the electrical apparatus, from the angle               repulsion     at      of             or
traction, where both powers (the terrestrial magnetism and the
electro-magnetism) are            equilibrium, there are two cases
                                           in                                                        to
 be distinguished: namely, the connecting wire either passes
through the magnetic meridian,              forms      angle with
                                                          or                 an              it.

 exact, as it was taken for granted, that the conneting wire and
 the needle were lying in one plane.                   If,

the above, may be very easily developed in the following                                      man
ner.    I have here the case in view,  IS
in which the connecting wire
passes through the magnetic meri-      I)
dian. Let KZ be the wire, NS the
direction of the magnetic meri
dian, and the original situation of
the needle, which now stands in
ns in equilibrium with the terre
strial magnetism, and moves in
the plane D'EG.       Now let DD’
be the distance of the wire from
the plane, in which the needle
moves, which distance       we will
state = X.     Now DE is = E.; if *
we divide this power into DG and
 EG, then we have                             S
                                          Z.

      Now the electro-magnetic power acts inversely as the                                      di
stance   DE. But it is

    5. Setting out from these principles, I made several series of
experiments, in order to develop the law of the relation of the
magnetic power of the connecting wire in Prof. Schweigger's
multiplier to the number of convolutions it was made to
take.                                      I
          For this purpose made use of a magnetic needle six
inches in length, made by M. Kraft an instrument-maker of this
town.       Glass tubes had been applied to the compass, at two
opposite points, through which the wire was introduced.

               In this
ments made for the purpose, the diminution of intensity may
be neglected at the commencement.     It is also convenient,
that the electromotor be  always immersed in the acid in an
equable manner, not quicker at one time than at another.
    The diminution of intensity appears to have some relation
likewise to the region of the globe in which the electromotor
is situated. This however is merely a supposition, to which
I  have been led by experiment;        will not venture to main                  I
tain that it is an absolute fact.
    Ihave also to observe, that the wire had always an equal
length in my experiments, which is in            cases important,                                        all
since the   length     the  connecting of
                                        wire  greatly weakens the

XCIII.     Suggestions   for rendering  the Labours   of    Foreign
             Astronomers available in Great Britain.
   To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
          persons who are fond of astronomical pursuits must
AH!.  be  grateful to those correspondents who occasionally
convey important intelligence by means of the Philosophical
Magazine.      The article lxxxvii, in the No. for last month,
contains much information which probably would have been
confined to a few men of science in the metropolis, had not
the liberality of the writer communicated it to the pages
of your Magazine.         The activity of the foreign astrono
mers appears very remarkable; but from their works being
principally written in German, and from the difficulty of pro
curing them, the labours of these philosophers remain in a
great degree unheard of by many. It would be a subject
worthy the attention of the Astronomical Society, to request
their Secretaries to communicate any circumstances which
may be curious or useful, received from the continent, for the
information of the distant members. .      I beg leave to suggest
to this Society, how desirable it would prove, if the occulta
tions which are given in the Philosophical Magazine, from
Inghirami, for 1824, could be published, as observed by those
experienced astronomers who have accurately verified the po
sition of their observations. But it would be still more grati
fying if the time of some of these occultations as seen at Green
wich could be made known; but this is perhaps too much to
ask. It would also be extremely advantageous to know the
culmination of the moon's preceding limb, in sidereal time, as
seen at Greenwich during the early part of the moon, for the
purpose of comparing longitudes by means of stars near her
course, as mentioned in page 392 of the Philosophical Magazine
of last month. The theory of this operation is described at
page 854 of Woodhouse's Astronomy, &c.; and it would oblige
many observers if the formulae for the correction of the pro
 cess, which are said (page 892) to have been prepared by
colai, Bessel, &c., could be communicated thröugh the pages
                                                                Ni
 of the Philosophical Magazine, as the works of these great men
are in the hands of few in this country. Dr. Brinkley's for
mula is generally used; but still, without simultaneous co
operation, both occultations and lunar transits become little
more than amusing sights; for, unless the observed time at
 Greenwich were accurately known, much uncertainty must
remain; as the calculated time, from the imperfections of lunar
tables, could not be implicitly relied on, to seconds, in de
ducing longitudes at distant places.      It must be

   also, that unless the distances were within certain limits,
   the  preceding  limb of the moon would not be so proper as
   the centre, on account of the change in the moon's diameter.
   But this would not be necessary for experiments within the
   shores of our island.  Should any gentlemen, in various parts
  of the country, be desirous of making observations of this
  kind, the writer would with pleasure prepare a table of the
  moon's place corrected, and a few selected stars preceding and
  following of the same declination, as near as possible, for the
  early age of the moon, during the beginning of the next year,
  and transmit it to the Philosophical Magazine.       The result
  of such observations would ascertain to what degree of accu
  racy this method would answer the purpose intended.        But
  the observed time at Greenwich is the great desideratum, as a
  guide to               all
                 observers,       series    experiments

 conferred, by the observations made at Greenwich, on naviga
 tion, and our maritime interests, repaying a hundred fold #.
 liberal expenditure of Government on this great national esta
 blishment. . In speaking of the labours of Mr. Pond, he
 mentioned that the two most important points of research to
 which he had directed his attention, were the question of
the parallax of the fixed stars, and observations which seem to
show a considerable apparent southern motion of many of the
principal fixed stars.      Mr. Pond thinks there is no evidence
of a sensible parallax. Dr. Brinkley, on the contrary, is of
opinion that this parallax distinctly exists.          The Council of
the Royal Society, said the learned President, do not mean in
any manner by their award of the medal to express an opinion
on this subject"; for when two such observers differ, the ques
tion cannot be considered as settled: and he paid the highest
compliments to the profound mathematical knowledge, acute
ness and accuracy of research, and extent of view, of Dr.
Brinkley; and between his observations and those of the
Astronomer       Royal, the problem of parallax was now, he
said, reduced within very narrow limits; but perhaps more
perfect instruments and observations will be required for
its  complete solution. On the supposed southern declina
                                impossible, said the learned Presi
         to of

experience              of

    the Lampyris   noctiluca, or Glow-worm,    was concluded on this
    evening. The writer, after detailing the opinions of various
    naturalists on the nature and cause of the light of the glow
    worm and other luminous insects, proceeds to relate his own
    observations and experiments, which show that this light is
    not connected with the respiration, nor derived from the solar
    light; that it is not affected by cold, nor by magnetism, nor
    by submersion in water. , Trials of immersion in water of
    various temperatures, and in oxygen, are detailed. When a
      low-worm was immersed in carbonic acid gas, it died shining
      rilliantly: in hydrogen it continued to
    seem to suffer.

    independent not only of the respiration, but of the volition
    and vital principle.   Some of the luminous matter obtained
    in a detached state was also subjected to various experiments,
    from which it appears to be a gummo-albuminous substance
    mixt with muriate of soda and           of alumine and potash,                                      .

Address of the Chairman (Rev. WILLIAM KIRBY, M.A. F.R.
  and L.S., &c.) read at the Meeting of the ºoological Club of
  the Linnaean Society held at the Society’s House in Soho
  Square, Nov. 29, 1823.
Gentlemen,
   Before we proceed to business, permit me to address a few
words to you, upon what appear to me to be the principal
objects of our association, and upon the best methods of car
rying them into effect. I see many Gentlemgn here present
who, from their more extended knowledge of every branch of
the science from which we take our name, are much more
competent than myself to perform this task to your satisfaction,
and upon some one of them I could wish it had devolved: but
as your kindness has placed me in this chair, I will endeavour
to fulfill this part of my official duty to the best of my abilities.
I  must previously state, however, that particular circumstances
and engagements have unavoidably prevented my putting my
thoughts together till after my arrival in town. They have,
                            ...;
in consequence, been arranged more hastily than I could have
wished, and without the             books.     I
                                               must therefore solicit
your indulgence for any imperfections of style or matter that
may strike you in this address.
   Zoology may be regarded as including several provinces, in
every one of which our knowledge is at present very imper
fect; and therefore contributions upon every subject which
they include, as your taste and turn of mind may lead you,
provided there is no waste of time and talent upon what is tri
vial and uninteresting, or has been already thoroughly investi
gated, will be acceptable and valuable.
   There is one of these provinces that I think ought to stand
high in the esteem of every patriot Zoologist—I mean the
study of the animals that are natives or periodical visitants of
his own country.       An indigenous Fauna is the first desidera
tum in our science; and could a work of this kind be accom
plished in every country, regard being had to natural bound
aries, we might hope to become acquainted with            the prin

ing a separate department suited to his talents and previous
pursuits, this grand desideratum might at length be effected.
It strikes me that this object might be put in train by the means
and under the patronage of the Zoological Club. I see now
around me a number of Gentlemen sufficiently learned in na
ture, and several who have drunk deeply at her well-spring of
knowledge, who, if once they undertook the task, would accom
plish it with the highest credit to themselves and to the great
advantage of the science they cultivate.         Let the members of
our new-born institution, amongst other subjects, discuss this
point amongst themselves at their meetings—weigh the diffi
culties—investigate the means—consider the proper persons—
apportion the work—set their shoulders to the wheel, and the
thing will half be done; for most true is that aphorism—
                                                                         -

 But let me not be misunderstood on this subject: I do not
mean that such a work should be read at our meetings, or ap
pear in the Transactions of our venerable Parent Society.
 This would be inconsistent with the nature of a Fauna, which
 ought to be published in a different form, and appeal more
 directly to the public for support on the ground of                  own         its

little interest or utility; but when the localities of the Anima
lia rariora are given, or a district catalogue is worked into a
catalogue raisonné, and includes facts before unknown with re
gard to the animals it registers, it becomes a useful document.
  o note the soil, the kind of country and atmosphere that
particular animals affect, makes such a catalogue more inter
esting. The relative proportion, where glimpses of it can be
obtained, that different species bear to each other, or their
numerical distribution in any given district, is a speculation
worthy of the attention of the zoologist; and likewise to ob
tain as full an account as possible of those which are particu
larly detrimental to us either in the garden, the orchard, the
forest, or the field.

of the Persian Gulf, to a great extent, consist of a calcareous
formation, which, it is ascertained, in many parts continues flir
inland.   In a part of this formation, his route from Bushire
commenced; between which place and Shiraz, the hills are
composed of sulphates and carbonates of lime, and the strata
often much disturbed.     Through a large tract of this country,
carbonate of lime is ite            ºfwith
                                       the gypsum; but in parts
rocks of  pure gypsum   occur, and  very frequently accompanied
by salt. Streams and lakes of salt abound, and there is a con
siderable one of the latter at Shiraz.    Proceeding northward,
the route from Shiraz to Ispahan, a distance of about 250
miles, lies over an elevated country, the nature of which is                              si
milar to that before described, but the carbonate of lime pre
dominates.   Between the village of Gendoo and the town of Yes
dikhaust Mr. Fraser found clay slate, and a conglomerate rock
inclosing pebbles of quartz, greenstone and limestone cemented
by carbonate of lime; strata of this aggregate rock alternate.
with a finer sandstone.    The mountains between Ispahan and
Teheran are of a character very different from the preceding;
among them clay slate was observed, and the highest region,'
which reaches a great elevation, consists of granitic rocks.

466    Mr. Pond and M. Bessel.—Astronomical Information.
Wednesday, January 14; and which will be resolved, when
the legislative business has been concluded, into an Ordinary.
Meeting, for the reading of papers, &c.
             XCVI.    Intelligence and Miscellaneous            Articles.
                        MR. POND AND M. BESSEL.
  N   our last Number we referred to a singular rumour, which
    had been circulated with much industry, relating to the
bending of the telescope attached to the meridian circle at
Königsberg: and we ventured to contradict that report, on
the authority of the gentleman to whom the communication
was said to have been first made.        We have since seen letters
from M. Bessel himself, of whom        inquiries  had been expressly
made relative to this assertion; in one of which he expresses                    .
himself thus:
    “With respect to my catalogue of the declinations of the
principal stars,      I
                      think the information which you sent me
must be founded on some misunderstanding, since               have notI
the least suspicion that it is    wrong.     The effect produced     by
the bending of the telescope of my circle,       appears   to me to be
 so well determined   that, in this respect, I can  expect   no further
improvement without running the risk of greater inaccuracies.
 In my method, both of observation and computation, I have
 never neglected any thing that could have any influence of
                                  I
 consequence: therefore cannot throw any light on what you
 say, unless some one would point out inaccuracies at present
 unperceived by me, which might produce an alteration.
    “The whole of my proceedings are laid open to every
 astronomer in the 7th number of my Observations: and those
 who devote to them an attentive examination, will have greater
 confidence in what I have stated, than by listening to any idle
 reports.”
    In another letter M. Bessel expresses himself still more
 forcibly: but it is unnecessary to multiply this evidence, as we
 presume the public is by this time convinced of the falsehood
 of the report above alluded               to.

 remarkable example of the great good that may be effected
 by an active and intelligent observer, with even very ordinary
 instruments.     Amongst the other papers we notice a very
 valuable one    by  M. Mathieu on some experiments made by
 the French, on the invariable pendulum, in the southern
hemisphere; and in which will be found some new and                                 in
 teresting matter.    These experiments are compared with those
 made    by Sir Thomas Brisbane in New South Wales (which
 appear to have been communicated to the Board of Longitude
 at Paris, as well as to the Royal Society of London); and the
result produces nearly the same compression of the earth as
that previously deduced by Capt. Kater.        Prior to the sailing
of the  expedition,  M.  Arago   assembled  Cap. Duperrey and his
principal officers at the Royal Observatory at Paris, and                           in
structed them in the mode of conducting the delicate observa
tions which they were about to make, and of handling the va
rious instruments that would be necessary for that purpose.

pleasure that he has been raised, in the Board of Longitude,
to the class of Astronomes, in the place of M. Delambre de

     For example: Let                 the temperature
                                        of 100 cubic inches of
gas be 32°, and it is required to find the bulk at 212°; then
t=212–82=180,and A=100,hence”; “”-187-5–B.
  Again: Let the bulk at 212° be 137:5 cubic inches, required
the bulk at 32°.
137.5, hence
                  In this case also we have    180, and                   t-            B

                                 T450 ITSO       F 100 = A.
  Another example may be taken when the temperature of
100 cubic inches is 50° to find the bulk at 60°; in this case
t= 10°, and A= 100, therefore
                            *...*

   These will be sufficient to show that the gentleman who has
attempted to correct the writers on chemistry, has given a
rule which is not perfectly accurate (see Philips's Annals of
Philosophy for December 1823, p. 415). He makes the bulk,
as increased by expansion, in the last example only 102-008.
In fact, the rules given by the chemical writers he has quoted,
are accurate when the temperature is increased; while his own
is only correct when the one of the temperatures happens to

of Champlain, were alarmed by the following extraordinary

arpents,    was   suddenly moved five or six arpents (about 360
yards) from the water's edge, and precipitated into the river
 Champlain, overwhelming in                       its

thereof, and to communicate with the centre or upper parts of such kilns
or ovens; also by conveying the flame and heat of one kiln more into an
other or others by means of chimneys or flues, and thus permitting the
draft and smoke of several kilns or ovens to escape through                 of
a central kiln or oven of great elevation, whereby the degree of heat is in
creased in the several kilns or ovems, and the quantity of smoke diminished.
