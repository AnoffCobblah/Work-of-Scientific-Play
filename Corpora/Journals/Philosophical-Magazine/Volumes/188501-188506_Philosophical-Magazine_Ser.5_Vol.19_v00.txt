 164.    THEtheexperiments         described in Part VIII.f show that
                     difference in E.M.F. between two two-fluid
 cells containing metallic salts in solution, and alike in all
 respects save that one of the fluids is of different degrees of
 concentration in the two cells respectively, can be readily
 obtained by opposing the two cells to one another, and mea
 suring the current set up through a total resistance large
 enough to reduce the current to such an extent that its den
 sity, in reference to the plate-surfaces in the cells, falls below
 *Certain limiting value variable with the details of the con
 struction of the cells; and, further, that the same value is

2 Messrs. Wright and Thompson on the Determination of
decrement" due to a given increase in strength of the other
fluid, then E and e, the electromotive forces of the cell when
 containing the two stronger and the two weaker fluids respec
tively, are related so that, within experimental-error limits,
                              E=e-H a-b.
     It follows from this fact, and from the circumstance that in
 many cases the values of a and b are considerable fractions of
 e, that the great majority of the valuations hitherto made and
  published of the electromotive forces of various two-fluid cells
  cannot be properly compared with the heat-evolutions due to
  the net chemical actions taking place in the cells; because no
 accurate valuations having been made of the strengths of the
  solutions used, and the precise character of the plate-surfaces
  employed not having been noted, the values of the terms a
 and b cannot be calculated with precision so as to enable the
  values of E to be deduced for some given standard-strength
  of solution (e.g. for strength MSO, 100H,0, or MCI, 100H.0,
  &c.). Differences of several centivolts, and even decivolts,
  exist between the values assigned to certain voltaic combi
  nations by different observers, mainly due to this cause.
  Accordingly it becomes necessary to repeat most of the work
  of previous experimenters with due regard to these points
  before comparisons can be satisfactorily instituted. A large
  number of cells have therefore been examined during the last
  four years, under strictly comparable conditions, in order to
  obtain sufficiently accurate values for the purpose of tracing
  out the correlations subsisting in different cases between the
  heat-evolution due to the net chemical change and the maxi
   mum E.M.F. actually developed, when so small a current
   flows as to cause no appreciable diminution by “polarization.”
      All these observations completely confirm the conclusions
  already arrived at, that Volta's law of summation holds within
  the limits of experimental error, and that the effect of a given
  alteration in the molecular strength of a saline solution sur
  rounding one of the plates of a two-fluid cell is sensibly indepen
   dent of the nature of the other fluid and the other plate. It
   hence becomes possible to assign numerical values or constants
   to given metals immersed in solutions of their salts of given
   nature and strength, such that the E.M.F. of a voltaic com
   bination formed by combining two such immersed metals (b
   allowing the two solutions to interdiffuse, e.g. in a Raoult cell
      * With cells set up with acid fluids (e.g. dilute sulphuric acid) sur
   rounding the plate acquiring the lower potential, increasing the strength
   of the acid fluid not infrequently causes an increment, and not a decre
   ment, in the E.M.F. of the combination; e.g. in Daniell cells (§§ 112–114,
    Part V.).

       Chemical Affinity in terms of Electromotive Force.       3
or in a “gravity” cell) is calculable by taking the difference
between the constants; i.e. by employing the formula
                           E=C1-C,
where E is the E.M.F. of the combination, and C, and C, the
two constants involved, such that if C1-C, is of + sign the
metal to which C1 applies acquires the higher potential, whilst
if C1-C, is of — sign the metal to which C, applies acquires
the higher potential. For instance, if C, apply to zinc and C,
to copper in sulphate solution, C1-C, = + 1-114, and copper
acquires the higher potential ; whilst if C, refer to magnesium,
Cl–Cl––725, and zinc acquires the higher potential.
   165. The value of the voltaic constant thus applicable to any
given metal is variable, within certain limits, with its surface
conditions (according as bright fused metal, electro-deposited,
amalgamated, &c.), and also with the nature and strength of
the solution of its salt in which it is immersed, and probably
also with the temperature, but is independent of the nature of
the other half of the cell.   In order to fix the numerical value
some convention must be made as regards the zero to be
adopted as starting-point. For this purpose, and in view of
the comparisons desired to be instituted between the values of
C1-C, and the heat-evolutions due to the net chemical
actions taking place, the most convenient assumption appears
to be this —that the potential of an amalgamated zinc plate
immersed in a solution of a given salt of zinc of given mole
cular strength is assumed to be zero, for the purpose of fixing
the numerical value of the potential of a plate of the metal to
be examined when immersed in an equally strong solution of the
corresponding salt of that metal, the two solutions being allowed
to interdiffuse (e.g. in a “gravity” cell or in a “Raoult”
cell). For instance, when     º     of electro-copper or cadmium
are respectively immersed in solutions of the sulphates of these
metals, and opposed to amalgamated zinc immersed in zinc
sulphate solution, the molecular strength throughout being
1.0MSO, 100H2O, the potentials of the copper and cadmium
plates are respectively +1.114 and +360 volt higher than
the potential of the zinc plate; which values are accordingly
the “voltaic constants” for electro-copper in 1:0CuSO,
100H2O, and for electro-cadmium in 1:0CdSO, 100 H,0
respectively: whence it results that the E.M.F. of a cell set
up with electro-copper and electro-cadmium plates and solu
tions of the sulphates of these metals of molecular strength
1.0 MSO, 100 H.O will be
              E=C1-C, -1-114–1360="754,
which in point of fact is the case.    On the other hand, when
magnesium is opposed in the same way to zinc in sulphate
                               B 2

4 Messrs. Wright and Thompson on the Determination of
solutions of strength 1:0MSO, 100H2O, the former metal
acquires a potential lower by 725 volt than that of the latter;
whence it results that –725 is the voltaic constant for mag
nesium in sulphate solution of this strength ; wherefore the
potential difference set up between magnesium and copper in
sulphate solutions of this strength will be 1114–(–725)=
1839 volt, which in practice is found to be the case. Evi
dently Volta's law of summation is involved in the proposition
that the E.M.F. of a voltaic combination is the algebraic dif
ference between the values of the voltaic constants as thus
defined.
   If the value of a given voltaic constant applying to a given
metal immersed in a solution of one of its salts of given
strength be known, that for any other given strength is readily
calculable by means of the formula E=e--a-b º, tables of
the values of a and b are extant, like those given in Part VIII.
for certain kinds of plate-surfaces in chloride and sulphate
solutions.
   Out of a large number of voltaic combinations examined,
consisting of two metals immersed in solutions of their salts
of a given kind (e.g. sulphates, chlorides, nitrates, or acetates),
only a few have been found to possess an E.M.F. which, when
at its maximum, differs by but little from the value calculated
from the heat-evolution during the net chemical action taking
place in the cell, i. e. from the difference between the heats of
formation of the two salt solutions forming the electrolytes;
the great majority either fall short of this value, or exceed it by
quantities well outside of the limits of experimental error.     In
cells of the latter class, it is evident that the extra work which
can be done by the passage of a current through a large external
resistance over and above that due to the net chemical change,
must be accomplished by a transformation of sensible heat
into electric energy; i. e. it is done at the expense of sensible
heat, such cells resembling in this respect various of the dif
fusion-cells described in Part VIII.        º still more remarkable
 class of cells has been found, however, in which the current
 flows in the direction opposite to that deducible from the rela
 tive heats of formation of the electrolytes, so that, instead of
 the plate immersed in the solution of the salt of greater heat
 of formation acquiring the lower potential (as the zinc plate
 in a Daniell cell), it actually acquires the higher potential.
 The passage of a current in such cases, consequently, is
 accompanied by a twofold transformation of sensible heat into
 current energy, actual or potential; for the chemical changes
 that take place in the cell are accompanied on the whole b
 heat-absorption, whilst any work done externally must be

        Chemical Affinity in terms of Electromotive Force.               5
  performed at the expense of sensible heat". Twenty such
 combinations have been examined, vide § 209.
    166. An attentive consideration of these and other allied
 phenomena leads to the conclusions that, since only in excep
 tional cases does the formula hold,
                           EH = E = Cl     - C,
 (where Eh is the E.M.F. corresponding to the net heat-evolu
 tion due to chemical change in the cell), the E.M.F. actually
 generated must be due to other causes in addition to the heat of
 chemical change ; and that all the observed phenomena may
 be clearly accounted for if it be assumed that the difference
 of potential set up between the two plates of the voltaic com
 binations examined is due to the superposition of two causes—
  one, the net heat-development or difference in heat of forma
 tion of the two electrolytes surrounding the two plates respec
 tively; the other, an action akin to that taking place in a
  thermoelectric combination, and, like that action, expressible
  numerically by the algebraic difference between two constants
 applicable to the two halves of the combination respectively;
 so that if ki and k, be the two thermovoltaic constants appli
 cable respectively to the metals (and corresponding with the
 voltaic constants C, and Cº), and En be the E.M.F. corre
 sponding with the difference between these heats of formation,
 then                 E=C1-Cº-EH + k) – kg.
 If, then, ki—k, does not differ greatly from zero, E and EH
 are nearly equal ; if, on the other hand, ki—k, has a consider
 able value, E exceeds or falls short of EH according as that
 value is positive or negative in sign. If ki-kº is negative in
 sign and also is numerically greater than EH, E is of the
 opposite sign to EH. This case corresponds with the class of
 cells above referred to in which the metal actually acquiring
 the higher potential is the one which would be expected to
 acquire the lower one, were the heat of chemical action the
 sole cause of potential difference in the cell.
    The value of the thermovoltaic constant applicable to any
 given metal necessarily varies in the same way as that of the
 voltaic constant; i. e. it is to some extent dependent on the
 nature of the metal surface, and varies with the nature and
strength of the solution of the salt of the metal employed to
   * A somewhat analogous phenomenon is presented by gravity-diffusion
cells set up with platinum plates and nitric acid of different degrees of
concentration. With certain strengths an E.M.F. is set up superior to
that calculable from the heat of intermixture of the two acid fluids; so
that when a current flows through a large external resistance, part of the
work done is performed at the expense of sensible heat; whilst the passage
of the current reduces the concentrated acid to lower oxides of nitrogen
(precisely as in a Grove's cell), thereby absorbing additional heat.

6 Messrs. Wright and Thompson on the Determination of
surround the plate, and probably also with the temperature".
In some few cases the constant is of positive sign for some
solution-strengths or kinds of salts, and negative for others :
in these cases the numerical value of the thermovoltaic con
stant is never great, not exceeding a few centivolts at most.
If, on the   ...i.           a metal possess a thermovoltaic constant
of considerable magnitude for one class of salts, the sign is the
same for all classes of salts examined. So that practically
metals may be divided into three classes, viz.:-those where the
thermovoltaic constant has uniformly a more or less consider
able negative value, e.g. lead and silver; those where the
value is sometimes positive and sometimes negative but never
large, e. g. copper and cadmium ; and those where the value
is considerable and always positive, e. g. iron, mercury, mag
nesium, and aluminium.
    In order to have a standard for reduction, it is convenient
to make the same convention as that above referred to for
voltaic constants, viz. that the thermovoltaic constant for
amalgamated zinc is taken as zero when immersed in a solution
of a zinc-salt corresponding in nature and molecular strength
with the solution of the salt surrounding the other plate.
    As regards the actual numerical values assigned below to
the voltaic and thermovoltaic constants, it has been thought
best to adhere to the same fundamental assumptions as have
been hitherto made throughout this series of papers, viz.:-that
the B.A. unit of resistance is actually one earth-quadrant per
second; that the factor for converting gramme-degrees into
volts is 4410; and that the E.M.F. of Clark’s cell at 15°-5 is
 1.457 volt, that of a Daniell cell set up with amalgamated
 zinc and electro-copper plates and solutions of zinc and copper
 sulphates of equal molecular strength being 765 x 1.457
  +.0005, or 1-114+.0005 volt. The present state of our
 knowledge would introduce corrections in all three of these
 values; but these corrections would so far balance one another
 that the most probable end result is that all the numerical
 values given are about 1:6 to 2.2 per cent. too high. Tirst,
   * S. Czapski has recently, found (Annalen der Physik, xxi. p. 209)
 that zinc-silver-chloride and cadmium-silver-chloride cells diminish in
 E.M.F. as the temperature rises; whilst iron-mercurous-chloride, cad
 mium-mercurous-chloride, and zinc-mercurous-bromide cells rise in E.M.F.
 with increasing temperature. In the former class of cell the E.M.F.
 actually set up is less, and in the latter greater, than that correspondin
 with the heat-evolution due to the net chemical change. But it º;
 seem that if there be any general law connecting the variations in E.M.F.
 with temperature, it is less simple than might appear from these particular
 results; for Clark's cells (zinc-mercurous-sulphate) obviously belong to
 the same class as zinc-mercurous-bromide and            cadmium-mercurous
 chloride cells; and yet the E.M.F. of a Clark's cell falls instead of rising
 as the temperature rises (§§ 139 and 179).

the true value of the B.A. unit is about 1.3 per cent. lower
than that thus assumed; next, Lord Rayleigh's recent valua
tions of the E.M.F. of Clark’s cell indicate 1:434 instead of
1.457, or 1.6 per cent. lower (this correction including the
previous one). Still smaller values, 1427 to 1:433 volt, or
from 1-7 to 2.1 per cent. lower than Clark’s value, have
recently been obtained by Von Ettingshausen (Zeitsch. für
Electrotechnik, 1884, Heft xvi.); whilst, lastly, the value of
JF, the factor for converting heat units into volts, as deduced
from the most recent experiments of Mascart, Kohlrausch,
and Lord Rayleigh, is nearly as much below 4410; these three
observers finding for the C.G.S. electrochemical equivalent of
 silver respectively the values 01124, '011183, and between
 ‘01118 and 0.1119, from which a mean value of close to 0112
                          •0112                             -
results ; so that F= 107-93 T 0001038; whence, taking
 J-41'55 x 10", it follows that JF=4313, or 2.2 per cent.
 below 4410. So that, on the whole, both E and EH are uni
 formly overvalued below by amounts probably amounting to
 between 1:6 and 2.2 per cent. ; whence their differences will
 evidently be overvalued to sensibly the same extent. The
 errors thus introduced into the values assigned to the various
 thermovoltaic constants calculated are in no case of such
 magnitude as to interfere with the general character of the
 inferences drawn from the numbers thus deduced.
    167. A number of cells have been examined, in which a
 sparingly soluble electrolyte was employed in the form of the
 solid salt suspended in a solution of some other salt (usually
 the one surrounding the other plate), e.g. zinc-silver-chloride
 cells, where the silver plate was surrounded by a magma of
 silver chloride suspended in zinc-chloride solution; or cad
 mium-lead-sulphate cells, where lead sulphate suspended in
 cadmium-sulphate solution surrounded the lead plate. Some
 noteworthy peculiarities have been observed with such cells
 as regards the fluctuations in the values of a and b in the
 formula E=e-Ha—b with variations in solution-strength.
 Thus, with zinc-lead-sulphate cells (set up with a magma of
 lead-sulphate and zinc-sulphate solution round the lead plate)
 the effect of variation in the strength of the zinc-sulphate
 solution surrounding the lead plate is not the same, either in
magnitude or sign, as the effect of the same variation in the
 strength of the zinc-sulphate solution surrounding the zinc
plate. . In the latter case (as already shown, Part VIII.) the
effect is of this kind, that as the solution-strength increases
the numerical value of b continually increases, its sign being
always the same, viz. positive; but in the former case this is
not so, the numerical value of a increasing with the strength

        168. It is evident that cells of the type now under discus
    sion, where the electrolyte surrounding the plate acquiring

 10 Messrs. Wright and Thompson on the Determination of
the higher potential is of a mixed character (i.e. containing
two salts), are to a certain extent comparable with Daniell
cells in which the copper plate is surrounded by a mixed
solution of zinc and copper sulphates, the only essential dif
 ference being in the greater solubility of copper sulphate as
compared with lead sulphate, &c. It seemed of interest,
therefore, to examine in detail the influence on the numerical
 value of the E.M.F. of a Daniell cell exerted by addition of
 zinc sulphate to the copper-sulphate solution used. Accord
 ingly a number of cells were set up containing mixed sulphate
 solutions of strengths mCuSO4, n/nSO, 100 H.O, the values
 of m and n varying in the different cases, but all else being
 the same. The following remarkable results were thus
obtained, electro-copper plates being used throughout :—
    1. With solutions such that m constantly =1.77, the value
 of a with continually increasing values of n is never nega
tive, being sensibly =0 as long as n does not exceed '5, and
being +, and continually increasing in numerical value as n
increases above ‘5.
   2. With solutions such that m does not exceed '5, the value
of a is always negative, increasing in numerical value as n
increases.
   3. With solutions such that m= from 1-0 to 1:42, the value
of a is at first negative, increasing to a negative maximum as
n increases, then diminishing to zero, and finally becoming
positive, and continuously increasing in numerical value.

  12 Messrs. Wright and Thompson on the Determination of
     Hence it appears that cells containing very sparingly so
  luble compounds like lead sulphate, silver chloride, &c., sus
 }. in solutions of more soluble salts, are comparable with
    aniell cells in which the copper plates are surrounded with
 solutions containing only small quantities of copper sulphate,
 together with varying quantities of zinc sulphate, increasing
 the strength of the solution of the more soluble salt, in the
 first case producing the same general effect on the E.M.F. of
 the cell as addition of more zinc sulphate to the copper
 sulphate solution in the second.
     169. A probable explanation of these results is the fol
 lowing:—The passage of a current, however feeble, decom
 poses both electrolytes in the mixed fluid simultaneously;
 so that, for example, in the Daniell cell containing mixed
 zinc- and copper-sulphate solution round the copper plate,
 both zinc and copper would be thrown down simultaneously
 in the metallic state, were it not that whilst still nascent the
 zinc acts on the copper-sulphate solution by a secondary
 action, precipitating the equivalent amount of copper, and
 becoming itself zinc-sulphate solution. A portion of the
 energy gained by this secondary action is nonadjuvant, the
 amount of nonadjuvant energy depending, inter alia, on the
 number of molecules of zinc sulphate thus reproduced relatively
 to that of copper sulphate in solution, in such a fashion that the
 stronger the copper-sulphate solution, casteris paribus, the less is
 the amount of nonadjuvant energy. Hence, from this cause the
 E.M.F. of a Daniell cell would be necessarily diminished by
 addition of zinc sulphate to the copper-sulphate solution. But
this addition produces also an effect of another kind ; for
addition of zinc sulphate to the fluid surrounding the plate
acquiring the higher potential, making that fluid stronger so
far as zinc sulphate is concerned, must set up an interdiffusion
effect which will be superposed upon the other sources of
difference of potential, tending to raise the potential of the
plate immersed in the fluid thus strengthened relatively to
that of the other plate. Hence there are two causes, acting in
opposite directions, thus brought into play, tending to affect
the potential-difference set up between the two plates of the
cell; if the one predominate, the E.M.F. of the cell as a
whole is lowered ; if the other predominate, the E.M.F. is
raised. With weak solutions of copper sulphate the former
tendency is always greater than the latter, and the E.M.F.
falls continuously as zinc sulphate is added to the copper
sulphate solution, as indicated in curves nos. 5 and 6, fig. 2.
With strong solutions of copper sulphate the latter tendency is

       Chemical Affinity in terms of Electromotive Force.      13
always greater than the former, so that in this case the E.M.F.
continuously increases in value as zinc sulphate is added to
the copper sulphate, as indicated in curve no. 1. . With in
termediate strengths of copper-sulphate solution, the former
tendency at first predominates over the latter one, the
E.M.F. of the cell falling as more zinc sulphate is inter
mixed with the copper sulphate ; but by and by the second
tendency becomes stronger relatively to the first, and finally
overpowers it, thus causing the E.M.F. of the cell first to cease
diminishing, and then to rise continuously until it reaches and
even surpasses the first value.
   Mutatis mutandis, evidently the same kind of explanation
applies in the case of cells where the mixed electrolyte is a
magma of a sparingly soluble salt suspended in a solution of a
more soluble one.
    It should hence evidently result that the effect of “polari
zation ” on cells set up with such magmas (i. e. the depre
ciation in E.M.F. observed with increasing current-density)
should be much more marked than with cells containing only
readily soluble salts in moderately concentrated solution; since
the film of fluid surrounding the plate on which metal is
deposited must, with such a magma, become very rapidly de
preciated, as regards the amount in solution of the sparingly
soluble salt, on account of the decomposition of that salt
caused by the passage of the current. This is, in fact, the case,
depreciation of some tenths of a millivolt being readily ob
 servable even with currents of density too small to produce
any measurable effect on such diffusion-cells as those described
in Part VIII.      In order to avoid errors from this cause ex
ceeding 0.5 millivolt in magnitude, it was found indispensable
 to work with currents of    àensity not  exceeding from 01 to
 :02 microampere per square centimetre when cells containing
 such magmas were employed ; so that with        ".     exposing
 some 3 or 4 square centimetres of surface, and cells of near to
 1 volt in E.M.F., a total resistance of at least a megohm, and
 usually of several megohms, was employed ; and proportion
 ately in other cases.             -
    It should further result, if the above explanation be correct,
 that if two cells be compared, alike in all respects save that
 in one the copper plate is surrounded by a mixed solution
 m CuSO, n ZnSO, 100 H.O, and in the other by a solution
 of copper sulphate only, of equal strength, viz. (m+n)CuSO,
 100 H20, the difference between the E.M.F.'s of the two for
 a given value of the   ratio . will   not be constant, but will

 14 Messrs. Wright and Thompson on the Determination of
 increase as the value of m diminishes, i.e. as the mixed solution
 is weaker so far as the copper sulphate contained is concerned.
 This is in fact the case, as shown by the following Table,
 representing the E.M.F.'s of such pairs of cells uniformly
 containing amalgamated-zinc and electro-copper plates, the
 former immersed in m ZnSO, 100 H.O.; the E.M.F.'s of the
 cells containing m CuSO, n ZnSö, 100 H2O are derived
 from the preceding tables, and those of the cells containing
(m+n)CuSO, 100 H.O are calculated by means of the for
mula E=1114--a, in which 1114 is the constant E.M.F.
in millivolts of an ordinary Daniell cell containing m MSO,
100 H,0, where m is constant for both zinc- and copper-sul
phate solutions (§ 170, footnote), whilst a is derived from the
table given in Part VIII. § 154.

    170. In all the cells examined, wherever possible, the plates
used were coated over by an electro-deposited coat of metal,
thrown down by a moderately weak current from a .
 solution of a pure salt of the metal. The plates employe
 usually exposed a total surface of 3 or 4 square centimetres,
 and   i. electro-coating was effected     by passing the current
 from three to five Leelanché quart-cells in series through a
 decomposing cell, in which the plate to be coated formed the
 negative electrode, the positive one being a plate of the same
 metal in as great a state of purity as practicable ; the elec
 tºodes were usually some 3 or 4 centimetres apart. Under
  these circumstances the coating of metal formed was fairly
  tough, and coherent, although in certain cases somewhat
  crystalline on the surface. Copper thus deposited from a
  strong solution of copper sulphate formed a coating of great
   regularity and toughness. }. some cases, however, bright
   Plates of fused metal were necessarily employed, e.g. with
   iron and aluminium. With zinc the plates always consisted

16 Messrs. Wright and Thompson on the Determination of
 of pure metal superficially amalgamated with pure mercury.
 The cells employed were uniformly constructed of two small
beakers or porcelain vessels containing respectively the metals
 and fluids employed, and united by a siphon-tube, consisting
 of an inverted     §. the lower ends of which were covered
 over with thin animal membrane secured by a silk thread, and
 rendered watertight, when requisite, at the junction of the
 glass and membrane by the application of a little melted gutta
 percha, so that no leakage into or from the siphon took place,
 saving by osmosis through the membrane. In all cases the
 temperature varied from 18° C. by only + a few degrees.
 Saving in the case of certain experiments quoted from pre
 vious portions of these researches, and a few others made for
 special reasons with the quadrant-electrometer, all the obser
vations were made by means of the galvanometer, currents
being used of such small density as to produce no sensible
 depreciation in the E.M.F.; in most cases an external resist
ance of a megohm (and in many of much more) being
employed, the valuation being obtained by comparing the
readings of the cell to be examined with those of an Alder

construction, with amalgamated-pure-zinc and electro-copper plates im
mersed in pure solutions of their respective sulphates of the same molecular
strength, preferably of strength ..º. 100 H.0, where m is near to
2.0, i. e. with copper-sulphate solution nearly but not absolutely saturated,
so as not to deposit crystals by chilling or slight evaporation. The ratio
of the E.M.F. of such a cell to that of a Clark's cell at 15°-5 has been

unique peculiarity, that the value of its voltaic constant in
sulphate solution, as above defined, is practically uniform for
all solution-strengths; for, as already shown, the E.M.F. of a
zinc-copper-sulphate cell is sensibly the same whatever the
solution-strength when amalgamated-zinc and electro-copper
plates are used, viz. (on the assumptions above discussed,
§ 166) 1:114+.0005 volt; so that the voltaic constant for
electro-copper in sulphate solution is sensibly +1.114 for all
solution-strengths (i. e. when referred to amalgamated zinc
in zinc-sulphate solution of the same strength as zero).
   The thermovoltaic constant of electro-copper also shows the
same independence; for the experiments described in § 160
show that the heats of dilution of zinc- and copper-sulphate
solutions are sensibly identical for equal dilution-ranges; hence
the heats of formation of zinc- and copper-sulphate solutions

    Hence, finally, since E=1:114 and Em–1-105 for all solu
 tion-strengths, the thermovoltaic constant for electro-copper
 in sulphate solution is constantly 1:114–1'105= +009 for
 all solution-strengths.

    172. The experiments with the quadrant-electrometer
 described in Part VI, show that the electromotive forces of all
 zinc–cadmium-sulphate cells set up with solutions of zinc and
 cadmium sulphate of the same strength, m MSO, 100H2O, are
 comprised within the limits '360+-0015, when m is between
 '08 and 2-0, and that those of the analogous copper-cadmium
 sulphate cells are similarly comprised within the limits
 '7525 + .0015.
    The experiments described in Part VIII., however, enable
 still more exact figures to be deduced. Applying the formula
  E=e-Ha-b, and taking the values of a and b from the tables
  *. the following figures result as the most probable ones,
  the probable error in no case being so great as +:002 volt:

   Unlike that of copper therefore, the voltaic constant for
electro-cadmium immersed in m CdSO, 100H2O, referred to
amalgamated zinc in zinc-sulphate solution of the same
strength as zero, varies with the value of m, decreasing as m
2ncreases.
   From these values the corresponding thermovoltaic con
stants are thus calculable. According to Julius Thomsen the
heats of formation of zinc and cadmium sulphates in solution
of strength 25 MSO, 100H2O differ by 16210 –
                         Zn, O, SO, aq. = 106000

solutions are not equal in the two cases: calling them respec

    173. The experiments already described in Part VI. show
 that the E.M.F.'s of zinc-silver-sulphate cells and the corre
 sponding cadmium- and copper-silver cells are respectively
 1536, 1:1805, and 4235, when amalgamated-zinc and electro
 silver, -copper, and -cadmium plates are used with solutions
 of -042. MSO, 100 H,0 throughout.                        The probable error
 attaching to these values was in each case between + 001 and
 +-0015.      Hence, referred to amalgamated zinc in zinc
 sulphate solution of this strength as zero, the following values
 result for the voltaic constant of electro-silver in Saturated
 silver-sulphate solution :
 From Zinc-Silver cells . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.536
 From Cadmium-Silver-HZinc-Cadmium cells 1-1805-- 362=1'5425
 From Copper-Silver + Zinc-Copper cells... 1-114 +4235=1:5375
                                                              Mean. . . . . . 1:539
    These three valuations do not accord so well as those obtained
  in most of the experiments subsequently detailed and made
  by means of the galvanometer ; the chief causes of the dis
  crepancies lie in the greater want of permanence and wider
  range of fluctuation noticed with these cells (vide §§ 125–128,
  Part VI.), probably due to the extremely weak solutions
  necessarily employed owing to the sparing degree of solu
  bility of silver sulphate.
     Taking the mean value 1:539 volt as the voltaic constant
  for electro-silver in saturated silver-sulphate solution, it
  results that the corresponding thermovoltaic constant has a
  large negative value; for Julius Thomsen finds that Age, O,

   174. A number of cells were examined set up with well
washed recently precipitated lead sulphate (prepared from
clear lead-acetate solution and pure sulphuric acid in excess,
boiled up many times with distilled water, and washed by
decantation), suspended in zinc- or cadmium-sulphate solutions
of varying strength. Electro-coated lead plates immersed in
these magmas were opposed to amalgamated-zinc plates
immersed in zinc-sulphate solution with i. following results,
to which are also joined the figures obtained with similar cells,
in which electro-copper and electro-cadmium plates immersed
in solutions of their sulphates respectively were opposed to
the lead plates. The probable error of each value is in almost
every instance        ºilº             below + 001 volt, and in no
case exceeds + 002 volt. The values refer to cells containing
on both sides solutions of the same molecular strength

   Hence electro-lead in , connexion with its sulphate is
analogous to silver, the thermovoltaic constant possessing a
considerable negative value ; so that zinc-lead-sulphate and
cadmium-lead-sulphate cells have E.M.F.'s notably below the
values     'º. with the net chemical actions taking
place therein. On the other hand, since the thermovoltaic
constant for copper is a small positive value (+:009 for all
solution-strengths), and that for lead is in all cases a con
siderably larger negative value, whilst copper is the metal
acquiring the higher potential in a lead-copper-sulphate cell,
it follows that the value of ki—k, in such a cell is always a
considerable + quantity, varying from +:009–(–162) to
 +009–(–221); that is from +171 to +230, according
as the lead sulphate is suspended in zinc- or cadmium-sulphate
solution, and according as the molecular strength of the
solutions is low or      ;       In other words, a lead-copper-sul
phate cell gives an effective maximum E.M.F. of from 171
to 230 volt above that corresponding with the net chemical
action taking place therein. This chemical action represents
a heat-evolution of 73800–55960=17840 gramme-degrees.
per gramme-molecule, corresponding with 393 volt only. The
actually observed values consequently correspond to an incre
ment of about 50 per cent. in the E.M.F. of the cell above
that due to chemical action.
   On the other hand, since the thermovoltaic constant for
silver in contact with saturated silver-sulphate solution is a
negative quantity numerically greater than that for lead,
whilst in lead-silver-sulphate cells silver is the metal acquiring
the higher   #."         the value of ki—k, in such cells must be
negative.        us a cell set up with electro-silver immersed in
saturated silver-sulphate solution opposed to electro-lead
immersed in a magma of lead sulphate suspended in '042
ZnSO, 100 H.O, must yield a value for k –k, close to
—351–(-176)= –175 ; that is, the E.M.F. of such a

         Chemical Affinity in terms of Electromotive Force.                  23
cell must be close to 1-1775–175                =   1.0025   volt,  since   the
heat of displacement of silver from silver-sulphate solution by
lead forming solid lead sulphate is 73800–20390=53410
gramme-degrees per gramme-molecule, equivalent to 1-1775
volt. On trying the experiment, the following values were
observed with a number of similar cells :—
                    Maximum cell-value=1:008 volt.

     175. A number of cells were examined set up with electro
  copper plates immersed in copper-sulphate solution, opposed
  to plates of brightened sheet iron of as high a degree of purity
  as could be obtained, immersed in freshly prepared ferrous
  sulphate solution; and, similarly, numerous observations were
  made with analogous cells containing electro-cadmium plates
  immersed in cadmium-sulphate solution, amalgamated-zinc
  plates immersed in zinc-sulphate solution, or electro-lead plates
  immersed in a magma of lead sulphate suspended in zinc-sulphate
  solution. The following average values were obtained: with
   solutions of molecular strength throughout 1 MSO, 100 H.0,
   the cells exhibited far greater want of permanence and much
   wider fluctuations in E.M.F. than were noticed with cells of
   strength 1:0 MSO, 100 H,0; so that, whilst the probable
   error in the former class of cells ranged from +:003 to +:005,
   that in the latter class was only from +001 to +002. The
   negative sign attached to the values for the iron-cadmium
   cells indicates that iron was the metal acquiring the higher

    It results from these figures that the thermovoltaic constant
for polished iron in ferrous-sulphate solutions must always
have a notable positive value. Admitting, what is doubtless
the case, that the heats of dilution of ferrous- and zinc-sulphate
solutions from the molecular strengths 1.0 MSO, 100 H2O to
0.25 MSO, 100 H.O are not widely different, so that their
difference is negligible, the heat of displacement of iron from
 1:0 FeSO, 100 H,0 by zinc is 106090–93200=12890
gramme-degrees per gramme-molecule, corresponding with
284 volt. Since iron acquires the higher potential in zinc
iron-sulphate cells, the value of ki—k, must be positive and
 = 398 – 284 = + 114 ; whence the thermovoltaic constant
for iron must be + 114 for 10 FeSO, 100 H.O; and must con
sequently have higher values still for weaker solutions, approxi
mating to 432–284= + 148 volt for 0.1 FeSO, 100 H.O.
   Hence iron is an ea'ample of a class of metals opposite in
thermovoltaic power to silver and lead, and differing from
copper and cadmium in that, whilst with the last two metals
the thermovoltaic constant has never a value largely above or
below zero, with silver and lead it has considerable negative
values, and with iron it has a notable positive value.
   One result of this is that a zinc-iron-sulphate cell is analo
  ous to a copper-lead-sulphate cell, in that it affords a consi
i.           higher effective E.M.F. than corresponds with the net
chemical action, viz. from 398 to 432 instead of 284.
   Another result is that, since the thermovoltaic constants
for cadmium and iron (in solutions 10 MSO, 100 H.O) are
respectively +001 and + 114, if iron were to displace cad
mium from solution of this strength, there would be evolved
93.200–(89.880–75)=3395 gramme-degrees per gramme
molecule (75 being the heat of dilution from 1-0 ClSO,
100 H.O to 25 CdSO, 100 H,0), corresponding with a value

        Chemical Affinity in terms of Electromotive Force.         25
for Eir of .075 volt, cadmium acquiring the higher potential ;
but upon this chemical source of potential-difference there is
superposed the thermovoltaic action
                   ki—k, = +001—"114= —'113;
hence the net effective E.M.F. is
                        + 075 – 113 = —-038 :
 that is, instead of cadmium acquiring the higher potential, iron
 does so, and a current flows with an E.M.F. of —-038 volt
 (mean observed value = –035 volt).
     As regards iron-lead-sulphate cells, it is to be remarked that,
 since lead acquires the higher potential and since the thermo
 voltaic constant of lead is a considerable negative quantity
 whilst that of iron is also a considerable positive quantity, the
  value of ki—k, is largely negative, viz. for solutions of strengths
  1:0 MSO, 100 H.O (zinc-sulphate solution being used to
  suspend lead sulphate in), –200–114= – 314. That is to
  say, whilst the value of EII corresponding to this displacement
  of lead from lead sulphate (solid) by iron is 428 volt (corre
  sponding with 93.200–73800–19400 gramme-degrees per
  gramme-molecule), the effective E.M.F. of the cell is little
  more than one fourth of this, viz. 428–314='114 (mean
  observed value = 112 volt).
      The same kind of remark applies to iron-copper-sulphate
   cells in a less degree, the value of ki—k, being here (for 1:0
   MS0, 100 H,0) +:009–114= —-105; that is, whilst the
   Yalue of Eir is 821 (corresponding with 93200–55960=
   §1240 gramme-degrees per gramme-molecule), the effective
   E.M.F. of the cell is only '821–105=1716 (mean observed
   value = 715 volt).
      It should consequently result that, if a cell be set up with
   an electro-silver plate immersed in saturated silver-sulphate
   solution opposed to bright iron in an equally strong ferrous
   sulphate solution, viz. 042 FeSO, 100 H.O., º value of ki—k,
   will be largely negative, approximating to — 351–148=
   - 499; so that as Em is, in this case, 1-605 (corresponding
   With 93.200–20390=72810 gramme-degrees per gramme
  lº,           the effective E.M.F. will be near to 1-605 — 499 =
  *106 volt. In point of fact, a number of such cells gave on
  “xamination the average value 1'103 with a probable error of
   it'003 volt.

      176. Some experiments were carried out precisely as de
   *cribed in §§ 115, 124, and 131, with cells set up with polished

26 Messrs. Wright and Thompson on the Determination of
iron plates immersed in a strong solution of ferrous sulphate
opposed to electro-copper plates in copper-sulphate solution.
The values obtained show that, whilst with zinc-copper, zinc
cadmium, cadmium-copper, zinc-silver, and copper-silver cells
halving the area of the plate on which metal is deposited usually
causes a greater decrease in the E.M.F. for a given rate of
current-flow than is caused by halving the area of the other
plate, the reverse is the case with iron-copper cells. Thus,
for example, in one experiment the following numbers were
obtained, and similarly in other cases:—

   It is noticeable that the substitution of dilute sulphuric acid
for ferrous-sulphate solution in an iron-copper cell uniformly
tends to lower the E.M.F., also rendering the cell-values less
permanent and subject to wider ranges of fluctuation than
before, probably on account of the “local action ” of the acid
on the iron ; a similar result is also brought about by the
substitution of dilute hydrochloric acid for ferrous-chloride
solution in cells containing iron and other metals with chloride
solutions.

 aluminium plates opposed to amalgamated zinc and electro
 Copper respectively, immersed in sulphate solutions of strength
 ‘5 MS0, 100 H2O (instead of using aluminium sulphate, pure
 potash alum was employed, the potassium sulphate present

 28 Messrs. Wright and Thompson on the Determination of
 therein being left out of consideration in valuing the molecular
 strength). From the heat of formation of aluminium-sulphate
 solution being greater than that of zinc-sulphate, it might
 naturally be expected that zinc would acquire the                                              i;
 potential, as with magnesium-zinc cells; but this was not the
 case, aluminium-zinc-sulphate cells resembling cadmium-iron
 sulphate cells (§ 175) in that the current actually generated
 flows in the direction opposite to that predicable from the heats
 of formation of the electrolytes : for this reason the cell-values
are marked with the – sign. The following figures represent
 the mean readings during the first half hour after setting up:
 with aluminium-zinc cells the readings slightly diminished in
numerical value as time elapsed, and vice versä with the copper
aluminium cells :—

    From these figures the following valuations of the voltaic
constant result; this constant is of + sign, since aluminium
acquires the higher, and zinc the lower potential:—

   Julius Thomsen finds that Alg, O, SOs aq. = 150630; whence
EH = –1982 volt. This value is probably not strictly appli
cable in the case of the cells now under discussion (which
contained potash alum and not aluminium sulphate); but the
error introduced by taking this value is but small as compared
with the thermovoltaic constant deduced, viz.
                      ‘537–(–'982)= +1.519.
              VIII. Mercurous-Zinc-sulphate Cells.
   179. A number of cells were examined consisting of amal
gamated-zinc plates immersed in zinc-sulphate solution on the

       Chemical Affinity in terms of Electromotive Force.             29
One side, and of pure mercury with a magma of mercurous
sulphate and zinc-sulphate solution on the other, the zinc
sulphate being of the same strength on each side : with these
cells the j continually fell as the solution-strength rose".
It is evident that these cells differ but little from a cold
  .          Clark's cell, the essential difference being that in the
 atter the zinc rod is not coated with fluid mercury to begin
with, and is immersed, not in pure zinc-sulphate solution, i.
in the same magma of mercurous-sulphate and zinc-sulphate
solution as surrounds the mercury. |. difference in con
struction gives rise to a slight difference in E.M.F. with
weaker solutions of zinc sulphate, the Clark's cell uniformly
 reading lowest; with saturated or very strong solutions the
 difference between the two kinds of cell is less than the expe
 rimental errors. Thus the following average values were
 obtained as the voltaic constants of mercury in contact with mer
curous sulphate and m ZnSO, 100 H2O, and as the E.M.F.'s
of cells like Clark's but set up with m ZnSO, 100 H.O instead
 of saturated zinc-sulphate solution:—

    The heat of formation of mercurous sulphate being unknown,
 the corresponding thermovoltaic constants cannot be exactly
 calculated; in all probability, however, the value of EH is near
 to 1202 volt, the value for mercurous-zinc-nitrate cells, when

                  II. On Arctic Interglacial Periods.
                 By JAMES CROLL, LL.D., F.R.S."
 Polº Interglacial Periods more marked than the Glacial.
        —In a former paper f, and also in “Climate and Time’
 (chap. xvi.), it was pointed out that in temperate regions the
cold periods of the glacial epoch would be far more marked
than the warm interglacial periods. In temperate regions
the condition of things which prevailed during the cold
periods would differ far more widely from that which now
prevails than would the condition of things during the warm
periods. But as regards the polar regions the reverse would
 be the case ; there the warm interglacial periods would be
more marked than the cold periods. The condition of things
prevailing in these regions during the warm periods would be
in strongest contrast to what now obtains; but this would
not hold true in reference to the cold periods, during which
matters would be pretty much the same as at present, only
 somewhat more severe. In short, the glacial state is the
normal condition of the polar regions, the interglacial the
abnormal. At present dj and other parts of the
 Arctic regions are almost wholly covered with snow and ice,
 and, consequently, nearly destitute of vegetable life. In
fact, as regards organic life in those regions, matters during
the glacial epoch would not probably be much worse than they
are at the present day. Greenland and the Antarctic con
tinent are to-day almost as destitute of plant-life as they could
possibly be. Although, in opposition to what is found to be
true in reference to the temperate regions, the polar inter
   lacial periods were more marked than the glacial, it does
not follow that on this account the relics of the interglacial
periods which remain ought to be more abundant in polar
than in temperate regions.          On the contrary, the reverse
ought to be the case. In the polar regions, undoubtedly,
there is least likelihood of finding traces of interglacial
periods; for there, of all other places, the destruction of such
traces would be most complete. The more severe the glacia
tion following a warm period, the more complete would be
the removal of the remains belonging to the period. If in
such places as Scotland and Scandinavia so little is left of
the wreck of interglacial periods, it need be a matter of no
surprise that in Arctic regions scarcely a relic of those periods
remains.     The comparative absence in polar regions of

organic remains belonging to a mild interglacial period
cannot therefore be .# as evidence against the probable
existence of such a period. Who would expect to find such
remains in ice-covered regions like Greenland and Spitzber
  en? Although not a trace is now to be found, it is never
theless quite possible that during interglacial periods those
regions may have enjoyed a comparatively mild and equable
climate.
    Evidence from the Mammoth in Siberia.-This comparative
 absence of the remains of a warmer condition of climate in
 Arctic regions during Pleistocene times holds true, however,
 only in regard to those parts, like Greenland, which have
 undergone severe glaciation. When we examine Siberia
 and other places which appear to have escaped the destructive
 power of the ice, we find, from a class of facts the physical
  importance of which appears to have been greatly overlooked,
  abundant proofs of a mild and equable condition of climate.
  I refer to facts connected with the climatic condition under
  which the Siberian Mammoth and his congeners lived. The
  simple fact that the Mammoth lived in Northern Siberia
  proves that at the time the climate of that region must have
   been far different from what it is at the present day.
      The opinion was long held, and is still held by some, that
   the Mammoth did not live in Northern Siberia, where his
   remains are found, but in more southern latitudes, and that
   these remains were carried down by rivers. It was considered
   incredible that an animal allied to the Elephant, which
   now lives only in tropical regions, should have existed under
    a climate so rigorous as that of Siberia. The opinion that
    the remains were floated down the Siberian rivers is now,
    however, abandoned by Russian naturalists and other observers
    who have carefully examined the country.
       I shall here give a brief statement of the facts and argu
    ments which have been adduced in support of the theory that
    the Mammoth lived and died where its remains were found.
    For these facts I am mainly indebted to the admirable papers
    by Mr. Howorth on the “Mammoth in Siberia,” which
    appeared in the Geological Magazine’ for 1880.
       Had the remains of the Mammoth been carried down from
    the far south by the Siberian rivers, they would have been
    found mainly, if not exclusively, on the banks of the long
    rivers, such as the Obi, Yenissei, and the Lena, and in the
    deltas   formed at their mouths.     But such is not the case.
    “These are,” says Mr. Howorth, “found even more abun
    dantly on the banks of the very short rivers east of the Lena.
     They are found not only on the deltas of these rivers, but far

32                     Dr. J. Croll on Arctic
away to the north, in the islands of New Siberia, beyond the
reach of the currents of the small rivers, whose mouths are
opposite those islands.” But a more convincing proof is that
“ they are found not only in North Central Siberia, where
the main arteries of the country flow, but in great numbers
east of the river Lena, in the vast peninsula of the Chukchi,
in the country of the Yukagirs, and in Kamtskatka, where
there are no rivers down which they could have floated from
more temperate regions.”. Besides, it is not merely in the
deltas and banks of rivers that the remains are found, but in
nearly all parts of the open tundra; and Wrangell says" that
the best as well as the greatest number of remains are found
at a certain depth below the surface in clay-hills, and more in
those of some elevation than along the low coast or in the flat
tundra.
    Had the Mammoth lived in the south we should, as Mr.
 Howorth further remarks, have found its remains most
abundant in the south, whereas the further north we go the
 remains become more abundant, and in the islands of the
 Liachof archipelago, in about latitude 74°, the greatest
 quantities have been discovered. Again, according to Heden
 strom, the bones and tusks found in the north are not so large
 and heavy as those in the south; a fact which still further
 confirms the opinion that the Mammoth lived where his
 remains are found, inasmuch as the greater severity of the
climate in northern parts would certainly hinder the growth
 and full development of the animal.
   Northern Siberia much Warmer during the Mammoth
 Epoch than now.—It is true that the Mammoth and the
Rhinoceros tíchorhinus were furnished with a woolly covering
which would protect them from cold; but it is nevertheless
highly improbable that they could have endured a climate so
severe as that of Northern Siberia at the present day, where
the ground is covered with snow for nine months in the year
and the temperature is seldom much above zero Fahr. And
even if they could have endured the cold, they would have
starved for want of food. Some parts of Siberia are no doubt
fertile, as, for example, the valley of the Yenisei, described
by Nordenskjöldf; but there is little doubt, as Mr. Howorth
remarks, that the larger portion of Northern Siberia, where
the Mammoth and the Rhinoceros lived, is now a naked
tundra covered with moss, on which no tree will grow. On
such ground it is physically impossible that the Mammoth
and Rhinoceros could exist, for they cannot graze close to

the ground like oxen. They live on long grass and on the
foliage and small branches of trees.
   Evidence from Wood.—The fact that the Mammoth was
most abundant beyond the present northern limit of wood is
§       good evidence that the climatic condition of Northern
  iberia must have been milder than now.         Wood must have
extended, in the days of the Mammoth, far beyond its present
limit, probably as far north as New Siberia: facts of obser
vation support this conclusion.
   The   wood   found in Northern Siberia consists of two
classes—the one is the result of drift, the other grew on the
spot. The natives call the former “Noashina,” and the latter
“Adamshina;” and the division is supported by Göppert,
“who separates the trunks of timber found in Northern
Siberia into a northern series, with narrow rings of annual
#." and a southern, with wider ones.          The latter doubtless
 oated down the rivers, as great quantities do still ; while
the former probably grew here with the Mammoth.”
   In the middle of October 1810 Hedenstrom went across
the tundra direct to Ustiansk. “On this occasion,” he says,
“I observed a remarkable natural phenomenon on the Chas
tach Lake. This lake is 14 versts long and 6 broad, and
every autumn throws up a quantity of bituminous fragments
of wood, with which its shores in many places are covered to
the depth of more than 2 feet. Among these are pieces of
a hard transparent resinous substance, burning like amber,
though without its agreeable perfume. It is probably the
hardened resin of the larch tree. The Chastach Lake is
situated 115 versts from the sea and 80 versts from the
nearest forest.” "
   On the same journey Hedenstrom noticed “on the tundra,
equally remote from . present line of forest, among the steep
sandy banks of the lakes and rivers, large birch trees, com
plete, with bark, branches, and root. At the first glance they
appeared to have been well preserved by the earth; but, on
digging them up, they are found to be in a thorough state
of decay. On being lighted they glow, but never emit a
flame : nevertheless the inhabitants of the neighbourhood
use them as fuel, and designate these subterranean trees as
Adamoushtshina, or of Adam’s time. The first living birch
tree is not found nearer than three degrees to the south, and
then only in the form of a shrub.” f

ever, the icy wilderness produces nothing that could afford
them nourishment, nor would they be able to endure the
climate.      Sannikow concludes that a milder climate must
formerly have prevailed here, and that these animals may
therefore have been contemporary with the Mammoth, whose
remains are found in every part of the island.” *
    “Herr von Ruprecht reported to Brandt that, at the mouth
of the Indiga, in 67° 39' N. lat., on a small peninsula called
 Chernoi Noss, where at present only very small birch bushes
   row, he found rotten birch trunks still standing upright, of
the thickness of a man’s leg and the height of a man. In
going up the river he met with no traces of wood until he
reached the port of Indiga. Here he noticed the first light
fir woods growing among still standing but dead trunks. And
higher up the river still, the living woods fairly began.”f
   j. says that, “where the lakes on the tundra have
grown small and shallow, we find on and near their banks a
layer of turf, under which, in many places, are remains of trees
in good condition, which support the other proofs that the northern
limit of trees has retrogressed, and that the climate here has grown
colder. I found, on the way from Dudino to the Ural Moun
tains, in a place where larches now only grow in sheltered river
valleys, in turf on the top of the tundra, prostrate larch trees
 still bearing cones.”f
    Schmidt also states that he was informed that at Dudino,
just at the limit of the woods, there had been found in a
miserable larch wood the lower part of a stem sticking in the
ground, apparently rooted, which was three feet in diameter.
 He also states that, “eleven versts above Krestowkoje, in
lat. 72°, he found, in a layer of soil covered with clay on the
upper edge of the banks of the Yenissei, well-preserved stems
 like those of the birch, with their bark intact, and sometimes
 with their roots attached, and three to four inches in diameter,
 Professor Merklin recognizes them as those of the Almaster
 fruticosus, which still grows as a bush on the islands of the
 Yenissei, in lat. 70}^N.”
     Evidence from Shells.-In the freshwater deposits in which
 the bones of the Mammoth are found, there are freshwater
 and land-shells, which indicate a warmer condition of climate.
  I quote the following from Mr. Howorth's memoir :
     “Schmidt found Helic schreneki in freshwater deposits on

  Lopatim found recent shells of it, with well-preserved colours,
   9° further south, in lat. 68° and 69°, within the present range
  of trees, at the mouth of the Awamka. The most northern
  limit hitherto known for this shell was in lat. 60° N., where
  they were found by Maak in gold-washings on the Pit.”
     “In the freshwater clay of the tundra by Tolstoi Noss,
  Schmidt found Planorbis albus, Valrata cristata, and Limnaea
  auricularia in a subfossil state; Cyclas calyculata and Valvata
 piscinalis he found thrown up on the banks of the Yenissei, and
  on a rotten drifted trunk, Limaw agrestis; Anodonta anatina he
  also found on the banks of the Yenissei as far as Tolstoi Noss,
  but no further. Pisidium fontinale still lives in the pools on the
  tundra; as does Succinea putris on the branches of the Alnaster
 on the Brijochof Islands.”
     Mr. Belt mentions" that the Cyrena fluminalis is found in
 Siberia in the same deposits which contain the remains of the
 Mammoth and the Rhinoceros tichorhinus.
     “The evidence, then,” says Mr. Howorth, “ of the débris of
 vegetation, and of the freshwater- and land-shells found with
 the Mammoth-remains, amply confirms the 3 priori conclusion
 that the climate of Northern Siberia was at the epoch of the
 Mammoth much more temperate than now. It seems that the
 botanical facies of the district was not unlike that of Southern
 Siberia, that the larch, the willow, and the Alnaster were pro
 bably the prevailing trees, that the limit of woods extended far
 to the north of its present range and doubtless as far as the
 Arctic Sea; that not only the mean temperature was much
 higher, but it is probable that the winters were of a temperate and
 not of an Arctic type.” (Geol. Mag. Dec. 1880.)
     The Mammoth Interglacial,—lt need be a matter of no
 surprise that the climate of Northern Siberia during the time
 of the Mammoth was more mild and equable than now, if we
 only admit that the Mammoth was interglacial. That it was
 of interglacial age is a conclusion which, I think, has been well
established by Prof. J. Geikie and others.       Into the facts and
arguments which have been advanced in support of this con
clusion I need not here enter. The subject will, however, be
found discussed at great length in Prof. Geikie's “Prehistoric
Europe’ and in ‘The Great Ice-Age' (second edition). Mr.
R. A. Wallace considers that one of the last intercalated mild
periods of the glacial epoch seems to offer all the necessary
conditions for the existence of the Mammoth in Siberia.
That the Mammoth was interglacial will be further evident
when we consider the climatic conditions of Europe at the

36                    Dr. J. Croll on Arctic
time that it lived there. Before doing so, it may be as well
to glance at what evidently were the main characteristics of
the interglacial periods.
    Main Characteristics of Interglacial Climate.—They are as
follows:–
    1. Interglacial conditions neither did nor could exist simul
 taneously on both hemispheres. They existed only on one
 hemisphere at a time, viz. on the hemisphere which had its
 winter solstice in perihelion.
    2. During interglacial periods the climate was more equalile
 than it is at present; that is to say, the difference between
 the summer and winter temperatures was much less than it is
 now. The summers may not have been warmer or even so
 warm as they are at present, but the temperature of the
 winters was much above what it is at the present day.
    3. During interglacial periods the quantity of equatorial
 heat conveyed by ocean-currents into temperate and polar
 regions was far in excess of what it is at present. On this
 account a greater uniformity of climate then prevailed : that
 is to say, the difference of climatic conditions between the
 subtropical and the temperate and polar regions was less
 marked than at present—the temperature not differing so
 much with latitude as it now does.
    4. Mildness, or a comparative absence of high winds, cha
 racterized interglacial climate. This partial exemption from
 high winds resulted from the fact that the difference of tem
 perature between the equator and the poles, the primary cause
 of the winds, was much less than at the present day.
     5. Another character of interglacial climate was a higher
 mean temperature than now prevails. This, amongst other
 causes, resulted from the great amount of heat then transferred
 by ocean-currents from the glacial to the interglacial hemi
 sphere.
     6. During interglacial periods the climate was not only
 more equable, mild, and uniform than now, but it was also
 more moist. This was doubtless owing mainly to the fact of
 the presence then in temperate and       i.   regions of so large
 an amount of warm intertropical water. In short, it was the
  presence of so much warm water from intertropical regions
  which mainly gave to the climate of the interglacial periods
 its peculiar character.
     All these characteristics of interglacial climate have been
  fully established by the facts of j.        but they are also, as
 We fº seen, deducible a priori from physical principles. They
 follow as necessary consequences from those physical agencies
 which brought about the glacial epoch.

     Eridence from the Mammoth in Europe.—Skeletons and
  detached remains of the Mammoth have been found in nearly
  every country, in Europe. ... Mr. Howorth, in his memoir”,
  gives the details of the finding of these in various parts of
  Russia, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Belgium, Franée, Eng
  land, and other countries.      It is shown that the conditions
  under which the Mammoth-remains have been found in Europe
  are almost identically the same as those under which they are
  found in Siberia, with the exception, of course, that in Europe
  no carcases with their flesh intact have been met with.
     Again, the deposit in which the Mammoth-remains are
  found in Europe is the same as that in which they occur in
  Siberia. The deposit is a freshwater one, consisting of marly
 clay and gravel, and containing plant-remains and land- and
 freshwater-shells. When these plants and shells are examined,
 they are found to indicate the same interglacial condition of
 climate as that which prevailed in Siberia during the time the
 Mammoth lived in that region.
    In the case of land-plants it is, of course, only under excep
 tional circumstances, as Prof. J. Geikie remarks, that they can
 be found in a condition suitable for the botanist.       Now and
 again, however, beds with well-preserved plants are met with,
 buried under lacustrine deposits. In a still better state of
 preservation are the plant-remains and shells which have been
 discovered in the masses of calcareous tufa which have been
 formed upon the borders of incrustating springs.        An exami
nation of the plant-remains found under those conditions shows
that during !. times, when the deposits in which the
 Mammoth bones are found were being formed, the climate was
more equable and uniform than it is at the present day.
    The fossiliferous remains yielded by the tufas have led to
most important results as to the climatic condition of the
Pleistocene period, into the details of which I need not here
enter. These will be found at full length in Prof. J. Geikie's
‘Prehistoric Europe, chap. iv. f. It will suffice at present
simply to refer to the general conclusions to which these
researches have led, in so far as they bear on the climatic
conditions prevailing at the time the Mammoth lived so
abundantly in Europe.
   In the tufa deposits of Tuscany have been found numbers
of plant-remains of indigenous species, commingled with
others which now no longer grow in Tuscany. Amongst the
latter is the Canary laurel, which now flourishes so luxuriantly
in the Canary Islands, on the northern slopes of the mountains,
       * Geol. Mag. May 1881.

38                    Dr. J. Croll on Arctic
at an elevation of from 2000 to 5000 feet above the sea-level—
a region, remarks Prof. J. Geikie, nearly always enveloped in
steaming vapours, and exposed to heavy rains in winter. In
that deposit is also found the common laurel, associated with
the beech. This is not now the case, as the laurel requires
more shade than it can find there at present, while the beech
has retreated to the northern flanks of the Apennines to obtain
a cooler climate.
    In the tufas of Provence are found groups the same as those
 which flourish there at present, but commingled with them are
 also the Canary laurel and other plants which are no longer
 natives of Provence. Saporta directs attention to the fact that
 species such as the Aleppo pine and the olive, demanding consi
 derable summer-heat rather than a moist climate, are entirely
 wanting in the tufas.
    Similar to those of Provence are the tufas of Montpellier.
 Saporta concludes that when all those species lived together
 the climate must necessarily have been more equable and
 humid than at present. In other words, the summers were
 not so dry and the winters were milder than they are now.
    The deposit near Moret, in the valley of the Seine, is still
 more remarkable in showing the equable condition of climate
 which then prevailed. The assemblage of plants found there
 tells a tale, says Prof. J. Geikie, which there is no possibility
 of misreading. “Here,” he says, “we have the clearest
 evidence of a genial, humid, and equable climate having
 formerly characterized Northern France. The presence of
 the laurel, and that variety of it which is most susceptible
to cold, shows us that the winters must have been mild, for
this plant flowers during that season, and repeated frosts,
 says Saporta, would prevent it reproducing its kind. It is
a mild winter rather than a hot summer which the laurel
 demands, and the same may be said of the fig-tree. The
 olive, on the other hand, requires prolonged summer heat to
 enable it to perform its vital functions. Saporta describes
the fig-tree of the La-Celle tufa as closely approximating, in
 the size and shape of its leaves and fruit, to that of the tufas
 in the south of France, and to those of Asia Minor, Kur
 distan, and Armenia. But if the winters in Northern France
 were formerly mild and genial, the summers were certainly
 more humid, and probably not so hot. This is proved by the
 presence of several plants in the tufa of La Celle which
 cannot endure a hot arid climate, but abound in the shady
 woods of Northern France and Germany.”
    The plants found in the tufas of Canstadt are much similar
to those of Moret. Mr. Howorth, in regard to the deposits of

                         Interglacial Periods.                   39
   those places, says:–“The coexistence of the species found
   there, remarks M. Saporta, proves very clearly that, notwith
   standing the variations due to latitude, Europe, from the Medi
   terranean to its central districts, offered fewer contrasts, and
   was more uniform than it is now. A more equable climate,
   damp and clement, allowed the Acer pseudo-platanus and the
   fig to live associated together near Paris, as it allowed the
   reindeer and hyaena. The Acer grows with difficulty now
   where the Ficus grows wild, while the latter has to be pro
   tected in winter in the latitude of Paris.””
      Equally conclusive is the testimony borne by the Mollusca
  of the tufas. In the tufas and marls of Moret, in the valley
  of the Seine, thirty-five species were discovered. The majority
  of these must have lived in damp and shady places, in the
  recesses of moist woods, and on the leaves of marsh-plants.
  The shells, M. Tournouar concludes, bespeak a condition of
  climate more uniform, damp, and equable than now prevails
  in that region, with a somewhat higher mean annual tempe
  rature.    É. the alluvial deposits of Canstadt, in Würtem
  berg, a class of shells indicating a similar condition of climate
  has been discovered.
     The evidence furnished by the animals found most abun
  dantly with the Mammoth in Europe and Siberia, Mr.
  Howorth thinks, points to the same conclusion as that of the
  plants and mollusca.
     The same mild and equable condition which allowed of the
  Mammoth living in Northern Siberia            º;      Pleistocene
  times thus equally prevailed over the whole of Europe. We
  have seen that, according to the Physical Theory, this con
 dition of climate was in every respect precisely what it
 ought to have been on the supposition that it was interglacial.
  It was a condition mild, equable, uniform, humid, and of a
 higher mean annual temperature than we have at the present
 day. There is, however, direct and positive evidence that
 this condition of climate was interglacial; for the facts both
of geology and of palaeontology show that it was preceded
 and succeeded by a state of things of a wholly opposite
character.
     The Mammoth Glacial as well as Interglacial,—Although
the Mammoth could have lived in Arctic Siberia only during
an interglacial period, it does not foliow that it must have
perished during the succeeding glacial period. When the
cold came on, and the vegetation on which it subsisted began
to disappear, it would move southwards, and would continue
its march as the cold and severity of the winters increased.
                        * Geol. Mag. June 1881.

40                   Dr. J. Croll on Arctic
During the continuance of the ten or twelve thousand years
of Arctic conditions it would find in Southern Europe and
elsewhere places where it could exist. At the end of the cold
period, and when the climate again began to grow mild and
equable, it would retrace its steps northwards. There is,
however, little doubt that during the severity of a glacial
period, and when necessarily confined to a more limited area,
its numbers would be greatly diminished. There is every
reason for believing that the Mammoth outlived all that suc
cession of cold and warm periods known as the glacial epoch
proper, and did not finally disappear till recent postglacial
times.
   It was probably about the commencement of a cold period,
and before the Mammoth had retreated from Northern Siberia,
that those individuals perished whose carcases have been found
frozen in the cliffs. The way in which they probably perished
and became imbedded in the frozen mud and ice, has, I think,
been ingeniously shown by Dr. Rae”.
   Arctic America during Interglacial times.—We have seen
that the eastern continent in Pleistocene times enjoyed in the
Arctic regions interglacial conditions of climate. It is true
that on the western continent we have not in Arctic regions
such clear and satisfactory evidence of an interglacial period.
But it would be rash to infer from this that the western con
tinent was, in this respect, less favoured than the eastern.
That we should find less evidence at the present day of former
interglacial periods in Arctic America than in Arctic Asia, is
what is to be expected, for the glaciation which succeeded
interglacial periods has been far more severe in the former
region than in the latter. The remains of the Mammoth
have, however, been found in Arctic America, in ice-cliffs at
Kötzebue Sound, under conditions exactly similar to those of
Siberia.
   In Banks's Land, Prince Patrick’s Island, and Melville
Island, as in Northern Siberia, full-grown trees have been
found in abundance at considerable distances in the interior,
and at elevations of two or three hundred feet above sea-level.
The bark on many of them was in a perfect state. Capt.
McClure, Capt. Osborn, and Lieut. Mº. by whom they
were found, all agreed in thinking that they grew in the place
where they were found.
   It is true that more recent Arctic voyagers have come to
the conclusion that these trees must have been drifted down
the rivers from the south.     There can be little doubt that the
 greater part of the wood found there, as in Siberia, is drift
 wood.    But may there not be also, as in Siberia, two kinds
                  * Phil. Mag. for July 1874, p. 60.

                         Interglacial Periods.                 41
  of wood —a “Noashina” and an “Adamshina,” a kind which
  was drifted and another kind which grew on the spot. This
  is a point which will require to be determined.
     That so little has as yet been done in the way of searching
  for such evidence of interglacial periods, is,   ...       in a
  great measure due to the fact that most of those, if not all,
  who have visited those regions entertained the belief that
  there is an a priori improbability that a condition of climate
  which would have allowed the growth of trees in such a place
  prevailed so recently as Post-tertiary times. Even supposing
  those Arctic voyagers had considered the finding of inter
  glacial deposits a likely thing, and had in addition made
  special search for them, the simple fact that they should
  have failed to find any trace of them could not, as we have
  already shown, be regarded as even presumptive evidence
  that none existed. Take Scotland as an example. Abundant
  relics of interglacial age have there been found from time to
  time ; but amongst the many geologists who visit that country
  year by year, how few of them have the good fortune of dis
  covering a single relic. In fact a geologist might search for
  months, and yet fail to meet with an interglacial deposit. The
  reason is obvious.    The last ice-sheet, under which Scotland
  was buried, was so enormous as to remove every remnant of
 the preceding interglacial land-surface, except here and there
 in deep and ...i hollows, or in spots where it may happen
 to have been protected from the grinding power of the ice
 by projecting rocks. But all those places are now so com
 pletely covered with boulder-clay and other deposits that it
 is only in the sinking of pits, quarries, in railway-cuttings,
 and other deep excavations that traces of them       ...i.
 turn up. Now if it is so difficult to find in temperate regions,
 in a place like Scotland, interglacial remains, how much more
 difficult must it be to meet with them in Arctic regions, where
 the destructive power of the ice must have been so much
greater.                                                   -
    Something like indications of an interglacial period appear
to have been found by Professor Nordenskjöld in Spitzbergen.
“In the interior of Ice-fjord,” he says, “and at several other
places on the coast of Spitzbergen, one meets with indications
either that the polar tracts were less completely covered with
ice during the glacial era than is usually supposed, or that,
in conformity with what has been observed in Switzerland,
interglacial periods have also occurred in the polar regions.
In some sandbeds not very much raised above the level of
the sea one may, in fact, i. the large shells of a mussel
(Mytilus edulis) still living in the waters encircling the Scan
dinavian coast. It is now no longer found in the sea around

 42                  On Arctic Interglacial Periods.
 Spitzbergen, having been probably routed out by the ice
 masses constantly driven by the ocean-currents along the
 coasts.”*
     This testimony is the more valuable as it is given by an
 experienced geologist so much opposed to the theory of inter
 glacial periods. A more special and thorough search of
 those beds might probably reveal further indications of inter
 glacial age.
     Was Greenland free from Ice during any of the Interglacial
 Periods 2—There is nothing whatever improbable in the sup
 position that during some of the earlier interglacial         º,
 when the eccentricity was about a maximum, the ice might
 have completely disappeared from Greenland, and the country
 become covered with vegetation.
    Mr. Wallace thinks that the existence at present of an
 ice-sheet on Greenland is to be explained only by the fact
 that cold currents from the polar area flow down both sides
 of that continent.        He further thinks that could these two
 Arctic currents be diverted from Greenland, “that country
 would become free from ice, and might even be completely
 forest-clad and habitable.” f
    I am inclined to agree with Mr. Wallace in thinking that
 the withdrawal of the two cold currents in question would
 effectually remove the ice. We know that Greenland is at
present buried under ice, as has been shown on former occa
sions, simply because there      º          to be about two inches
more of ice annually formed than is actually melted. It
certainly would not require any very great change in the
present physical and climatic conditions of things to melt
two additional inches per annum. If this were done the
ice would ultimately disappear. A simple decrease in the
volume of the two currents might possibly bring about such
a result. A cause more effectual would, however, be an
increase in the temperature and volume of the Arctic branch
of the Gulf-stream.
    NoTE.—This will probably be my last paper on questions
relating to geological climate. There are many points I
should have wished to consider more fully, but advancing
  'ears and declining health have rendered it necessary for me
to abandon the subject altogether in order to be able to finish
some work, in a wholly different field of inquiry, which has
been laid aside for upwards of a quarter of a century.

                   III. A Capillary Multiplier.
                 By A. M. WoRTHINGTON, M.A.”
                         [Plate I. figs. 1 & 2.]
This little instrument (Plate I. fig. 1) consists simply of a
       rectangular strip of platinum foil of known length rolled
into a cylindrical coil, whose successive convolutions are kept
separate at a distance of about 2 mm. by means of a strip of
glass beads in the upper portion of the coil. The lower
edges of all the convolutions are in the same plane ; and the
instrument when in use hangs from one end of a balance
beam with this plane horizontal.
    The liquid whose surface-tension is to be determined is
placed below the coil in a vessel which can be raised till
the free surface touches the base of the coil. The pull now
 exerted on the coil is measured by weights placed in the
 other pan; and these weights afford, when certain precautions
 shortly to be mentioned are taken, an accurate measure of the
  surface-tension of the liquid.
    The method is really that used twenty years ago by Wil
  helmyt, and more recently by M. Dupréf, who, however,
  employed only a single cylindrical sheet of platinum instead
  ofa coil, and an hydrometer instead of a balance for measuring
  the pull.                                                      -
     The only novelty lies in the substitution of the coil for
  the single sheet, by which the sensitiveness of the method is
  increased many-fold.               -
     The principles involved may be briefly explained as follows:
  When any liquid is placed in a vessel whose sides it wets, i.e.
  against which the edge-angle of the liquid is 0°, the liquid is
  raised round the edge above the level of the free surface,
  and the weight of liquid so raised is equal to the surface
  tension of the liquid multiplied by the periphery across which
  the surface-tension acts.     When the       º: (p) is known
  and the weight (w) of liquid raised is known, then the tension
  per unit of length is known to be w.
     When a capillary tube is used for measuring the surface
 tension, the periphery across which the force acts, is the
 internal perimeter of the tube, and this is too small to be

44                 Mr. A. M. Worthington on
capable of very exact measurement; while the weight of liquid
raised is that of a column whose height can indeed be accu
rately measured, but whose sectional area is again too small
to be very correctly determined.
   If a very wide tube be used, the perimeter can be measured
with much greater accuracy ; but the weight of liquid raised
cannot now be determined in the same way as before, since
the volume included between the surface of the meniscus and
a horizontal plane touching its lowest point is now an import
ant part of the whole volume raised. But the weight of the
liquid raised along both the inside and outside perimeters
of the tube is equal to the reactionary pull downwards of the
liquid on the tube and may be determined by measuring
this latter.
   M. Dupré's wide cylinder of platinum foil was simply a
tube whose inner and outer perimeters were sensibly equal
and accurately known, and the pull across this perimeter
could be determined in the way described.
   The great advantage of the coil over the single sheet is that
the periphery across which the tension acts may be made
very great, while the diameter of the coil, and consequently the
quantity of liquid required and the area of its exposed surface,
remains small.
   Thus one of my coils is made of a strip 50 centim. long
and presents a perimeter of 1 metre, while its diameter is
only 3 centim, and the pull of water on this is about 8 grams.
   The beads of which the strip is composed for separating
the convolutions are made of hard glass, and strung on fine
platinum wire, so that the instrument may be very readily
cleaned by heating to a bright heat in the Bunsen flame.
The beads should not reach within 2 or 3 centim. of the lower
edge of the coil, in order that the liquid which rises between
the convolutions may not reach so high as to wet the glass.
If the consecutive coils are 2 millim. apart, then water (which
is raised higher than any other known liquid) will attain a
height of about 8 centim. But since the coil is liable to be
dragged down into the liquid, it is well to leave an ample
margin.
   If the coil dips below the plane surface of the liquid, there
is a correction necessary on account of the buoyancy of the
liquid. If, on the other hand, the base of the coil is raised
above the free surface, there is a traction to correct for, due
to the adhesion of the liquid to the horizontal section of the
spiral edge. By adjusting the level of the liquid-surface
after it has wetted the coil to the level of the base of the coil,
when the balance-beam is horizontal, the necessity for these

                        a Capillary Multiplier.                   45
corrections is avoided.       The thickest foil that I use is 0025
centim. thick, and the correction due to an error of adjust
ment of the surface, amounting to 1 millim., would, in a
measure of the surface-tension of alcohol, amount to gºo of
the whole ; and it is easy to make the adjustment within much
narrower limits than 1 millim.
                             Method of Use.
    In order to prevent the coil from being dragged below the
surface, or, on the other hand, separated from it, I find it
convenient to fix two stops A and B (see fig. 2), just above
and below the beam of the small unmounted balance that I
 employ : two stout pins stuck in a cork that is held in its
 place by a rod (as in the figure) serve the purpose very well.
    After cleaning the coil in the Bunsen flame, adjusting its
 base so as to be horizontal by means of the three suspending
 cords, which are made of silk and are provided with beads
 through which the silk forms nooses like a tent-rope, and
  accurately counterpoising, a block C is placed below the
  right-hand pan at such a height that the pan rests on it when
  the beam is horizontal. Then the liquid to be tested is placed
  in a thin beaker, which stands on a small table, whose height
  can be easily adjusted by a ratchet-screw (the end of an
   optical lantern with a ºon the top does very well). This
   is raised till the platinum is wetted, when it is at once drawn
   as far below the surface (4 or 5 millim.) as the position of
   the stop A will permit. The pan D is now pressed down by
   hand on the block C and held there, while the level of the
   liquid surface is adjusted to the base of the coil. Then D is
   released, Cremoved, and weights added to restore equilibrium.
      It will be observed that the coil is, by the process of putting
   on the weights, gradually drawn out of the liquid, so that the
   topmost element of the elevated liquid will everywhere be in
  contact with a portion of the coil that has been thoroughly
  wetted, which will with most liquids reduce the contact-angle
  to zero.
      A few points may be usefully mentioned about the con
  struction of the coil. To make the strip of glass beads I use
  combustion-tubing drawn out to a diameter of about 2 millim.
  and cut first into lengths of about 20 centim. Out of a
  number of such pieces, a careful selection is made of those of
  most uniform thickness; these are then accurately cut to a
 length of about 2 centim, and of the beads thus i. the strip
 i. Put together by passing through each in turn in opposite
 directions the two ends of a fine platinum wire (size no. 36).
 The smoothness of the glass strip allows the        platinum coil to

might doubtless be given to the multiplier, but the cylin

smallest amount of liquid. The labour of double-threading
the long strip of beads is considerable, and I have tried to
avoid it by substituting a strip of asbestos cardboard, which
would allow the coil to be cleansed by the action of the flame
as before. But though in other respects satisfactory, the
asbestos very rapidly gains in weight through the absorption
of the vapour of many liquids, and cannot therefore be used
unless wrapped in very thin platinum foil; but when so
wrapped it is troublesome to coil, and does not allow the same
ready adjustment of the edges of the coil to one plane.

    IV. Note on a Point in the Theory of Pendent Drops.
                 By A. M. WoRTHINGTON, M.A. *
                            [Plate I. figs, 3–5.]
IN a paper on        Pendent Drops (Proc. Roy. Soc. no. 214,
      1881) I explained how, from a tracing of the outline of
a drop pendent from a circular base, the value of the surface
tension of the liquid could be deduced with an accuracy that
compared favourably with that of any other method.
   The most difficult part of the process is the measurement
at various levels of the inclination of the tangent of the curve
to the axis; and I find that this difficulty does not disappear,
as I hoped it might, when a photograph of the magnified
image of the drop is substituted for a tracing made by i.
   It is essential to the success of the method to measure this
inclination at levels where the horizontal sectional area of the
drop is widely different. Thus in a drop shaped as in fig. 3
Plate I, it would be desirable to measure the inclination, say,
at the level AB and again at the level C.D. Now at AB,
where the inclination §º very slowly, its value may be
very accurately determined ; but at CD the change of incli
nation is rapid and its determination difficult.
   It has lately occurred to me that the necessity of finding
the value of the inclination at more than one level may be

avoided, while that level may be so chosen that the tangent
is there vertical or changes its inclination very slowly.
    Let ADCE (fig. 4) represent a horizontal circular section
of the pendent drop taken at any level; ABC the generating
 curve in the plane of the paper; DBE the same curve in a
 plane at right angles to the paper. Consider first the equi
 librium as regards vertical forces of the mass of liquid below
 the plane section. We may equate the vertical component
 of the surface-tension (T) round the circumference ADCE,
 to the weight (W) of the liquid below the section + the
 pressure on the area ADCE ; so that, signifying by a the
 unknown distance of this section from the level of the free
 surface of the liquid, and by A the weight of unit volume of
 the liquid, we have

     Again, if we consider the equilibrium, as regards horizontal
  forces parallel to the plane of the paper, of the mass

                V. On a new Form of Monochord.
                 By Dr. A. ELSAss of Marburg".
    HE monochord has been employed from time immemorial
     to demonstrate the laws of transverse vibrations. It is used
to show that, in producing its fundamental note, a string
vibrates in its whole length, but that, in producing the higher
K.       tones, nodes are formed; and by its means the law of
   ersenne can be demonstrated, according to which the fun
damental note of a string depends upon its length, its tension,
and its mass. In recent times Melde's apparatus has also
been employed to show the mode of vibration of the string,
which by its means may be made evident to a large audience.
   The essential parts of this apparatus are a tuning-fork and
a stretched yielding thread, one end of which is attached to the
tuning-fork. If the tuning-fork is made to sound, its vibra
tory motion induces a transversal vibration of the thread,
both when the motion of the tuning-fork takes place at right
angles to the thread and when it takes place in the direction
of its length and the magnitude of the vibrations of the
thread is so great that they can be observed        from some dis
tance off. The present communication describes a new form
of vibration-apparatus which combines the advantages of the
monochord .." of Melde's apparatus.
   In Melde's apparatus the thread is made to assume different
forms of vibration by altering its tension, and with it the ratio
of its oscillation-period to that of the body which produces the
motion; but the oscillation-period itself, which depends upon
the period of the exciting body, is not subject to variation.
   In the arrangement to be described, however, all variations
can be obtained with the same thread by altering the period
of the exciting body, so that the law connecting the normal

                       Form of Monochord.                       49
vibration-form of the thread and the period of corresponding
number of vibrations can be at once exhibited.
   The problem, how to excite a thread to vibration by an
exºn<U+017F>      periodic action the period of which can be varied at
pleasure, can only be solved by employing a motion of rotation
to excite the vibration.   If one end of the thread is to be used
as the exciting-point, then, in order that the external motion
shall take place at right angles to the thread, this point must be
fastened in such a way that it cannot be displaced in the direc
tion of the thread, but is capable of motion at right angles to
it. This is nearly the case if the thread is attached to a rigid
lever capable of motion, without much friction, on fixed points
round an axis at right angles to the thread. If, then, by
means of a revolving toothed wheel or some similar arrange
ment, periodical impulses can be given, this arrangement will
render possible the solution of the problem proposed.
   As far as the nature of the vibrations of the thread thus
produced is concerned, it is clear that stationary vibrations
of the thread can only take place when the period of the
external motion stands in some simple ratio to the period of a
component of the natural vibrations of the thread—if, at least,
we make the assumption that the lever comes into contact with
the rotating body only during an indefinitely small time in
each impulse.
   We see at once that the vibrations of a thread of which one
end is not fixed but takes part in the vibration cannot take
place in the same manner as the free vibrations of a thread of
which both ends are fixed. The mathematical theory, how
ever, which I intend to give in another place, shows that the
difference between the form of the constrained vibrations with
which we are concerned and that of the free vibrations of the
thread is only of small amount. In the constrained vibrations
the thread swings without true nodes, i. e. points which are
absolutely at rest; but instead, it has apparent nodes which
are points of minimum amplitude of vibration, and the moving
end of the thread itself is such a node of minimum amplitude.
This remark, of course, holds good only upon the assumption
that the end of the thread attached to the lever makes only
very small excursions.
   It is easy to take account of the relation which must exist
between the period of the external excitation and the period
of the vibrations of the thread.         Let us        Fig. 1.
imagine that the oscillations of a pendulum
are maintained by periodical blows, taking --- e................ O
place always in the same direction. . Let               a.       b
a and b (fig. 1) denote the limiting positions

50                    Dr. A. Elsass on a new
of the bob of a pendulum; then it is only necessary each time
that it comes into the position a to give it a blow in the direc
tion ab. The motion will be sustained if the period T of the
excitation is equal to the period of the oscillation. We see,
however, that the motion of the pendulum may also be sus
tained by impulses of the periods 2T, 3T, &c.; for if the
pendulum-bob is at a at the times 0, T, 2T, 3T, &c., it is suffi
cient that it should receive an impulse in the direction ab at
the instants T, 3T, 5T in order to replace the energy lost
by friction. It is seen, however, that the amplitude of the
pendulum-oscillations will be greatest for equality of periods,
 if the impulses are in all cases of equal intensity.
    From these considerations we should expect that, in the
 constrained vibrations of the thread, the mth partial vibration
whose period Tm =      #T.  is equal to the mth part of the period
 of the fundamental vibration, would appear if the period (T)
 of the excitation is equal to Tm, 2Tm, 3T., &c. The phenomena
 of oscillation, however, are not so complicated with the appa
 ratus here described as might appear from this. A small wheel
 is fixed somewhat excentrically upon the axis of the siren
 (fig. 2) (the excentricity amounts to about 0.5 millim.), and
 to the uprights carrying the wheelwork is fixed, by means of
 two screws, a support for a little bent lever, the conically
 pointed axis of which rests in two steel screws passing through
 the support, and moves in it with              Fig. 2.
 a small amount of friction.      The
 wheel itself and the supports for
 the lever are of cast brass.     The
 lever (as shown in fig. 2) is ca
 pable of motionin a vertical plane,
 presses with its vertical arm against
  the excentric wheel, and has its
 horizontal arm attached to the
  stretched thread, which is hori
  zontal and at right angles to the
  axis of the lever. The tension of
  the thread retains the lever in its
  position when the siren is at rest,
  and brings it back into its position
  of rest when the siren is sounding,
  and the revolving excentric wheel
  imparts to it periodically a small
  motion. It is not necessary, nor
  possible with a considerable ten
  sion of the thread, that the lever should touch the wheel

                            Form of Monochord.                             51
  in all positions; it is sufficient if the wheel comes into contact
  with the lever for a short interval of time.                  The degree
  of contact may also be easily regulated. At the proper dis
  tance from the siren, and opposite to it, a wooden stand is
  placed, carrying a pulley-wheel turning very easily, such as
  the wheel of an Atwood's machine. The wheel is adjusted at
  such a height that the thread which passes over it may be
  horizontal when stretched by means of weights placed in a
 little scale-pan attached to it. If the friction between the
 wheel and the lever is too great in the horizontal position of
 the thread, the support carrying the pulley-wheel may be
 raised a little, so that the horizontal arm of the lever may be
 pulled up a little and the vertical arm thus removed somewhat
 from the wheel. If the lever does not touch the wheel at all,
 the support must be lowered somewhat.
    When the friction has been properly regulated, the siren
 may be put into action and its note gradually raised. At first
 the motion of the thread may be followed through its separate
  º, with the eye, but when the velocity of rotation of the siren
   ecomes greater there is to be observed only an uncertain trem
 bling of the thread, and the friction of the lever on the wheel
 produces a noise; then this suddenly ceases, and the thread is
 seen to be in stationary oscillation of the fundamental form.
 The amplitude is considerable, and with threads of 1 metre lon
 is often of three fingers’ breadth, if the dimensions of the i.
 have been well chosen.          As soon as the thread has settled
 down to perform its fundamental oscillation with constant
amplitude, it is found to be very easy to maintain the velocity
 of the siren constant. Every one who has used a siren to
 determine the pitch of a note must have remarked how diffi
cult it is to maintain the note of a definite pitch if there is no
arrangement for regulating the pressure of air. I must
acknowledge that I had not expected to see this difficulty
so easily removed ; and it is certainly a peculiar action of the
friction between the lever and the wheel, though one easily to
be explained", which causes that a change in the pressure of
the air delivered by the bellows produces only a change in the
intensity of the note given by the siren, and not at once any
change in the velocity of rotation—if this coincides with the
velocity of vibration of the thread. The tone of the siren and
the vibration of the thread can equally easily be maintained
constant, when the velocity of rotation of the siren is increased
   * The thread     º; its own proper vibration is, as it were, in a
condition of rigidity, out of which it is not easily brought (unless its mass
is altogether too small), and thus acts, by means of the friction between
the lever and the wheel, as a regulator to the siren.

52                      Dr. A. Elsass on a new
so much that the thread shows its second, third, or fourth mode
of vibration ; and the period of excitation becomes equal to
#Ti, T., +TI, where Ti denotes the period of the fundamental
vibration of the thread. According to theory, a definite form
of vibration of the thread must make its appearance when the
time of rotation of the siren T-2Tm, 3Tin, &c.; so that, for
example, if T-3T1=3T, the thread vibrates in four half
waves, and for T=#T1=2Ts the thread shows its third form
of vibration. The velocity of rotation of the siren can be
maintained constant without trouble only when the period of
excitation is equal to that of the vibration of the thread; and
if a vibration of the thread belonging to some other ratio of
periods shows itself for a moment, it does not produce any
perceptible disturbance. It is precisely this peculiarity—that
the vibrations of the thread can be maintained without change
only when the periods are equal—that renders this form of
apparatus so suitable for the demonstration of the laws of the
vibrations of threads.
   We may now give some examples of the use of the
apparatus.
   In order to show that the numbers of vibrations of the over
tones of a thread are in the ratio of the natural numbers, it is
only necessary to count the revolutions of the siren when it
puts a thread or a thin metallic wire into vibration with 1, 2,
3, &c. half-waves. In Table I. I have brought together four
series of observations, made with four different threads each
1 metre in length. I. denotes a cotton thread with a tension
of 50 gr. ; II. bookbinders’ thread with a tension of 50 gr. ;
III. a thread of button-hole silk with a tension of 9 gr. ; and
IV. a brass wire of about 0.15 millim. diameter and 200 gr.
tension.   The number n denotes the order of the vibration
and N the number of vibrations.

   The number of vibrations N was determined from three
independent observations—by reading the dials of the siren
every 2 minutes, adding together the numbers of revolutions,

                         Form of Monochord.                        53
and dividing by 360. The numbers of vibrations of the fol
lowing Tables were determined in the same way.
    It is not possible to raise the tone of the siren to any extent,
and thus to render visible the higher partial vibrations of the
same thread. But for lecture-experiments it will always be
sufficient to show the law of overtones for the slower vibrations;
and if it is desired to go further than in the experiments I have
described, it is only necessary to replace the excentric wheel
by an elliptical wheel, or by a toothed wheel exactly centred,
with, say, four teeth, so that for the same velocity of rotation
the number of shocks is doubled or increased fourfold.         I have
obtained the best results with toothed wheels of various forms,
but think it more convenient so to choose the thread, its
length and tension, that the excentric wheel suffices for the
experiment.
        order to demonstrate the Law of lengths, it is advisable
to take a longer piece of a not too thin white silk thread,
which will be nearly the same length for great differences of
tension, and to stretch it over a measure and mark off equal
distances with India ink. Thus, in the experiments to which
Table II. relates, a thread of button-hole silk 2 metres long,
and marked off into lengths of 10 centim., was attached to the
lever of the apparatus, so that the first mark fell at the point
of attachment, passed over the pulley, and stretched with
a force of 60 gr. by weighting the scale-pan with shot.
Between the siren and the upright carrying the pulley-wheel
 I placed a table, carrying a small iron support with a clamp to
grip the thread. In the Table, l denotes the length of the
vibrating thread and N the number of oscillations for the
fundamental note.

the same silk used in the last experiment and 1 metre lon

and the higher tensions were obtained by adding weights. In

   In order to show that the vibration-numbers of threads of
 equal length and tension vary inversely as their masses, it is
 best to employ thin metallic wires, since they are heavier than
 threads, and consequently a small error in the weights is not
 so perceptible. The weights, p, of wires employed for the fol
 lowing experiments were determined by weighing four metres
 of each wire; after being weighed a length of 1.20 metre was
 cut off and stretched between the siren and the pulley-wheel,
 so that the length of the vibrating portion was 1 metre ; the
 tension (200 gr.) was chosen so great that the portion of the
 wire depending from the pulley-wheel did not need to be
 taken into account.

say more of the advantages which it offers to the demonstrator
of physics. It is, however, perhaps not superfluous to remark,
that the apparatus is so little costly that any institution at
which instruction in physics is given may be able to obtain it.
A bellows and wind-chest for organ-pipes and a siren belong
to the necessary apparatus of instruction in acoustics; we
require in addition only a small piece of apparatus which may
easily be fitted to any siren. The lever arrangement must,
however, be well made, so as to avoid disturbing noises, which
might easily be produced by the friction of the lever against
the revolving wheel.

one.” I presume that Dr. Carnelley was here referring to
the paper in the Berlin Berichte, vol. xiii. p. 1808 (1880);
and if this is so, there is little doubt that he has misinterpreted
Thomsen's conclusions, as the formula given represents only
six single linkings. The “heat of combustion of benzene, if
the carbons are linked as in Kekulé's formula, would amount
to 846,000 units, whereas if there are nine single linkings in
the molecule it would be 802,330 units. The experimental
number obtained by Thomsen was found to be 805,800; hence
he concludes that the six carbon-atoms in benzene are nine
times singly linked with each other.”, I quote here from my
own paper, entitled “Researches on the Relation between the
 Molecular Structure of Carbon Compounds and their Absorp
tion-Spectra,” published in the Journal of the Chemical
 Society for April 1881; and my conclusion was that, “subject
 to the correctness of this deduction, I consider the following
conclusion to be established :-No molecular arrangement of
carbon-atoms causes selective absorption unless each carbon is
itself united to other three-carbon atoms, as in the case of
benzene.”
   In accordance with this view, benzene could be represented
by a formula such as the following:—                             -

VII. Permanent Magnets.-II. On Magnetic Decay; with a
    Correction to the Value of H at Oxford. By R. H. M.
    BOSANQUET, St. John's College, Oaford.
  To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,
THE       decay of the magnetism of permanent magnets is a
       subject of the greatest practical importance. Some of
the best makers of electrical measuring instruments continue
to relie to a considerable extent on permanent magnets, and the
 change of these is not easily eliminated with accuracy.
    Among the methods employed for the discovery of the
changes in permanent magnets, the direct determination of
their moments, which accompanies the ordinary process for
the determination of the horizontal component of the earth's
magnetism, seems to be free from objection. This is the
 method some further results of which I propose now to
 communicate.
    The existence of the decay or diminution of magnetic mo
 ments has been pointed out by Joule", and is alluded to in
 my former paper (Phil. Mag. xvii. p. 438). The values now
 dealt with form a sequel to those given in that paper.
    It is important to consider the justification offered for the
 continued use of magnets as standards, and this depends on
 the process used for the redetermination of the constants
 involved.
     One of the processes consists ultimately in the reference to
 a Clark's cell, which is supposed to remain perfectly constant.
  The assumption is justified by the fact that two such cells
  similarly prepared at the same time do not vary relatively to
  each other, though their values are not generally identical.
  It appears, however, that two such similar cells, being exposed
  always to the same influences, might be expected to make any
   changes they do make in common. At all events, without
   some further check, there is nothing in the shape of absolute
   Proof attainable by this method as to the constancy of the
   ultimate standard.

      certainly vitiate any accurate measurements founded on such

  The curve in the figure exhibits the course of the values
of M. In seven months it has diminished very nearly in the
Prº of 12 to 11.
      ese magnets are of what is called best cast steel, and are
as hard as they possibly can be made. They were prepared
about February 8th.
   It is incumbent on those who maintain that permanent
magnets can be made subject only to insignificant changes, to
submit their magnets to some long-continued series of tests of
equal conclusiveness with the above. I hope to continue the
Series.
   The new value of the moment of inertia of the magnets was
obtained by a series of forty experiments, in which the mag
nets were vibrated alternately alone and with the standard
brass bar which was made for the purpose. The wire used
for suspension was better than that employed on the former
occasion. The torsion due to it was considerably less than
that of the former wire, and was very nearly the same for all
weights.

 Geology of Wisconsin. Survey of 1873–9. Vol. I. Part I. General
    Geology. II. Natural History. III. Industrial Resources. Pub
   lished under the direction of the chief Geologist, by the Commissioners
   of Public Printing, in accordance with Legislative Enactment. 8vo,
   pages i-xxiv, and 1–725. With 11 plates, and 157 other figures.
   [Madison?] 1883.
IN agreement with the plan laid down at first, the general intro
       ductory volume is here published last”, although termed
“vol. i.” The “General Geology” is treated under several heads, so
that any one, taking up and desiring to understand the results of
the Geological Survey, may make himself acquainted with the
principles of the science by which the Survey is carried out. Thus
the Chief Geologist, Prof. T. C. Chamberlin, has been called on to
supply, and does supply very satisfactorily, a good series of obser
vations and teachings on—I. Chemical Geology, in relation to the
Earth's Crust; II. Lithological Geology, as to rocks in groups and
individually,–offering a system of nomenclature, and defining
technical terms; III. Historical Geology, under the subordinate
headings of Laurentian, Huronian, Keweenawan, Cambrian and
Potsdam, Lower-Silurian or Cambro-Silurian, Upper-Silurian, De
vonian, Carboniferous, Reptilian, Tertiary, and Quaternary periods,
and their stratal representatives; with many interesting remarks
on the processes, results, and concomitants, occurring from time to
time in the geographical and biological conditions of the Earth's
surface.
   Part II. contains chemical analyses of minerals, rocks, ores, and
waters of Wisconsin, some compiled by R. D. Salisbury (pp. 303–
308); some made, in a classified system, by R. D. Irving (pp. 309–
339); and the lithology of Wisconsin by the same (pp. 340–361).
R. P. Whitfield gives a valuable classified list of the Fossils of
Wisconsin (pp. 362-375); G. D. Swezey catalogues the Phaeno
gamous and Vascular-Cryptogamous plants of Wisconsin (pp. 376–
395).    A partial list of the Fungi of Wisconsin, with descriptions
of new species, is contributed by W. F. Bundy (pp. 396–401), who
gives also an account of the Crustacean Fauna of Wisconsin, with
descriptions of little-known species of Cambarus (pp. 402–405).
Other interesting natural-history communications are—the Cata
logue of the Wisconsin Lepidoptera (pp. 406–421), and of the
Cold-blooded Vertebrates of Wisconsin (pp. 422–435), both by
P. R. Hoy. The late Moses Strong's list of the Mammals of Wis
consin follows (pp. 437–440).
   Of the “Economic relations of Wisconsin Birds” an elaborate,
careful, and useful (at all events suggestively useful) memoir, by
F. H. King, is given (pp. 472–610). The results of the examina
tion of stomachs and food are shown by notes and tables very fully,
as to the cases in which Birds are beneficial,—destroying “noxious

  plants,” “injurious mammals,” “detrimental birds,” “injurious
  reptiles,” “noxious insects,” “injurious molluscs,” and other
 noxious forms of life, and when feeding on carrion. So also of
 harmful Birds, which destroy useful creatures, their young or their
  eggs, or when eating the parasites hurtful to obnoxious animals.
  The relations of Birds to different industries, also their habits,
  seasons, value as food, asthetic value, and economic classification,
 are all considered. Numerous figures of Birds and their various
  prey are freely inserted in the descriptions.
     Part III. treats of Economic Geology. The Iron-ores are de
  scribed by R. D. Irving (pp. 613-636). The late Moses Strong
  wrote the Chapter (for the most part) on Lead and Zinc-ores
  (pp. 637–655). Prof. T. C. Chamberlin has contributed the
  remaining Chapters—“Economic Suggestions as to Copper, Silver,
  and other ores” (pp. 656–662); on “Building Material” (pp. 663–
  677); on the “Soils and Subsoils of Wisconsin " (pp. 678-688);
 and on “Artesian Wells” (pp. 689–701). A short Note on the
  Geodetic Survey of the State, and its progress, is given at p. 702,
 and plate xi. is a map in illustration.
     The good Index (pp. 703—725) is well worthy of this excellently
  useful volume.
     Containing much that is of interest to Botanist, Ornithologist,
 and other Naturalists, this volume is also very useful to the Geo
 logist and Mineralogist. By the Geologist the many figures of
 fossils, and the highly suggestive hypothetical maps of the North
 American land in the several periods of the Huronian, Potsdam,
 Trenton, Niagara, and Hamilton formations—and again during the
 First and Second Glacial Epochs—will be fully appreciated. We
 cordially thank the Scientific Staff and the State Authorities of
 Wisconsin for this and the other volumes of their carefully-worked
Survey of the State.
The Student's Handbook of Physical Geology. By A. J. JUKEs
    BRowNE, B.A., F.G.S. 8vo. Pp. xii, 514. London: George
    Bell and Sons. 1884.
ELEvKN years have now elapsed since the second edition of Jukes's
‘School Manual of Geology’ was prepared by his nephew, the
author of the present work. Now the School (or Student's)
Manual has, we are informed, been allowed to fall out of circu
lation, and the “Student's Handbook of Physical Geology’ in a
measure takes its place, dealing with a portion of geological science
under the headings of Dynamical, Structural, and Physiographical
Geology. The Palaeontological and Historical sections are left to
form another volume.
   The work before us, although differing from it in arrangement,
is a capital introduction to the more elaborate treatise by Prof.
A. H. Green, a new edition of which was issued in 1882. We trust
that Mr. Jukes-Browne may complete the second portion of his
work more speedily than has been the case with Prof. Green; and

62                   Notices respecting New Books.
if it prove, which we do not doubt it will prove, as clear and syste
matic as the “Physical Geology,’ it will furnish a welcome guide to
those who may be dismayed at the size and cost of such a work as
that produced by Dr. A. Geikie. If, however, one work leads u
to the other, the success will be satisfactory, both to student an
author.
   We might naturally expect to find Mr. Jukes-Browne more “at
home” when he comes to deal with the succession of stratified rocks
and their fossils, a subject reserved for his second volume; for he
is perhaps best known to geologists through his successful labours
among the Cretaceous and Post-Tertiary deposits. But a perusal
of the present work enables us to speak in the highest terms of the
wide research and full treatment of the subjects he has now brought
before us. Illustrations are drawn from all parts of the world, and
the author evidently gathers inspiration, as well as many duly
acknowledged explanations, from the works of Lyell, Jukes, A.
Geikie, O. Fisher, and other past and present leaders in Geology.
   Here and there we are disposed to differ in the use of terms or
on theoretical questions. For instance, on p. 67 the author speaks
of “the detrition of a district,” and “the denudation of fresh
rock-surfaces,” when we should transpose the terms. Mr. Jukes
Browne strongly advocates the hypothesis that our Boulder-clay
was chiefly formed by Coast-ice, or, in other words, that it was a
marine deposit formed near ice-clad shores, but always underwater.
It has, however, not been shown that Coast-ice is capable of forming
a comparatively uniform deposit of Boulder-clay spread over a wide
area, usually devoid of any appearance of stratification, and con
taining no marine shells that lived on the spots where their remains
are imbedded.     It is true that the advocates of the formation of
Boulder-clay by land-ice have to be equally guided by inference;
but the frequent contortions and disturbances in beds underlying
Boulder-clay, evidently produced by the agent which formed this
glacial drift, seem to indicate a force more potent and extensive
than coast-ice.
   Mr. Jukes-Browne has, however, taken pains to state the
opinions opposed to those he may express or adopt; and we doubt
not it will be some time before there is unanimity amongst geolo
gists on the subject of the formation of Boulder-clay.
   We should not omit to mention that Prof. T. G. Bonney con
tributes to this work a short chapter on “Original or Igneous
Rocks.” The subject of rocks or of minerals cannot be made
interesting, in the ordinary sense, to the student; nor for that
matter can we say that the present volume is one to be read through
lightly and easily by a general reader. But it is full of facts and
information, and as such is just the work to be appreciated by the
young and earnest student, who desires to learn about volcanoes
and earthquakes, springs, the formation of various deposits, the
structure of rocks, and the origin of hill and valley, mountain, lake,
and river.

   The following communications were read:—
   1. “Note on a Section near Llanberis.” By Professor A. H.
Green, F.G.S.
   In this paper the author described a section showing actual un
conformity at the base of the Cambrian. In one of the cuttings
on the railway that runs from the Dinorwig quarries along the
north-western shore of Llyn Padarn, the basement conglomerate of
the Harlech and Llanberis group, dipping N.W. at a moderate
angle, rests upon vertical flaky beds, one of which is a breccia.

  64                       Geological Society.
  The author believes that the section described is one of which a
  different reading was given by Sir A. Ramsay in the Geological
  Survey Memoir on North Wales. In that work the conglomerate
  was regarded as a continuation of the breccia of the underlying
  beds sharply turned over.
    The microscopic characters of the lower series show that these
 beds are probably coarse volcanic tuffs, and that they resemble the
 rocks at St. David's, called Pebidian by Dr. Hicks. The uncon
 formity observed does not necessarily indicate great difference of
 age between the conglomerate and the underlying beds. In volcanic
  rocks such breaks may be merely local.
    Further north-west, in the same railway section, a junction is
 seen between the Cambrian conglomerate and quartz-felsite.          It is
 uncertain whether the junction is a fault or not. The matrix of
 the conglomerate is chiefly composed of felsite fragments so per
 fectly cemented together as to bear a close superficial resemblance
 to the original rock even under the microscope, unless a high
 power be used.
    2. “The Tertiary Basaltic Formation in Iceland.” By J. Starkie
 Gardner, Esq., F.L.S., F.G.S.
    The country explored stretches from the N.E. corner to the S.W.
 Every locality in which lignite had been met with was visited. The
 most northerly of these, at Húsavik, presents a coast-section showing
 200 feet of tuffs with bands of lignite, 200 feet of the same with
 marine shells, and an immense series of overlying tuffs, which are
 unfossiliferous, and were followed, ten miles further north, to Tjörnes,
 almost within the Arctic Circle.    The shells, a series of which were
 exhibited, indicate a warmer sea, and, in the author's opinion, are of
 an age a little anterior to the Crag. It is hoped that Dr. Gwyn
Jeffreys, who has several times examined them, may pronounce a
 definite opinion in regard to this. A number of sections towards
 the interior were visited, one of the finest being in a cañon near
 Hof, where the sides are upwards of 1000 feet high, and nearly
 vertical, exhibiting an alternation of semicolumnar basalts, ash
 beds, and laterites, capped by rhyolites.    These rhyolites are very
 beautiful, and cap the basalts over a wide area, being themselves
 overlain by other and more irregular streams of basalt and tuffs.
 The country has been subjected to immense denudation, and is cut
 up into rolling flat-topped hills such as characterize basaltic regions
elsewhere.     The horizon from which most, if not all, the fossil
plants from Iceland have been obtained, is that of the rhyolites—
a more recent series than any represented in the British Isles or
even in the Faröes. Their age may have been correctly assigned to
the Miocene.

  ON THE EMPLOYMENT OF MARSH-GAS FOR PRODUCING EXCEED
            INGLY LOW TEMPERATURE.           B.Y. M. CAILLETET.
        To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
        GENTLEMEN,
      HAVE just received the September Number of the Philoso
       phical Magazine, in which I read with surprise a communication
  by Professor J. Dewar claiming the priority for employing marsh
  gas in order to obtain very low temperature. Mr. J. Dewar, to
  prove his claim, alludes to a note published by him in Nature’
  of the 4th of October, 1883, which, he says, “will prove that     my
  experiments with liquid marsh-gas were made a year in advance
  of those made recently by M. Cailletet.”
     It is to be regretted that Mr. J. Dewar, who must be well
  acquainted with the contents of the communications presented by
 me to the French Academy of Sciences on the use of Marsh-gas,
 as well as the date of its presentation, has not spoken of the
 Notice I was obliged to publish a few weeks afterwards to refute
 the unjust claim of priority alleged by M. Wroblewski. This Note
  was deposited by me, closed and sealed,in the hands of the President
 of the French Academy on the 12th of December, 1881, that is to
 say, two years previous to the publication made by Mr. J. Dewar in
 “Nature. The Note was opened at my request and read in the
 Academical Meeting of the 4th of last August. It contains these
 words:—“I am busy working up researches, at this moment, which
 will take me a long time, and will not be published before a
 lengthened period. I have been obliged to speak of the details of
 these researches to several persons; it is therefore quite necessary
 for me to establish early my rights to priority in case any author
 were to take precedence, and for that object I write this note, which
 contains the summary of my work. I am trying to obtain greater
 cold than that obtained until now by scientific men. . . . .
    “By means of a pump, the piston-rod of which is covered with
mercury, preventing thereby air and other injurious impediments,
 I can obtain the liquefaction of great quantities of carbonic acid
and protoxide of nitrogen, as also of marsh-gas and ethylene, whose
critical points are greatly inferior to those of carbonic acid. I
am nearly certain to obtain very low temperature by plunging my
instruments in these liquefied gases. I hope, lastly, to be able to
liquefy oxygen, nitrogen, and other gases completely by refrigera
ting them by means of ethylene or marsh-gas boiling, after having
compressed them in a curved tube by employing the instrument
invented by me and which is well known to the Academy.”
    This Note cannot leave, I trust, any doubt of the priority of my
researches over those of Mr. J. Dewar; and it is certainly owing to
his not having known it that he has published in the Philosophical
Magazine the article which I feel entitled to answer.

  ON THE VALUE OF POIssON's COEFFICIENT FOR CAOUTCHOUC.
                            BY E. H. AMAGAT.
   It is known that scientific men are far from being in agreement
as to the numerical value to be given to what is known as Poisson’s
Cofficient. According to the theories of Poisson, Navier, M. de Saint
Venant, and the experiments of Cagniard de Latour, and of M.
Cornu, this coefficient should be equal to #: according to Wertheim
it is equal to ; ; from the researches of Cauchy, of Lamé, and of
Kirchhoff, all that can be affirmed is that it is between zero
and 4 ; finally, according to MM. Schneebeli and Okatow it varies
not only from one body to another, but also with the same body
according to its physical condition. The latter physicist had the
idea of utilizing the great extensibility of caoutchouc to determine
the coefficient in question by the well-known method; and MM.
Naccari and Bellati have made analogous experiments by Regnault's
method.
   It has been observed with justice that experiments made with
caoutchouc are but little conclusive; they present great irregula
rities, due more especially to permanent deformations; and, on the
other hand, the body has but little homogeneity. It may be added
that the very magnitude of the deformations has put it outside the
theoretical conditions, which suppose the deformations to be very
small.
   I propose to show that by following a totally different path we
may arrive, in the case of caoutchouc, at conclusions which can only
be invalidated by supposing errors of experiment quite out of pro
portion to those which can be really committed.
   In order to make these experiments, and others which are not
concluded, I have had a piezometer made, in which, as in that of
Regnault, the pressure may be transmitted in the interior or on
the exterior at the same time or separately. The apparatus is,
however, double; two spheres or two cylinders may be placed in
it side by side, which are under precisely the same pressure and
at the same temperature-conditions which are very favourable for
rather delicate comparative experiments. This is not the case of
the present experiments, which, as we shall see, do not claim great
accuracy.
   I call o Poisson's coefficient, K the coefficient of cubical compressi
bility, a the coefficient of elongation or the inverse of the coefficient
of elasticity, and A and u the two constants.
   We have the ratios:—
                                           X

    I place in the different apparatus two spheres, one of caoutchouc
 and the other of bronze, which I assume are exactly identical, so
 as to simplify the reasoning; a few millimetres of pressure are
 sufficient to raise the water 300 divisions in the rod of the caout
 chouc sphere; in the other the motion of the meniscus is barely
 perceptible, and it cannot be measured with accuracy. It follows
 from this that (referring to the formula, which gives in this case the
 variation of the internal volume), whatever may be in the case of
  bronze the value of a between zero and 3 (the accented letters refer
  to bronze), a is very great in reference to a'.
    It might be feared that in this case a considerable amount of the
 diminution of volume arises from a change of form; but this first
  operation might be replaced by a direct determination of a by
  means of traction; we obtain the same result. In one of my
  experiments *, was equal to 60,000 in round numbers.
                 cº
     That being so, let us compress internally and externally at the
  same time: according to the formula relative to this case, the
  changes of internal volume will be proportional to K and K';
  K should therefore be very great in comparison with K', the
  compressibility would even be relatively negligible, and the liquid
  should ascend in the stem of the caoutchouc sphere; but nothing
  of this kind takes place: the water sinks whatever be the pressure,
  and gives the inevitable irregularities with caoutchouc. It would be
  difficult to say whether the variation of volume has been greater
  with this body or for bronze, so small is the mean difference; hence
  a is comparable to a', and is perhaps even smaller. It evidently
  follows from this that the ratio (4) can only be satisfied provided
  that   E;%
          – Zor
                  is very small, and therefore a very little different
  from 4.
     Assuming for a' the number 3, we have from the preceding
                           —l
                        or = 1(l -

 Whatever errors may be attributed to want of homogeneity, to
 small deformations, and to permanent deformations, even if the
 results found were double, or even tenfold, it may be said that a
 would still be very little different from , and far higher for
 example than 0.499.
    We may, moreover, by means of general formulae and without
 comparing caoutchouc to another body, arrive at the same conclusion
in different ways, which essentially amount to this: the coefficient
of cubical compressibility is very small, as actual experiment shows;
as moreover it is equal to 3a(1–27), and since a is very great,
1–2a must be very small, and therefore a very near }.
    There is nothing contradictory in this result. It follows from
that and from the ratio (1) that p is very small ; and therefore
from ratio (3) that a is very great: this is in fact the case.
   But here a great difficulty presents itself. The various caout

68            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
choucs which I have examined have all led to the same result; it
would certainly be the same with that which Wertheim used, and
this physicist found, by measuring directly the diminution of cross
section, a = }. Since then MM. Naccari and Bellati have shown, by
Regnault's method, that for the same substance the value of a may
amount to 0.41; but this number satisfies the ratio (4) no better than
that of Wertheim; assuming o'= } it would give 1–2a    II. -
                                                                 0-36

a value quite out of proportion to that which should be found.
   As it is difficult to assume that Wertheim, and then MM.
Naccari and Bellati, have made experimental errors as great as
appears from the preceding-as, on the other hand, there is no
reason why caoutchouc supposed to be homogeneous, and submitted
to small deformations, should not conform to general laws, it may
be asked how far the formulae assumed are really the expression of
these laws. It is not, then, superfluous to submit these formulae
to the test of experiment, following in this the advice given by
Regnault; it is with this object that I have had made the differ
ential apparatus mentioned above ; these researches are in course
of execution.—Comptes Rendus, July 21, 1884.
  ELEMENTARY PHYLLOTAXY. BY PLINY EARLE CHASE, LL.D.”
   I have shownt that the “numerics” of the chemical elements
can be better represented by various phyllotactic divisors than by
Prout's law. Phyllotactic submultiples of the organic elements
C, H, O, N give a mean residual ratio of .05654, while Prout's
law gives 12007, the probable ratio of merely accidental residual
being 18394. This indicates comparative aggregate probabilities
which are represented by the reciprocals of .05654*, '12007", and
‘18394", or by 1999 × 10", 1098 x 10", and 1.
   In the Philosophical Magazine for November 1884, Dr. Edmund
J. Mills gives additional evidences of phyllotactic influence. He
represents all the elementary numerics, except that of hydrogen,
by the equation
                        y=p15–15(.9375)”.
 This introduces the first five numbers of the phyllotactic series
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, being of the form
                     5× 3 p –(5 x 3+2 x 8)"].
The sum of the infinite series which is represented by 15x
(5x3+2× 8)" is the product of the first five phyllotactic numbers,
1x2x3x5 x 8. The series itself is of the form (n+n+1)", thus
representing cumulative harmonic rupturing tendencies, of the
same kind as are shown in the inter-stellar influence upon plane
tary positions (Phil. Mag. September 1884, p. 197).

  ON A NEW FORM OF POLARIZING PRISM.            BY C. D. AHRENS.
   The prism which I desire to bring to the notice of the Society is
intended for use either as a polarizer or an analyzer. It will, I
hope, be found especially useful as an analyzer for the microscope.
   The employment of a Nicol prism above the eye-lens is subject
to the great inconvenience that, owing to the necessary length of
the prism, the eye of an observer is so far removed from the lens
that a portion of the field is cut off. Double-image prisms of the
 usual construction are shorter, but they have another defect, viz.
that the angular separation of the rays is so slight that the eye
 sees both images at once, and some confusion is thus caused.
    My object in constructing this improved prism has been to
 obtain a much wider separation of the two beams of light; so that
 one of them, although not actually removed entirely by total
 reflection (as in the Nicol prism), is so far refracted to one side
 that it may be neglected altogether. I made several attempts to
 construct such a prism some years ago, but failed (as probably
 others have done) owing to the difficulty or impossibility of avoid
 ing distortion and colour, and of obtaining a wide separation of
 the ordinary and extraordinary rays in a prism made up of only
 two pieces of Iceland spar.
    I have now effected the desired object by making the prism of
 three wedges of spar cemented together by Canada
 balsam, as shown in the accompanying drawing (fig. 1).       Fig. 1.
 The  optic axis in  the two outer  wedges is parallel
 the refracting edge, while in the middle wedge it is  to      G
 perpendicular to the refracting edge, and lies in a
 plane bisecting the refracting angle. This disposition
 of the optic axis is the one originally suggested by
 Dr. Wollaston, and has the effect of causing a greater            s
 angular separation of the rays than Rochon's construc-          º
 tion. By the employment of three prisms instead of
 two I am able to give the middle prism a very large           s
 angle, and yet to correct the deviation of the rays so
 far that on emergence they make approximately equal
 angles with the central line of the combination.
    Nearly in contact with one of the terminal faces of the prism
 I place a prism of dense glass of such an angle that it just corrects
 the deviation of one of the rays and also achromatizes it, while it
 increases the deviation of the other ray to such an extent that it
 may be practically disregarded altogether; an eye, even when
 placed almost close to the prism, receiving only the direct beam.
This beam is, of course, perfectly polarized in one plane, and can,
by a proper arrangement of the glass compensator, be rendered
practically free from distortion and colour.
    Other methods of effecting the compensation have suggested
themselves in the course of my work; and I have obtained the
best results by adopting the arrangement represented in fig. 2.

  70          Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
 In this, the glass compensating prism, instead of
 being mounted separately, is cemented upon one of
 the terminal faces of the compound spar-prism; the
 angle of this latter, and also of the other terminal
 face, being suitably modified.
    This seems distinctly preferable to the original
 arrangement, for several reasons.
    1. The total length of the compound prism is
 rather less, being scarcely more than twice its breadth.
    2. The field is rather larger, so that the prism can
 be used over microscope eye-pieces (A and B) without
 any of the field of view being cut off.
    3. The whole arrangement is more compact, all the components
 being firmly cemented together, and therefore not liable to acci
 dental displacement.
    4. There is less loss of light by reflection, the reflecting surfaces
being reduced to two.
    A ray of light entering the prism in a direction parallel to its
axis is divided into two rays; one of which, on emergence, follows
 a course parallel to that of the original incident ray, and is practi
cally free from distortion and colour; the other ray is deviated to
 the extent of about 59° 30' (for yellow sodium-light), being, of
course, strongly coloured and distorted. The angular separation
is so great that this latter ray does not interfere with ordinary
observations.
    I hope that the prism, which has cost me much time and labour,
 will meet with the approval of the Society, and take a place as a
 useful accessory to the microscope and other optical instruments.

ON THE PENETRATION OF DAYLIGHT IN THE WATER OF THE LAKE
            OF GENEWA.        B.Y. M.M. FOL AND ED. SARASIN.
    Questions relating to the absorption of light by more or less
thick layers of the very pure water of the Lake of Geneva have
been the object of a series of experiments, undertaken by a Com
mission of the Société de Physique et d’Histoire naturelle of
Geneva, on the incentive, and under the direction, of M. Louis
Soret”.
    We have been charged more particularly to examine, by means
of photography, the extreme depth which daylight reaches. Our
experiments consisted in exposing a photographic plate at various
depths in that part of the lake where the water is deepest.
   We used Monckhoven's rapid gelatino-bromide plates. They
were placed in a special apparatus designed by one of us for these
experiments+. It consists of a brass photographic back, the two

tions of M. Fol by the Société génevoise d'instruments de Physique.

slides of which are closed by the action of a pair of levers joined
like scissors and drawn by a weight; they separate by the action of
 an antagonistic spring, as soon as the weight of the lead in touching
 the bottom ceases to act on the levers. Knowing the depth, we
 can regulate the length of the line by which the weight is suspended
 to the apparatus, so as to have the photographic plate exposed in a
 horizontal position, at a given distance below the surface of the
 water. After a given exposure the apparatus is withdrawn, and
  rapidly closes under the action of the weight. The time of expo
  sure was ten minutes in all cases. The development was made with
 the normal oxalate-of-iron developer, which was caused to act uni
 formly for ten minutes on each plate. They were all of the same
  lot, and therefore coated with the same emulsion*.
     The experiments were made in front of Evian, where the lake
  has over a large surface a depth of 315 metres. Dr. Marcet was
  kind enough to place at our disposal on two occasions his steam
  yacht, the ‘Heron.” Professor Forel, of Morges, had the goodness
  not only to lend us his sounding-line, but also to accompany us,
  and help us with his advice and his experience.

     3. At 300 metres deep (15 metres from the bottom) a plate at forty

 plate 1. Plate 5 at 170 metres was slightly clouded, almost like plate 9,
 which was exposed at night for 5 minutes. Plate 4 at 147 metres had
 been slightly acted on, more so than the plate which had been exposed at
 night for ten minutes. Of the two plates at 113 metres, the plate 6 of the

 apparatus worked as well as could be desired, and that when closed it could
be left in full sunlight without any light getting to the plate. During
exposure the glass was uppermost and towards the light. On this side
characters and numbers were traced in black varnish. The sharpness
with which these signs were produced in white on the developed plate,
the purity of the edges of the image, which, restricted by the separation
of the covering      #.      only extended to the middle of the sensitive

more affected than plate 4 of the second day, Finally, plate 7, exposed
 at 90 metres, was so acted upon that the lines which had been traced on
i.yer.back were only imperfectly seen on the dark ground of the developed
    Comparing the results obtained on the two days of the experi
 ments, we are struck by the fact that the photographic action
 was greater on the 23rd September than on the 16th August.
    We are thus led to conclude from these first attempts;
    1. That daylight penetrates into the water of the Lake of Geneva
 to a depth of 170 metres, and probably further; that at this depth
the illumination in full daylight is just comparable to that which
 we observe on a fine night when there is no moon.
    2. That at 120 metres the light is still very strong.
    3. That in September, in cloudy weather the light penetrates in
larger quantity and to a greater depth than in August, in perfectly
bright weather. Further experiments will have to decide whether
this difference is to be attributed to the greater transparency of
water in autumn and in winter, which the experiments of M. Forel"
have put beyond doubt, or whether the light diffused from the
clouds penetrates further than the more or less oblique rays of
the sun.
    Previous to our experiments, M. Aspert had exposed gelatino
bromide plates in the Lake of Zurich at depths varying from 40 to
90 metres. He immersed them at night, and withdrew them the
following night. But the darkest night is still bright for a rapid
gelatino-bromide plate. Our experiments seem then to be made
under more trying circumstances. We intend to pursue these
experiments in the summer of 1885.
   We are desirous also, if possible, of making analogous experi
ments in the sea, where the greater transparency of the water leads
to the supposition that the extreme limit of the luminous rays is at
a still lower level.
   In this respect satisfactory data are wanting, for the experiments
of the cruise of the “Porcupine' have remained in the state of
project, as the apparatus devised by Sir W. Siemens refused to act.
The depth to which daylight penetrates in the sea is therefore still
to be found.—Comptes Rendus, Nov. 10, 1884.
   * M. Forel investigated from 1873 the transparency of the waters of the
Lake of Geneva by a       Pºlº          method; he employed, however, albu
minized silver paper, which is less sensitive than gelatino-bromide. He
immersed the sheets at night at various depths, and took them out after one
or several twenty-four hours. This method gave for the limit of absolute
darkness approximately 45 metres in summer and 100 metres in winter.
The greater abundance of aquatic powders during summer, which is
the cause of the greater opacity, is due to the thermal stratification of
water during ... season, from which results the power of holding in
suspension powders of different densities (Archives des Sciences physiques
et naturelles, vol. lix. p. 137, 1877).

  To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
     GENTLEMEN,
BºORE attempting to draw rigorous experimental con
       clusions as to the effect of the magnetic properties of
Iron and Steel on electromagnets made of these metals, it is
necessary to obtain some further information as to the mag
netic properties in question.
   #. I have accepted the results of Rowland's experi
ments with rings"; but }. now repeated and varied these
experiments, with special regard to the following points:—
   To find the average properties assigned by this method to
the Iron and Steel I commonly use;
   To assign to the results formulae of a more general and
more manageable type than that employed by Rowland;
   And to justify experimentally the assumption that the per
meability, as calculated from the experiments, is independent
of the size and proportions of the rings examined.
   A new theory of these magnetic properties will be enun

   The iron upon which most of the following experiments
have been made is what is called ordinary bar-iron. It is
what I commonly use for electromagnets. It is moderately
soft and admits of being easily forged. It is stamped with a

74          Mr. R. H. M. Bosanquet on the Magnetic
crown, and I shall speak of it as crown iron. One ring of
best Lowmoor has also been examined.
    The steel ring J was forged from the remainder of the bar
of cast steel from which the divided magnet was made, which
is called A in my paper I, on Permanent Magnets (Phil. Mag.
August 1884, p. 142). It was first examined soft, and then
after hardening.
    The method employed was substantially that of Rowland.
 The rings were uniformly wound with coils through which
 the magnetizing current was transmitted. The current em
 ployed was a small derived current from the circuit of the
 dynamo machine; so that it could be opened, closed, or
 reversed without upsetting the main circuit. The current
 was measured by means of two galvanometers of Helmholtz's
 pattern, the one having two coils, the other eighteen. The
 galvanometers were always erected on the brick stand which
 forms the standard position for which values of H are deter
 mined in the laboratory.
     The observations were all made by reversal.
     A number of induction-coils, varying from 250 to 1, were
 wound round the ring to be examined. In circuit with these
 coils were the ballistic galvanometer and the earth induction
 coil, for the reduction of the readings to absolute measure.
     Two earth induction-coils were employed. The first had
 21 turns, with a mean diameter of 51°30 centim.; the other
 250 turns, with a mean circumference of 166:53 centim. With
 both of these coils the impulse of the galvanometer due to
 half a turn about a vertical axis in the standard position" was
 about 7°. But in the case of the larger coil, a <U+017F>º COr
 responds to about twelve times as great an induction as with
 the smaller coil, so that a very large range is secured. The
 galvanometer has a circular scale which reads, by reflection,
 directly to 5' and by estimation to single minutes.
     The mode of calculation adopted is precisely equivalent to
  that of Rowland. Rowland’s Mis current-turns per unit length,
  –   p in our notation. Then his expression connecting Au,
 the permeability, with the total number of lines of force is,
                   lines of force    =41% A(TR”);
 and for the magnetic induction, or lines of force per unit area,
    * The positions of rest between which the half turn is made are such
  that the plane of the coil is at right angles to the magnetic meridian.
 Hence the coil cuts the lines of force of H twice in the half turn.

 though of course the form and the letters Rowland uses are

    The whole process of calculation of an experiment is
 embodied in the following formulae.
    Let a be the deflection of the ballistic galvanometer due to
 reversal, with m induction-coils; then
                           2m Sll = ka
 (S = sectional area of bar).
    Let 3 = deflection due to half turn of earth induction-coil
 (N = number of coils, A = mean area); then
                          2NAH=r8.
 Combining these, we have
                                2 NAH
                         *=##.
    Let G be that part of the tangent-galvanometer coefficient
 which is independent of H, so that we have for the current
                          C= GH tan 8.

    First, as to the saturation-value. In nearly all the rings of
  Crown iron the saturation-value of the                        iº is under
  18,000, although in ring Fit appears to exceed 19,000. This
  agrees generally with Rowland’s result as to rings.
    In my paper on Electromagnets (Phil. Mag. xvii. p. 532) I
  have shown that in the case of the two bars there examined
  thºsaturation-values were higher, and did not appear to give
  evidence of having any fixed limit. This seems intelligible

 80          Mr. R. H. M. Bosanquet on the Magnetic
when we remember that in the bar the lines of force are
crowded closely only at the equatorial section.
    The formula by which Rowland represented his results was
of the type
         Yp           a-Asia (*****},
in which A, C, D, and a are constants depending upon the
 kind and quality of the metal used. This type of formula is
unmanageable; and it seemed to me necessary to attempt a
 more direct expression of the facts.
    Rowland’s formula offers the suggestion that we may regard
 values of u which occur in these experiments as corresponding
 to the first half of a periodic change, the whole of which would
be completed for a value of l; corresponding to about twice
the saturation-value. This being so, it is theoretically pos
 sible, according to Fourier's theorem, to express any set of
 the experimental values of p. by a series of sines and cosines
 of an angle proportional to the induction and of the multiples
of that angle; and the only difficulty is to find the coefficients
 of the different terms of the series.
    Unfortunately the distribution of the values obtained does
not admit of the application of the simplest form of harmonic
analysis; so that the accurate determination of the coefficients
is attended with a good deal of difficulty; and after trial of
various methods of solution of equations, including an extended
application of the method of least squares, it was found that
a process of trial and error was capable of giving better results
than could be obtained in any other way.
    The representations thus obtained are not in all cases very
close, but they are quite sufficient to show, by comparison of
the different rings of the same iron, the uselessness of attempt
ing to define minutely the properties of a given kind of iron.
For the analysis of the different sets these are as valuable, on
account of the clearness of the expressions, as the representa
tions founded on my subsequent theory, which are as close or
closer.                                           -
   As to the size of the rings. There are five rings of crown
iron, E, F, G, H, K. Of these, E, H have approximately the
same mean diameter; F, G, K have mean diameters rather
more than twice as great. H, K have about the same bar
thickness, E, F bar-thickness nearly twice as great, and G a
bar-thickness between three and four times as great. But when
we examine the expressions for u, we fail to find any syste
matic differences which appear to correspond with these dif
ferences in the dimensions. So that, so far as this small
number of experiments goes, the fundamental suppositions are

                    Permeability of Iron and Steel.                     81
 justified in leading to values of a independent of the dimen
 sions of the rings.
    It is a question of particular interest whether the iron in
 the interior of thick bars is in any degree shielded by that
 which encloses it from the effects of magnetic potential. In
 rings we have this question detached from the complications
 caused by the ends of straight bars or tubes, and are face to
 face with the simple question:—Is magnetic potential so ab
 sorbed in its passage through external layers of iron that its
 effect in the interior is sensibly diminished ?
     To answer this question it is convenient to make use of the
 ordinary expression for magnetizing force (= 13 in the above
 tables), and to tabulate the values of the induction in the dif
 ferent rings corresponding to a series of definite values of the
  magnetizing-force. If, then, there is absorption of the force
  in the external layers, the inside of the thickest rings should
  be the most shielded, and the induction should throughout be
  lower in those rings for the same magnetizing force.
     An inspection of the following Table will show that, if any
  thing, the reverse of this is the case.

     The thickest ring, G, has the highest inductions throughout.
The thinnest rings fall a little behind on the whole, except in
the initial values. It seems probable that this may be due to
slight flaws of small surface-extent, which may not percep
tibly impair the magnetic conductivity of the thick ring, but
may interfere with that of the thin ring. At all events the
hypothesis of shielding is conclusively negatived.
    Returning to the general tables, the variations which strike

82          Mr. R. H. M. Bosanquet on the Magnetic
us most are those in the initial values of p and those in the
coefficient of sin 6. We can only conclude, either that the
iron is of very variable quality, or that the forging of the
rings is liable to introduce these large discrepancies.
   I may mention here that, in accordance with Rowland's
direction, a coating of at least of an inch was removed in
the lathe from the rings after forging. The ring K was
turned out of the very heart of a forged ring originally nearly
four times its ultimate thickness.
   The Lowmoor iron ring shows low initial permeability and
a high saturation-point. In both respects it much resembles
ring F, but the maximum permeability of the Lowmoor is
greater than that of F, though considerably less than that of
E or G; in fact the differences due to the type of iron appear
inconsiderable compared with the differences between different
rings of the same iron.
   The soft steel ring presents very remarkable results. First
we notice that the saturation-point is decidedly high ; that is
to say, by the employment of sufficient force, as shown by the
low values of the permeability, the induction in the soft steel
was actually raised to over 18,000.
   The initial permeability is about one third of the average
value for soft iron ; the maximum permeability about one
fifth of the average value for soft iron. But the strangest
thing of all is that the variable part of the permeability appears
to be completely represented      I. a single term involving the
sine of the angle proportional to the induction, so that the
maximum permeability corresponds to an induction of about
9000 instead of to an induction of between 5000 and 6000
as is usual in soft iron.
   In the case of the hard steel ring the power employed was
insufficient to force the steel up to its saturation-point, and
before the ring could be re-examined with a larger number of
windings the tubes of the boiler broke down and put a sto
to work for the present. But the observations already jºi.
are very fairly represented by a formula which would give a
high saturation-point. The initial permeability is less than
one half that of the soft steel. . The maximum permeability is
about one third that of the soft steel, and it corresponds to a
somewhat lower value of the induction than in soft iron,
instead of to a higher value as in soft steel ; that is to say,
what we may . the octave term (sin 26), which vanishes
for the soft steel, has for the hard steel the *}.
value that occurs in any of the rings examined. The physical
meaning of this will be given us by my new theory.
   In Rowland's paper above referred to he observes that it is

                     Permeability of Iron and Steel.                      83
probable that Weber's theory may be so modified as to give
an equation of the type he employs. I am not aware that
this has been      º            and it seems improbable on account
of the nature of the equation. Further it is clear that the
functions involved are continuous through the whole range
of the magnetization. And the essence of Weber's theory
and of all modifications of it is to divide the course of events
into separate portions, in which different causes are supposed to
operate, and different expressions are obtained for the results.
    The statement that the results are continuous applies to
the residual subpermanent magnetism as well as to that ob
tained by reversal; for although I have not made any deter
minations of residual magnetism, the data in Rowland's
table I. are sufficient to give a series of values of residual
magnetism which determine the point. Using the same
angle proportional to the total induction for 6, we can find a
new quantity u', which we may call susceptibility to residual
magnetism.
     The following table gives the results of this process as

  84         Mr. R. H. M. Bosanquet on the Magnetic
     There is a slight discontinuity here near the maximum
  value of pº'; but nothing to obscure the general applicability
  of a continuous formula.
     We note that the initial value of A', though small, is by no
  means evanescent; that the curve formed by u' as ordinate
  and l3 as abscissa rises very steeply at starting; that u<U+017F>
  has a maximum value equal to nearly two thirds of the maxi
  mum value of p. ; and that, although the position of this
  maximum of a<U+017F> is somewhat obscured by the small dis
  continuity above referred to, yet it is substantially in the
 same position as the maximum of u.
    On the whole, then, the facts are incompatible with those
 with which Weber's theory and Maxwell’s modification of it
 are framed to correspond; and it will be of interest to
 consider whether there be any hypothesis by which these facts
 can be represented.
    Prof. Hughes has recently put forward a theory, the funda
 mental supposition of which appears to be identical with that
 of the theory of Weber; but }cannot find that it has been
 applied so as to give any quantitative account of magnetizing
 functions or permeabilities.
    I will now give an illustration of the suppositions as to
 molecular magnets, which would have to be made, in order
 that the principal term of the permeability may be propor
 tional to the sine of an angle whose zero corresponds ap
 proximately to the zero of magnetic induction, and 180° to
 saturation, the angle being proportional to magnetic induc
 tion in between. The resulting theory is of an impossible
 character.
    Let a typical molecule be represented by a small Inagnet
 hung by a torsion-wire at the centre of a coil, and let the
 magnet be placed so that when no current is passing it
 stands nearly at right angles to the plane of the coil, but
 with the poles in the opposite direction to that which the
action of the coil tends to make them assume. Suppose, then,
 that a current is sent through the coil; the needle will be
deflected, and will rest, at the point where the deflecting
couple on the needle is balanced by the torsion of the
wire. Now the couple due to the coil may be expressed as
GC sin 6; where C is the current, G a constant, and 6 the
deflection from a position at right angles to the coil. The
torsion may be represented by T(0–2), where 2 is small; or
approximately by Tó, whence we have for the position of
rest
                          T0= GC sin 6.

                  Permeability of Iron and Steel.              85
    Let 6, or the rotation, represent the magnetic induction.
 It is clear that, however great C may be, it can never tend
 to increase 6 beyond 180°, since this is the position in
 which the coil tends to place the needle independently of the
 torsion: this represents saturation. Further, § is proportional
 to the magnetic potential or magnetizing force, so that C is
 proportional to p, and    {=}|sin   6; so that p is represented
 approximately by a quantity proportional to the sine of an
 *        roportional to the induction.
          e fundamental ideas of this illustration could be in
 any way applied to the behaviour of systems of molecules, it
 would be easy, by small modifications of the principal sup
 positions, to take count of the smaller terms; but it seems
 quite impossible to carry out this application; and the illus
 tration is only useful as showing the sort of circumstances
  which would have to be imagined in order to obtain a
  formula of this sort from the hypothesis of molecular mag
  nets.
     I will proceed to sketch another theory which appears to
  me more reasonable, and leads to forms of function by which
  we can represent the experiments very well.
     Suppose that every molecule of iron has one axis, and only
  one axis, through which magnetism can be transmitted.
     The molecules in an inert mass of iron are supposed to have
  their axes of transmission distributed in all directions. There
  will then be a very small proportion of molecules whose axes
  are so situated as to form continuous lines of transmissibility
  for magnetic lines of force proceeding in a given direction.
  Thus, for small magnetizing forces there will be a small trans
  missibility or permeability.
     In the case in which molecules are so situated that the
 extremities of their axes do not join, the magnetic lines of
 forge have to pass between the molecules as they would through
 ordinary space. We suppose that the transmissibility through
 the axes of the molecules is very great compared with that in
 ordinary space or in the interstices of the molecules.
    As the magnetic induction increases, couples are established
 by the action of the lines of force, which tend to move the
#.       of the molecules towards the direction of the lines of
 Orce.
    Consider a single molecule. Let the plane of the paper
cut it in     the plane containing its magnetic transmission axis
and the axis of magnetization. Then the lines of force will
traverse the molecule somewhat in the way shown in the

 to the mean axis of magnetization, where they issue from the
 molecule.
    Now it is known that many magnetic phenomena may be
 expressed by the hypothesis of a tension along the lines of
 force. If we suppose such a tension to exist here, we have
 a couple whose force is equal to the tension, and arm equal to
 the diameter of the molecule x sin 6, tending to turn the axis
 of the molecule towards the axis of magnetization. If we
 suppose the molecules to give way to this force, the ends of
 the axes of the successive molecules approach each other, and
 the intermediate space, as well as the number of molecules,
 required to be traversed is diminished. This accounts for
 the increase of the permeability in the first part of the range
 of the induction.                      -
     Without attempting to frame exact hypotheses we can see
  generally that the whole magnetic resistance may be ex
  pressed by "..."; the lines of force to form a zigzag, the
  obliquity of which diminishes as the tension of the lines of
  force increases. . From this representation, assuming a law
  similar to Ohm's law for electric circuits, we get the expression

          as representing the reduced resistance of a length l of
  the magnetic substance, 8 being an auxiliary angle represent
  ing the mean obliquity of the zigzag. We have further to
  take into account the fact that all forms of iron and steel are
  capable of transmitting only a limited amount of magnetic
  induction      º       a given area. In the absence              º:

assume a factor in the permeability which vanishes for the
saturation-value, namely     &      –$3), where 13, is the saturation
value of the induction. The resistance will then be propor
tional to the reduced length divided by this factor, so that

Or                       A-A(l; ... — 13) cos 8.
    We may give some further account of the factor (13. –$)
based on an analogy between the lines of magnetic force and
 solid wires. If a number of thin wires had to be packed into
 a cylindrical tube, by the time there were a certain number of
 them the hollow of the tube would be full, and no more could
 be got in. Also, if there were a less number, the space avail
 able in the tube would be measured by the number of wires
 that could still be added.
    Now if our axis of transmission in the molecule represent
 the hollow tube, and the lines of force the wires, it is reason
 able to assume that the permeability is proportional to the
 portion of the channel left open and unoccupied. And this
 is precisely given by (13. – $3). It is only an analogy, but it
 seems to me not destitute of force. We may call (l; ... — 13)
 “defect of saturation.”
     Let us return to the consideration of the equilibrium of
 the molecule. On the one hand we have the couple exerted
 by the lines of force; on the other that arising from molecular
 attachments, which tends in the opposite direction.
     The simplest law of molecular attachments is the law of
 torsion; and in considering a single molecule I assume that
 the couple tending to restore it to its place is proportional
 to the angular rotation from the position of rest. (The dis
 placements of subpermanent and permanent magnetism are
 at first left out of the question.) }: therefore

    * I assume that the tension along the lines of force is proportional to

 88          Mr. R. H. M. Bosanquet on the Magnetic
 expresses the condition of equilibrium ; o is the unit angle, so
 that op is ºp expressed in degrees.
    If we pass from the consideration of a single molecule to
 that of a molecular arrangement we are confronted with
 problems which, for the most part, must be regarded as
 insoluble. One point, however, is clear.
    If the axes of the molecules are arranged uniformly in all
 directions, the average inclination to any one line is 60°.
    For we may suppose the axes of transmissibility uniformly
 distributed over the surface of each hemisphere, and the hemi
 sphere is divided into two equal portions by a cone whose
 semi-vertical angle is 60°.
    If therefore we represent the condition of the average
 molecule with respect to inclination by a single molecule, we
 must assume the initial inclination to the axis of magneti
 zation to be 60°.
    And, in the above expression, when 6=0, op=60°; so
that op=60°–06. And the equation becomes,
                         *=;k 60°–06.
                                    sin 6
   It only remains to connect 6 with the auxiliary angle 8.
In the absence of exact knowledge of the molecular arrange
ments, the only thing we can do is to assume the simplest
connection possible. We shall assume
                             8= f0,
where f is a factor. We thus obtain the system of equations,

This system of equations involves only the arbitrary constants
A, 13., f, and   ;  for 60° cannot be called arbitrary. The
equations are capable of representing very well the connection
between u and l3. The Fourier's series are in some respects
more flexible. But these equations are important as regards
their physical bearing. As the computations present some
difficulty, I here give a systematic scheme for adapting these
equations to the representation of experimental series of values
of 13 and A.

o(6–62), offers a means of estimating the true value of A,
for which the maximum of a given by the equations corre
sponds to the proper value of 13. But the convergence of the

for the estimation, unless close approximation has been already

where one accent refers to the first of two assumptions, two to
the second.
   Before this way of estimating A was devised, the only way
of approximating to it was to carry out the whole calculation
of u from $3 for each assumed value of A, and then judge
from the results. It was soon seen that the representations
obtained differed in the position of the maximum of u. The
following correspondences were thus obtained for ring E:—
       Assumed.                Value of 33 for which p is

            # . . . Before 6400, a little too early.
An accurate judgment could be formed by the correspondences.
of u before and behind the maximum.
   The application of the above method saved the great labour
of these complete computations by way of trial.
   It is necessary to repeat the above processes until the
resulting value of of 8–8,) is sensibly zero. The quantities f
and  k obtained in the computation which satisfies this con
dition are taken on for the final process.
   The next thing is to form the table connecting $3 and 6,
from equation (3). This is most conveniently done by form
-                     60°–06
ing a table of logº              once for all, for each degree from
about 20° to 60°". The addition of these logarithms to that
of k gives the values of 13 corresponding to the degrees of w8.

   This table (13,6) is written out, with differences. The
values of off corresponding to the experimental values of $3
are then found by interpolation.                           -
   Multiplying off by j, we find w8 corresponding to each
experimental value of l;.
    With A, w8, and 13, u is calculated from equation (1) for
 each experimental number 13.

the soft steel.

    As to the question whether the tension of the lines of
force is proportional to l; or to l89, it is a question for ex
periment, and I shall take an early opportunity of endeavouring
to decide it. But in the mean time it appears quite clear that
 if lines of force mean anything, it is that their number is
proportional to the force. Consider a magnet-pole. We may
represent the distribution of force about it either by the law
of the inverse square of the distance, or by a system of lines
of force radiating from the pole. If the two are equivalent,
it involves the consequence that the force at any point is
proportional to the number of lines of force.
 XII. The Influence of an Electric Current in Modifying the
    Rate of Thinning of a Liquid Film. Ily Prof. A. W.
    REINoLD, F.R.S., and Prof. A. W. Rücker, F.R.S."
 IN 1877       the results of some experiments made by us on
        liquid films were published in the Proceedings of the
 Royal Society (Proc. Roy...Soc., No. 182, 1877). One object
 of the investigation was the determination of the electrical
 resistance of the films. The method of Wheatstone's Bridge
 was employed for this purpose, and the current was passed
 through a film only at the moment when an observation was
 required. Under these circumstances the films generally
 thinned until they became black; and we succeeded in obtaining
 several measures of their resistance when this colour was dis
 played. Subsequently this method was abandoned for another,
 in which continuous currents were passed through the film,
 and the difference of potential between two fine wires thrust
 into it was measured by an electrometer, and compared with
 that between two other points in the same circuit separated
 by a known resistancet.
   Although in many respects a great improvement, this method
was in one point inferior to that previously employed. The
behaviour of the films, was very irregular when compared
with that of those previously examined by the galvanometer,
although they were formed of a liquid having i. Sanne COin
position. Sometimes they thinned rapidly, sometimes slowly;

       Electric Current on the Thinning of a Liquid Film.      95
 at one time the black would appear after a comparatively short
 interval; at another, the film would persist for many hours
 without showing a trace of black. As at this time our atten
 tion had not been directed to the possible influence of the
 current itself in modifying the rate of thinning of the film, no
 special precautions were taken with regard to the current,
 either as to its direction or intermittence ; but we now know
 that the apparently capricious behaviour of the films observed
on many occasions was largely, if not entirely, due to want of
method in managing the current.
   We have recently made some experiments with the definite
object of determining the effect upon a liquid film of passing
through it a current of electricity. Some of the results
obtained were communicated to Section A of the British
Association at the Montreal meeting. We propose to give in
this paper a somewhat more detailed account of our obser
vations.
   The liquid employed consisted either of a solution of potash
soap in water, or of Plateau's liquide glycérique, containing a
certain proportion of nitre to increase its conductivity. The
films had the form of vertical cylinders, the upper and lower
ring supports being of platinum, and about 33 millim. in
diameter. The cylinders were generally either 30 or 40
millim. long. Occasionally other lengths were employed.
Three films were under examination at the same time; two
being in one glass box, the third in a separate glass box.
The two that were together were supported by platinum rings
identically alike and sharply bevelled at the edge; the edges
of the supports of the third were much thicker and were
rounded. We had thus the means of ascertaining whether
any difference in the behaviour of the films was due to the
form or thickness of their supports. No such difference was
observed.
   Each of the film-boxes was placed in the centre of a water
tank with glass sides, in order to prevent rapid changes of
temperature. In all cases the films were surrounded with air
saturated with the vapour of the liquid of which they were
made. The constancy of the hygrometric state of the air,
and that of its temperature were indicated respectively by a
hair-hygrometer and a thermometer inside the glass case.
    The films were blown with air which was first dried and
 then passed over some of the soap-solution in a wide tube.
 The state of the air inside the film was thus approximately
 the same as that on the outside.
    In the earlier experiments a battery of nine Leclanché cells
 was used, the electromotive force of which was about 12 volts.

96 Professors Reinold and Rücker on the Influence of an
More recently we have employed the current from a Siemens'
dynamo. The current passed through a sensitive reflecting
galvanometer, the deflection on the scale measuring approxi
mately the strength of the current. This varied from about
100 microampères to half a microampère.
   We began our experiments by observing the behaviour of
a number of films, each 40 millim. long, formed of potash
soap solution without any glycerine, which were allowed to
thin in the ordinary way, no current passing through them.
In less than a minute after the adjustment of the film to the
cylindrical form narrow rings of colour appeared, and white
of the first order of Newton’s rings was soon seen at the top,
generally bordered by a narrow band of deep blue, the blue
of the second order.     The coloured bands did not extend
beyond 10 miliim. from the top, the rest of the film being
colourless.   This was the state of the case at the end of five or
six minutes. In from eight to fifteen minutes from the moment
of formation of the film a black ring appeared and slowly
extended downwards. Nine films were examined, and all
behaved substantially in the same way.
  We now tried the effect of passing a current through the films.
It is unnecessary to describe all the observations that were
made, as the object of many of them was merely to obtain
confirmation of previous results. A few typical cases may be
described.
     i. Downward Current.      Plain Potash-soap Solution.
   (1) Film 40 millim. long. A current was passed through
from the moment of its formation.         Broad bands of colour
formed and spread with great rapidity, soon occupying the
whole area of the film.     After six minutes the current was
2.6 microampères (m.a.). In eleven minutes there was a ring
of black, which in two minutes more increased to 3 millim.
The current was then stopped.
   It appears from this and a number of other experiments
made in the same way that the effect of the downward current
is to promote the thinning of the film. The bands are broader
and spread out more rapidly than when no current is applied.
   (2) A film 40 millim. long had thinned until 2.5 millim. of
black were formed. Next to the black came a band of deep
blue. . A downward current of 5:18 m.a. was applied. The
blue changed to white, the black not being altered. After
nine minutes the black was still of about the same breadth and
the white had increased to 16 millim, the current being now
4.06 m.a. In two minutes after breaking the circuit the white

       JElectric Current on the Thinning of a Liquid Film.     97
had changed to black, the extent of which had become 19
millim., i. e. nearly half the length of the film.
    The change from white to black in an experiment such as
this is very striking : the black does not begin at the top and
spread downwards as might have been expected, but the whole
area of the white passes by insensible gradations into black,
and it is difficult to say at times whether it is black or white.
This intermediate condition between black and white can
generally be obtained by accelerating the thinning of a film
by a downward current until white has been formed, and
then breaking the circuit and leaving the film to itself.
    This and similar observations show that a downward current
has the remarkable effect of rapidly thinning that part of the
film which is thicker than the black; but does not necessarily
affect the latter. The film is, however, put into such a con
dition that, on the cessation of the current, the development of
the black proceeds at a rapid rate.
     (3) A film 40 millim. long had a ring of black 2.5 millim.
 in breadth at the top. A downward current of 6.2 m.a. was
 applied. In one minute the black entirely disappeared, being
 replaced by white. The current rose to 6.5 m.a.
     The conditions in this case appear to be nearly the same as
 in the last. In each there are 2.5 millim. black, and the
 strength of current applied is about the same. Never
 theless in the latter the effect is to destroy the black and
 increase the conductivity of the film.
     This is to be explained as follows:—When a film is formed
 between metal supports, the thin portion of the film is not
 immediately in contact with the metal. There is between
 them a thick ring of liquid of variable length, and from this
  the film proper hangs. As the film thins this massive ring of
  liquid is maintained more or less unaltered. Experiments
  were made with supports of various materials, shapes, and
  thicknesses, with the object of determining whether these had
  any marked effect on the mode or rate of thinning of the films.
  Glass, iron, and platinum have been used, and the edges of the
  supports made |. and rounded or finely bevelled. Although
   a thick and rounded edge would support a larger quantity of
   liquid than a sharp edge, the thinning of the films seemed
   little influenced by these modifications. When therefore a
   downward current is passed through a film having a certain
   area of black immediately depending from a ring of thick
   liquid, the current, carrying matter with it, soon floods the
    black with liquid and causes it to appear first grey and then
    White, its thickness and therefore its conductivity increasing.
    In the same way may be explained the fact that when a down

  98 Professors Reinold and Rücker on the Influence of an
 ward current flows through a film from the moment of its
 formation, although the film thins more or less rapidly to the
 white of the first order, it generally does not show the black
 so soon as it would have done if no current had been flowing.
  So long as a thick liquid fringe remains on the upper support,
 liquid is being carried downwards and the film prevented from
 thinning beyond a certain limit. As soon as the circuit is
 broken this downward passage of liquid ceases, and the white
 of the first order rapidly thins to black. The fact that the
 current sometimes does and sometimes does not destroy the
 black may be understood by reflecting that the increase or
 decrease in the thickness of any part of the film depends upon
 whether the quantity of matter carried into it exceeds or falls
 short of that transported away from it in the same time. Since
 both these effects are produced in part by gravity and in
 part by the action of the current, and are also probably
 modified by the thickness of the different parts of the film,
 it is possible that very slight differences in the conditions of
 the experiment may determine which of the two shall obtain
 the predominance.
    (4) Film 30 millim. long. A downward current of 24 m.a.
 applied from the beginning. In ten minutes the white ex
 tended more than halfway down, and the current fell to 2.5 m.a.
 The circuit was then broken.       The white turned to black so
 rapidly that in less than one minute the entire transformation
was effected.                                                   -
    In this case, the film being shorter, the same battery gave
a stronger current, and the changes due to the current were
accelerated.
   We will now describe a few typical cases of the action of
an upward current.
       ii. Upward Current. Plain Potash-soap Solution.
    (1) Film 40 millim. long. Current (9.2 m.a.) applied
from the beginning. In twenty-four minutes there was a
narrow band of white at the top succeeded by a narrow band
of indigo-blue. Faint uniform tint below. The film was
left for three quarters of an hour, but no black appeared.
The current fell to 1.95 m.a.     We have evidence here of the
retarding action of the current, as the film would have ex
hibited black in ten or twelve minutes had there been no
current. The current was too feeble to produce more marked
changes.
   (2) Film 40 millim. long. There were 3 millim. of black
and three millim. of white immediately below. An upward
current of 4.9 m.a. was used. The lower edge of the black

       Electric Current on the Thinning of a Liquid Film.     99
became blurred and indistinct, and in two minutes the black
had disappeared, white taking its place. The current rose to
5:32 m.a. The circuit was then broken. Three millim. of black
having been formed in seven minutes, the current was again
put on (C=42 m.a.). The fuzziness at the edge reappeared
at once, and in two minutes the black was all gone. The
current rose to 4.62 m.a.
    (3) Film 19 millim. long, entirely black from top to bottom.
Upward current of 3.12 m.a. put on. In thirty-eight minutes
the current rose to 4-23m.a., and the film was white throughout.
    (4) Film 30 millim. long. Black appeared in ten minutes.
When it had increased to 5 millim. the circuit was completed.
C = 5:05 m.a. In one minute all the black had disap
peared, and in two minutes more the film had a uniform tint
throughout, while the current rose to 14.5 m.a.
    (5) Film 30 millim. long. Upward current passed through
from the beginning. It was not measured at first, but after
five minutes its strength was 20 m.a. This increased to 28.5
m.a., which was maintained for several minutes, after which
it slowly fell. The film was colourless.
    The ring of liquid on the upper platinum support was seen
to increase in thickness and to become wavy along its lower
 edge. Pendent drops were formed, pointed at the bottom,
 and hanging from the liquid fringe.
 From the points of the drops tiny
 streamlets were seen flowing down the
 film. This is a very remarkable experi
 ment. The up-current not only retards
 the thinning, but actually increases
 the thickness of the film. The strength
 of the current was not observed at
first; but from the moment when it
 was observed until it reached its maxi
 mum it increased by over 40 per cent.,
 and the thickness of the film must
 have increased in nearly the same proportion. In opposition
 to gravity the current carries liquid to the top of the film,
 where it accumulates and from which it descends in liquid
 Weins.
    The phenomena mentioned above recurred in several other
 films similarly treated. In some cases the film lasted long
 enough after the circuit was broken for black to be formed
 and to extend to a considerable depth; and the curious
  spectacle was exhibited of pendent drops of thick colourless
 liquid penetrating through the black to a distance varying
  from $ millim. to 9% millim.

 100          Mr. G. F. Fitzgerald on the Rotation
    (6) Film 30 millim, long. When the black, which appeared
 in ten minutes, had increased to 14 millim. a current was
 passed. C= 1.9 m.a. In five minutes the black was reduced
 to 8 millim., and then the film broke. This shows that even
 a feeble current is, at certain stages of a film's existence,
 sufficient to destroy the black.
    (7) The last case we may mention was one in which two
 films, each 30 millim. long, were formed side by side. The
current from the battery was divided and passed up one and
down the other film. The effect was most striking. In twelve
minutes, when one of the films broke, there were 15 millim.
of black in the one, while the other was thick and colourless
and liquid was streaming from the top of it.
   The experiments cited above were made with a solution of
potash-soap (Brit. Pharm.) without any glycerine. The ad
vantage of using such a solution is that the films formed with
it grow thin with tolerable rapidity, and in the course of two
or three hours several films may be observed with each appa
ratus. Similar experiments were carried out with liquide
glycérique (made both with oleate of soda and potash-soap).
The results were identical in kind with those enumerated
above, but very different in degree. Films made with this
solution are very persistent, but thin slowly. Generally three
or four hours elapsed before any black appeared; and when a
current was passed through, its effect was not so promptly
manifested as in the case of the plain soap solution. The
addition of nitrate of potassium may be partly accountable for
this sluggishness, for it certainly increases the viscosity of the
liquid. Nevertheless a great number of films made of the
glycerine solution were observed, with currents flowing up
or down. The effect of the downward current was invariably
to promote, of the upward current to retard, the thinning of
the film.
  XIII. On the Rotation of the Plane of Polarization of Light
             by Reflection from the Pole of a Magnet.
   To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
                                             Trinity College, Dublin,
      GENTLEMEN,                               December 27, 1884.
     ROF. A. KUNDT, in his paper translated from the Berlin
      Sitzungsberichte into the October number of the Phi
losophical Magazine does me the honour of noticing the
theoretical explanation I have given (R. S. Proc. xxv, p. 447)
of the rotation of the plane of polarization of light by reflection

             of the Plane of Polarization of Light.            101
from the pole of a magnet. From the way in which he writes
of my theory being refuted by his experiments, it is plain that
he is unacquainted with my paper “On the Electromagnetic
Theory of the Reflection and Refraction of Light” (R. S.
Trans. 1880, part ii. p. 691), in which the following sentences
occur (p. 709):—
    “In comparing these expressions with the results of Mr.
Kerr's admirable experiments, it is necessary to observe, as I
mentioned before, that the introduction of a difference of
phase between the reflected components is a question of a
different order from that here discussed, and probably to
some extent at least depends on the want of abruptness in the
change from one medium to the other. For instance, my
expressions give no change of plane of polarization when
light is reflected normally from the end of a magnet, but they
would lead one to expect that the only effect was a slight
elliptic polarization, the major axis of the ellipse being in the
same plane as the original plane of polarization. Now
Mr. Kerr's experiments show that there is some rotation
of this plane by reflection, and a supposition similar to one
long ago proposed to explain the known elliptic polarization
of metallic reflection—namely, that the efficient reflecting
surface has some depth—may easily be shown to lead to
Mr. Kerr's result.      §.  this hypothesis the reflected ray is
the resultant of the rays reflected from a small thickness at
the surface of separation of the media; and in the case of
normal reflection from the end of the pole of a magnet, each
of these components would be slightly turned from its original
plane of polarization owing to having passed through a very
small thickness of a very powerful rotatory polarizing sub
stance—namely, this superficial layer of the magnet; hence
it is evident that their resultant would no longer be polarized
in the same plane as the incident ray. I only give this as an
 instance of how this question of a difference of phase affects
 the results, and how the hypotheses that have been framed
 to explain it might be used to bring my results into complete
  accord with Mr. Kerr's experiments.”
     Prof. Kundt will see from this that I have anticipated the
  objection he raises, and have also anticipated him in pointing
  out in what direction to look for the explanation of the out
  standing phenomena, to one of which he has called attention.
  Even in my first paper, the one with which Prof. Kundt is
   acquainted, I pointed out that it would be necessary to include
   the complications of metallic reflection in order to arrive at a
   complete theory. I cannot agree with Prof. Kundt in
   thinking that the incompleteness he has now pointed out and

102 Messrs. Wright and Thompson on the Determination of
which I pointed out in 1880 is in any fair sense a refutation
of my    |.         Fresnel's theory of reflection cannot be
fairly said to be refuted because it leaves unexplained the
gradual change of phase of the components near the polarizing
angle. All that is required in order to make my theory
more complete is a little fearlessness as to complicated
mathematics, which I regret to say either my laziness or
my busyness prevents me from displaying, as it has till now
prevented my noticing Prof. Kundt’s paper.
   I have roughly compared my formula with Prof. Kundt’s
results, and find that the calculated rotations are of the same
order of magnitude as he has observed. As he does not give
experiments on the rotations produced by reflection and
transmission under exactly similar conditions, any comparison
must of necessity be rough.
                             Yours obediently,
                                 GEORGE FRANCIS FITZGERALD.

 B. Voltaic and Thermovoltaic Constants of Metals immersed
                 in Solutions of their Chlorides.
                          I. Cadmium.
   180. A number of cells were set up with amalgamated-zinc
and electro-cadmium plates, and solutions of equal molecular
strength, m MCl2 100 H2O, on each side, and examined pre
cisely as before. The following average values were obtained,
the probable error in each case being from + 1001 to + 002
volt.    The values of E H annexed are calculated from the
heat-valuations of Julius Thomsen, viz. Zn, Cl, aq. = 112840,
and Cd, Cl, aq. = 96.250, for molecular strength 25 MCl2
100 H,0; so that the heat of displacement of cadmium by zinc
from chloride solution m CdCl2 100 H2O is
         112840–h1–(96.250—ha)=16590–(hi-ho),
where hi and he are the heats of dilution of zinc- and cadmium
chloride solutions respectively from the strength m MCl,
100 H.O to 25 MCl2 100 H20: the values of hi and h, are
derived from the table given in § 160, Part VIII.

   It is here evident that whilst the voltaic constant for cad
mium-zinc-chloride cells continually diminishes as the solu
tion-strength increases, the value of EH diminishes still more
rapidly; so that the thermovoltaic constant is negative for
weaker solutions and positive for stronger ones, the actual
values of this constant being somewhat larger than those
observed with zinc-cadmium-sulphate cells (§ 172), but still
always under 5 centivolts. With the sulphate ceils the values
of the constant were opposite in sign, viz. positive for weaker,
and negative for stronger solutions.
                            II. Copper.
   181. On immersing a plate of clean metallic copper in a
strong solution of cupric chloride, the plate speedily becomes
visibly coated with a film of sparingly soluble cuprous chloride
formed in virtue of the reaction
                        Cu + CuCl2=Cu2Cl2.
With weaker solution the actual deposition of cuprous chlo
 rides in the solid state is not always noticeable, although its
formation and presence are readily detected analytically. It
is hence evident that any cell containing as one half a solution
of cupric chloride and a copper plate must really contain as
the electrolyte on this side a mixture of cuprous chloride with
more or less cupric chloride, the film of fluid in immediate
contact with the copper plate containing but little if any of
the latter salt in solution. In point of fact, on examining a
number of similar cells set up with electro-copper plates
immersed in 25 CuCl2 100 H.0 on the one side and amalga
mated-zinc plates immersed in 25 ZnCl2 100 H.O on the
other, values were obtained fluctuating between 1.083 and
1:106 volt; whilst another series of analogous values fluc
tuating between almost exactly the same limits, and averaging
practically the same value, was obtained with a corresponding
set of cells in which the copper plate was immersed, not in
cupric-chloride solution alone to begin with, but in a magma

104 Messrs. Wright and Thompson on the Determination of
of cuprous-chloride crystals suspended in 25 CuCl, 100H,0*.
The values of the two series of observations combined were as
follows:—
         Maximum E.M.F.        .     .   .    . .   .   .     1'106
         Minimum        ,      .     .   .    . .   .   .     1083
         Average        22     -    -                   .     1.0985
         Probable error of average value            . .     +0018
   It is noticeable in this connection that precisely analogous
results were obtained with other sets of cells, containing, on
the one hand, cupric chloride alone, and on the other a magma
of cuprous-chloride crystals and cupric chloride, when op
posed to cadmium ; whilst similarly various mercury cells
gave substantially the same values whether pure metallic
mercury and corrosive-sublimate solution were used, or mer
cury and a magma of calomel and corrosive-sublimate solution
 § 183).
( It   *        from the above average value that the voltaic
constant for electro-copper immersed in 25 CuCl2 100 H2O
(or, what is the same thing, a magma of this solution and
crystals of cuprous chloride) is +1.0985, when referred to
amalgamated zinc immersed in 25 ZnCl2 100 H2O as zero.
Sensibly the same value results as the sum of the E.M.F.'s of
zinc-cadmium and cadmium-copper cells in solutions of
strength 25 MCl2 100 H2O throughout. With the latter cells
the following numbers were obtained :–
                 Maximum       .     .   .    . .   '778
                 Minimum       .     .    .   . .    .756

   The heat of displacement of copper from cuprous chloride
by zinc with formation of 25 ZnCl2 100 H2O results from
Thomsen's values, thus:—
              Zn, Cl, aq. . . . 112840
              Cuz, Cl, . . . . 65750
                                            47090 = 1.038 volt.

sulphate solution with common salt and spongy copper, filtering hot,
.."allowing cuprous chloride to crystallize out on cooling,

       Chemical Affinity in terms of Electromotive Force.               105
Whence the thermovoltaic constant for electro-copper in con
tact with cuprous chloride suspended in cupric-chloride solu
tion of strength 25 CuCl, 100 H.O is 1099–1-038 – 4-061.
   The experiments detailed in § 174 indicated that when lead
sulphate was suspended in cadmium-sulphate solution a higher
E.M.F. was observed, cateris paribus, with zinc-lead-sulphate
cells than when zinc-sulphate solution was employed ; from
which it would seem probable that, if cuprous chloride be sus
pended in zinc-, cadmium-, and copper-chloride solutions in
three zinc-copper-chloride cells . alike, the E.M.F.
will be smallest in the first case and greatest in the last. This
is in fact the case. The following values were obtained in a
number of experiments on the point, indicating that the use
of cadmium-chloride solution gives values intermediate be
tween those obtained with zinc- and copper-chloride solutions
respectively. The solutions were in all cases of strength
"25 MCl, 100 H,0.

   Hence the thermovoltaic constants for electro-copper in
contact with cuprous chloride suspended in zinc- or cadmium
chloride solutions of strength 25 MCl2 100 H2O are negative
in sign, viz.:
Suspended in zinc-chloride solution .              .988–1-038––.050
       3)        cadmium ,              22     . 1'001–1038 = – ’037
   It should hence result that cells set up with electro-cadmium
immersed in 25 CdCl2 100 H,0 on the one side, and on the
other side electro-copper immersed in a magma of cuprous
chloride suspended in zinc-chloride solution of the same
strength, will have an E.M.F. of 672–'050—(–036)=-658;
and, similarly, that analogous cells set up with cuprous chlo
ride suspended in cadmium-chloride solution will have an
E.M.F. of 672–'037–(–036)=-671 (.672 being the
E.M.F. corresponding with the heat of displacement of copper

On setting up a number of such cells the following values
were obtained, the averages being sensibly identical with
those thus calculated:—
                                  Cu2Cl, suspended in       Cu2Cl, suspended in

     Probable error .........            +0027                    +:0016
   It is noticeable in connection with these values, that whereas
zinc–cadmium, cadmium-copper, and zinc-copper cells set up
with sulphate solutions of various strengths possess E.M.F.'s.
in no case differing by more than +010 volt from the values
calculated from the difference between the heats of formation
of the two electrolytes, the divergence between the two values
is usually much greater when corresponding cells are set up
with chloride solutions. Thus, for example:—

   182. A number of cells were set up with analgamated-zinc
and zinc-chloride solution on one side, and on the other side
electro-silver immersed in a magma of freshly precipitated,
well-washed silver chloride, suspended in zinc-chloride solution.
The following values were finally obtained for cells where the
zinc-chloride solution is of the same strength, m/nCl, 100 H.O,

       Chemical Affinity in terms of Electromotive Force.        107
on each side.         The probable error is in all cases below

   The thermovoltaic constants for electro-silver thus immersed
are calculated from the heat of displacement of silver from
silver chloride by zinc forming m/nCl, 100 H,0, viz.:
                  112840–58760—h-54080–h;

    Hence it results that both the voltaic and thermovoltaic
 constants diminish in value as the solutions become stronger;
 and that whilst the thermovoltaic value of silver in contact
 with silver chloride (suspended in zinc-chloride solution) is
 negative in sign as with the sulphate, its numerical value is
  considerably less than in that instance.
    Some cells were next examined, containing on the one side
 electro-silver plates immersed in a magma of silver chloride
 suspended in zinc-chloride solution, and on the other side
 electro-copper or electro-cadmium in their respective chloride
 solutions, the solution-strength being 25 MCl2100H2O through
 out. The following values were obtained, sensibly agreeing
 with the value – 112 for the thermovoltaic constant above
 obtained with zinc-silver-chloride cells for this molecular
 strength. It is to be noticed that the values of Ei<U+017F> with these
 two kinds of cells respectively are '827 and 154, correspond

110 Messrs. Wright and Thompson on the Determination of
   It is noticeable that suspending silver chloride in zinc-, cad
mium-, or copper-chloride solution affects the E.M.F. of a cell
in the same way as the use of the same fluids for the suspen
sion of cuprous chloride (§ 181), viz. that the E.M.F. is lowest
with zinc and highest with copper-chloride solution.
   Since the ºf F, of a zinc-silver-chloride cell continually
diminishes as the solution-strength rises, just as with a Clark's
cell (§ 179), it is evident that De-la-Rue and Müller's cell
must possess an E.M.F. variable with the strength and nature
of the solution used. A number of rods of pure silver chlo
ride fused round strips of pure silver were obtained from
Messrs. Johnson and Matthey, and set up opposed to zinc and
cadmium in various solutions of their ... respectively.
Variations of 4 to 5 centivolts were observed in the E.M.F.
of such cells with different silver-chloride rods, everything
else being the same, and the observations being made with the
electrometer to avoid possible diminution in E.M.F. The
average values found were slightly lower than those found
with the same solution-strengths and precipitated silver chlo
ride, as might perhaps be expected, inasmuch as the silver
strips inside the fused rods were not electro-coated but were
of bright metal, which has been found in the case of sulphate
cells to give lower values than electro-coated metal (§ 125).

    183. When metallic mercury and corrosive-sublimate
solution are brought into contact, calomel is formed; so that
by agitating the two together almost the whole of the metal
and chlorine are removed from solution.                     Hence it is to be
expected that the same peculiarity would apply to these cells
as to copper cells (§ 181), viz. that much the same E.M.F.
will be given whether mercury be in contact with corrosive
sublimate solution, or with a magma of calomel and corrosive
sublimate solution. In point of fact this is the case; cells set

 1.21 and 128 (zinc). Combining the two sets of cells, the

greatly superior to that corresponding with the net chemical
change. The thermovoltaic constant deduced from the above
mean voltaic constant is 1257–1668– +589; so that mer
cury in this class of cells resembles iron, aluminium, and
magnesium in their sulphate cells, possessing a large positive
thermovoltaic constant.
   Some observations were next made with cells containin
calomel suspended in zinc-chloride solution in contact .#
mercury on one side, and amalgamated zinc immersed in the
same zinc-chloride solution on the other side.                Like the

expected that an E.M.F. of +5.25 should result (correspond

 mercury-chloride cells, silver acquiring the higher potential.

 curous chloride be similarly suspended, in all four cases the
 value of ki-kº is not only negative, but is numerically

 analogous cells in which mercurous chloride was suspended
 in mercuric-chloride solution instead of zinc or cadmium
 Shloride solution, as would naturally be inferred from the
 larger values of the thermovoltaic constant in this case. The

114 Messrs. Wright and Thompson on the Determination of
observed values ranged between – 134 and – 187, averaging
 —"167, that deduced as the above being – 176.

    184. A number of cells were examined, set up with elec
tro-lead plates immersed in saturated lead-chloride solution,
opposed (a) to amalgamated zinc in zinc-chloride solution;
(b) to electro-cadmium in cadmium-chloride solution; (c)
to electro-silver immersed in silver chloride suspended in
zinc-chloride solution; the solution-strength being '05 MC<U+017F>,
100H2O throughout. The following values were obtained:—
                                                                     |

                                                      i
   These numbers give the following valuations for the voltaic
constant of electro-lead in the lead-chloride solution:—
      Zinc-lead           .  .   .   .  . .   .   . .     .   .   = '591
     *Zinc–cadmium + Cadmium-lead . .260+ .330 = '590

    Since Pb, Cl, aq. =75970, the value of EH is 813 (corre
sponding with 112840–75970 =36870 gramme-degrees);
whence the thermovoltaic constant for electro-lead in satu
rated lead-chloride solution is '591–1813= — 222.
    It is noteworthy that whilst ki—k, is negative for both
zinc-lead and cadmium-lead cells, so that their electromotive
forces are notably below the values corresponding with the
heat-evolution during the net chemical change, the reverse
is the case for lead-silver cells: here the heat-evolution is
75970–587.60=17210 gramme-degrees, corresponding with
'379 volt; whilst the actual E.M.F. is 3794-(–112)
 —(-222)=-489 volt (observed average = 489 volt). So
that whilst lead-silver-sulphate cells give rise to electromotive
   * The zinc–cadmium and zinc-silver values are assumed to be the same
for the solution-strength used as those above found for somewhat stronger
solutions 25 MC1, 100 H.O.; the error thus introduced is but small, if
not inappreciable.

        Chemical Affinity in terms of Electromotive Fore... 115
forces considerably below the value of Eh pertaining to that
class of cell, lead-silver-chloride cells possess electromotive
forces considerably above the corresponding value of EH.
    On substituting lead-chloride solution for zinc-chloride
solution as the medium in which silver chloride is suspended,
but little change is produced in the E.M.F. Thus a number
of lead-silver-chloride cells containing solution of strength
"25 PbCl, 100 H, O throughout gave values ranging from
'453 to 522 volt, and averaging near to 480.
     Some   lead-copper-chlori<U+017F>e   cells were examined; but for
some unknown reason they failed to give concordant results,
the observed E.M.F.     º       falling short of that deduced from
the voltaic constants for lead and copper in chloride-solution
 (viz. 1099–1591='508). In some cases the falling off was
 small; in others it exceeded 050: these cells, moreover, exhi
 bited no constancy even for half an hour after setting up, the
 E.M.F. rapidly falling as time elapsed. In all cases, how
 ever, higher º forces were observed than corre
 spond with the difference between Pb, Cl, aq. =75970 and
    us, Cl, = 65750, viz. 10220 gramme-degree = 225 volt.
     On the other hand, numbers closely agreeing with those
 calculated from the above-described thermovoltaic constants
 were obtained with cells set up with electro-lead immersed in
  lead-chloride opposed to mercury in contact with mercurous
  chloride suspended in zinc- or cadmium-chloride solution, the
  strength being 25 MCl2 100H2O throughout. The value
  of EH in these cells is +145 volt, corresponding with
  8250–75970-6580          gramme-degrees, the metal giving the
  smaller heat-value, and consequently acquiring i. higher
  gº in consequence of the            chemical action, being lead.
    ince, however, the thermovoltaic constant for lead is – 222,
  and that for mercury in contact with mercurous chloride sus
  pended in zinc-chloride solution +458, and when suspended
  in cadmium-chloride solution + 473, the value of ki-kº is
  in each case largely negative, and considerably greater nume
  rically that EH. #. the calculated electromotive forces
  for the two cells are respectively 145+(–222)—458
   = –1535, and 145+(–222) – 473= —-550 volt. The ob
  served values were — 539 and – 549 respectively, i.e. electro
  motive forces of '539 and 550 volt were observed, the mer
  cury, and not the lead, acquiring the higher potential. These
   cells are remarkable not only for the large negative values of
   ki-kº, but also for the high negative values of EH + ki–ks,
   exceeding in this respect all    .     cells examined with the
   exception of zinc-aluminium-sulphate cells (§ 178), which gave
   the numerical value .537.

116 Messrs. Wright and Thompson on the Determination of
                              VI. Magnesium.
   185. A series of cells was set up containing bright mag
nesium (wire) opposed to amalgamated zinc º; electro
cadmium in their respective chloride-solutions, the strength
being uniformly 25 MCI, 100 H, 0. The values exhibited
.# greater fluctuations as time elapsed than were observed
with most of the other cells examined; whilst the mean read
ings during the first half-hour after setting up also showed
much less concordance, as the following figures show. As with
the sulphate-cells (§ 177), magnesium acquired the lower
potential when opposed to zinc, and & fortiori when opposed
to cadmium.

these values necessarily being negative, as with the sulphate
cells:–

   Julius Thomsen finds Mg, Cl, aq. = 186930 for solution of
strength 25MgCl, 100 H, 0; wfºe EH = –1634. Conse
quently the thermoyoltaic constant for bright magnesium in
contact with chloride solution of this strength is
                     —‘701-(–1-634) = +933,
or, approximately, the same large positive quantity as that
found with sulphate solutions.
                             VII. Aluminium.
   186. In precisely the same way were two series of observa
tions made with cells containing plates of bright aluminium
opposed to amalgamated zinc and electro-cadmium immersed
in solutions of their chlorides respectively, the solution
strength being 25 Al; Cls 100H2O", and equivalent amounts

hydrochloric acid with recently precipitated well-washed aluminium
hydroxide.

    Each of these averages leads to the same value, +280, for
 this voltaic constant.

 This constant being of + sign, since aluminium was found to
 acquire the higher and zinc the lower potential (as with the
 sulphate-cells, $178); whilst, on the other hand, the readings
 observed with the zinc-aluminium cells are marked — above
 because this cell is another example of the case where
 EH--ki-kº has a negative value, the current actually set up
 passing in the direction opposite to that predicable #ºn the
 heats of formation of the electrolytes.
    Julius Thomsen finds Alg, Cl, aq. = 158550, whence EH=
 —1:008; consequently
              E–Eh- +280–(–1:008)= + 1.288;
i. e. the thermovoltaic constant for bright aluminium in contact
with its chloride solution is a large positive quantity, as with
the sulphate.
                                 VIII. Iron.
    187. Cells were set up containing plates of nearly pure
sheet-iron (bright) opposed to amalgamated zinc and electro
cadmium in solution of constant strength 25 MCI, 100H, O,
also to electro-silver immersed in a magma of precipitated
silver-chloride suspended in zinc-chloride solution of this same
strength. The following numbers were obtained as the
average readings during the first half-hour after setting up.

118 Messrs. Wright and Thompson on the Determination of
                          Zinc-Iron.      Cadmium-Iron.     Silver-Iron.

    Hence the following three valuations for the voltaic constant
result; the values with the cadmium-iron cell being marked
–, since in this case (as with the corresponding sulphate
cells, Š 175) iron, and not cadmium, actually acquires the
higher potential.

    Julius Thomsen finds Fe, Cl, aq. =99950 for 25FeCl,
100H, O, whence EH="284. Hence the thermovoltaic con
stant for bright metallic iron in ferrous-chloride solution of
this strength is
                      E—EH = 488–284= +204;
i. e. it is a considerable positive quantity, as in the case of the
sulphate-cells.
      t is noticeable that whilst with silver-iron cells the value
 of ki—k, is negative, so that E is considerably less than
 EH, the opposite holds with zinc-iron cells, the E.M.F.
 actually set up being not much below double that corre
 sponding with the net heat-development in the cell.
   C. Voltaic and Thermovoltaic Constants of Metals immersed
                        in Solutions of their Nitrates.
                                    I. Copper.
     188. A number of cells were set up with amalgamated
 zinc and electro-copper plates, and solutions of the nitrates
 of the respective metals prepared by dissolving pure metals
 in nitric acid, and saturating any excess of .# by means of
 the metallic carbonate freshly precipitated from a portion of
 the respective solution, and well washed. The following values
 were obtained as the mean readings during the first twenty

         Chemical Affinity in terms of Electromotive Force. 119
minutes after setting up. The readings during this period did
not always exhibit constancy, especially with the weaker solu
tions; but the extreme alteration usually only amounted to a
few millivolts, concurrently with a visible alteration in the
surfaces of the plates. Strength of solutions, mM(NO3)2

   Probable error...        + 0035 |   +0.034  H-0005   ||   +0009
    These figures correspond with the following thermovoltaic
constants, the values of E H being deduced from the experi
 ments of Julius Thomsen, including his valuations of the
 heats of dilution of zinc- and copper-nitrate solutions. The
 difference between the heats of formation of mM(NOs),
 100H,0 are given by the formula
            102510–h1–(52410—ha)=50100—(hi-hs),
 where Zn, O, N,0, aq. =102510, and Cu, O, N,0, aq. =52410
 for solution-strengths 25 M(NO3), 100 H.6 ; whilst hi and he
 are the heats of dilution of solutions of zinc and copper
 nitrate respectively from the strength mM(NO3), 100 H.O to
 •25 M(NO3), 100             2O.

     It is here noticeable that the thermovoltaic constant for
 electro-copper in nitrate solution has in no case any large
 value ; whilst of negative sign for low-solution strengths, it
  becomes positive for stronger fluids, and again negative with
  . concentrated solutions, following the variations in the
  voltaic constant, which has a maximum value for fluids of
 medium strength.

 120 Messrs. Wright and Thompson on the Determination of
                                 II. Cadmium.
    189. Cekls were set up with electro-cadmium plates im
 mersed in cadmium-nitrate solution, opposed on the one hand
 to electro-copper, and on the other to amalgamated zinc im
 mersed in solutions of their nitrates respectively, the constant
 solution-strength being 25 M(NO3), 100 H.O. The following
values were obtained :

   From these figures the following valuations result for the
voltaic constant of cadmium in nitrate solution 25 Cd(NO3)2

   Julius Thomsen finds Cd, O, N,0, aq. = 86300 (for
25 Cd(NO3), 100H,0), whence EH="357. Hence the thermo
voltaic constant for electro-cadmium in nitrate solution o
this strength is                                                                 - -
                     E–EH="352–357 = —‘005.
   It is here noticeable that the value of the thermovoltaic
constant is negative, as in the case of chloride solution of
corresponding strength, whereas it is positive in the case of
sulphate solution of the same strength; but in no case is the
numerical value of the constant large.
                                    III. Lead.
   190. Cells containing electro-lead opposed to amalgamated
zinc and electro-copper in nitrate solution of strength
mM (NOs), 100 H.O gave the following average values, the
probable error in no case exceeding +004, and being usually
considerably less:–
                                    m = 25.    m= 1-0.      m = 2-0.

 solution is always negative (as with sulphate and chloride);

 becomes rapidly and completely converted into mercurous
 salt by agitation with mercury. In order to prepare mer
 curous nitrate with but little excess of acid, mercury was
 dissolved in nitric acid, and the crystallized mass washed on
 the filter-pump with a little water, and then well agitated with
 water and mercury. The solution thus obtained was free from

It is noticeable that with the last cell the current sometimes
passed from mercury to silver and sometimes in the opposite

    XV. Some Observations on the Behaviour of Electricity in
               Rarefied Air. By Prof. E. EDLUND”.
FRM recent observations on the passage of electricity
         through rarefied gases, the conclusion has been drawn
that the conductivity of a gas increases with its rarefaction
until a certain limit has been reached; but that if this limit is
exceeded the conductivity begins to decrease, so that at last, if
the process of exhaustion is continued, an absolute vacuum
must be regarded as a nonconductor. These observations have
been generally made by using an air-pump or other apparatus
to rarefy the air in a glass vessel, into which two electrodes of
platinum or some other metal had been melted, and then ex
amining the passage of electricity through the rarefied gas.
If we examine these experiments, which have been made at
various times, and compare them critically with each other,
we shall find that they by no means justify the conclusion
hitherto drawn from them, viz. that the conductivity of gases
 attains its maximum for a certain definite rarefaction, and
 then diminishes again if the exhaustion is continued. On the
 contrary, everything goes to show that the conductivity
 increases continually up to the highest attainable limit, and
 that consequently an absolute vacuum is a good conductor.
 In fact the passage of electricity through a rarefied gas is not
 simply dependent upon the conductivity of the gas, but also
  to a considerable extent upon the greater or less ease with
  which the electricity itself effects its passage from the elec
  trodes into the gas, or in the opposite direction. There is
  thus a resistance offered to the passage of electricity from the
  electrodes into the layers of gas in contact with them. To
  speak exactly, the experiments hitherto made show that this
  resistance increases with the exhaustion, whilst the resistance
  of the gas continually decreases.         I have already endeavoured
  to show this in a previous researchf.
  * The resistance which the electricity meets in its pas
  sage from the electrodes into the gas, or in the opposite
  direction, does not consist in an electrical resistance in the
  ordinary meaning of that term, but arises from an electro
  motive force, which acts in a direction opposed to that of the
  electric current. Direct observations, described in a former
  research f, showed that this opposed force increases con

tinuously in proportion as the exhaustion of the gas increases,
and consequently opposes the . of electricity by a
resistance which increases with the exhaustion.          The electro
motive force in question is no other than that of which I
showed the presence in the voltaic arc and in the electric
spark some years ago ".
    Although the existence of this force was at first denied by
 some physicists, who had no opportunity of examining the
 evidence which I furnished, and yet pronounced upon its
 value, yet it has been universally admitted in recent times,
 without further evidence being required.
     Since the solution of the question whether a vacuum is a
 conductor or not is of great importance, not only as a matter
 of theory, but also as rendering possible a correct explana
 tion of many phenomena in cosmical physics, I propose to
describe here certain new experiments, which show the cor
 rectness of the results which       } obtained in the researches to
 which I have referred.          Experiments of the kind which I
 propose to describe have no doubt been already made by other
 physicists; but since they have not been so made as to fully
 show their significance, it is not superfluous to consider once
 more their importance.
    It is a well-known fact that the current of a Ruhmkorff's
 coil is not able to leap over even a small distance between
 two electrodes melted into a glass tube, if the air contained
 in the tube is sufficiently rarefied. If, however, a little more
 air is admitted into the tube, the current easily passes from
 the one electrode to the other. The problem, then, is as
 follows: Is the reason why the current will not pass through
 a highly-exhausted atmosphere that the resistance in the
 highly-exhausted gas is too great, or that the resistance
 opposed to the passage of the electricity from the electrodes
 into the atmosphere or in the opposite direction increases
 with the exhaustion?
    We ought to obtain a clear and definite answer to this
 question, if we try, by means of an electromotive force, which
 is not greater than that of the Ruhmkorff’s apparatus, to pro
 duce directly an electric current in the tube without elec
 trodes. If we succeed thus in producing a current in the
highly-exhausted atmosphere, this atmosphere must be a good
 conductor; and the reason that the current of the Ruhm
korff’s apparatus will not pass through the tube must be
 sought in the resistance opposed by the electrodes themselves
to the passage of the current.

surround the tube without being in communication with the
electrodes.
   The current was produced by a large Ruhmkorff’s induc
tion-coil, actuated by two Bunsen-cells, the conducting-wires
being connected alternately with the electrodes and with the
tinfoil coatings. In the latter case, of course, the current of
the induction-coil cannot penetrate into the glass; but the
coatings at the moment of opening or closing the induction
current become charged, the one with       Yº.      the other with
negative electricity, and these charges disappear again equally
rapidly. This continual charging and discharging of the
coatings on the outside of the tube produce (as soon as the
atmosphere of the tube is sufficiently exhausted) induced
 currents inside the tube, which show their presence by lumi
 nosity. This experiment, which, like all the rest, was made
 in a dark room, gave the following result:—

       0.00036. The spark between a and b is seen only occa
          sionally, the tube remaining dark for long intervals of
          time. The induced light between c and d, on the other
          hand, is to be seen all the time, and is very intense.

128              Prof. E. Edlund on the Behaviour of
   If we consider first the phenomena attending the charge
and discharge of the tinfoil coatings, we observe that when
the density of the air in the tube is relatively considerable,
e.g. 36 millim. or more, no perceptible induction-currents
result; on the other hand, when the density amounts to less
than 1 millim. down to 0-00036 millim., induction-currents
are formed and manifest their presence by brilliant luminosity.
The constancy of the induced electromotive force is altogether
dependent upon the improvement which takes place in the
conducting-power of the air in the same proportion as the
rarefaction increases up to the limit attainable by means of
the mercury air-pump. If, on the other hand, we observe the
form assumed by the phenomenon when the current of the
induction-coil is    º      into the tube through the platinum
electrodes, we find that the current easily leaps over the in
terval between the electrodes when the pressure amounts to
one atmosphere or less down to 0-004 millim.—a point at which
the resistance becomes large enough to sensibly weaken the
current, and from which onward this resistance increases, if
the exhaustion is continued; so that at a pressure of 0.00036
millim. the current can only occasionally leap over the interval
between the electrodes,    º         this is only 3 millim. The
resistance to the current at a pressure of only 0.00036 millim.
is therefore greater than at a higher pressure. The two
series therefore give altogether opposite results. I can only
explain this by the presence of a hindrance to the passage of
electricity from the electrodes into the air, whilst, on the con
trary, the resistance peculiar to the air becomes less as its
exhaustion increases. This experiment leads therefore to the
same result as my former experiments, in which I came to the
conclusion that there exists an opposing electromotive force
at the surface bounding the electrodes and the gas, which
increases continuously with the exhaustion of the gas.

      0.0003. The spark leaps over the distance between a and
          b still from time to time, but the light between c and d
           continues.
     Third Ewperiment.—I used for this experiment a glass tube
 18 millim. wide, bent into the form of a ring of 155 millim.
 diameter, into which two platinum electrodes were melted
 nearly at the ends of a diameter.        An open glass tube from
 the outer side of the ring placed it in communication with
 the mercury air-pump. As in the previous experiments the
 tube was surrounded by two tinfoil coatings, which were not
 connected in any way with the electrodes. When the air had
 been exhausted to a certain degree, the current passed between
 the electrodes through both halves of the tube, so that the
 whole tube was illuminated. If, on the other hand, the con
 necting wires of the apparatus are attached to the tinfoil
  coatings, no induction-light shows itself. If the exhaustion
  is pushed to the highest limit attainable with the air-pump, it
  is impossible for the current to pass between the electrodes,
  whilst when the conducting wires were removed from the tin
  foil coatings the tube becomes luminous immediately. This
  experiment therefore confirms the former ones. One of the
  Geissler tubes belonging to the collection of physical appa
  ratus of the Academy of Sciences, a tube 300 millim. lon
  and 20 millim. in diameter, having platinum electrodes º
  into the ends, was so far vacuous that the current of the Ruhm
  korff's induction-coil would not pass between the electrodes,
  a distance of 200 millim. On surrounding the tube with tin
  foil coating and connecting them with the coil, the tube
  commenced at once to diffuse a brilliant light, due to the in
  duced currents which traversed it. Consequently we have
  the same result as before.
      Fourth Eaperiment.—The glass tube used for the first two
  experiments was employed as follows:—The air was exhausted
  from it until the current from the induction-coil could no
  longer leap over the interval between the electrodes.         The
  tube having been closed by means of a hermetically closing

tap, the pump was removed and the spherical conductor of an
ordinary electrical machine feebly charged was brought near
to it.  W. the      tube was   º moved         to and fro in the
neighbourhood of the conductor, it was illuminated by an in
tense light, but remained dark if held still or if made to
describe a circle round the conductor. This shows clearly
that it was an induced current produced in the interior of the
tube which caused the light; in fact, no induction-current
was produced in the second case, and consequently there was
no light. Then the pressure of the air in the tube was in
creased to about 350 millim.       The current of the induction
coil now produced a spark between the electrodes, but no
induced light was to be seen on approaching the tube to a
charged conductor or on withdrawing it. In this experiment
the tube had no coatings of tinfoil, and the portions of the
electrodes outside the tube were covered with insulating
material.
   Corresponding experiments with the ring-shaped tube
yielded i. same result.
   Fifth Ewperiment.—In a tube like the first described the
air was exhausted so far that the current from the induction
coil would not pass between the electrodes. If, then, the one
half of the tube was rubbed with a suitable cushion, it began
to light up altogether, the electricity contained in the tube
being put into motion by means of the electricity produced by
the external friction. If, on the other hand, the tube contained
air at a high pressure it was impossible to produce light,
although the current of the induction-coil easily passed from
the one electrode to the other.     The same result was obtained
with the ring-shaped tube if the air contained in it was suf
ficiently rarefied. The whole tube became luminous when
only one fourth of it was rubbed. These experiments thus
completely confirm the previous ones.
   We see thus that the admitted fact that an induced current
passing through a #. increases in intensity in proportion as
the gas is exhausted, but that, if the exhaustion is continued, it
decreases, is not explained by supposing that from the moment
when a certain limit is reached the resistance increases as the
exhaustion is continued. On the contrary, experiments show
that the fact in question is to be explained by the increase
which takes place in the resistance offered to the electricity in
its passage from the electrodes into the gas as the exhaustion
of the gas increases, until it becomes so great as to present an
insurmountable obstacle to the passage of the electricity.
There is thus no experimental foundation for the assumption
that an absolute vacuum is an insulator. Since the conducting

   Electromagnetic Experiments of Faraday and Plücker. 131
power of the gas increases continuously, with the exhaustion
which it undergoes, even when this is pushed as far as
possible, it would be more philosophical to assume that an
absolute vacuum is a conductor.
 XVI. On some Electromagnetic Earperiments of Faraday and
                Plücker. By S. TolvKR PRESTON".
                              [Plate II.]
ALTººl it might seem late in the present day to call
         in question any at all fundamental theoretic conclusions
on the subject of magnetism deduced from experiment, yet we
know that cases admitting of a double interpretation do some
times occur in experimental research ; and precisely on account
 of their extreme rarity are such cases liable to elude attention
 and to lead to misapprehensions. About the year 1869, when
 reading Faraday's ‘Experimental Researches,’ such an instance
 attracted my notice, and it recurred some years afterwards
 while perusing a paper of Plücker's (Pogg. Ann. Bd. lxxxvii.
  1852, S.353: “Ueber die Reciprocität der elektromagnetischen
  und magnetoelektrischen Erscheinungen’’). The same ambi
  guous case occurred both to Faraday and Plücker; and neither
  appears to have noticed the fact of its being ambiguous (or
  admitting of a double interpretation). Yet the interpretation
  taken by them, when carried out to its logical conclusions,
  appears to contradict the theory of Ampère as to the similarity
  of the helix (solenoid) and magnet in their chief properties—
  a theory which seems to have been hitherto generally accepted.
     I will at once proceed to the point in question. Faraday,
  and also Plücker, adopted quite a peculiar view as to the
  behaviour of the system of force (“lines of force ’’) about a
  magnet when rotated on its aris; and they set up in this way
   (led by the experiments) a fundamental distinction of principle
  between the translatory and rotatory motion of a magnet in
  regard to the behaviour of the field of force about it.    Fara
  day himself calls his own view “singular.” The following
  are the words of Faraday relating to this point:
      “When lines of force are spoken of as crossing a conducting
   circuit, it must be considered as effected by the translation of
   a magnet. No mere rotation of a bar-magnet on its axis
   produces any inductive effects on circuits exterior to it. The
   system of power about the magnet must not be considered as
   revolving with the magnet any more than the rays of light
                     * Communicated by the Author.

132        Mr. S. Tolver Preston on some Electromagnetic
which emanate from the sun are supposed to revolve with the
sun. The magnet may even, in certain cases, be considered
as revolving amongst its own forces, and producing a full
electric effect sensible at the galvanometer.” (Phil. Trans.
1852, page 31.)
    Without at once going into the related practical question
as to whether a magnet (the rotating globe of the earth, for
instance) can, by “revolving amongst its own forces,” become
charged at the equator and poles with electricity of opposite
sign (as Faraday * inferred from this experiment), I would
only wish to call the unbiassed attention to the above distinction
in principle between a translatory and a rotatory motion, as it
seems to me that such a distinction (as a matter of theoretic
reasoning) cannot possibly hold. For rotation is surely after
all only a particular case of translation, viz. translation in a
circle. When a magnet rotates on its axis, every part or
magnetic point in it is translated (in a circle) about that axis.
And certainly it will be conceded in regard to Faraday's
analogy of the (axially) revolving or rotating sun, the same
principle (whatever it was) that applied to the behaviour of
the “rays of light” of the rotating sun, also must apply to
the rays of light of the translated sun (in its proper motion).
For we do not ask whether a given luminous point or portion
of the sun’s surface is moving in a curred or in a straight line
in order to set fast the principle of the behaviour of the rays of
light. The same reasoning must therefore apply to the magnet
if Faraday's analogy is to hold at all, i.e. if (in            .."     to the
inductive effect) the lines of force must be regarded as par
taking of the motion of a magnet when it is translated, they
must partake of its motion when it is rotated f. This, there
fore, constitutes the first theoretic objection to the view adopted
by Faraday, and it seems to me to be in itself conclusive.
But, for the sake of further illustration, I will point out how
this view clashes with the generally accepted similarity in (at
least) fundamental properties between the solenoid, or helix,
and the magnet.                                                     *
    It seems always to have been taken for granted that when
a solenoid, or a simple circular current, rotates on its axis in
  * Plücker also inferred it from an analogous experiment, and remarks,
“Hier tritt alsdann in den beiden Polen die positive, unter dem Aequator
die negative Elektricität auf, während eine Indifferenzzone zwischen dem
Aequator und jedem der beiden Pole liegt.”        º:      Ann, 1852, p. 357.)
   + Or, in other words, if the lines of force emitted by a given portion of
a magnetic surface must be considered as partaking of the motion of that
 ortion of surface, when it is translated in a straight line, they must equally
§. so when that portion of surface is translated in a curved line (by the
rotation of the magnet on its axis).

             Experiments of Faraday and Plücker.                  133
its own plane, the inductive effect depends only on the relative
motion between the circular current and neighbouring con
ducting bodies, and does not depend on whether the circular
current or the conducting bodies move. When, for example, a
piece of wire ab (Pl. II. fig. 1) is placed near a revolving solenoid
or simple circular current, ss, it is quite indifferent, as regards
the inductive effect, whether the circular current revolves
about its centre (or axis), or whether, conversely, the wire a b
is made to revolve about the fixed circular current, in the
direction of the dotted line, so long as the relative motion
between the two is the same. I only suppose that in reference
to inductive effects with currents we have to do with relative,
and not at all with absolute motions. If that is true, and also
if the magnet is to resemble the solenoid in its chief properties
 (according to the well-known theory of Ampère), then I
 contend that a magnet in the above case must behave in prin
 ciple as a solenoid or circular current. Faraday, however
 (and with him Plücker), holds the opposite. Faraday ex
 presses the view that it is not indifferent whether the magnet
 or the external conductor moves, that the effect is not   iºi.
 on relative motion; in short, that “no mere rotation of a bar
 magnet on its axis produces any inductive effect on circuits
 exterior to it. The system of power about the magnet must
 not be considered as revolving with the magnet” (loc. cit.
 supra).
    I will now consider the experiment whence Faraday derived
 the above singular (or exceptional) view in regard to a rotating
 magnet. A copper disk k (fig. 2) was cemented upon the end
 of a round bar-magnet m, with insulating paper intervening
 —or, in the words of Faraday :—
    “The magnet and disk were rotated together, and collectors
 (attached to the galvanometer) brought in contact with the
 circumference   ini the central part of the      copper plate. . [In
 the diagram, the dotted line shows this outer circuit, with the
 galvanometerg.] The galvanometer-needle moved as in former
  cases, and the direction of motion was the same as that which
  would have resulted if the copper only had revolved and
  the magnet been fixed. Neither was there any apparent
  difference in the quantity of deflection. Hence rotating the
  magnet causes no difference in the results, for a rotating and
  a stationary magnet produce the same effect upon the moving
  copper.” (Phil. Trans. 1832, page 183.)
       ere Faraday observed gi. a certain deflection of
  the galvanometer when the copper disk was made alone to
  revolve through the lines of force of the fixed magnet. He
  observed the same deflection when the magnet and copper disk

 134       Mr. S. Tolver Preston on some Electromagnetic
 were revolved together (as one whole). Hence he seems to have
 reasoned that because the deflection remained the same, the
 conditions must have remained the same; and therefore that
 the revolving copper disk, even when attached to the magnet
 (and revolving with it), still continued to cut through the
 magnetic lines of force of the magnet, precisely as it would
have done if the disk alone had revolved and the magnet been
fixed. Hence Faraday concluded that the lines of force could
not possibly partake of the rotatory motion of the magnet"; but
that the magnet revolved “amongst its own forces.”
    But I believe it will be apparent here, on inspection of the
diagram of the apparatus, that the same deflection would be
equally consistent with the opposite supposition (viz. that the
lines of force partake of the rotatory motion of the magnet,
 in the same sense as they partake of the translatory motion
of the magnet). For, admitting that the lines of force revolve
with the magnet, then they will intersect the galvanometer-loop
circuit when the magnet revolves on its axis; and this will
evidently produce a current of the same direction and mag
nitude as under Faraday's singular assumption, which he
thought himself forced into by the experiment. This, I think,
is clearly one of those rare cases of a deceptive double mean
ing to an experimental fact, which on account of their rare
occurrence are unexpected, and may consequently sometimes
escape the notice of even skilful experimenters. Iventure to
believe that few will doubt what the true explanation here is
after the above elucidation; and only in this way does the
contradiction to Ampère's theory (of the similarity of the
properties of the helix and magnet) vanish, as also the great
theoretic difficulty of drawing a distinction between trans
latory and rotatory motion in regard to the behaviour of the
magnetic lines of force.                                  -
    # conclude,    therefore, that the inferred inductive charge
produced at the poles and equator of the revolving globe of
the earth (as a rotating magnet), by “revolving amongst its
own forces,” certainly does not necessarily followt from this
   * After a second perfectly similar experiment to this, with a cylindrical
copper cap instead of a disk, Faraday adds “Thus a singular independence
of the magnetism and the bar in which it resides is rendered evident.”
 Page 184.)
   + On the other hand, another quite different cause may conceivably
conduce to an electric disturbance on the earth's surface, or, rather, on
i. of it which are not rigidly fixed. The tides, namely, form a circular
  and or ring of water through which the earth revolves. These great
water elevations are not therefore fired (relatively to the revolving earth)
as the globe of the earth itself is ; and consequently the magnetic lines of
force carried along with the revolving globe can intersect the tides, and

               Eaperiments of Faraday and Plücker.                    135
experiment. Whether there are other independent grounds
for such an assumption, I am not aware, and Faraday does
not state them.
   It will be seen clearly that Faraday’s view involves the
strange assumption that although (as an admitted fact), when
a copper disk is revolved parallel to and above the pole of a
magnet, an inductive effect is produced on the disk [so that
its centre and periphery become statically charged with elec
tricity of opposite sign], yet when, conversely, the magnet is
made to revolve with the same relative velocity below the fixed
disk, no effect is produced; yet the relative motion is really
the same in both cases. In fact, Faraday's aspect of the case
involves the supposition that the parts of a body at rest (rela
tively to the body itself, when it revolves) can produce an
inductive effect on the body.
   The following experiment (Phil. Trans. 1832) may possess
an interest, as it was considered by Faraday to confirm his
view of the static charge produced at the equator and poles
of a magnet by its own revolution, and which also led
(Plücker especially) to speculations over the cause of the
aurora borealis (Pogg. Ann. 1852, p. 357). A cylindrical
 bar-magnet, m (fig. 3), was set by Faraday in axial rotation,
 and the galvanometer wires were maintained in sliding con
 tact with the equator and one pole of the magnet respectively,
 as the dotted lines in the diagram indicate. A current was
 observed; and the cause of this current was referred (in the
 same way) to a static charge produced by the magnet cutting
 through its own (internal) lines of force, these lines, or the
 internal field of force, having been supposed to remain rigidly
 at rest, while the magnet revolved independently through it.
 But it will be seen that the current may be simply referred
 (in an analogous way to the previous example of the copper
disk) to the lines of force moving with the revolving magnet,
and intersecting the eaternal circuit formed by the galvanometer
wires. This explanation has the additional advantage of
bringing the current formed, whether by the rotation of
the magnet on its axis, or by the (inverse) revolution of the
wire about the magnet, under the same cause (and not under
different causes).
so cause a disturbance of the electric equilibrium on the earth's surface
of the character imagined by Faraday, and assigned by him to a quite
different cause. . Also the trade winds, which, somewhat similarly, form
a kind of air-belt through which the earth revolves, can conceivably con
duce in the same way to an electrie disturbance, especially as these winds
near the equator are laden with moisture, so as to become in some sense
conductors.

136       Mr. S. Tolver Preston on some Electromagnetic
   Twenty years afterwards, in 1852, in order to test the case
further, the following experiment was made by Faraday. An
insulated wire was bent into the form of a rectangle, ed a bf
(fig. 4), and pushed into the slit or interval between two bar
magnets of oblong cross section, of which fig. 4 (bis) shows
the end view. The part of the wire buried between the
magnets is dotted in the upper figure. The whole was made
fast to the axis of a convenient rotary apparatus, so that
the whole could be put in motion about the central magnetic
axis (common to both magnets). The ends e and f of the
wire loop were brought out and attached separately to two
insulated metal rings fastened on the axis of rotation, and
suitable springs pressed upon these rings, these springs thus
serving to carry off any current to a conveniently placed
galvanometer (Phil. Trans. 1852, p. 30, &c.).                  The whole
arrangement is accordingly very simple. The magnets with
rigidly attached rectangular loop were revolved together (as
one whole) about the central axis, and no current or deflec
tion was observed at the galvanometer. The absence of cur
rent was explained in the following manner. The outer pro
jecting part of the rectangular loop, viz. a de, was supposed
by its rotation to cut through the outer lines of force of the
magnet, which were considered to remain in absolute rest
while the magnet revolved. The inner part of the rectangular
loop, viz. a bf (dotted in the diagram), was supposed, on the
other hand, to cut through the inner or interior magnetic
lines of force, which were also thought to remain in rigid
rest, while the (compound) magnet independently revolved
through them. In this way it was supposed that two oppo
site currents tended to be produced in the rectangular loop,
and so exactly neutralized each other; and the absence of
current in the loop was thus explained. But instead of
having recourse to this complicated hypothesis, one can
explain the absence of current by the simple fact that the
whole system is at rest when it revolves as a whole, or there
is no relative motion between its parts, which are rigidly
connected; and without relative motion there can be no induc
tive effect *.                                        -
  * Faraday considered that this experiment—where magnet and attached
wire loop are revolved as one rigid whole—proved that the lines of force
within the magnet were equal in power to those outside the magnet;
because he supposed that the lines of force remained in absolute rest
while the system revolved through them, whereby the current generated
by the intersection of the internal lines of force was considered equal and
opposite to that generated by the intersection of the external lines of force.

               Eaperiments of Faraday and Plücker.                   137
    Moreover, it seems very apparent on consideration that
when the above double magnet rotates, its lines of force must
rotate with it. For imagine one of the two magnets (which
form the compound bar) to be removed. Then the centre of
#. of the other will now lie outside the axis of rotation.
Therefore this magnet and therefore its lines of force will (by
the rotation) be bodily translated about the axis. For Fara
day himself admits that when a magnet (or its centre of
gravity) is translated, its lines of force accompany it, and
would intersect and inductively affect external conductors.
The same reasoning now applies to both magnets (if the other
be brought back), so that when the whole revolves the lines
of force of each bar (and therefore of the whole) are translated
about the axis, i.e. revolve with the magnet (or compound
bar), and would influence external conducting bodies. This
must, I think, be sufficiently clear; indeed, by holding a
sheet of paper with loose iron filings horizontally above the
end of the compound bar, one could, no doubt, in a certain
sense, see the movement of the lines of force by observing the
small disturbances produced in the iron filings, as the irre
gularities in shape or magnetic distribution of the poles pass
under the filings when the compound bar revolves. This
must be obvious enough, and it will probably be thought
superfluous to carry the analysis of this point further. For
we are concerned here only with one single oversight (depend
ing on a double or ambiguous aspect in the experiments);
and as soon as Faraday, in the first instance, thought his
view warranted or necessitated by the experimental results,
he, of course (consistently), applied it throughout, and so a
considerable number of experiments are affected. , My object
is only to reach the truth, and, whatever it may be, we shall
certainly gain by its recognition.
     As regards the experiments of Plücker, although the
 various forms of apparatus specially constructed by him for
 the determination of this and related questions is generally
 more complicated than the apparatus of Faraday, yet it is
 easy to see on going through the drawings that the same
 oversight, viz. the neglect of the influence of the galvano
 meter wires (or the external galvanometer-loop circuit) on
  the results, affects all his experiments alike; so that I deem
  it unnecessary to consider these experiments further here.
  They are described very completely in the paper in Poggen
  show that these (currents) are perfectly equal to each other” (p. 33).
  My contention is that this experiment proves nothing, although there
  may be independent grounds for concluding that the lines of force outside
   the magnet are ºi in power to those inside.
      Phil. Mag, S. 5. Wol. 19. No. 117. Feb. 1885.                L

138 Mr. S. Tolver Preston on some Electromagnetic
dorff’s Annalen before referred to. I will only mention one
point. In one of Plücker's experiments he used an apparatus
consisting of a copper disk, d. (fig. 5), in which six round
bar-magnets were fixed vertically, as the diagram shows. The
whole was rotated about the central axis. It was then thought
(according to the view adopted by him, and previously held
by Faraday) that the lines of force did not share the rota
tion” of each bar-magnet about its axis, although they did
share the rotation, i. e. translation (in a circle), of each bar
magnet about the aris of the disk when the latter revolved.
Hence it was believed that when the whole system revolved,
the lines of force of each magnet remained acially in absolute
rest, and therefore (virtually) revolved backwards, relatively
to the direction of revolution of the disk, thereby intersecting
the disk and themselves, and charging up the disk inductively,
as it was thought. One sees to what a complicated result
this hypothesis leads. The inductive charge of the disk was
thought to be proved by touching the axis with one galvano
meter wire, and the periphery of the disk with the other,
when a deflection was observed.            It was overlooked that
this deflection is attributable to the passing of the magnets
through the galvanometer-loop or circuit as the disk revolves,
 whereby the lines of force of the magnets successively inter
 sect the wires.
    If one wished to illustrate this subject further experimen
tally, it would be necessary to be on one's guard against a spe
cial case, which otherwise might lead to deceptions. This may
be best seen by taking a particular example. We will suppose
that a magnet, m (fig. 6), taken for simplicity the shape of a
sphere, is surrounded by a metallic covering, or shell, h, with
an air-space between. At the poles of the spherical magnet,
projections n s reach through holes in the shell, by which the
magnet can be put in rotation independently—or (when neces
sary) connected to earth, or to an electrometer. Then, by
the rotation of the magnet-sphere about its magnetic axis ns,
the lines of force (partaking of the motion, on my view) will
intersect the metallic shell h, and therefore strive to generate
a current there, such that the parts of the shell opposite the
equator and poles of the magnet will be statically charged
with the opposite electricities, whose sign will depend on the
direction of rotation. The charge on the metallic shell is
accordingly just the same as if the magnet had been fixed and
   * The lines of force were supposed to behave in this respect as mag
netic needles would do, if balanced on pins projecting from the axis of
each magnet; then when the whole revolves, the needles (pointing
 steadily north and south) would virtually revolve backwards, or remain
 avially at rest in space.

                Earperiments of Faraday and Plücker.                     139
the shell had been rotated in the opposite direction about the
magnet (or, on my view, the charge depends on the relative *
motion between the magnet and shell, and not on which
revolves). When the shell revolves about the magnet, the
existence of the charge upon it is admitted, and is dependent
on well-known principles; but when the magnet revolves, the
existence of the charge upon the shell would have been denied
by   H. "...}                 the relative motion (between magnet and
shell) is the same in both cases. For Faraday considered that
“no mere rotation of a magnet on its axis produces any induc
tive effect on circuits exterior to it.” But Faraday thought
that the rotation of a magnet on its axis could produce an
inductive effect on itself, or that the magnet could become
statically charged by “revolving amongst its own forces.”
Although I contend that Faraday’s experiments do not prove
this static charge, I think I can show how (from another cause)
such a static charge could come on the magnet in the present
special case (fig. 6) without revolution “amongst its own forces.”
For it is apparent that if a static charge is produced on the shell
by the . revolution of the magnet (whose lines of force par
take of its motion and intersect the shell), then this charge
will act by static electric induction—like a Leyden jar—across
the layer of air, and call forth an opposite static charge (or
distribution of electricity) on the corresponding parts of the
magnet facing the shell. Unless this fact (deducible before
hand from the considerations here set forth) be kept in view,
this peculiar static charge may mislead, and make one think
that the magnet could here have become charged in no other
possible way but by “revolving amongst its own forces.”
    Since the first draft of this paper was written, I have
observed that this question is touched upon in the very com
plete work of Prof. Wiedemann (Die Lehre vom Galcanismus),
 where there are also some references, viz. to Beer, Pogg. Ann.
 Bd. xciv. S. 177 (1855); Nobili, Pogg. Ann. Bd. xxvii. S. 421
 (1833), &c. But on referring to these papers, I find that they
 practically leave the question open (or have done nothing to
 decide it), and I find no mention of the possible double (or
 ambiguous) meaning of Faraday's fundamental experiment,
 upon which it may be said the whole question hinges. And
   * It is curious here to remark that, on Faraday's view (that the “system
 of power about the magnet must not be considered as revolving with the
 magnet”), it would follow that the inductive effect on the shell produced
by revolving it concentrically through the lines of force of the magnet
would not be, altered if the magnet itself were put in motion at the same
rate as the shell (so that the two were in relative rest); or it would be
necessary to conclude from this view of Faraday's that the inductive
effect between two bodies is the same by relative rest as by relative motion.

140 Electromagnetic Experiments of Faraday and Plücker.
it would seem desirable that any diverse views on a tolerably
fundamental question of electromagnetism should cease, or a
satisfactory general agreement be arrived at ; which may be
facilitated by an unbiassed discussion of the subject in the
interests of truth.
   Subsequent Addendum.—Besides the practical aspect of this
question as relating to the revolving earth (as a magnet), and
to the identity in fundamental qualities between the magnet
and the helix (involving the validity of Ampère's theory),
there is another practical application of the matter.
   It seems, namely, extremely difficult (if not impossible) on
Faraday's view of “a singular independence of the magnetism
and the bar in which it resides,” to explain how a bar-magnet
is caused to rotate on its axis when one terminal of a galvanic
element is connected with one pole of the magnet, and the other
terminal with the equatorial part of the magnet (the magnet
being suspended freely, and the terminals of the galvanic cell
maintained in sliding contact with its equator and pole). Thus,
suppose the galvanometer, g, of fig. 3 to be removed, and a
battery or galvanic element substituted for it. Then the
magnet is observed to revolve (as is well known). But how
is the magnet to be made to revolve by the action of the cur
rent on its lines of force if the lines of force are independent
of (the rotary motion) of the magnet? The lines of force
may be made to revolve no doubt (by the current); but how
are they to drag the magnet round with them when they are
independent of it?—indeed so independent (as Faraday sup
poses) that the magnet can be actually made to rotate through
its own lines (or field of force). If the rotation of the magnet
cannot cause the field of force to rotate, how can (con
versely) the rotation of the field of force cause the magnet
to rotate ; in other words, how is the rotation of the magnet
by the action of a current to be accounted for on Faraday's
hypothesis? It appears that, on the opposite hypothesis, the
explanation is simple; viz. the rotation of the magnet is then
easily referable to the reaction of the current in the external
portion of the circuit upon the external lines of force of the
magnet (whereby these external lines of force are caused to
revolve), and, being dependent on the magnet, the magnet is
caused to revolve with them.

 Absolute Measurements in Electricity and Magnetism. By ANDREw
    GRAY, M.A., F.R.S.E., Chief Assistant to the Professor of Natural
    Philosophy in the University of Glasgow [now Professor of Physics
    in University College, Bangor]. London: Macmillan and Co.,
    1884 (pp. xiv-H 194; sm. 8vo).
 THE chief function of this little book is to describe the prin
        ciples and methods of electrical measurement, as introduced
 and modified by Sir William Thomson, and in use at Glasgow
 University. With some slight additions it is a reprint of articles
 published in “Nature’; and it contains in a convenient form some
 very useful practical details and hints, which are evidently given
 by one thoroughly conversant with the apparatus described.
    The first chapter contains an account of the usual method of
 determining the earth's horizontal intensity and the moments of
 magnets, carried out with extemporized but quite satisfactory ap
 pliances—appliances, indeed, in many respects more in accord
with the demands of theory than are the present Kew instruments.
Then, after a chapter of definitions, comes the tangent galvanometer,
with its elementary theory fully worked out. Then a full and
instructive description of Sir W. Thomson's two new “graded"
galvanometers for measuring potential and current respectively.
The range and versatility of these instruments render them very
serviceable in a laboratory, though they are probably too complex
and delicate for workshop manipulation; and the account of their
uses, by one who is so thoroughly familiar with their working as
is Mr. Gray, gives the little book a unique value.
    Methods of measuring resistance, some of them well known,
others less known, are given pretty fully ; and a very interesting
chapter on the measurement of intense magnetic fields concludes
the practical portion of the book.
    Not many electricians know how to measure the intensity of
the field between the poles of an electromagnet, but it is a matter
of vital importance in the construction of dynamos; and if the
methods here described enable measurements of magnetic fields to
be carried out with anything like the same glibness as is now the
case with currents and resistances, the book will have done good
service and much aided the practical development of the science.
This is indeed too much to expect, but a beginning can now be
made; and the still-needed practical instrument, convenient and
 simple in use, yet able to effect measurement of fields with
 reasonable accuracy, will before long be invented.
     Concerning the more theoretical portions of the book, they are
  not different from what is already common property; nevertheless,
  isolated as they here are from more difficult matter, and embodied
  in a small compass, these portions will be found very useful for
  college classes such as ordinarily go by the name of “ Senior.”

Evercises on Electrical and Magnetic Measurement. By R. E. DAY,
   M.A. New Edition. Longmans, Green, and Co. (Pp. 188.)
THE object of this work is explained by the quotation in the
preface from a lecture by Sir W. Thomson —“In physical
science a first essential step in the direction of learning any subject
is to find principles of numerical reckoning and methods for prac
tically measuring some quality connected with it. I often say that
when you can measure what you are speaking about and express it
in numbers, you know something about it; but when you cannot
measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge
is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind: it may be the beginning of
knowledge, but you have scarcely in your thoughts advanced to the
 stage of science whatever the matter may be.” We have here a
 collection of 580 problems in Electricity and Magnetism; and any
 student who has worked through these examples, or who is able to
 correctly work any of them, may be satisfied that he is possessed
 of a thorough knowledge of the elementary portions of these
 sciences. The book is, however, something more than a mere col
 lection of problems. Many of the problems, some at least in each
 section, are worked out in full, so that the book forms almost a
 treatise upon the subject. For example, in treating of Ohm's law,
we have a proof (possibly not altogether as simple as it might be),
involving only simple algebra, of the condition for maximum cur
rent from a given number of cells, viz. that they must be so arranged
as to have an internal resistance as nearly as possible equal to the
external resistance. Most elementary textbooks simply state that
this can be proved by the use of the differential calculus; but it is
 much more satisfactory to the student to have a proof given him.
    The book is prefaced by an explanation of the C.G.S. system of
 units; and whilst most of the problems are given in the practical
 units—the volt, ampere, and ohm—yet a sufficient number are
 expressed in the theoretical units, to make sure that the student is
 able to employ either system, and understands the relationship
 between the two systems. We can thoroughly recommend this
 work as one most useful to the student.
    Numerical Tables and Constants. By SYDNEY LUPTON, M.A.
                    Macmillan and Co. (Pp. 96.)
THIS is a small book containing a very large amount of useful
information, and science teachers will be grateful to Mr. Lupton
for this very useful compilation. The book will, however, very
probably be found to be in use both too large and too small. The

analyst, for example, will be disposed to think the tables which he
most frequently requires too limited; while he may be disposed to
think that tables of the values of Hebrew, Greek, and Roman
measures, of the number of vibrations per second which constitute
F: or Db, of Geological formations, or of Tide-tables, are (to him)
useless matter. In view of the small size of the present (first)
edition, we trust that in a second edition many of the tables may
be extended. For example, it would be most useful to have,
instead of the present page of 4-figure logarithms, a table of
5-figure logarithms; the table of trigonometrical ratios might with
great advantage be enlarged; and the same remarks apply to the
tables of boiling-points, the table for the conversion of tempe
ratures, and the table of lengths of rivers. We would further
suggest that in the table of rotation of polarized light the effect
of temperature should be taken into account; and that the compa
rison of electromotive forces for various batteries should be sup
plemented by some statement of their usual internal resistances.
A little more explanation might occasionally be given; e. g. in the
first table, at present, stands the statement that when n = 2,
; = 50,000, which of course is not intended.      Still these are small
matters which can easily be set right in a second edition, which will
no doubt soon be required.

 THE     following communications were read:—
      1. “On the South-western Extension of the Clifton Fault.”
 By Prof. C. Lloyd Morgan, F.G.S., Assoc. R.S.M.
    This fault cuts across the strata out of which the Avon gorge has
 been excavated, a little north of the Suspension Bridge. According
 to the author's estimate the throw of the fault is, on the Gloucester
 shire bank, somewhat less than 1200 feet, and somewhat more than
 1100 feet on the Somersetshire bank. The difference of nearly 100 feet
 the author considered to be, in part at least, due to the dying-out of
 the fault to the west. Taking as a datum-point the intersection of
 the line of fault and the line of high-water mark, the rocks relatively
 shifted downwards are, on the Gloucestershire bank, Mountain
 Limestone 730 feet, Upper Limestone Shales 470 feet. According
 to this estimate there would be 130 feet of Upper Limestone Shales

144                      Geological Society:
above high-water mark, above which beds of Millstone Grit would
be brought down. This accords with observed facts. On the
Somersetshire bank the beds brought down below high-water mark
are Mountain Limestone 770 feet, Upper Limestone Shales 330 feet.
According to this estimate there would be 270 feet of Upper Lime
stone Shales above high-water mark, which would thus leave little
or no room for Millstone Grit to be brought down to the surface.
Nor has the author succeeded in finding any sign of this rock on the
Somersetshire side.
   Owing to the fact that softer Upper Limestone Shales are brought
down by the fault, its westward extension may be traced by a line
of depression resulting from the greater erosion of these softer beds.
In the map which the author exhibited, a triangular wedge of
Upper Limestone Shales, brought down by the fault, had its apex
near Hill Farm (see Survey Map), and its base abutting on the
Triassic beds south of Durdham Down.         If the fault do not tend to
die out westwards, the apex of this triangle must be placed further
S.W., for which there is no evidence, while there is some against it.
The southern side of the triangle marks the line of fault. Further
west the author believed that evidence exists of the faulting-down
of a wedge of Mountain Limestone into the Lower Limestone
Shales.

Silurian Rocks of North America.” By Prof. E. W. Claypole, B.A.,
B.Sc., Lond., F.G.S.
   3. “On some West-Indian Phosphate Deposits.” By George
Hughes, Esq., F.C.S. (Communicated by W. T. Blanford, Esq.,
LL.D., F.R.S., Sec. G.S.)
   Some West-Indian specimens of phosphates were exhibited, in
reference to which the author called attention to a description by
Dana of an instance in which the carbonate of lime in fragments
of coral was partially converted into phosphate, and also to the
apparent alteration of limestone rock into phosphate of lime in
Barbuda Island by the action of water draining a guano-like deposit
of bats' dung in a cave. A specimen of the phosphate of lime thus
produced was exhibited.
    In Aruba Island the process of conversion of coral-rock into
phosphate of lime has been in operation on so extensive a scale that
the deposit is being largely worked for shipment. The alteration is
probably due to the action of water containing soluble phosphates
derived from the excrements of sea-birds (guano). Of this guano
 no trace remains; but the fragments of coral in the underlying rock
have been altered into a substance containing from 78 to 80 per cent.
of phosphate of lime; and the deposit, as shipped, contains 35.7 per
 cent. of phosphoric acid, equal to 77.9 per cent. of tribasic phosphate.
    Reference was also made to some other West-Indian phosphate

Lower Silurian Rocks, near Welshpool, Wales.” By George Robert
Wine, Esq. (Communicated by Prof. P. Martin Duncan, F.R.S.,
F.G.S.)
    January 14, 1885.-Prof. T. G. Bonney, D.Sc., LL.D., F.R.S.,
                       President, in the Chair.
   The following communications were read:—
   1. “The Metamorphism of Dolerite into Hornblende-schist.”
By J. J. Harris Teall, Esq., M.A., F.G.S.
   The author referred to two dykes which occur in the neighbour
hood of Scourie, Sutherlandshire. Their general direction is N.W.
and S.E.; and as the prevalent strike of the gneissic banding is,
roughly speaking, N.E. and S.W. (not N.W. and S.E. as is usually
the case with the Hebridean gneiss of Sutherland), there can be no
doubt as to their true character. It is impossible to regard them
as bands in the gneiss.
   The author's observations referred more particularly to the
southern dyke, which is well exposed on the sea-shore on the north
side of Scourie Bay, and especially at the promontory named Creag
a' Mºháil. The rock of this dyke occurs in two very different forms,
which are proved by chemical analysis to agree very closely in com
position. The one is a typical dolerite (German “ diabase”), the
other a typical hornblende-schist. Transitions from one form to the
other are easily traced.   Weins of quartz and, in one case, a vein of
nearly pure andesine were observed in the dyke. An analysis of
the latter mineral was given in the paper.
   The original rock is composed of pyroxene, lath-shaped felspars,
titaniferous iron-ore, frequently in skeleton rhombohedra, and apa
tite.  This may be traced by gradual stages into a massive rock, in
which the augite has been completely replaced by green hornblende,
and the original microstructure entirely destroyed. The modifica
tions in the felspar-substance have not been worked out; but the
resulting product is frequently a colourless mineral, without any
definite external boundaries, and often difficult to distinguish from
quartz. In many cases the author found himself unable to decide
whether the colourless grains occurring in the altered rock were
quartz or felspar, or some mineral resulting from the modification
of felspar.
   The massive rock in places passes into a typical hornblende-schist,
and the transition may be often seen in a hand specimen. The
schist is composed principally of crystalline grains of green horn
blende, a colourless mineral or minerals (quartz and felspar 2), tita
niferous iron-ore, sphene, and apatite. The hornblende grains show

146                      Geological Society:—
no definite crystalline form, and they have their longest axes, which
correspond for the most part with the vertical axes of hornblende
crystals, lying parallel to each other in the plane of schistosity. In
fact the different grains show a striking amount of uniformity in
their arrangement in the mass of the rock, the corresponding axes
of elasticity lying, as a rule, approximately parallel to each other.
The titaniferous magnetic ore is never present as skeleton rhombo
hedra, but is drawn out into long strips in the plane of schistosity,
and frequently more or less surrounded by granules of sphene.
Apatite occurs in broken prisms. Turbid grains of felspar are fre
quently, but not always, present.
   The author argued that the schist has been produced by meta
morphic action subsequent to the consolidation of the original rock.
This metamorphic action has sometimes resulted only in the mole
cular rearrangement of the different constituents, but where the
unequal distribution of stress has given rise to a kind of plastic
movement in the mass a typical crystalline schist has been produced.
   The distribution of foliation in the dyke is not in accordance with
any simple law. Sometimes it is parallel to the sides and some
times it runs across the dyke. In the latter case it agrees, as far
as strike is concerned, with the prevalent direction of the gneissic
bands in the district. In many places and for considerable dis
tances no trace of foliation can be detected.
   In conclusion the author pointed out that the metamorphism of
basic igneous rocks into hornblende-schist had been discussed by
many previous writers. He also acknowledged his great indebted
ness to Prof. Lapworth.
   2. “Sketch of the Geology of New Zealand.” By Captain F. W.
Hutton, F.G.S., Professor of Biology in the Canterbury College,
University of New Zealand.                           -
   The paper commenced with some general remarks on the impor
tance and variety of the geology of New Zealand, and on the pro
gress made in the investigation of the islands. The author then
proceeded to the question of the classification of the sedimentary
strata, which he arranges in the following local systems:–
       Systems.                              Probable age.
     Recent.                        Recent.
     Pleistocene.                    Pleistocene.

     Maitaí.                        Carboniferous.

     Manapo<U+017F>iri.                    Archaean.
  Most of these systems are divided into several local series.

    Mr. T. M. Reade on the Drift–deposils of Colwyn Bay.          147
    The general geological structure was then treated.     The south
island of New Zealand was shown to be traversed from near the
southern extremity to Tasman's Bay by a curved anticlinal, convex
to the westward; and the strata to the east of this axis are thrown
into secondary folds, which mainly affect the beds older than
 º inal.
             A great north-and-south fault occurs west of the anti
    The north island is very different. It is traversed by a narrow
ridge, the country northward of which is broken by three great
volcanic cones, Mount Egmont, Ruapehu, and Tongariro near the
centre of the island.   The oldest rocks seen south of Cook's Straits
are not repeated to the north, and a fault may traverse the Straits.
    The rock-systems up to the Hokanui inclusive are similar in
lithological character throughout New Zealand, and appear to have
been formed on the shore of a continent with large rivers.        The
higher systems, with the exception of a few coral-reef limestones,
are locally variable and may be considered insular.
    The relative distribution of sedimentary and eruptive rocks was
briefly noticed, and the occurrence of some useful minerals men
tioned. No workable coal is found below the base of the Waipara
system.
    A description of the different systems, and of the series into
which they are divided, followed, commencing with the oldest. The
distribution, lithology, and thickness of each system were noticed
briefly, and lists of the most important fossils were added. The
eruptive rocks associated with each system were next noticed in the
same order; and the paper concluded with notes on the distribution
of volcanic rocks in the north island, on hot springs, and on the
minerals found in New Zealand.
    3. “The Drift–deposits of Colwyn Bay.” By T. Mellard Reade,
Esq., F.G.S.
    The author, after referring to a former paper (Quart. Journ.
 Geol. Soc. vol. xxxix. p. 111), described the drifts of Colwyn Bay
 as forming cliffs towards the sea, and thinning out inland, forming
 a crescent-shaped deposit, which lies for the most part upon Silurian
 rock of Wenlock age, while the two headlands of Colwyn Head and
 Rhos Point are denuded remnants of Carboniferous Limestone.
 He distinguished three divisions in the drifts:–1. Bluish-grey Till,
 composed of disintegrated Silurian and Carboniferous rocks, and
 full of striated fragments of slaty rock, with few granite boulders;
 its surface is unevenly denuded. 2. Brown Boulder-clay repre
 senting the Low-level Boulder-clay and Sands, overlying the former,
 evidently a marine deposit, and containing shell-fragments. To
 this bed the author referred most of the erratics found on the shore,
 which included boulders of Eskdale and Scotch granites; and
 3. Rearranged gravels. The line of demarcation between numbers
 1 and 2 is particularly clear.
    The author considered the Bluish-grey Till to be here, as else

 148          Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
 where, chiefly, if not entirely, made up from the denudation of the
 local rocks, the material being brought down by the action of ice
 and snow from the high ground lying inland; while the overlying
 deposit of brown Boulder-clay is part of the great sheet of Low
 level Boulder-clay and Sands which occupies the plains of the north
 of England from the mountains to the shores of the Irish Sea, and,
 like the more sandy Boulder-clays near Liverpool, its materials were
 probably derived chiefly from Triassic rocks, which occur in the
 neighbouring Vale of Clwyd, mixed with material derived from
 other rocks, and especially with argillaceous matter from the under
 lying Till. The granite boulders contained in it were carried to
 where they lie by floating ice.

  A NEW METHOD OF DETERMINING THE CONSTANT OF GRAVITA
         TION.    BY ARTHUR KöNIG AND FRANZ RICHARZ.
 IN    the older experiments for determining the constant of gravi
      tation the pendulum and the torsion-balance were used as mea
 suring-instruments. Both apparatus were, however, far excelled by
 the balance which was first applied to problems of gravitation by
 Herr von Jolly". He counterbalanced one and the same mass in
 one case by placing weights in a scale-pan on the same level, and
 in another case by placing weights on a scale-pan at a depth of 21
 metres, and connected with the upper one by a wire. The differ
 ence represented the decrease of gravity with height. He then
 arranged below the lower pan a lead ball weighing 5775 grammes,
 and again determined the corresponding difference. The increased
 difference represented the attraction of the lead ball on the weights
 in the lower scale; for the lead ball, as experiment showed, exerted
 no measurable action on the upper scale-pan. The most material
 sources of error are the unavoidable differences in temperature
 arising from the height of the place of observation, as well as the
 friction due to currents of air on the wire of 21 metres.
    Quite independently of each other we have arrived at a method
in which a fourfold attraction of the mass of lead used in measuring
by the balance comes into play, and, moreover, differences in tem
 perature and currents of air can be almost entirely avoided.
   In the middle of the horizontal surface of a parallelopipedal
 block of lead a balance is so arranged that its pans are just over
the surface. Below each pan the block is bored through vertically,
and by means of two rods passing through these holes two other
pans are so suspended from the upper pans that they are just
below the block.

   A mass m on the upper right pan is counterpoised by a weight
m, placed in the lower left pan. The same mass m is then placed
in the lower right pan, and is counterpoised by weights mo placed

calculation, let us assume that the absolute value of the vertical
components of the accelerating forces which the block exerts on
the upper and lower scale is the same; let it be denoted by k. If
go and gu represent the values of gravity at the upper and lower
scales respectively, we have for the two weighings the equations
                         m(go +k)=m,(gu-k),
                         m(gu-k)=mo<U+017F>go-HR);

    The magnitude y is to be determined by weighings, which are
 to be made in the same balance in the same way before building up
 the lead block. If m stands for the same mass as above, and
 m', and m', correspond to the above values mu and mo, we have
  for two such weighings

pointed out that en and 3'm are both positive.

   The differential quotient  º may be calculated from the known

Our observations give the constant of gravitation G, and therefore
also the mean density of the Earth.
   We have already taken the preliminary steps for the experimental
execution of this method. We think of using a mass of lead which
has about twice the attraction of the ball used by Herr von Jolly;
 the determination of k may therefore, other things being equal, be
made with eight times the certainty. Moreover, from the consi
 derably smaller distance of the upper from the lower scale-pans,
 1 to 2 metres, we are in a position to exchange the weights
within a closed case by our automatic arrangement, by which cur
rents of air and differences of temperature are almost entirely
avoided. We may therefore accept with certainty a far greater
accuracy for our determinations.—Sitzungsberichte der Akad. der

RESULTS FOR USE IN CALCULATIONS WITH MANOMETERS WITH
               COMPRESSED AIR.       BY E. H. AMAGAT.
   I gave some years ago the numerical results necessary for
calculations with compressed air between 20 to 30, and 430
atmospheres; but these results were not reduced to the standard
pressure as starting-point, partly because my series began at
pressures higher than those at which Regnault's series end, and
partly because these latter series were obtained at a temperature
which is too different from that at which I worked.         In all the
researches in which I have hitherto determined the pressure with
a nitrogen-manometer, I took this difference into account, by a
method which it is needless to describe here.     On the other hand,
the results obtained by M. Cailletet and by myself exhibit such
differences as to make a verification necessary.

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                151
   I have made this verification for air and nitrogen up to 85
atmospheres; and at the same time I have made the deter
minations necessary for referring the series to the normal pres
sure which is indispensable in the construction of manometers.
These experiments were made in one of the towers of the church
of Fourvières, where, thanks to the kindness of M. Sainte-Marie
Perrin, the architect of the monument, I had at my disposal a
vertical height of 63 metres during the whole time necessary for
frequently repeating the series. I retained the method I had used
at the shaft at Werpilleux, but with some improvements. The
glass manometers were so arranged that the gas occupied at least
the value of 500 divisions of the stem; the diameter of the iron
tubes was double; the conditions were favourable for exactly
reducing the volumes of mercury to zero.
   The various series agreed perfectly. For nitrogen the results at
which I arrived are almost identical with those of my former
experiments. The differences do not in general exceed a thousandth
of the total pressure, except in one point of the curve which I had
already noted as irregular. The differences with M. Cailletet's
numbers exist still ; between 40 and 60 metres they correspond to
an error of more than 2 metres of mercury.
   In the following table the values of the product pu for nitrogen
and air are for the temperature 16°; they are compared with the
standard pressure, for which they are supposed equal to unity.

      40’00      0-9896     0-9824
   The deviations for 20 metres are considerably lower than those
 which had been given by Regnault, which is explained by the fact
 that Regnault had worked at 4°. For nitrogen the minimum of
 the product pu corresponds to a pressure of 42 metres; in my first
 researches it was 45 metres.       For air it is 59 metres.     It must
 moreover be remarked that the variation of pu is here so small near
 the minimum, that an unimportant difference in the pressure may
 displace the minimum ordinate through several metres.
    Within the limits of the above table we may either use air or
 nitrogen for filling the manometers; for higher pressures it will
 be preferable to choose nitrogen, which has been directly studied.
 It will be sufficient to reduce proportionally all the numbers which

I gave up to 430 atmospheres to have them at the normal
pressure.
   For pressures above 430 atmospheres we may obtain exact results
by using hydrogen. I have in fact shown that for this gas the
curve representing the values of pu is a straight line; we may
without hesitation prolong this line to far higher pressures ; this
is what I am doing in researches in which I have worked under
pressures of several thousand atmospheres, and of which I shall
before long give an account to the Academy.—Comptes Rendus,

    Mr. F. Jacob, in a letter addressed to Dr. Guthrie and fowarded
to us, has kindly drawn our attention to the fact that the method
of observation of loss of heat described by us in the Postscript to
our paper “On Gas-Engine Indicator-Diagrams,” and which was
used in obtaining the results referred to in the postscript, is not,
as we thought, new, having also been used by the late Sir W.
Siemens, and described by him in his paper “On the Dependence
of Radiation on Temperature,” read before the Royal Society on
April 26, 1883; to whom of course we hasten to cede the priority.
   We may add that Mr. J. T. Bottomley, in his paper just pub
lished in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, “On the Permanent
Temperature of Conductors through which an Electric Current is
 assing ” &c., has also described the use of the same method, and
 e tells us that he, like ourselves, was unaware of Sir W. Siemens's

XX. On the Seat of the Electromotive Forces in the Voltaic Cell.
             By Professor OLIVER J. LoDGE, D.Sc.
   To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
     GENTLEMEN,
THE accompanying tract is an expansion of a paper drawn
      up as the opening of a discussion on Contact Electricity
by Section A of the British Association at the Montreal
Meeting. It is in five portions or chapters. The first of
these [printed this month] is mainly historical; in the second
and third portions theoretical views are considered, and my own
are given at some length in accordance with the kind advice
of Sir W. Thomson ; the two remaining chapters are occu
pied with cognate thermoelectric phenomena, with the theory
of the simple voltaic cell, which singularly enough is pretty
complicated and very litte understood, and with a discussion
on the size of atoms. Although the paper is being printed in
the annual volume of the Association, it has been suggested
that a further publication of it might be useful in order that
Physicists may have a better and more leisurely opportunity of
contributing to the discussion of a matter which must have
occupied the attention of every one more or less, which branches
out into several interesting and important developments, and
which, as a matter of controversy, has remained singularly
long unsettled. I will therefore ask you to find room for it
in your Journal, in the hope that the iº may be there
conveniently continued and properly closed.

    1. The subject chosen for the present discussion illustrates
in a remarkable way the need for such conversations. It is
scarcely credible, at the present rate of progress, that eighty
four years after the discovery of the voltaic pile, opinion
should still be utterly divided as to the seat of the main E.M.F.
in it. I venture to hope that it may now be decided, and a
substantial agreement arrived at with respect to it. My busi
ness is to open the discussion; but it so happens that for some
seven or eight years I have believed myself to see more or
less clearly to the root of this particular matter, and a labori
ous review of the literature of the subject has only strengthened
my conviction. Having, therefore, strong and definite views
I can hardly help letting them appear; and without assuming
prematurely that these views are agreed with, they may yet
serve as a link with which to connect the facts and the mul
tifarious observations thereon.
   In the course of my reading on the subject I have found
only two great and epoch-making papers, that of Volta in
1801, and that of Sir William Thomson in 1851.                                               The other
contributions are some of them keen, like those of Faraday
and Clerk Maxwell ; some of them laborious, like those of
Hankel and Ayrton and Perry; but none contain anything
essentially and powerfully new except those two : unless,
indeed, we include in the subject the immensely important
phenomena of Seebeck and of Peltier, and Faraday's funda
mental law of electro-chemical decomposition.
   Volta” showed that when two metals were put into contact
and separated, the insulated one was charged with electricity
sufficient to make gold leaves diverge. He also stated that
the contact force between any two metals was independent of
intermediate metals, so that the metals could be arranged in
a definite numerical series; and he gave the first series of the
kind:— Zn--Pb--Sn--Fe-Cu--Ag.

 Moreover, he started a hypothesis to account for the action, a
 sort of impulsion or attraction of electricity by matter—an
idea subsequently elaborated by Helmholtz. Fabroni" ob
jected to Volta’s explanation of his experiment. He denied
contact force, and considered that the electricity was developed
by chemical action.
     Then the fight began, and lasted on and off some half-century.
On the one side were Volta, Davy, Pfaff, Péclet, Marianini,
Buff, Fechner, Zamboni, Matteucci, and Kohlrausch. On
the other were Fabroni, Wollaston, Parrot, CErsted, Ritchie,
Pouillet, Schönbein, Becquerel, De la Rive, and Faraday.
     It was not all fighting : part of it resulted in a more
thorough investigation of voltaic phenomena; and very often
the original point of dispute was lost sight of, and V.
fact itself was doubted in the eagerness to disprove Volta's
explanation. The experiments . and Péclett, however,
fairly well established the correctness of his observation; and
Kohlrausch showed how, by means of a Daniell’s cell combined
with a condenser, to measure Volta forces absolutely, thus in
venting a method which has been employed with modifications
by Hankel, by Gerland, by Clifton, by Ayrton and Perry, by
Von Zahn, and by most other experimenters on the subject<U+017F>.

This crux is on p. 306, and consists in substituting ZnSO, for H, SO, in
a Grove cell, and showing that the current through a thin wire galvano
meter is stronger than before. This, he says, leaves no further shift or
evasion (Ausflucht) for the chemical theory. It is a fact we have grown
accustomed to, but it is rather    º           at the E.M.F. given by §§§
should be even higher than that given by H.S.O.. A convenient “Aus
flucht” could nevertheless be provided for the chemical theory by pointing
out that the combustion heat Zn, 2NO, is greater than Zn, SO,-H,SO,
 +2(H,NO,), if indeed the fact be so. Another shift is to talk about
basic sulphate and the sourness of ZnSO, ; another is to use the word
“dissociation.”
    f Kohlrausch's method consisted in bringing the plates of the two
metals close together, connecting them by a wire for an instant, sepa
rating them, and putting one into connection with a Dellman electrometer,
 the other with the earth. The observation is repeated with a Daniell in
the connecting wire, first one way, then the other. Thus three equations

Both the plates are insulated by silk threads. The fixed wire, d, with
  which the raised plate comes into contact, leads to a Dellman electro
  meter. The connections are arranged for determining the “electro
  scopic tension" on the poles of an open battery, to see if it is the same
  as the E.M.F. (See Pogg. Ann. 1848, vol. lxxv. pp. 88 and 220.)
  This apparatus he also used to measure the Volta effect between two
metals, his classical memoir on the subject being in Poggendorff's Annalem,
1851, vol. lxxxii. p. 1. Later he improved the condenser, bringing it into
the form shown in the following figure.

     Wherever electrostatic methods were employed, and where
 the electroscope was the instrument of research, contact theo
 rists had it all their own way; and it was only by apparent
 effort and twisting of experiments that chemical theorists
 could maintain their ground. But when electric currents
 were dealt with, and the galvanometer used, then the chemists
 had their turn, and they showed most conclusively that no
 mere contact could maintain a current unless heat disappeared
 or chemical action occurred : a fact obvious enough to us to
 day on the principles so laboriously and finally established by
 Joule. By means of the galvanometer, the contact theory
 WaS SO ... by Faraday that it ultimately seemed to
 give up the ghost, and the chemical doctrines triumphed. So
 much so, that Volta's original fact, in spite of the evidence
 which had been accumulated, was again doubted ; and one
 finds in text-books culled from this period statements that
 Volta must have had wet fingers, or that he rubbed the plates
 together, or that there was moisture in the air. Also hints
 are given that films existed on the plate, that squeezed coats
 of varnish or lacquer might produce some electricity, and so
on. It was pointed out, moreover, by De la Rive", how
minute a trace of chemical action could produce how much
 electricity, and how little electrictity could affect an electro
 scope. But it is to be noted that any chemical action caused
 by damp on the plates, or moisture in the air, would be of the
 nature of local action, and local action is not a satisfactory pro
ducer of manageable electricity. Sir Humphry Davy is very
 clear on this head. He shows that chemical action need pro
duce no electricity, instancing the burning of iron nitre on
charcoal, potash and acid in a crucible or an electroscope, &c.;
a plate of zinc placed on mercury and separated is found posi
tive, but if left long enough to amalgamate, the compound
shows no signs of electricity. Davy's views are singularly
advanced, and are worth quotingf.

   t Davy, Bakerian Lecture, 1806 (see Phil. Trans. 1807, p. 39):-" As
the chemical attraction between two bodies seems to be destroyed by
giving one of them an electrical state different from that which it naturally
  OSSèSSes . . . . . so it may be increased by exalting its natural energy.
  hus, while zinc is incapable of combining with oxygen when negatively
electrified in the circuit even by a feeble power, silver easily unites to it
when positively electrified. . . . . . Among the substances that combine
chemically, all those, the electrical energies of which are well known,
exhibit opposite electrical states.... In the present state of our knowledge
it would be useless to attempt to speculate on the remote cause of the
electrical energy, or the reason why different bodies after being brought
into contact should be found differently electrified; its relation to chemi
cal affinity is, however, sufficiently evident. May it not be identical with

 here and there, two papers a          .#.        1851 by the President
 of this Section, which were the triumph and apotheosis of the
 chemical theory of the source of the current in the voltaic
 cell”. In one of these papers (that on “Electrolysis") it is
 irrefutably established, on the basis of the conservation of
 it, and an essential property of matter?"—Page 44: “The great tendency
 of the attraction of the different chemical agents by the positive and nega
 tive surfaces in the Voltaic apparatus seems to be to restore the electrical
 equilibrium....The electrical energies of the metals with regard to each
 other or the substance dissolved in the water, seems to be the cause that
 disturbs the equilibrium, and the chemical changes the cause that tends
 to restore the equilibrium; and the phenomena most probably depend on
 their joint agency.” He then gives a very Voltaic account of the action
 of the pile—much in agreement with Sir Wm. Thomson; and endeavours
 to reconcile chemical and contact theorists by pointing out how essential
 a part chemical action plays in the production of a current, a most clear
 sighted thing to do at that date. One more sentence may be quoted from
this remarkable paper, though it is not quite so striking as the preceding.
—Page 49: “These ideas are evidently directly in contradiction to the
opinions advanced by Fabroni, and which in the early stage of the investi
gation appeared extremely probable, viz. that chemical changes are the
primary cause of the phenomena of Galvanism. Before the experiments
of M. Volta on the electricity excited by mere contact of metals were
  ublished, I had to a certain extent adopted this opinion; but the new
fact immediately proved that another power must necessarily be con
cerned, for it was not possible to refer the electricity exhibited by the
opposition of metallic surfaces to any chemical alterations, particularly as
the effect is more distinct in a dry atmosphere, in which even the most
oxidizable metals do not change, than in a moist one, in which many
metals undergo oxidation.”

phenomena the then new principle of the conservation of energy. He

the mechanical theory of the E.M.F. of voltaic cells, of thermoelectric
piles, and of magneto-machines; anticipating in many respects the some
what later though independent work of Sir W.Thomson on these subjects.

energy, that, making exception of such irreversible effects as
are not readily brought into calculation, and allowing for
certain possible reversible effects to be investigated thermo
electrically, the E.M.F. of a cell is not only dependent on the
chemical action going on, but is calculable numerically in
absolute measure on purely chemical data supplied provision
ally by Dr. Andrews. It is proper to say, however, that this
brilliant theory is avowedly based on the laborious and acute
experimental work of Joule on the conservation of energy in
the voltaic circuit*.
    In the other of the two papers (that on “Thermo-electricity”)
it was shown that, from the fact that a current absorbed or
generated heat at a metallic junction, an E.M.F. was neces
sarily situated there—in other words, that the Peltier effect
necessitated the previously discovered Seebeck one.
     The establishment of the conservation of energy, by Joule,
 for ever placed beyond doubt the fact that the energy of the
 electric current produced by a battery was due to, and was
 the equivalent of, the chemical actions going on there ; but it
 was supposed, and is still supposed           g.       as I venture to
 think, quite erroneously), to leave untouched the question as
 to the precise seat of the E.M.F. in a battery.
      However that may be, the success of the chemical theory
 of the electric current naturally caused it to be still more
 certainly assumed that the apparent contact-force of Volta
 could also be accounted for by accidental chemical action, and
 that without some chemical action somewhere no Wolta effect
 could be produced. This, also, I believe to be quite false;
 provided always that the phrase “chemical action ” be used in
 its ordinary sense as meaning combination, and that the word
 “action ” be not explained away as meaning anything what
 ever.
      2. The triumph of the chemical theorists with regard to the
 Volta effect was, however, shortlived, for, from 1860, the in
  vention of the quadrant electrometer put into the hands of
  electrostatic experimenters a far more refined and delicate in
  strument than could have been thought possible a few years
  before ; and the illustrious inventor of that instrument him
  self for ever put the truth of Volta's phenomenon beyond
  doubt, by the most simple and beautiful device of           *
   a charged torsion-arm over a zinc-copper junction. By com
   paring the deflection so produced with that caused by a

  in Chemical Combination,” Phil. Mag. [4] iii. p. 481. See also Reprint

160             Prof. Oliver Lodge on the Seat of the
Daniell cell, an absolute measure of the so-called contact-force
was made ; and it was shown that, uniting the copper and
zinc by a drop of water, instead of by a metal, no deflection
was produced. It was also shown that the deflection was
greatest when the zinc was clean and the copper oxidized".
   But Sir William Thomson went further than this: he
sounded a theoretic note, and in a sentence revived the whole
controversy about the seat of power in the pile. The sentence
is this:—“For nearly two years I have felt quite sure that
the proper explanation of voltaic action in the common voltaic
arrangement is something very near Volta's, which fell into
discredit because Volta or his followers neglected the prin
ciple of the conservation of force. I now think it quite
certain that two metals dipped into one electrolytic liquid
will (when polarization is done away with) be at the same
potential.” And then he goes on to one of those brilliant
and extraordinary speculations characteristic of no one else,
and applies this apparent contact-force to determine a lower
limit to the size of atoms—an application obviously of tran
scendent interest, and of more importance than all the previous
outcome of contact discussions put together f.
   The whole subject now acquired a fresh interest, and the
new series of experimental determinations of contact-force
began.
   3. Hankel’s and Gerland's measurements belong to this
period in point of date (1861–69), though in method and motive
they probably are the outcome of the earlier periodf. Hankel
uses a modified Kohlrausch method and a Bohnenberger or

   t “There cannot be a doubt that the whole theory is simply chemical
action at a distance. Zinc and copper connected by a metal wire attract
each other from any distance, so do platinum plates coated with oxygen
and hydrogen respectively. I can now tell the amount of the force, and
calculate how great a proportion of chemical affinity is used up electro
lytically before two such disks come within any specified small distance
  own to a limit within which molecular heterogeneousness becomes sen
sible.  This of course gives a definite limit for the size of atoms.”—

The liquid, L, is in a funnel-tube, A, B; C is a copper plate, and M the
   metal under observation. First, p touches C for an instant, then C is
  raised and made to touch p", which leads to a Hankel electrometer.
           This gives           Cu/M-H-M/L =koz.
   Then the liquid is run out of the funnel, a plate of the metal M is placed
   on its mouth, and the experiment     º

   In all these expressions air contact-forces are, as usual, neglected. But
   it is very tempting to try if, by increasing the number of such equations,
   one cannot calculate some metal/air contact-forces. Thus the special
  case when M is copper gives one more equation. We can then take
  zinc instead of M, and can also make the condenser-plate of zinc
  instead of copper, and so on; but we get no forwarder, fresh unknowns
  . as fast as additional equations, and some of the equations are
  liable to degenerate into identities.
    So far back as 1824 Becquerel" attempted the investiga
tion of metal-liquid contacts; and Bufff made some measure
ments in 1842, but his results are scarcely likely to be reliable
considering the poor experimental resources of that date.
    Professor Clifton employed Kohlrausch's method in 1877,
using a Thomson, electrometer and a Clark cell as standard
of E.M.F. He has only published a preliminary papert, in
which he overlooks minutiae such as change of contact

capsule on the plate of an electroscope, and connected it with the con
denser plate by his fingers.

   On the appearance of Clifton's paper the year after, they
issued a strongly worded claim * in respect both of         º
and completeness—a claim which seems to me well established,
for their results are the most comprehensive yet obtained,
and the energy needed to devise, construct, and use such an
apparatus as the one they depict must have been immense.
A convenient summary of their numbers is to be found in
Everett’s “Units, second edition. The main result achieved
by them is the experimental establishment of the summation
law for all substances (this is not to be confused with Volta's
summation or series law, which is only applicable to metals),
viz. that the total E.M.F. of a closed circuit of any number
of substances may be reckoned by adding up the Volta forces
observed electrostatically for every pair of substances in con
tact. This law is, it seems to me, for reasons given later
(§. 7), very probable theoretically; but still it was quite
essential to have it experimentally established, especially as
Ayrton and Perry point out that it is often called in question
without good ground. The establishment of this law is, I
say, perhaps their main work in this matter, besides the

   Clifton arrives at the same conclusion with regard to sum
mation, and gives handy diagrams, reproduced in Jenkins's
* Electricity, of the contact-force at the different junctions.
My own opinion is that the intended and obvious significance
of these diagrams is theoretically wrong, but they embody
certain experimental results conveniently, and they can be
interpreted properly.
   Both Clifton and Ayrton and Perry appear to believe in
the great constancy of the value Zn/Cu. Clifton gives it as
'8516 volt (“Quelle précision " " somewhat sarcastically eja
culates Pellat, who himself finds it to vary between '63 and
‘92). Ayrton and Perry assert that it is more constant than
a Daniell.    I believe that both Professor Clifton and Pro
fessors Ayrton and Perry have made several experiments
besides those recorded in their communications to the Royal
Society; but as they have not been published, I can give no
account of them.
   Among the Theses presented to the Faculty of Science in
Paris in 1881 we find an important memoir by Pellat”,
which reviews the whole position very clearly, and records
a series of determinations of Volta force among metals,
determinations which are evidently the most accurate and
satisfactory yet made. He adopts the capital experimental
method of neutralizing the charge of a condenser by a Pog
gendorff or compensation method, and thus converts Kohl
rausch's into a null method, for which a very sensitive elec
troscope is all that is needed. The plates of the two metals
set face to face are connected, not directly, but by a greater
or less length of a graduated wire conveying a current ; and
the position of the slider on the wire is adjusted by con
tinually separating the plates and testing until no charge at
all is found. The step of potential on the wire is then pre
cisely equal to the “contact-force ’’ between the plates ; for
this would have caused a charge in a similar but uncom
pensated condenser, and the step of potential on the wire has
neutralized it.
    Compensation methods of a sort had been used before by

   it very analogous to that of Pellat".
       Pellat also adopts Sir William Thomson's view that the
   Volta effect is due to a true contact-force between the metals,
   and that it represents a real difference of potential between
   them when in contact; at the same time he is careful to point
   out that no rigorous proof can be given of this, and that all
   that is really and certainly measured electrostatically is the
   difference of potential between what he calls the electric coats

   the air-films, on the two touching metals.

      * I find indeed that Sir W. Thomson completely anticipated Pellat in
   the application of galvanic compensation to the measurement of Volta
   effects; for in “Nature, April 14, 1881 (vol. xxiii. p. 567), is printed an
   account, given in brief at the Swansea meeting of the British Association
   (see Trans, of Sects. 1880, p. 494), which relates how the divided-ring
   experiment naturally developed into more complete compensation with
   . resistances, and that an extensive series of measurements were made
   on this plan in the years 1859–61 with results quite in agreement with
   those published by Hankel in 1862. Other experiments were made since
   1861 with results confirmatory of those of Pfaff, 1821, showing the Volta
   effect to be independent of the surrounding gas. The description of all
   these experiments was therefore withheld till something new should be
   obtained by the method, and was not published until Pellat's paper had

              Electromotive Forces in the Voltaic Cell.                167
   4. Meanwhile some experimenters, starting with a belief
in the chemical origin of the Volta effect, had made experi
ments supposed to support this view. Mr. J. Brown, of Bel
fast, in 1878, repeated Thomson's divided-ring experiment",
as well as Kohlrausch’s condenser-experiment, in other gases
than air; and found a very decided difference, and even a
reversal of sign, when sulphuretted hydrogen was substituted
for air. The metals Brown used were copper and iron, and he
 obtained a 1-centimetre deflection in the direction indicating
iron + in air; while in SH, he obtained a 3-centimetre de
flection, indicating that iron was –. On readmitting air, the
deflection again reversed, and so on until the copper coated
 itself with a blue film of sulphide, when the deflection became
 undecided, owing, as Brown supposes, to “the cessation of
chemical action.”

 additional experiments of the same kind as those published in 1881 by
Schulze-Berge, in which a platinum plate is soaked for a certain time in
dry hydrogen or oxygen, and then used in the Volta condenser. The
observation is made that merely soaking a plate in gas is more effective
than electroplating it with the same gas with an E.M.F. of a volt.        -
   * J. Brown, Phil. Mag. August 1878, Feb. 1879, and March 1881; see
 also Brit. Assoc. Trans, of Sect. 1881, and ‘Electrician, vol. vii. p. 165.

 168            Prof. Oliver Lodge on the Seat of the
    In 1881 he observed a time-change (decrease) of the Volta
 effect at a copper-zinc junction, and reckoned that at the first
 instant after cleaning the potential-difference would be as
 high as ‘9 Daniell, “which,” he says, “agrees with J. Thom
 sen's determination of the difference of the heats of combus
 tion of zinc and copper and oxygen.” He here gives a hint
 of holding a heterodox notion which I do not find in any
 other of his writings, and which I believe he abandoned,
 even if he ever really held it.
    In 1879 Brown tried a copper-nickel divided ring, substi
 tuting HCl for air, and here also succeeded in obtaining a
 reversal of sign. He also arranged a divided ring of wet
 blotting-paper, and showed that there was a difference of
 potential when the two halves were touched with a zinc
 copper couple (which is not remarkable); but he then goes
on to draw a moral, and to say that the slit of the divided
ring corresponds to the air-film, and the wet paper to the
moisture-film in the ordinary Volta-condenser experiment.
The film of moisture on the zinc plate is thus shown to have
a + charge, and that on the copper a negative. If it be
objected that the better the plates fit, the better the manifes
tation of contact E, it is to be replied that it is not to be sup
º:     that there is no air between them anyhow (says Brown).
   robably, he says, gas produces the difference of potential
only so far as it forms a film on the surface. When a metal
and a liquid are experimented on, it is probably really a two
fluid cell, the other fluid being that condensed on the surface
of the metal.
    Brown thus goes strongly for the activity of the films, or
condensed air-sheets, which certainly exist on the surface of
solids, and which may play an important part in the matter;
but he supposes that these films act by corroding or attacking
the plates, and that such a film is necessarily existent between
surfaces nominally in contact if any Volta effect is to be pro
duced; so that if the metal faces really and truly º all
over, they would show no charge when separated. Moreover,
he lays it down that the potential difference is only observed
while chemical action is going on; but that so soon as it
ceases, from any cause, at once the Volta effect ceases too.
In all this I entirely differ from him; but his experiments are
very interesting and much to the point.
    They cannot, however, be regarded as settling the question
—the very important and fundamental question—as to whether
the Volta effect depends on the atmosphere or medium sur
rounding the plates, or whether it is an absolute effect
depending on contact alone. Experiments on this point are
absolutely discordant; and it seems to be one of those points

              Electromotive Forces in the Voltaic Cell.          169
which it is very difficult to settle by direct experiment.       For
if by using a chemically active gas instead of air, you get a
positive result or change in the Volta effect, the answer from
the other side is : “Yes, of course, because your plates are
corroded and coated with sulphide or chloride, or something
whose contact-forces come in and modify everything.” If,
on the other hand, you get a negative result when you substi
tute some inert gas like hydrogen for air, then it is objected
that you have not removed the air-film which the plates had
contracted from long standing in the air; and if you answer
indignantly that you did, and that your hydrogen was per
fectly pure, it is replied with a sneer, “Oh yes, it is not so
easy to get pure    iºn         as you seem to think.”
   Moreover, suppose a positive effect on changing the gas
was established ; what then 2 Nothing is settled except that
the metal/air contact-force is proved to be somewhat different
from the metal/gas contact-force. There seems to be really
no way of knocking contact-force on the head experimentally,
and #. probably because it is a reality: there really is a
contact-force at every junction of dissimilar substances; and
the E.M.F. of a circuit, whether it be inductive or conductive,
is always the sum of such contact-forces. I do not say that
the contact-force at any given locality has the value ordinarily
assigned to it as the result of experiment.
   The earliest attempt made to examine the question as to
whether the Volta effect depended on the atmosphere was
made by Pfaff" in 1829, who used dry and damp air, oxygen,
nitrogen, hydrogen, carburetted hydrogen, and carbonic acid,
and he found that there was no difference so long as no visible
chemical action occurred; but it must be noted that the oppo
sing faces of his plates were varnished. De la Rive, on the
other hand, asserted that there was no Volta effect in the
slightly rarefied air then known as “vacuum.”
   i. recent times Pellat has investigated the subject, and has
come to a conclusion in agreement with Pfaff, viz. that the
differences are very small. The metals used by Pellat were
copper and zinc, and the gases were air dry and damp, dry
oxygen, dry nitrogen, dry and pure hydrogen, dry and pure
carbonic acid. He finds slight variations, but exceedingly
slight, and such as Pfaff, Exner, and Brown could hardly have
detected. He says:– “Au surplus il est fort probable que, si
quelques-uns des auteurs précèdents avaient tenté les expé
riences que j’ai faites au sujet des gaz, ils auraient trouvé
des résultats négatifs; les faibles variations produites par le
 changement des propriétés du gaz que j’ai pu mettre nette

 Fig. 9.—Pellat's Apparatus for experimenting in different Gases and at
                             different Pressures.
The movable plate is now the lower one, and it is pulled down by an
   electromagnet, E, a little way against the springs, B, which tend to
   drive it up against the screw-tops, C. Contact is automatically broken
   at q the instant before separation. The bell-jar has 35 litres capacity,
   the diameter of each plate being 15 centimetres. It must be impossible
   to employ anything like pure gases in a bell-jar enclosing such a bulky
   mass of heterogeneous material; and the pressure was found not to go
   below 2 or 3 centimetres of mercury. However, he has since made a
   smaller arrangement of 1 litre capacity, with plates 9 centimetres
   diameter, and, what is more important, with the electromagnet out
   side, and nothing inside but glass, mica, and metal. In this the pressure
   goes down to a millimetre. But even this is not all that could be
   wished. Moreover the experiments described had been made with the
   larger apparatus.

             Electromotive Forces in the Voltaic Cell.               171
   In all the above gases he has also studied the effect of varying
the pressure. Lowering the pressure slightly increases the
observed difference of potential; but the change lags a little
behind the pressure-variation. Damp and dry air behave in
the same way. In oxygen the effects of pressure are rather
better marked. Nitrogen gives nearly the same numbers as
air; but after it has been in for some time, the numbers are
slightly lower than at first. Hydrogen gives a little greater
effect than even rarefied air; rarefying hydrogen does not
alter it much. Carbonic acid gives the same numbers as rare
air or dense hydrogen. As for liquids, plates wetted with
alcohol give the same result as if immersed in plain air.
   Von Zahn" also tried a condenser in various gases, and
found no difference; but when he tried a platinum-zinc con
denser in the highly rarefied air now known as vacuum with
some melted sodium in a branch tube to absorb all the oxygen,
the Volta effect was diminished, and only represented a po
tential difference of half a Daniell.        I am not clear whether
sodium can be trusted to ultimately absorb every trace of
oxygen; but I should judge it would take a very long time:
and as to rarefaction, dividing the numbers of molecules in a
vessel by a million or two leaves them quite numerous enough
to accomplish anything they want.
   Sir W. Thomson has also made experiments in different
gases with negative results f. These experiments are not de
scribed in detail, but they were made with the apparatus shown
in fig. 10.
   #. views of Ayrton and Perry on the subject of the effects
of atmosphere underwent modification between their first
paper and their third. In their first paper they say they have
good reason to believe that, there is no great difference of
potential between a metallic or liquid surface and the air in
 contact with it
   Clerk Maxwell, in a letter to the ‘Electrician,’f pokes fun
at them for this, saying:—“A statement like this, coming
from men whose scientific energy is threatening to displace
the centre of electrical development, and to carry it quite
out of Europe and America to a point much nearer Japan,
is worthy of all attention, even without an explicit statement
of their “good reason.” But Mr. J. Brown has shown (Phil.
Mag. August 1878) by the divided-ring method of Sir W.
Thomson, that whereas copper is negative with respect to iron
in air, it is positive with respect to iron in H2S. It would

appear, therefore, that the reason why the results of metals by
the ordinary ‘contact-force' experiments harmonize so well
with the comparison by dipping both metals in water or an
oxidizing electrolyte, is not because the E.M.F. between a
metal and a gas or an electrolyte is small, but because the pro
perties of air agree to a certain extent with those of ordinary
electrolytes. §or if the active component of the electrolyte is
sulphur, the results are quite different; and the same kind of
difference occurs when hydrogen sulphide is substituted for air.”
   In their third paper", therefore, we find Ayrton and Perry's
views changed, and they clearly state that their experiments,
like all those based on inductive methods, leave the question
of air-contacts quite undecided.
   They then go on to say :-‘‘One way of determining the
E.M.F. of contact in volts between a substance and air, and
a way we hope shortly to employ, is to repeat all these exact
contact-experiments in different gases [it is not quite true
that this would give the results required, because it would
only give differential effects; very important to observe, no
doubt, but not the same as observing the actual contact-force
of air or of gas]. . . . We shall thus ascertain whether the
contact-difference of potentials of a substance and a gas
differs much for different gases. Qualitative experiments in
this direction have already been made with very interesting
results by Mr. Brown of Belfast, but his experiments differ
from ours in not being quantitative.” [Only, as their ex
periments do not yet exist, Mr. Brown's have still some
value.
   In  º      xii. of Wiedemann's Annalen f I find some in
teresting experiments by Schulze-Berge on contact-force
between metals and gases. He uses a condenser and differ
ent gases, but the plates of his condenser are both of the same
metal, and he coats one of the plates with a film of the gas,
say chlorine, or hydrogen, or ozone, and leaves the other
covered with air. To measure the potential-difference he
employs the compensation method of Pellat, and his arrange
ment seems fairly satisfactory. But he does not explicitly
 enter on the question as to the seat of E.M.F. in the Volta
experiment (except in a controversy with Professor Exner).
 He assumes that a contact-force between metals and metals
 and between metals and liquids has been established, and he
 wishes to extend it to the contact of a metal and a gas.

 174          Prof. Oliver Lodge on the Seat of the
 Believing firmly in the existence of films of condensed gas
 at the surface of a solid, which films require time for their
 formation or removal, he deems it sufficient to soak one of
 the plates of his condenser in the gas to be examined, and
 then to take it out and measure the difference of potential
 between it and the other plate coated only with a film of air.
 Tried thus, ozone rendered gold, platinum, and brass negative
 as against the corresponding air-covered plate. Hydrogen
 rendered its platinum strongly positive; but its influence on
 #.    was slight, and on brass uncertain. Chlorine and
  romine made platinum negative, and ammonia made brass
positive.
   It may be readily objected that what the soaking with gas
accomplished was not the formation of a film of gas, but a
film of actual chloride, oxide, or other combination. Against
this is to be urged the fact that after removal from the gas
the effect diminished with time, and the plates gradually re
turned to nearly their former state. He tried if he could
remove the gas film from one of the plates by exhaustion
under an air-pump, and the plate so treated exhibited a dif
 ference when taken out and compared with an ordinary plate;
but he was cautious enough to repeat the experiment, leaving
the plate under the bell-jar for the same time and not ex
hausting. The same difference appeared, so he attributes it
to possible grease.
   This is the right sort of way to make experiments; and if
everybody experimented with proper care there would be
vastly fewer papers published, and science would progress on
the whole faster.
   At present it feels to me overladen with a mass of publi
cation, mostly of necessity by men of not absolutely the first
order, much of it with no sort of clearness or insight, but
rough, crude, and ill-digested. A man makes a number of
experiments; he does not stop to critically examine and weigh
them, and deduce from them their meaning, nor indeed does
he often take the trouble to examine whether any definite
meaning can in their then shape be drawn from them ; but
he rushes with them into print, producing a memoir of weari
some length and sometimes extreme illiterateness of style.
   Some one else then has the trouble of wading through the
heap to see whether any fragments of value may perchance
be imbedded in it, and probably he is unable to come to
much definite conclusion, because he cannot be in so good a
position for criticism of the experiments as the original author
was. He therefore writes a paper pointing out defects and
errors in the communication. Others take up the same line,

              Electromotive Forces in the Voltaic Cell.        175
 the original man replies, and so there is a controversy, and
 nothing is really settled at all. Finally, some one else in
 dependently goes over the whole ground from some distinct
 point of view, makes a few well-planned, clear, and decisive
  experiments, describes them in a compact and readable form,
 and there results a definite gain to science. But how much
  better would it have been if this last paper had been the only
 one published Unless a man is an experimental genius of
 the highest order, it is necessary for him to think for far
 more time than he experiments, if he wishes to advance and
 not to lumber his science. If it be objected, as indeed it may
 with great truth be, that one man's life and capacity are not
 sufficient for this in the present state of knowledge, the ob
 jection constitutes a strong argument in favour of the pro
 position that the time has come for an organization of science
 and a more definite division of labour.
    To return to the experiments of Herr Schulze-Berge, one
 is not able to say after all that they are very satisfactory, for
 they do not distinctly settle any question. The general con
 clusion he draws from them is the apparently safe one that
 the contact-force between a metal and a gas is not in general
 the same as between a metal and air.         Even this is not ab
 solutely safe, however, because it might conceivably be that
 an air gas contact-force caused all the difference. Granting
 that this is unlikely, the experiments are in favour of a con
 tact-force between metals and air or gas; but they do not
 establish the fact any more strongly than, if so strongly as,
 Mr. Brown's experiments had already done. The weak point
 in both is the possible corrosion of the plates and formation
 of films of alloys or compounds, which may be the real source
 of the observed difference of potential.
    And against the existence of a contact-force between metals
 and various gases, the experiments of Pellat and others are to
 be remembered, which resulted in the conclusion that a con
 denser made of two different metals showed nearly the same
Wolta effect, whether the atmosphere surrounding the plates
was air or hydrogen.
    If it be assumed that the experiments of Brown and Schulze
 Berge establish their point, and that Pellat's apparatus for dif
ferent gases (fig. 9) is satisfactory (rather a large assumption),
I am unable to reconcile the discrepancy, except by suggesting
that Pellat did not take sufficient pains to remove the con
densed-air sheet originally on both his plates. It is of course
just possible that the difference between the potentials of the
two metals might be the same in two gases though the absolute
potential of both was different, but it is improbable.

176             Prof. Oliver Lodge on the Seat of the
    In this connection I must notice also a rather long memoir”
by Dr. W. von Zahn, published in 1882, which reviews the
whole subject, and describes an elaborate series of measure
ments made with an apparatus something like what one might
suppose Ayrton and Perry’s to become if it were arranged for
use in different gases and in vacuo. He refers with admira
tion to Pellat's work in the preface ; and I do not suppose
imagines that his own numerical determinations can compare
with Pellat's for accuracy where they overlap, seeing that he
only makes use of a sort of combination of Kohlrausch's and
Hankel's methods, with a Hankel electrometer as a measuring
instrument f. He has tried, however, a large number of sub
stances as well as ordinary metals, such as powdered antimony,
iron and nickel reduced by hydrogen, many kinds of carbon,
Fe3O, manganite, pyrolusite, copper oxide, lead “hyper
oxide,” iron glance, and other minerals. He has measured
the Volta effect in various gases and at different pressures,
and finds, like Pellat, that it does not appreciably vary.
    He has also examined the effect of temperature on the Volta
effect, though he appears to think that this ought to bear some
close relation to the phenomenon of Seebeck, a natural mistake
many years ago when made by Avenarius, whom it led most
...}}       though fortuitously, to the true, and by him experi
mentally verified, law of E.M.F. in a thermoelectric circuitf.
However, Zahn finds that experiment lends no support to this
view, and says that a larger series of results must be obtained
before basing a theory on them. Von Zahn is a confirmed
contact theorist, and he victoriously assails several experiments
supposed to be distinctly in favour of a chemical view of the
Volta effect. He says he publishes his results because of
the extraordinary discoveries being propounded by Professor
Exner (such as that a thermopile will not work in a vacuum)\,

   t A Hankel electrometer is a modification of Bohnenberger's, in which
a battery with middle to earth is substituted for the dry pile; the plates
on either side of the gold leaf are minutely adjustable, àf the motions of
the gold leaf are *i by a microscope. It is sometimes preferred to a
quadrant for its small capacity and dead quick motion; it can be made
very sensitive, but it can hardly be a satisfactory measuring instrument.
Pellat used it, but only as an electroscope.

and because of the vague and unsatisfactory views of phy
sicists in general on the matter (e.g. of Hart); but I am bound
to say that, so far as I can judge, Dr. von Zahn's own ex
periments are not of that conclusive and decided character
that one had hoped for from his start, and he signally fails to
sum up the facts in a neat and crisp manner. He adheres to
the contact view, but his adhesion scarcely seems to me to be
based on strong evidence ; and in fact his theoretical views
seem a little superficial considering the date at which he
writes; so that one may admit pretty well all he says about
contact and not chemical action as the cause of the Volta
effect without being deeply committed to any specially true
or specially false position *. His best experiment, and a very
 crucial one if only it could be perfectly performed, is the
attempt to measure the Volta effect in an absolute vacuum.
A pair of zinc and platinum plates are sealed up in a brass
and glass vessel in such a way that one of them is capable
 of moving up and down, and thus of varying its distance from
 the other. Gravity is employed to separate the plates, the
 whole vessel being inverted. The vessel is filled with dry
 nitrogen and exhausted for some days, occasional heat, P.O.,
 and melted sodium, being employed to improve the vacuum.
     The result is that the Volta effect is very decidedly “too
 small,” going down to half a Daniell, so far as the measure
  ments made by his not entirely unobjectionable method can
  be trusted ; but he does not seem to think that this is much
  of an argument either way, and, not finding any further change
  after some days, he did not pursue the investigation further
  by letting in some air and seeing whether the old value is
  restored, though he perceives clearly that this would be a
  crucial experiment. This abstinence is so remarkable that it
  antimony is destroyed by immersing the pile in pure nitrogen; and Young
  of Princetown takes the trouble to examine whether it is so experimentally
  (see Phil. Mag. x. 1880, p. 450), and finds the thermoelectric power of
  metals the same at one millionth atmosphere as at 1. This,       lº.
  would be altogether inconclusive if experiment were needed to settle it,
     * I am afraid this is not peculiar to Dr. von Zahn.  It may be that the
  German writers on the subject are too busy accumulating facts to care
  much about their precise theoretical bearing; but I notice a very loose
  and unsatisfactory way of putting forward secondary matters as if they
  were the real points at issue, and of never really getting to the heart of
  the matter. It is singular that the four questions or heads under which
  that eminent writer, ProfessorWiedemann, proceeds to discuss the attempts
  which have been made to settle the question of the seat of E.M.F. are
  such that if a categorical answer to each were, by supernatural means,
  Yºuchsafed to us, we should be, I believe, none the wiser (Wiedemann,

into position. He i. the sodium strongly positive to copper;

imagine, for metal in contact with glass may so easily give

    I believe he must have employed the best vacuum of any
experimenter on this subject, and that he has therefore gone
most near to the proof of what I cannot help believing will
be found to be the truth, viz. that the Volta effect in an abso
lute vacuum or perfectly inert gas (old air-sheets et hoc genus
omne having been thoroughly removed) is very small. But
if it be the case, as I believe it is, that the effect is almost
independent of the quantity of oxygen present, so long as it
is present, the difficulty of making the experiment so as to be
sure of the absence of even the last few thousand or million
oxygen molecules is almost overwhelming. The question of
the dependence of Volta force on atmosphere remains thus
undecided; and all the evidence which I can adduce in favour
of such dependence is this incipient decrease observed by von
Zahn, the little too-mixed-up observation of Mr. Hart (de
scribed later), the measurements of Schulze-Berge, and the
more decided experiments of Brown. It may indeed be
readily held that the weight of experimental evidence tends
the other way, since most experimenters on the subject (Pellat,

foundly impressed with the difficulty of making one in which
no fault or loophole can be found, and which will by every one

than on a crucial but almost impossible experiment.

 He sets himself to disprove the existence of contact-force in
 the most straightforward and obvious manner, and to establish
 the fact that there is no electrical evolution without definite
 and actual chemical action. To this end he announces the
 following propositions:—(1) that two metals in a chemically
 indifferent medium show no electricity; (2) that the potential
 difference of two connected metals in air is exactly half the
 difference of their heat-combustion energies; and (3) that two
 pieces of the same metal produce contact-electricity as soon as
 they are put into chemically different atmospheres.
    The experiments by which he supports these assertions have,
 every one of them, been elaborately and severely criticised by
 Beetz, Hoorweg, Julius, Schulze-Berge, Von Zahn, Ayrton
 and Perry, Pellat, and Wiedemann; and his numerical deter
 minations of contact-force appear to be unique”.
    It is not necessary for me to enter into a discussion on the
 merit of his experiments, inasmuch as the mere fact of the
 existence of so great a body of hostile opinion is sufficient to
 show that they are not of a kind best qualified to produce
 conviction.      The theoretical views which led Professor Exner
 to formulate his second statement above, that the potential
 difference of two connected metals is equal to half the differ
 ence of their heats of combustion per equivalent, are, I am
 sorry to say, quite unintelligible to me. They depend on the
 hypothetically necessary existence of films of oxide, between
 which and the metal there is supposed to be a considerable
difference of potential. Perhaps a few quotations from Pro

paper in Wiedemann's Annalen of the same year, with some abbrevia             º
tions:—“An investigation     ºf           the nature of galvanic polarization
has led me to a quite distinct view of the origin of the so-called contact
electricity, a view which will be supported by experiments following. I
have shown that the original cause of the polarization-current is to be
sought for, not at the contact of the electrodes with ions liberated on

from those of De la Rive and other older “chemical theorists;”
but they are (especially in later papers) expressed in so defi
nite and decided a manner that they have excited a sharper
controversy than vaguer and more hesitating writings could.
This indeed may be regarded as their special merit. The
main objection which can be taken to them relates to the
quantitative statements: these are vigorously made, but they
seem unwarranted by facts accumulated by all other observers,
though indeed some of his own experiments certainly seem to
support them. It has also been objected that he misinterprets
some of his experiments.
   He has got hold of the notion that the heat of combustion
has some sort of relation to the Volta effect, and there I am
heterodox enough to agree with him. But what the relation
is, and how it acts, and what sort of potential-difference you
ought to expect in accordance with theory, concerning all
these things I am utterly at variance with him ; and I deem
it prudent not to attempt to represent views which I am
unable to understand, because it is unlikely that I should do
them justice.
them, but in the recombination of the latter; and the E.M.F. of the cur
rent so prºduced is measured by the heat-value of this combination, just
as the E.M.F. of any galvanic cell is measured by the heat-value of the
chemical process going on in it. With a so-called contact-action the
existence of the polarization-current, and obviously of every other cur
rent, has nothing whatever to do. The idea then suggested itself to seek
for the cause of the production of electricity in the experiment of Volta,
not in the contact  ..} two metals, but in previous chemical actions of the
surrounding media on their surfaces. I have expressed the opinion that
so-called contact-electricity is produced by the oxidation of the metal in
contact by the oxygen of the air, just as in galvanic cells it is evolved by
oxidation of zinc. If the supposition prove true, and it has proved true,
the E.M.F. of his metal in contact in air must be measured and expressed
by their heats of combustion.”
   He then points out how all Volta tension series are in oxidation order,
and relates approvingly De la Rive's view that metals in air were attacked
not only by water-vapour but by dry oxygen, and that electricity is pro
duced by any kind of chemical action in proportion to the intensity of the
chemica .. Then he gives his numerical theory and supporting
experiments; and finally concludes:--"I believe we are ..H.”to say
that no Scheidungskraft exists at the contact of two metals.” The fol.
lowing must take the place of Volta's law of the evolution of electricity:—
“The difference of electric potential between two metals in contact is
measured by the algebraic sum of the heat-value of the chemical action
going on at each.”
   In his theory and experiments, and all through the rest of the paper, he
considers the difference of potential equal to half the difference of heat
values, so the above last statement must be a slight numerical slip.
   The above extracts are among the most favourable. . It would be easy
to select passages from this, and from his other memoirs on the subject,
of a more surprising character.

 182              Prof. Oliver Lodge on the Seat of the
    Professor Exner, to strengthen his position, adduces a large
 number of very simple experiments (such as connecting first
 one Daniell and then two Daniells to an electrometer, and
 observing that in the second case the deflection is double the
 first), and from them he obtains equations proving algebrai
 cally that Zn/Cu = 0. Considered as conundrums these
 equations are ingenious, but it is a waste of time seriously to
 discuss them as Herr Julius has done in an elaborate manner.
 To suppose that such everyday experiments as these are in
 direct contradiction of the contact theory is scarcely compli
 mentary to the great men who have held, and who still hold,
 that view.
     Dr. C. G. Knott, in 1879*, examined the contact-force
 between plates of the same metal at different temperatures,
 using the condenser or Kohlrausch method. He found that
 iron, copper, zinc, and probably tin, were negative when hot
 to the same metals cold ; and the effect increases uniformly
 with temperature. But it is permanent, remaining after the
 hot plates have cooled down ; hence, it must be due to
 oxidation.
    A slow oxidation proceeds with time alone. Time-curves
 are logarithmic like cooling-curves, and the most oxidizable
 metal varies most quickly i. for time-variation and tempe
 rature-variation.      There seems to be a surface-condition of a
 metal proper to each temperature which no polishing can
 change, for it establishes itself in a few seconds after cleaning,
and only changes with temperature.
    Mr. S. Lavington Hart, in 1881t, describes a mercury
dropper where the mercury is contained in a funnel, and is
connected with an electrometer by an iron rod dipping into
it. The drops form inside an iron inductor, and they fall
 negatively charged. Mr. Hart so far ignores any Volta force
that he considers the arrangement as an inversion of Lipp
mann’s electrometer, the advancing drops being oxidized. It
can plainly be regarded, however, as a mere Fe/Hg contact
arrangement; and that is what I suppose it to be. He makes
two interesting modifications : the first is to replace the air
round the dropping mercury by coal-gas ; the electrical effect
is then zero. This is interesting, because the exuding drops
of mercury, unlike most pieces of metal, expose to the coal-gas
a virgin surface which has probably contracted no condensed
air-sheet: only coal-gas is a rather sophisticated substance for

it to be first exposed to.      If the experiment is regarded as
sufficiently direct and simple, this fact lends support to the
view that Volta forces depend on the medium surrounding the
metals.
   The second modification is to bring an earth-connected iron
bar close to the drops, and to show that it reduces the deflec
tion. Mr. Hart thinks it reduces the oxidation by proximity;
and certainly, provided the obvious action of a mere electro
static screen has been considered and provided against, the
action by proximity is very remarkable. A similar effect has
been observed and more fully worked out by Pellat, in a paper
published in 1882". Pellat says that if he places two metallic
surfaces parallel to one another and very close together (say
half a millimetre more or less, variations from 12 to 1), each
metal undergoes a slight alteration of the properties of its
superficial coat. The alteration takes some minutes to pro
duce, increases with time, but tends to a limit. When the
influencing metal is removed, the other returns gradually to
its primitive state. Lead and iron produce the largest influ
ence effects; copper, gold, and platinum give smaller but
distinct effects; zinc produces hardly any, unless it be put
within a hundredth of a millimetre or so.            Pellat does not
attempt to account for this interesting phenomenon further
than by suggesting some possible connection with the smell
of metals.
   Mr. Hart's theoretical views are at first sight somewhat
analogous to my own, though they are by no means the same.
He considers the case of two metals immersed in liquid elec
trolytes, and dismisses air by calling it a gaseous electrolyte.
He believes zinc and copper in contact to be at the same
 º          and throws the variation of potential on the air
  etween them f. He considers the electrical effect brought
about by the electro-negative ion oxygen combining with the
zinc and charging it negatively, while some electro-positive
ion combines with the copper and charges it positively, “though
not unless the two metals are in sufficient proximity to over
come electrolytic diffusion ” (whatever that may mean as
applied to this case). He thinks his mercury-dropping expe
riment in coal-gas is conclusive as to the equality of potential
of metals in contact. This, I fear, is rather rapid induction.

more   º: Prof.         Exner in his paper on the Theory of Galvanic

regards the E.M.F. of contact as due to the “adhesion ” of
the two metals for each other: pretty much the same idea as
Sir W. Thomson's chemical action at a distance, an idea which
makes the energy of the Volta effect Zn/Cu depend on, and
be calculable from, the combination-heat of zinc and copper in
making brass. I must return to this matter later, because it
is important in itself and crucial as regards theory.
    Gassiott made an experiment intended to show that there
could be a difference of potential excited between metals by
proximity without actual contact, or at any rate without
metallic contact. Grove S also made a similar experiment.

employing Edlund's method, and finds, like him, that for alloys as well as
for simple metals the Peltier corresponds with the Seebeck force. The
    uliar language used in this and the preceding paper may easily cause
it to be imagined that they have found Volta force to agree with Peltier.
In fact, Sundell is so quoted in Watts's 3rd Suppl. p. 708. . Von Zahn
quotes Edlund in the same sense; and indeed it is probable that Edlund
himself at first thought he was investigating Volta forces thermoelectrically
(Pogg. Ann. cxlix. § 144).

    Prof. Fleeming Jenkin, in the last edition of his ‘Electricity

and chemical theories. According to the chemical theory,
the E.M.F. of a cell = X(J6e); according to the contact-theory
it is C/L +L/Z+Z/ C. On these undoubted facts he pro
ceeds to found a number of statements which are truef, though
scarcely simple; in fact they perhaps rather tend to compli
 cate what may be held to be a simple matter.
     Schönbein, in a letter to Faraday published in the Philoso
phical Magazine for 1838t, throws out a remarkable sugges
    * Although this article is, or ought to be, easily accessible to everybody,
there is one important suggestion in it which it is as well to quote, viz.
that contained in the following sentence:– “We are so ignorant of the
nature of the motion which is the essence of the electric current that the
very form in which we have put the question [as to the locality of E.M.F.]
may be misleading. If this motion be in the surrounding medium, as
there is great reason to believe it to be, it would not be surprising to find
that speculations as to the exact locality of the E.M.F. in the circuit were
utterly wide of the mark.” Prof. Willard Gibbs suggested something of
 the same sort at Montreal, though in a rather vaguer form. I do not
 myself feel any doubt that a precise location can be given to the E.M.F.,
H.; that much of the current energy exists in the medium.
The most complete attention to the distribution of energy in circuits which
 has yet been bestowed on the subject has been given by Prof. Poynting in
his remarkable memoir (Phil. Trans. 1884), and he therein locates the
E.M.F. of a battery exactly where I do myself.
    t Except, indeed, a doubtful statement at the end of Number 2 and an
erroneous bit of reasoning at the end of Number 4, though the conclusion
drawn is correct.
    f Schönbein, Phil. Mag. vol. xii. pp. 225 and 311. The two most
 striking sentences are here extracted:—
    “Before closing my letter, allow me to communicate to you in a general
 manner the view which I have taken of the subject in question. In the
 first place, I must tell you that I am by no means inclined to consider
 mere contact in any case as the cause of the excitement of even the most
 feeble current. I maintain, on the contrary, in accordance with the prin
 ciples of the chemical theory, that any current produced in a hydro
 electric voltaic circle is always due to some chemical action.       But as to
 the idea which I attach to the term ‘chemical action,' I go further than
 you and M. de la Rive seem to go; for I maintain that any tendency of
 two different substances to unite chemically with one another must be
 considered as a chemical action, be that tendency followed up by the
 actual combination of those substances, or be it not; and that such a
 tendency is capable of putting electricity into circulation.”
    And on page 314 he explains this last phrase, which he has elsewhere
 called a “current of tendency,” thus:–
    “As what I term a current of tendency is no doubt in some cases
 nothing but that electrical state which the Voltaists consider to be the
 effect of their force electromotive, or of contact, it appears to me that,
 from some of the facts above stated, a specific and most important con
 clusion regarding the theory of the pile can be drawn. Even if we

   tion with regard to “chemical tendency” as the possible
   source of a current, or rather of “force electromotive.”                His
  language and ideas are in many respects old-fashioned and
  erroneous; he uses such phrases as “a current of tendency,”
  he supposes currents with no electrolytic power to exist, and
  of course is not troubled about energy considerations. But I
  feel little doubt that, had he lived later, he would have held
  that while currents were due to chemical action, electromotire
 force was due to “chemical tendency;” and this is pretty
  exactly my own view of the matter.
      I have only just discovered this Schönbein letter; and I
  have also found some paragraphs in Faraday which more in
  detail and with fair distinctness express what I believe to be
  the true view. (See §§ 893–900, Exp. Res. vol. i.”)
  grant to the Voltaists our current of tendency to be the effect of mere
  contact, the facts alluded to prove that such a current does not possess a
 sensible degree of electrolyzing-power; consequently that the chemical
 effects of the common voltaic arrangements have nothing to do with
 current-electricity excited by contact.”
     * Extract from Faraday's Experimental Researches, vol. i.:—
     “(893) The use of metallic contact in a single pair of plates and the
 cause of its great superiority above contact made by other kinds of matter,
 become now very evident. When an amalgamated zinc plate is dipped
 into dilute sulphuric acid, the force of chemical affinity exerted between
 the metal and the fluid is not sufficiently powerful to cause sensible action
 at the surfaces of contact, and occasion the decomposition of water by the
 oxidation of the metal, although it is sufficient to produce such a condition
 of the electricity (or the power upon which chemical affinity depends), as
 would produce a current if there were a path open for it; and that con
 tact would complete the conditions necessary, under the circumstances,
 for the decomposition of water.
     “(894) Now the presence of a piece of platina touching both the zinc
 and the fluid to be decomposed opens the path required for the electricity.
 Its direct communication with the zinc is º , far beyond any commu
 nication made between it and that metal (i.e. between the         .. and
 zinc) by means of decomposable conducting bodies, or, in other words,
 electrolytes, as in the º already described [that of decomposing
 iodide of potassium without metallic contact by interposing it on blótting
 paper between the <U+017F>º and the zinc of a simple voltaic cell], because,
 when they are used, the chemical affinities between them and the zinc
   roduce a contrary and opposing action to that which is influential in the
#.       sulphuric acid; or if that action be but small, still the affinity of
their component parts for each other has to be overcome, for they cannot
conduct without suffering decomposition; and this decomposition is found
experimentally to react back upon the forces which in the acid tend to
   roduce the current, and in numerous cases entirely to neutralize them
    here direct contact of the zinc and platina occurs, these obstructing
forces are not brought into action, and therefore the production and the
circulation of the electric current, and the concomitant action of decom
position are then highly favoured.
    “(895) It is evident, however, that one of these opposing actions may
be dismissed and yet an electrolyte be used for the purpose of completing

E.M.F.”
    For much discussion of contact-electricity and for some
interesting statements of the views of Marianini, Davy, and
others, refer to ‘Experimental Researches, vol. ii. p. 20 &c.
From what is there said, it appears that Karsten and Marianini
held a modified contact theory, placing the E.M.F. at the
metal-fluid junction; and that Becquerel admitted as a possi
bility the efficiency of chemical attraction, as distinct from
combination, something in the same way as Schönbein.
    Professor Tait in his ‘Thermodynamics’ lends his powerful
support to the contact view of the activity of the pile as taught
by Sir W. Thomson.
     Some work has been done in the direction of observin
reversible heat-effects at metal-liquid junctions, notably by
Joule, Thomson, and Bosscha. We shall have occasion to refer
to this work later.
    Joule in 1841 sent currents through several dilute acid
voltameters with different electrodes, and measured the excess
or reversible heat H–RC” generated in the whole cell; with
the result that the excess of heat observed is that due to the
observed back E.M.F. of the cell, minus that concerned in the
decomposition of water. A table of his results is given by
Chrystal, Encyc. Brit. p. 91. For Maxwell on the same
subject see ‘Elementary Electricity, p. 146.
    Thomson (Math, and Phys. Papers, pp. 496, 503) says
that, of two decomposition-cells, one with zinc cathode, the
other with platinum cathode, the former showed the most
heat when the same current was sent through both. Separa
 the circuit between the zinc and platina immersed separately into the
 dilute acid; for if in the above experiment the platina wire be retained in
 metallic contact with the zinc plate, and a division of the platina be made
 elsewhere, then the solution .*. placed there, being in contact with
   latina at both surfaces, exerts no chemical affinities for that metal; or,
 if it does, they are equal on both sides. Its power, therefore, of formin
 a current in opposition to that dependent upon the action of the acid in
 the vessel is removed, and only its resistance to decomposition remains as
 the obstacle to be overcome by the affinities exerted in the dilute sul
   huric acid.
    “(896) This becomes the condition of a single pair of active plates
 where metallic contact is allowed. In such cases,   ...], one set of opposing
 affinities are to be overcome by those which are dominant in the vessel;
  whereas, when metallic cºntact is not allowed, two sets of opposing
 affinities must be conquered (894).”                           -

ting the electrodes by a porous cell, zinc cathode showed more
heat than zinc anode, but platinum anode more heat than
platinum cathode". He speaks of the local heat developed at
a tin surface, and shows that it is greater where hydrogen is
liberated than where tin is dissolved ; and suggests thermal
observations on four dilute-acid voltameters in one circuit
with zinc and platinum electrodes, arranged according to the
permutations—zinc-zinc, zinc-platinum, platinum-zinc, and
platinum-platinum. Thomson attributes the extra heat at an
electrode to opposing chemical affinities which have to be
overcome—a doctrine of “chemical resistance.”
   Bosscha examines and develops all these matters in a series
of interesting papers published about 1857f. He attributes
the development of local heat, at a cathode against which
hydrogen is liberated, to the change of hydrogen from the
nascent condition to the ordinary one—in other words, to the
energy of the molecular combination H, H. He finds the
electromotive forces exhibited by this local generation of heat
at the surface of different metals in acid to have the following
values in volts:—

torical sketch and discussion thereon, a valuable communication
by Bouty to the Journal de Physiquef, “On Thermoelectric
Force at Contact of Metals and Liquids, and on the Peltier
Effect thereat.” He finds the Peltier coefficient at a junction
of copper with salts of copper eighty times as great, as at an
iron-zinc junction, and eleven times as great as bismuth
copper.         e also measures the metal-liquid thermoelectric
E.M.F. at different temperatures, and shows that Thomson's

cases also. He endeavours to see if this Peltier, or, as we
had better call it for distinction, Joule or Bouty effect, can

altering the surfaces, and by developing parasitic heats. They
 may mask, but they do not produce, the true Bouty pheno

     The difficulties of making these measurements are exceed
 ingly great; and, notwithstanding the ingenuity and skill dis

     XXI. Some Principles and Results of Harmonic Motion.

   WHEN two bodies,             in relative motion, come into con
            tact, pressure begins to act between them to prevent
any parts of them from jointly occupying the same space. . . . .
Any force in a constant direction acting in any circumstances,
for any time great or small, may be reckoned on the same
principle ; so that what we may call its whole amount            .#
any time, or its ‘time-integral,’ will measure, or be measure
by, the whole momentum which it generates in the time in
question " (Thomson and Tait, “Natural Philosophy, i. sec
tions 294, 297).
     No relative motions can be more important, and no contact
more complete, than those which exist between the all
pervading luminiferous aether and the sun. In the conversion
of tangential luminous waves into spherical vibrations, gravity
is acting in a constant direction towards the sun's centre.
The amount of its activity upon each athereal particle, pu, or
its time-integral during each cyclical period, t, is measured

municated by the Author.
   This paper has been written, in part, to meet a desire which has been
expressed by some members of the Royal Astronomical Society for an

by pigt. The study of the various correlations which flow
from this integral involves the following considerations:—
   (1) The principle of Galileo, that the total effort is equiva
lent to the effective sum of the causes which are operating.
This is illustrated at sun's surface, which is the region of
greatest energy in our system, by the cyclic equation
                           Xg=gt=va.
   (2) The equality of pressures or resistances to opposing
forces, in all equilibrating tendencies. In consequence of this
equality, every interruption or prevention of the free action
of any force may be measured as a rate of change of momentum
in the opposite sense.
   (3) The invariability of the sum of kinetic and potential
energies.
   (4) The maximum of kinetic energy in all cyclical motions,
at the point of the trajectory which is nearest to the centre of
force, and the maximum of potential energy at the point
which is most remote from that centre. At the origin of
luminous radiation, where Xg-va, the reaction of gravitatin
resistance is all kinetic; after a half-rotation it becomes   .#
potential, but it is then combined with a new reaction which
is all kinetic.
   (5) The evidences of local aethereal stress, which is opera
tive in various forms of gravitating, thermal, electromagnetic,
and chemical attraction and repulsion.
   (6) The indestructibility of energy, which requires, as
Maxwell has stated, that energy must exist in the aether
during the interval of its transfer from one body to another.
   (7) The strong reasons for believing that the media for
luminous, gravitating, thermal,   tºº.             and chemical
interactions, occupying the same space and represented by the
same cyclical velocities, are identical.
   (8) The counteraction of stress by obvious elasticity, as in
a spring, or by probable intermolecular elasticity and orbital
motion, as in the resistance of solids.
   (9) The principle of Fourier, that any complex periodic
motion must be compounded of a definite number of simple
harmonic motions, of definite periods, definite amplitudes, and
definite phases.
   (10) The application of “Laplace's Coefficients,” or sphe
rical harmonic analysis, to the explanation of cyclical waves
and vibrations in spherical elastic masses.
   (11) Cumulative and progressive undulating tendencies,
resulting in complex harmonic motions of various kinds.
   The evidences and consequences of harmonic motion in

192            Dr. P. E. Chase on some Principles
stellar systems flow simply and naturally from the two fol
lowing important FACTs:—
    (1) The fundamental velocity in the solar system is the
velocity of light.
    (2) This is not a merely accidental and temporary coinci
dence, but, according to the first proposition of Newton's
Principia, it must have existed, and must continue to exist,
during all past and future stages of solar condensation.
    The first of these facts was discovered by investigating the
tendencies to oscillatory nodal harmony in elastic media. It
appears to be still regarded by some persons as merely curious
and without important significance. This is, perhaps, because
attention has been so often directed to the angular velocities
in different orbits, which vary inversely as the 3 power of the
mean distance, that the synchronous variability of angular
velocity with the inverse square of the radius, in all the par
ticles of an expanding or contracting nebular nucleus, is
forgotten or   ..
    We find in our stellar system three stages of material
aggregation :-(1) A nucleus, probably consisting chiefly, if
 not entirely, of condensed gas, rotating in about 25-5 days.
 (2) An atmosphere of lighter gas, rotating synchronously
 with the nucleus, and therefore extending no further than
 Kant's limit (p. = 36:35po, po being Sun's semidiameter).
 (3) A luminiferous aether which, if infinitely elastic, may be
 of infinite extent, but which would reach, if made homo
 geneous, to 221074 times Earth's mean distance from the Sun.
    If the Sun were homogeneous and unresisting, a particle
 would fall to its centre from its surface, or from any point
 within its surface, in 41.87 minutes, or in 3 of the time of
 free revolution at the surface (# of  *V%      =}        j). The
 relation of radial oscillation to orbital revolution is therefore
 that of simple harmonic motion. The velocity acquired by
 falling from the surface to the centre would be v.gr; which
 is the same as would be acquired in falling from an infinite
 distance to 2r, or from 2r to r, or in virtual fall through r,
 or through one half the length of a cycloidal pendulum which
 would oscillate synchronously with circular orbital revolution
  at r. It is also the velocity of wave-propagation in a homo
  geneous elastic atmosphere of a depth equivalent to r.
     At all points within the nucleus the velocity acquired by
 fall to the centre would be proportional to the distance from
 the centre. Let us apply the principles which are here indi
 cated to a stellar system like our own, with a nucleus so

preponderating that its oscillatory tendencies are not mate
rially modified by the perturbations of attendant planets or
companion stars.
   Within our solar nucleus all the tendencies to orbital revo
lution have been converted into constrained rotation, which
shows a retardation by collision, subsidence-oscillations, &c.,
such that the velocity of every particle is only about 345 as
great as that of free and self-sustained revolution. The con
tinual violent agitation of Sun's mass indicates the probability
of synchronous radial and tangential oscillations, which are
dependent upon simple harmonic motions. The measure of
gravitating acceleration for the oscillatory unit of time being
Trºl = º,      (lo being the distance from the point of suspension
to the centre of oscillation in a linear pendulum l), we have
                                  2
 Sun's semidiameter (po)=      * lo, and the quotient of circular
 orbital velocity by equatorial velocity of rotation

                (Vapo--e.)=     (#)       =219.17.
    The principle of conservation of areas requires that the
 angular velocity should vary inversely as the square of radius,
 without the nucleus as well as within it, provided we look
 merely at the orbit of any given mass or particle. It is only
 when we compare different extra-nucleal orbits in the same
 system, each of which has its own original force of projection,
 that we find angular velocities varying inversely as the #
 power of the mean distance.        If the nucleus is expanding or
  contracting the Kantian radius, p., should, accordingly, vary
 as the 4 power of the nucleal radius, so that

194              Dr. P. E. Chase on some Principles
act, whether by constant, successive, or undulatory pressures,
thrusts or pulls, all of its results may be accounted for on the
hypothesis of successive instantaneous impulses. The entire
accelerating force gt is always exerted, but a portion is usually
counteracted by opposing resistances or momenta. Suppose,
for example, three bodies in a vacuum—A falling freely for a
second, B suspended from a string between cycloidal arcs so
that its centre of oscillation is  3. of 32.08 feet from the point
of suspension, C sliding on a frictionless plane in which
h: l ; ; 1 : trº. A will fall 16:04 feet, while B swings once
and C slides 16:04 feet, falling through a height equivalent to
one half the length of the pendulum.
   The choice of a second as the unit of time is altogether
arbitrary. The desirability of a natural unit has often been
felt and expressed. Maxwell suggested, as a suitable unit,
the interval of some particular luminous wave-length. At
the surface of a stellar nucleus, where gravity is a maximum,
where the time of rotary oscillation can be linked with all
possible times of revolution by simple formulas of harmonic
vibration, and where a universal gravitating unit can be

196 Some Principles and Results of Harmonic Motion.
   The influence of luminous undulation upon the actions and
reactions between the chief centre of nucleation and the chief
centre of condensation (Sun and Earth) seems to be indicated
by the following tendencies:—
   tº, in the conversion of circular motion into simple harmonic
motion, Ox    #d.                                 -

   The radius of mean condensation (#8) is 23 times the radius
                                         2 \}
of actual condensation ; 365-256 x     (#) +2}=214.54.       The
apparent solar semidiameter which corresponds to this value
is 961":43, which differs by less than gº of 1 per cent. from
the British Nautical Almanac estimate, 961”.82. Dr. Fuhg's
estimate (Astron. Nachr. 2040), 961"-495, is still closer.
   Tendencies to solar equatorial acceleration and polar retar
dation, such as are shown by the sun-spots, are indicated
by the following approximations to the period of solar rota
tion :

   t, or d”; (36-3514--6-6)*=30:336.
    The secular influence of the chief centres of nucleation and
 nebulosity (Sun and Jupiter) on the chief centre of conden
 sation (Earth), as well as the cyclical actions and reactions
 between Earth and Jupiter, are shown by the equation
                      8, psa--80 psa= tg-ta.
   In this equation 8, 80 are the mean Kantian densities of
Jupiter, Sun; pse, psa, the nearest secular approaches of Earth
to Jupiter, Sun; ts, orbital period of Jupiter; ti, Kantian or
rotational period of Earth. The secular eccentricity of Earth
 which satisfies this equation is .06543. Stockwell’s estimate
is '06774.

              zinc and electro-copper plates immersed in solu
tions of their respective acetates, the constant molecular
strength being 25 M(C, H2O2), H2O". The following values
were obtained :

   Julius Thomsen's thermochemical data lead to the values
Zn, O, 20, H.O.aq. =100710, and Cu, O, 2 C, H, O,aq. =50340;
whence EH = 1.111, corresponding with 50370 gramme
degrees. Hence E-Eg---020 for electro-copper in contact
with copper-acetate solution of strength 25 Cu(C, H,0),
 100 H.O.
                                      II. Lead.
    195. Two series of cells set up with electro-lead opposed to
amalgamated zinc and electro copper respectively, with acetate
solutions uniformly of strength 25 M(C.H.O.), 100 H.O,
gave the following results; the differences observed between
 the values obtained for different cells set up in the same         way
being notably greater than with most of the other com
binations examined :—
                                          Zinc-Lead.   Lead-Copper.
            Maximum ...............          -616          •503

            Probable error .........       +-0048        +-0044
   * The acetate solutions employed were prepared by dissolving the
 freshly-precipitated, well-washed carbonates of the metals in boiling
 dilute acetic acid somewhat stronger than that required, filtering after
 cooling, and diluting to the proper extent.

 198 Messrs. Wright and Thompson on the Determination of
    From these average values the following valuations result
for the voltaic constant for lead in acetate solution of strength

                                       Mean .     .   .   . '607
    Hence, since Thomsen finds that Pb, O, 20.H.O., aq. =
65770, the value of EIt is 770, corresponding with 34940
gramme-degrees, whence
                         E—EH = — 163;
i. e. the thermovoltaic constant for lead in acetate solution is
negative, and of nearly the same magnitude as in nitrate
solution, or in contact with lead sulphate suspended in
zinc or cadmium-sulphate solution of corresponding strength,
25 PbX 100 H.O. In consequence the actual E.M.F. of a
lead-copper-acetate cell eacceeds that due to the net chemical
change taking place therein, just as in lead-copper-sulphate
and lead-copper-nitrate cells.
    Some observations were made on the rate of depreciation
in E.M.F. with increasing current-density in zinc-lead-acetate
cells, with the result of showing that the average rate of fall
is indicated by a curve lying between the analogous curves
obtained with zinc-silver-sulphate and iron-copper-sulphate
cells (§§ 130 and 176), being below the former and above the
latter, which, as already shown, overlie the analogous curves
obtained with zinc-copper-sulphate and zinc-cadmium-sulphate
cells. It is remarkable, in this connection, that the thermo
voltaic constants for the metals silver, lead, iron, copper, and
cadmium in these solutions respectively follow in the same
order as regards numerical magnitude, though not as regards

opposed to amalgamated zinc and electro-copper immersed in
their respective acetate solutions, the constant strength being

   The heat of formation of silver acetate not being known,
the value of EH cannot be calculated. Admitting that this
value is the same as in the case of nitrate cells of the same
molecular solution-strength, viz. near to 1890, the value of
E–EH would be — 401; whence it is at least evident that
the thermovoltaic constant for electro-silver in acetate solution
is a large negative quantity, comparable in magnitude with
the corresponding constants found for sulphate and nitrate
solutions.
    It is noteworthy that the E.M.F. of lead-silver-acetate cells
 deduced from the foregoing experiments is 1489–1607 = 882
 volt. On setting up a number of such cells, however, fluctu
 ating and inconstant figures were obtained, usually averaging
 during the first half-hour after setting up values from 02 to
 '12 volt below this amount; these cells therefore resembled
 in this respect the lead-copper-chloride cells above described
 (§ 184).
  E. Voltaic and Thermoroltaic Constants of Metals immersed
                   in Solutions of their Bromides.
    197. The experiments above described indicate that the
 sign and magnitude of the thermovoltaic constant for a given
 metal does not vary widely, whether the metal be in contact
 with its sulphate, nitrate, or acetate, whereas the values obtained
  under these circumstances are often considerably different from
 those obtained when in contact with its chloride.               In order to
    * Assumed to be the same as the value found for solution-strength
  25 M(C.H.O.), 100 H.O.

200 Messrs. Wright and Thompson on the Determination of
trace out whether the different halogen salts exhibit analogy
with these oxygen-acid salts, or whether they differ materially
amongst themselves, a number of cells were examined con
taining various metals immersed in solutions of their respective
j.         of constant strength 25MBr, 100 H,0, or in magmas
of their bromides immersed in zinc-bromide solution of this
strength (saving in the case of lead bromide, where the sparing
solubility necessitated the use of weaker solutions).
                           I. Cadmium.
   The following values were obtained with zinc–cadmium
bromide cells :—

   Julius Thomsen finds the values Zn, Br, aq. = 90960, and
Cd, Br, aq. =75640; whence EH = 338, corresponding with
15320 gramme-degrees.        Hence
                        E—Em= –1023;
that is, the thermovoltaic constant for electro-cadmium in
bromide solution of strength 25Cd Br, 100 H.O is a small
negative quantity, not quite so large numerically as that for
the corresponding chloride solution (viz. –'036).
                            II. Silver.
   198. The following values were obtained with cells set up
with amalgamated zinc opposed to electro-silver immersed in
a magma of freshly precipitated well-washed silver bromide
suspended in zinc-bromide solution, the solution-strength
throughout being 25Zn Br, 100 H.O.

that is, the thermovoltaic constant for silver in contact with
silver bromide suspended in zinc-bromide solution is a notable
negative quantity, slightly less numerically than the corre
sponding value for silver chloride suspended in equally strong
zinc-chloride solution (viz. – 112).

lead immersed in saturated solution of lead bromide of strength
*037 PbBr, 100 H.O opposed to amalgamated zinc and electro
cadmium immersed in their respective bromide solutions of
the same strength. The following values were obtained :—

corresponding with 36550 gramme-degrees. Hence

i. e. the thermovoltaic constant for electro-lead in saturated
lead-bromide solution is a large negative quantity, slightly
greater numerically than that for lead in saturated lead
chloride solution, viz. – 222.
                                   IV. Mercury.
    200. When mercuric-bromide solution is agitated with
metallic mercury, mercurous bromide is rapidly formed, so
that in a very short time practically all mercury and bromine
are removed from solution, just as is the case with mercuric
chloride (§ 183). Cells were therefore set up containing
mercury in contact with a magma of mercurous bromide
(freshly precipitated and well washed), suspended in zinc
bromide solution, and opposed, firstly, to amalgamated zinc
immersed in zinc-bromide solution, and, secondly, to electro
   * Zinc–cadmium assumed to give the same value for this solution
strength as that found above for the somewhat stronger solution
25CdBr, 100 H.O.

   Julius Thomsen finds Hgs, Bra-68290; whence EH="500
volt, corresponding with 22670 gramme-degrees. Hence
                               E—EH = + 472;
that is, the thermovoltaic constant for mercury in contact with
this bromide magma is a large positive quantity, somewhat
greater than that observed with the corresponding chloride
magma, viz. -->458.
   It is noticeable that the heat of formation of mercurous
bromide exceeds that of lead-bromide solution (Hgs, Br,
=68290, Pb, Br, aq.-54410, difference 13880, corresponding
with 306 volt); whilst the value of ki—k, for lead-mercury
bromide cells is
                       —-235—(+472)=–1707;
so that EH +ki-kº is negative relatively to Em, being
= —:401. On examining various such cells (solution-strength
=-037MBr, 100 H.O), the E.M.F. was found to be actually
of negative sign, the average observed value being – 402.

iron in excess and weighed quantities of bromine and water
in a stoppered bottle, filtering and using immediately). The

   As with the cadmium-iron sulphate and chloride cells, the
current passed in the second case in the direction opposite to
that predicable from the relative heats of formations of iron
and cadmium-bromide solutions; while the E.M.F. actually
set up in the first case notably eaceeded that similarly calculable
from the heats of formation of zinc- and iron-bromide solutions.

 plates opposed to amalgamated zinc and electro-cadmium,
 immersed in their respective bromide solutions of strength
 ‘25 MBr, 100 H.O. The readings exhibited the same fluc
 tuations as were observed with the sulphate and chloride

 readings were obtained, the current passing in the opposite

the constant being of + sign, since aluminium actually
acquires the higher potential, although it might à priori be
expected to acquire the lower potential.
    Julius Thomsen's thermochemical data lead to the value
Ali, Br, aq. = 136680; whence EH = –1.008 volt, corre
sponding with 45720 gramme-degrees. Consequently
              E–EH = + 295–(–1008) = +1:303;
i. e. the thermovoltaic constant for bright aluminium in

     Julius Thomsen finds the heat-values for this strength of
 solution are Zn, I.,aq. =60540, and Cd, I, aq. =47870; whence
EH = .279 volt, corresponding with 12670 gramme-degrees.
 Hence E—EH = + 043; i. e. the thermovoltaic constant for
cadmium in iodide solution of strength 25 CdI2 100 H2O is
   ositive in sign but not large numerically. It is noteworthy
that, with the corresponding bromide and chloride solutions,
the values were negative, viz. –'023 and —-036 respectively;
the bromide value being thus intermediate between the chloride
and iodide values.

    These values lead to the following valuations of the voltaic

   205. Cells were set up with mercury in contact with freshly

   Julius Thomsen finds that Hg2, IA-48440; whence EH =
•267 volt, corresponding with 12100 gramme-degrees. Hence
E—EH = + 534; i.e. the thermovoltaic constant for mercury
in contact with a magma of mercurous iodide suspended in
25 Zn I, 100 H2O is a large positive quantity, as similarly
found for mercury in contact with mercurous-bromide and
zinc-bromide solution and with mercurous-chloride and zinc
chloride solution of the same solution-strength, these latter
two values being respectively + 472 and +458. So that
the bromide value is intermediate between the values for
chloride and iodide; whilst the direction of variation with the
three halogens is the same as that observed both with cadmium
and with silver, viz. that the iodide value is algebraically the
greatest.
                                   IV. Lead.
   206. The very sparing solubility of lead iodide rendered it
impracticable to obtain good readings with cells set up with

        Chemical Affinity in terms of Electromotive Force.              207
 aqueous solutions of that salt. Accordingly a magma of lead
 iodide and zinc-iodide solution of strength 25 Zn<U+017F>, 100 H.O
was employed to surround the electro-lead plates used, opposed
in one set of experiments to amalgamated zinc in the same
zinc-iodide solution, and in another set to mercury immersed
in a magma of mercurous iodide suspended in the same zinc
iodide solution. The following values were obtained, the degree
of concordance being distinctly less than with most of the other
combinations examined :—
                                        Zinc-Lead.      Lead-Mercury.
          Maximum ...............           -489             – 317

          Probable error .........   -    +009               +008
   The lead-mercury cells gave a current in the direction
º           to that ... from the relative heats of formation
of zinc and mercurous iodides.
   From these numbers the following valuations of the voltaic
constant result:—
         Zinc-lead         .    .     . .   .    .  . .    .   .   .455
         Zinc-mercury--Mercury-lead                { _%          = 4.54
                                           Mean     . .    .   .   .455
    Julius Thomsen finds Pb, I, -39800; whence EH-457.
 Hence the thermovoltaic constant for electro-lead immersed
 in a magma of lead iodide suspended in 25 Zn I, 100 H2O is
 * Thinute negative quantity, viz. –'002.
   This value and those above found for electro-lead in contact
 With saturated-chloride and bromide-of-lead solutions respec
 tively, viz. – 222 and – 235, are not strictly comparable,
 * the solution-strength was not the same throughout ;
 whilst * magma containing zinc-iodide solution was used for
 the iodide cells and pure lead-salts for the others, which,
 *º, had respectively the strengths 05 PbCl, 100 H.0,
 and (37 PbBr, ibo H.G.                   Probably from these causes the
 bromide Yalue is not intermediate between the chloride and
 iodide values, as might have been anticipated ; but the last

 208 Messrs. Wright and Thompson on the Determination of
 value is algebraically the greatest, as was found with cadmium
 silver and mercury.
    It is hence evident that whilst the thermovoltaic constants
 of metals in contact with their oxy salts (sulphates, nitrates,
 and acetates) do not vary widely, the same remark is not true
 for their halogen salts (chlorides, bromides, iodides). In
 É.eneral  the thermovoltaic constant is decreased (algebraically)
      substitution of bromide for iodide or of chloride for
 bromide ; although this rule is not without exception, e. g.
 in the case of iron, where the values for 25 i. 100 H.O
 are +204 and + 134, where X represents chlorine and
 bromine respectively, the substitution of chlorine for bromine
 thus causing a notable increase.
                        Summary of Results.
    207. The experiments above described lead to the general
 conclusion that electromotors, consisting of voltaic cells in
 which two different metals are surrounded by solutions of
 corresponding salts respectively, are capable of generating
 electromotive forces which (when not depreciated sensibly
 below their maximum value by giving rise to currents of
 densities greater than certain small limiting values) usually
 stand in no simple relationship to the chemical action taking
   lace in the cell during the passage of the currrent, or to the
fººt.              taking place during that passage, or to the
 heats of formation of the two solutions electrolyzed. The
 values of the maximum E.M.F.'s thus generated may, however,
 be deduced within very close limits of accuracy by taking the .
 algebraic difference between certain numerical values or
 voltaic constants assigned to each metal in contact with each
 given solution, these values varying slightly according to the
 surface-nature of the immersed metal, and being also depen
 dent on the nature and strength of the solution of metallic
 salt in contact with the metal, and probably also varying with
the temperature, but being otherwise actually constant.
    Further, these maximum E.M.F. values may be connected
with the difference in heat of formation between the two
solutions electrolyzed by supposing that the total difference of
potential set up is due to two superposed causes:–one, the heat
evolution due to the difference in heat of formation of the two
solutions, which tends to make the metal immersed in the
electrolyte of lesser formation-heat acquire the higher potential
(like the copper plate of a Daniell cell); the other, a thermo
voltaic action akin to the modus operandi of an ordinary

                 Chemical Affinity in terms of Electromotive Force.                       209
         thermovoltaic couple, in virtue of which a difference of
         potential is set up expressible by the algebraic difference
         between two numerical values, or thermovoltaic constants,
         assignable to each metal respectively, the which values vary pari
         passu with the variations in the corresponding voltaic con
         stants. This thermovoltaic action being expressible by ki—ks,
         and the first source of potential-difference being indicated by
         EH, the total difference of potential set up is
                                           E=EH + ki-kº,
         where, if ki—k, be materially different from zero (which is most
         frequently the case), the value of E will differ materially from
         that of EH, exceeding or falling short of it according as ki-kº is
         positive or negative in sign with respect to Em. i. the latter
         case, if ki—k, be numerically greater than EH, the direction
         of the current actually generated is the reverse of that predi
         cable from the relative heats of formation of the electrolytes.
             208. The following Table furnishes a brief epitome of the
         mean values of the voltaic and thermovoltaic constants deduced
         above for various metals and fluids at a temperature within a
         very few degrees above or below 18°C.; the solutions surround
         ing both plates        .#        of equal strength (m zinc-salt molecules
         per 100 water molecules), the plate-surfaces being freshly amal

XXIII. On some Electromagnetic Experiments, continued.—
   No. II. Diverse views of Faraday, Ampère, and Weber.
   By S. TolvKR PRESTON".
IN Poggendorff’s Annalen (1841, Bd. lii.) is a remarkable
      paper by Prof. W. Weber, entitled “Die unipolare
Induction,” which refers of course to the well-known fact of
the induction of continuous currents by the influence of the
single pole of a rotating magnet.
   In spite of the comparatively old date of this paper, it is
well known and referred to in the present day. This paper
has some relation to the subject of my last communica
tion to the Philosophical Magazine (February 1885); but I
wish to point out that it does not alter or affect the conclu
sions there arrived at, but, on the contrary, tends to confirm
them.
   The paper of Prof. Weber appears to open out a new ques
tion, distinct from the phenomena dealt with in my commu
nication ; and I would call attention to the fact that Prof.
Weber's idea would appear to involve one theoretic conclusion
which appears at first sight improbable, but which, if true,
would seem to render an experimental determination possible
which might be capable of throwing some light on the phy
sical nature of the electric “current.”           I am not aware that
the subject has been considered from this point of view, and
of course anything I submit will be open to criticism.
   I will remark, first, that Prof. Weber agrees with my view
(which accords with that of Ampère, and is opposite to that of
Faradayt), viz. that the “lines of force,” or field of force, about
a magnet must be considered in that sense fixed or dependent
on the magnet, that this field of force rotates when the mag
net rotates on its axis, or, otherwise put—When a magnet
rotates on its axis, the field of force must (in regard to the
inductive effect) be considered as moving with the magnet
and intersecting external conductors, in the same sense as it
would do if the magnet were bodily translated.
   The chief point which I wish to notice in Prof. Weber's
paper is his view as to the cause of the rotation of a magnet
  * Communicated by the Author.
  t I may mention that the object of my last paper was to point out an
apparent ambiguous case (involving an oversight) in Faraday's experi
ments, which caused him to take the opposite of the above view as to the
rotation of the field of force with the magnet, yº,  Faraday contradicted
Ampère's theory in this respect, although he speaks in approving terms
of the theory in other respects.

216        Mr. S. Tolver Preston on some Electromagnetic
on its axis, when one terminal of a voltaic battery is main
tained in sliding contact with the equatorial part of the
magnet, the other terminal in sliding contact with the pole
of the magnet (a perfectly well-known experiment).
    Prof. Weber thinks that, because in this case the current
flows during part of its course within the body of the magnet,
the explanation of the rotation afforded by Ampère's theory is
“not at all ” (keineswegs) applicable".
    Prof. Weber says (translation):—“The two effects (i. e.
the rotation of a magnet on its axis, and the converse case of
the rotation of a conductor about the magnet), which Ampère
here endeavours to explain from like causes, are, however, in
 reality of different nature; and each demands its own expla
nation. The explanation given by him (Ampère) only applies
to the rotation of the ...i. about the magnet, discovered
by Faraday, and not at all to the rotation of the magnet on
its axis discovered by himself.”f
    But now I would call attention to the fact that the rotation
of the magnet is found to take place apparently equally well
when the current does not enter the body of the magnet at all,
such as when the magnet is coated with a metallic sheath or
cylinder, insulated from the body of the magnet by intervening
cement or paper, so that the current flows along the sheath
instead of entering the body of the magnet.
    If, then, the magnet rotates in this case (when no current
enters its body), how, it may be asked, can it be said that
Ampère's explanation of the rotation when the body of the
magnet (instead of the metallic sheath) is used to conduct the
current, is “not at all ” (keineswegs) applicable 2
   For Ampère's theory, when the magnet is coated with the
sheath, admittedly accounts for a force of rotation of the
magnet (on its axis) equal to that with which (conversely)
the external loop—called for brevity “ conductor”—would
rotate about the magnet if it (the loop or “conductor”) were
free to move. Ampère's theory therefore accounts for a
force of rotation in the magnet equal to the opposite force of
  * Ampère, as is known, considered the rotation of the magnet on its
axis to be due to the same cause as the (converse) rotation of the “con
ductor” (or external loop of wire) about the magnet, or he considered the
effect to be a simple case of “action and reaction” between the movable
parts of the circuit; i.e. whether the conductor revolved about the mag
net, or (conversely) the magnet rotated on its axis, depended simply on
which was free to move. The movement (on Ampère's view) depended
on the reaction between the current in the conductor and the external
magnetic field of the magnet, whereby the two tended to be twisted or to
rotate in opposite directions.

           Ewperiments of Faraday, Ampère, and Weber.           217
  rotation of the conductor about the magnet. What more,
  may I ask, do we want, or is not this sufficient? Is it to be
  supposed that when the body of the magnet conducts the
  current instead of the insulated sheath, the force of rotation
  of the magnet is then (by some action of the portion of the
  current within the magnet) greater than in the former case,
  i. e. greater than the (converse) force of rotation of the con
  ductor about the magnet? In other words, when (in the first
  case) the magnet is coated with a sheath (simply to prevent
  the current from entering its body) the rotative forces of the
  magnet and conductor are equal: then (in the second case),
  when the sheath is removed, is it to be assumed, or does Prof.
  Weber's theory imply, that the opposite rotative forces are
  unequal (so that the magnet and the conductor now tend to
  revolve in opposite directions about each other with unequal
  forces)? It appears that Ampère's theory is sufficient to
  account for equal rotative forces in magnet and conductor in
  opposite directions. Does Prof. Weber's view imply that
  wnequal forces of torsion—or of tendency to rotation—in
  opposite directions have to be accounted for, or exist when the
  current flows into the body of the magnet 2
     If so, a curious result would appear to follow, viz. (the
  opposite moments of torsion being assumed unequal, or the
  moment of torsion of the magnet on its axis being assumed
 greater than that of the conductor about the magnet) a re
 sultant moment of torsion must exist in the system ending to
 turn it about its centre of gravity. Or otherwise expressed,
 it would follow apparently that if the whole system, with a
 small voltaic battery fixed in it, were all delicately suspended
 as one whole, it would tend to rotate about its centre of
 gravity by the action of forces within itself without any
 external visible support or point of reaction.
     I would call attention to this improbable result, which
 appears to follow from Prof. Weber's view. But I am not
prepared to contend that this result might not be possible
under certain conceptions. If found to be true on trying the
experiment, the result would be highly interesting, as its
analysis would probably be capable of throwing a light on the
physical nature of the electric “current.”
    Another way of trying the experiment might suggest itself.
The moment of torsion of the magnet on its axis might be
exactly measured,first with the insulated sheath, and, secondly,
without it.     If in the last case (i. e. without the sheath), the
moment of torsion were found to be greater, this would (as
stated) appear to indicate the existence of a resultant moment
of torsion which, when the sheath is removed, tends to twist

the whole system—conductor, magnet, battery and all—about
a common centre of gravity. This result (as remarked) will
appear improbable at first sight at least. If found to be con
firmed on making the experiment, it would not, as it seems
to me (and I would put this as a query) necessarily invalidate
Ampère's theory, which accounts for equal forces of rotation
in opposite directions. It would rather add an additional or
new experimental fact to knowledge.
    P.S. The conditions stated in the above paper are, I think,
capable of settling this question ; and in this I am confirmed
§    a letter recently received from Prof. Wilhelm Weber, of
   Öttingen, to whom the present manuscript was previously
sent. I quote the following remark from Prof. Weber's
letter (dated February 15, 1885):
    “Ich habe sie (i. e. the present manuscript) mit grösstem
 Interesse gelesen und mich gefreut, dass die Frage iber uni
polare Induction dadurch endlich zu definitiver Erledigung
gelangen werde.”
    I may say I had, some time ago, received a letter from Lord
 Rayleigh, in which he spoke favourably of my view in the last
 º. hil. Mag., Feb.), which was in opposition to that of
   araday. I pointed out in my last paper that the experiment
 on which Faraday founded his view was capable of a double
 meaning. The subject appears an extremely interesting one to
 follow out experimentally, as there are conditions in the
 inquiry which would seem, if investigated, to be capable of
 throwing a light on the physical nature of the electric “current,”
and even of magnetism.

     XXIV. On Prof. Edlund’s T.heory that a Vacuum is a
                       Conductor of Electricity.
    To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,
      SHOULD like to call the attention of Prof. Edlund to an
       objection to his view that a discharge-resisting vacuum
 is nevertheless a conductor of electricity. The objection is
 one that I urged in a letter to “Nature' in the spring of 1883,
 and, so far as I am aware, it has not yet been answered. I
 refer to the fact that a body surrounded by such a vacuum is
 acted upon inductively by another electrified body near it,
 and not screened from the action as it would be if surrounded
 by a conductor.

         Determination of the Mean Density of the Earth. 219
   Although there was probably when I wrote already sufficient
experimental evidence to show that induction took place across
such a vacuum, yet I thought it worth while to make the
experiment described in my letter, in which a platinum ball
suspended in such a vacuum is shown to be strongly attracted
towards a neighbouring electrified platinum sheath, precisely
as if suspended in any other fluid dielectric, while a minute
spark was seen at the moment when the two attracting bodies
came into contact.
   This tube and others that I experimented with exhibited
the luminous effects described by Prof. Edlund when moved
in the neighbourhood of an electrified body or influenced by the
passage of currents in the neighbourhood; but I do not think
that this luminosity is necessarily the proof of a current in the
ordinary sense. It may be due to the increase or diminution
of induction within the medium, some of the energy of the
induction-tubes being absorbed in transit.
    It would be interesting to make the experiment of passing
 a strong current      i.        a stout wire surrounded by such a
 vacuum, and to observe whether the transit of energy across
 the vacuum * was attended by any luminous effect. If it were,
 then the vacuum might be regarded as a conductor in so far
 as the inductive energy entering is transformed into the lumi
 nous form. If no effect were observed, we should infer that
 this transformation did not take place when a steady flow was
 reached, but only     *               variations in the flow.

 XXV. On the Application of the Pendulum to the Determi
    nation of the Mean Density of the Earth. By Dr. J.
    WILSING, of Potsdam f.
 Th;         first experimental determination of the mean density
         of the Earth which Maskelyne and Hutton carried out
 depends on the observation of deflection of the plumb-line in
 the neighbourhood of Schehallien. It is limited by the uncer
 tainty arising from our imperfect knowledge of the mass and
  density of the deflecting mountain, an error which also affects
  the results deduced by Carlini and Airy from oscillations of
  the pendulum. Accordingly the use of the pendulum has been
  abandoned in favour of the torsion-balance, as it is not sensi

220    Dr. J. Wilsing on the Application of the Pendulum to
tive enough to be appreciably influenced by smaller masses
which are capable .accurate determination.
   The necessary degree of sensitiveness may be obtained by
adjusting the centre of gravity of the pendulum close under
the axis of oscillation. With an experimental apparatus, which
was intended to get some indications as to the practical execu
tion of this já.           experiments were made in September
of last year in the observatory. This consisted of a prismatic
rod of thin sheet-iron, at the ends of which were fixed lead
balls, each weighing 300 grammes. The steel knife-edge,
which worked on agate, was fixed in the middle of the
rod. The apparatus was so arranged that, when in equilibrium,
its axis was almost vertical. The motion was read off by
reflection. When the position of equilibrium was found and
the attracting masses were placed near the lead spheres, from
the deflection of the pendulum, the ratio of their attraction to
the constant of gravitation can be determined. By reversing
the direction of the deflecting forces, the action of the force
can be doubled.
    This method may be regarded as a combination of the two
oldest methods. In comparison with the method used by
 Prof. von Jolly with such distinguished success, it has the
advantage that the sensitiveness of the pendulum is consider
 ably greater.
    Although the crude construction of the experimental instru
 ment made it very difficult to introduce the needful corrections,
 —it being mounted on a wooden support, and not sufficiently
 protected against currents of air-a time of oscillation of 150
 seconds could be attained without the occurrence of irregula
 rities which could be regarded as essential. This may be
 explained by the fact that partial oscillations are excluded
 as completely as possible, and the axis of the pendulum de
 flects but a little on each side of the vertical, so that the
 bending of the rod is only a very slight amount. The degree
 of delicacy corresponding to the above-mentioned time of
 oscillation would be sufficient to measure the attraction of
 spheres of a few hundredweight, as is possible by using a
 torsion-balance.
     The sensitiveness of the apparatus was ascertained from the
  observation of oscillation by the addition of weights, which
  were placed at known distances from the knife-edge at the
  lower end of the pendulum. If gm is the weight of the piece
  added, d the distance of its centre of gravity from the knife
  edge, the time of vibration for infinitely small oscillations is
                    T=r, /MK-F wºrm<U+017F>

    the Determination of the Mean Density of the Earth. 221
   From this, in connection with the time of vibration of the
unloaded pendulum, we get the magnitude gMs, which forms
the denominator in the expression for the angle of deflection,
                          tan p _g/ml
                                = gMs’
where g’ is the attraction of the deflecting mass, m the mass
of the pendulum-bob, l the distance of its centre from the
knife-edge. Closer consideration shows that the use of this
method is even allowable if a correction is made for the buoy
ancy of the air, Bessel’s correction for the moment of inertia,
and for a possible blunting of the knife-edge; for the form of
the equation does not alter, and only the magnitudes g|Ms
and MK” acquire a different signification.
   As an example of the determination I may here          i.   the
results of two series of observations.   In the first the duration
of the free oscillation was:–
                                        T, - 5520
          Extra weight 1 gr. . . T = 22:00
              22     , 5 gr. . . T. = 10:46
              25     22 10 gr.   .  .   Tio -    7-48
Expressed in grammes and millimetres, we have for gMs the
values
                     81.96, 81.25, 81.89.
  In the second series the time of the free oscillation was:—
                                       T, - 14520
         Extra weight 1 gr. . . T = 23:64
              ,, , 3 gr. . . Tº = 13.66
                   , 8 gr. . . Tº = 8:41
and for gMs, 22
                    13.75, 13:50, 13:50.
  The concordance between these numbers, which are inde
pendent of each other, is also somewhat limited by the error
of the extra weight, the amount of which was not known.
The experiments show, however, with certainty that the value
of the reduction may be determined with great accuracy with
an apparatus of convenient construction.
   Besides the calculation of the gravitation of the pendulum
bob towards the attracting masses which is common to all
methods, two measurements are necessary—the distance of
the extra weight, and of the centre of the pendulum-bobs
from the knife-edge. These measurements, however, require
no other appliances than those which are in use with the
reversion-pendulum.

222                 Notices respecting New Books.
   The result of the experiments hitherto made renders it
scarcely doubtful that the pendulum, which does such excel
lent service in all problems bearing on the determination of
gravity, will also give useful results for our present purpose ;
and in the immediate future I hope, by means of an apparatus
constructed by Repsold, of Hamburg, to continue these
observations in the astrophysical observatory and to bring
them to a conclusion.

A Treatise on the Principles of Chemistry. By M. M. PATTIsoN
   MUIR, M.A., F.R.S.E., Fºllow, and Prelector in Chemistry, of Gon
   ville and Caius College, Cambridge. Cambridge: The University
   Press.
MR,       MUIR'S book is certainly one of the most important con
        tributions which have been made to general English Chemical
literature for many years, and will, we feel sure, be heartily
welcomed by all who are engaged in teaching chemical science in
this country. A text-book of a like scope to Lothar Meyer's well
known Moderne Theorien der Chemie has long been a desidera
tum; and it is surprising that a translation of the latter into the
English language has not been published long ere this. Such
 a translation will, however, not be in such request now that Mr.
 Muir has brought out a book similar in kind, and, as we think, of
 equal merit, and probably more suitable for English students than
 a translation of the German work would have been.
    The volume is not of course an elementary text-book, but is
 intended for advanced students and teachers, giving a lucid and
 comprehensive view of chemical theory and the general principles of
the science down to the most recent date. The author says he has
 “tried to deal with chemical facts and generalizations so as to show
 their reality,” and in this we think he has eminently succeeded.
 Mr. Muir possesses the happy method of marshalling even dry
 facts in a manner both interesting and instructive, and of eliciting
 therefrom the information which they are designed to teach. His
 success in this respect is in great part due to his having throughout
 “followed in the very footprints of the great discoverers, watched
 them as they make their footing sure and as they feel their way
 up the heights.” This is undoubtedly the plan on which a treatise
 on chemical principles and theory should be written. When pre
 sented in this manner the student is always in a position to see
 where fact ends and hypothesis begins, and is thus enabled to judge
 for himself as to the particular value to be placed on any given
 theory. . As an example of this we may mention more especially
 the capital summary of atomic heat-determinations and their
 bearing on the determination of atomic weights. This method
 has also an educational value in showing how abstruse chemical

                    Notices respecting New Books.                 223
problems are worked out and made capable of presentation in a
simple and concise manner.
   The work is divided into two parts. In the first, which in the
main deals with Chemical Statics, we have a statement and discus
sion of the Atomic and Molecular theory, and its application to such
subjects as isomerism, allotropy, nascent action, and classification.
In this part there is also an account of the application of physical
methods to the solution of chemical problems. The second part
treats with such subjects as may be conveniently considered under
Chemical Kinetics, as dissociation, chemical change, and equilibrium,
affinity, and the relations between chemical action and the distri
bution of the energy of the changing system.
   The chapter on Atoms and Molecules is remarkably well written,
and gives a clear account of the growth of the views at present
held by chemists. In that portion dealing with the molecular
weights of solids, the author seems to have overlooked the import
ant work of Prof. Louis Henry on the Polymerization of the
Oxides, in which this subject is treated in a very masterly manner
and most cogent arguments adduced in favour of the view that the
molecular weights of solids are much higher than is represented
by the simple formulae usually assigned to them. Our own re
searches on the colour of chemical compounds, so far as they go,
are in favour of Prof. Henry's views.
    After an account of the service which vapour-density, specific
 heat, and isomorphism render in the determination of atomic
 weights, the nature of the methods based on purely chemical evi
 dence is next described; and the chapter finally concludes with an
 exceedingly good and useful table giving a summary of the most
 important facts concerning the atomic weights of the elements.
 This table we consider to be a marked and very valuable feature
 in the book; for we fully agree with the author that “it is well
 that the student should have placed before him a synopsis of the
 evidence on which these all-important numbers are based.” The
 table is also rendered additionally useful by copious references to
 the original memoirs.
    Chapter II gives a good résumé of the more important facts
 bearing on “nascent action,” an expression which the author con
 siders to have been “at once helpful and harmful to the progress
 of Chemistry. By classing under a common name many pheno
 mena that might otherwise have been lost in the mass of facts with
  which the science has to deal, the expression has done good service;
  but in so far as its use has tended to prevent investigation—for it
 is always easier to say of any, unusual reactions, These are cases of
 nascent action, than to examine carefully into their cause and con
 ditions—the use of the expression has been unfavourable to the best
 interests of chemical science.” The sections of this chapter treating
 of equivalency, allotropy, and isomerism are well worthy of careful
 perusal, and will undoubtedly serve a good purpose in giving
  teachers of Chemistry a clearer and more concise idea of the meaning
  which ought to be attached to the vexed term “atomicity.” The

224                Notices respecting New Books.
view supported by Mr. Muir is that put forward more especially
by Lossen; and from the arguments adduced this seems to be the
most philosophical in the present state of our knowledge.
   The section on Isomerism includes an account of Groth's crys
tallographical researches on the derivatives of benzene, and gives
in detail the more important inexplicable phenomena of isomerism
presented by hydrobenzoin, dulcitol, the lactic and tartaric acids, &c.,
the discussion of which adds considerably to the interest of this
portion of the book. Here also Lehmann's important researches
on physical isomerism have a prominent place.
    The Periodic Law is treated in a separate chapter, and more
fully, we believe, than in any other English text-book. It will
thus be of valuable assistance to those who are unable to consult
the original memoirs on this subject. Scarcely sufficient credit,
however, is given to Newlands, who, in the publication of his ‘Law
of Octaves, was certainly the first to draw attention to the periodic
connection between the atomic weights and the properties of the
elements. The periodic relation between the atomic weights and
the heats of formation of the elements with chlorine, bromine, and
 iodine, which was first pointed out by the writer of this review in
 a paper published in the ‘Proceedings’ of the Royal Society, and
 also at greater length in another paper in the Chemiker Zeitung,
 is erroneously ascribed by Mr. Muir to Laurie, whose paper was
 only published by the Royal Society of Edinburgh some years sub
 sequently.
    The section dealing with Thermo-chemistry will, we think, be of
 very great service to teachers, as there are but few English text
books which even refer to this subject. The value of this section
 is also greatly enhanced by the numerous, varied, and well-chosen
 examples which are given of problems dealing with heat-changes
produced by chemical action.
    In Book II., under the head of Chemical Kinetics are included
facts and principles which chiefly relate to chemical action as
 opposed to those which refer more especially to chemical composi
 tion.   It is evident, as the author states, that this division can
 only be carried out in the broadest way, but it is nevertheless a
 very convenient and useful division for working purposes. The
 same facts, for a complete knowledge of their bearings, must be
 studied from both a Statical and Kinetical point of view.
    Under Kinetics we have a chapter on Dissociation, followed by
 one on Chemical Change, wherein are discussed at length the theories
 of Williamson, Pfaundler, Horstman, and Gibbs; and an account
 is also given of the work of Gladstone, Harcourt, and Menschutkin
 on this subject. In a chapter on Chemical Affinity much stress is
 laid on the dynamical hypothesis of Guldberg and Waage, which
 is shown io be almost independent of any molecular theory of the
 structure of matter; whilst, as extended by Ostwald, “it forms a
bridge connecting the investigation of the chemical properties of
molecules with that of the action of the forces which come into

                             Geological Society.                    225
  play during chemical operations. The thermo-dynamical methods
  of investigation introduced by Horstman, Gibbs, and others, and
  the electrical methods founded on the work of Joule and Thomson,
  and developed by Helmholtz and Wright, also enable us to gain
  some conceptions of the conditions under which chemical changes
  proceed and chemical equilibrium is established, and at the same
  time throw a little light on the most profound parts of chemical
  phenomena, the nature and conditions of action of the forces
  concerned in the combinations and decompositions of atoms.”
     The fair and cautious manner in which the author introduces
  all the ordinarily accepted theories, as well as those which are less
  known, is one of the excellent points of the book ; whilst his
  parting advice, “to exhibit the hypotheses of Chemistry as at once
  arising from facts and serving as guides in the quest of facts,”
  is what all teachers and workers in our science will do well to bear
  in mind, remembering that one of the chief difficulties in “the use
  of chemical hypotheses consists in determining the limits of the class
  of phenomena to which each hypothesis can be applied.”
     In conclusion, we can commend Mr. Muir's book most heartily to
  both teachers and taught as a reliable source of information on
  general chemical theory as well as on many points not easily found
  in the ordinary text-books, and the accounts of which as occurring
  in the original memoirs are generally in a too unwieldy condition
  for reference when time and opportunity are limited. We believe
  that no one will rise from a perusal of this book without feeling
  that his mind has become cleared on many points and his sym
  pathies widened into taking a much deeper interest in those branches
  of the science with which he is not immediately concerned, whilst
  many will experience an increased desire to have a share in the
  solving of problems which have not yet yielded to the force of in
  vestigation. As page after page is passed in review, we feel that we
  are indeed following in the “very footprints of the discoverers.”

      1. “The Boulder-clays of Lincolnshire: their Geographical Range
   and Relative Age.” By A. J. Jukes-Browne, Esq., B.A., F.G.S.
      The author commenced by referring to the late Mr. Searles W.
   Wood's papers on the Glacial beds of Yorkshire and Lincolnshire,
   and stated, as the result of his own investigations, that two distinct
   types of Boulder-clay occur in Lincolnshire, (1) the grey or blue

226                      Geological Society :—
clay, (2) the red and brown clays; the former undoubtedly an ex
tension of the Upper or Chalky Boulder-clay of Rutland and East
Anglia, while the second includes the Purple and Hessle Clays of
Mr. S. W. Wood. These two types of Boulder-clay are very rarely
in contact with each other.
   The brown Boulder-clays of East Lincolnshire rest upon a broad
plain of Chalk, which appears to terminate westward in a concealed
line of cliff, this cliff-line coinciding with the strike of the slope
which descends from the Chalk Wolds to the Boulder-clay plateau by
which they are bordered. The present boundary-line of the
Boulder-clay runs along this slope for long distances, though in
many places the clay has surmounted the slope and caps the hills to
the west of it.
   From Louth the main mass of the “brown clay” is bounded by
a line drawn through Wyham, Hawerby, Laceby, and Brocklesby
to Barrow and Barton on Humber, sweeping round the north end
of the Lincolnshire Wolds and occurring on both sides of the
Humber. Previously to the author's inspection of this district no
Purple or Hessle clay had been discovered west of South Ferriby,
and these clays were supposed to be entirely absent on the western
side of the Wolds. The officers of the Survey have, however,
mapped several tracts of such clay in the valley of the Ancholme.
It occupies the surface at Horkstow, Winterton Holme, Winterton,
and Winteringham. It probably underlies the alluvium of the
Ancholme near and south of these places, and occurs again at higher
levels in the neighbourhood of Brigg.      South of Brigg it has been
seen at low levels on either side of the valley of the Ancholme, as
far as Bishop's Bridge near Glentham.
   Beyond this point it was not traceable in the Ancholme valley,
but south of Market Rasen patches of reddish-brown clay, mottled
with grey, and containing small flints and pebbles of chalk, occur,
and cap the low ridges separating the valleys of the brooks.
   Another tract of Boulder-clay, which the author considers to
belong to the same series, occupies the western border of the Fen
land S.E. of Lincoln, what is left of it forming a ridge which runs
southward for many miles. It passes eastward beneath the Fen
deposits; and similar mottled clay was seen in the excavations for
the Boston docks beneath about 20 feet of Fen-clays &c., and resting
upon blue Boulder-clay of the “Chalky” type. Besides this sec
tion at Boston, there are very few places where the two types of
clay are in contact, or so near as to afford any evidence as to their
relative age.    Near East and West Real, and again near Louth,
the “Brown Clays” are banked against the slopes of hills which
are capped with the “Chalky Clay.” The same is the case also
near Brigg, where the country seems to have been originally covered
by a sheet of the Chalky Clay, through which valleys were eroded
into the Jurassic clays, and the brown (Hessle) clay is found only
in these valleys.

               On the Geology of the Rio-Tinto Mines.               227
    The author concludes, therefore, that the “Brown-clay series”
is of much newer date than the “Blue and grey series.”
    In conclusion, the author summed up the inferences drawn in the
paper, correlated the Basement Clay of Holderness with the Chalky
Clay of Lincolnshire, and suggested that the Purple Clay may be
confined to the east side of the wolds.     The classification he would
propose is therefore as follows:—
                         Lincolnshire.           Yorkshire.
                        Hessle clay.    Hessle and upper red clay
      Newer Glacial.                      of coast.

    2. “On the Geology of the Rio-Tinto Mines, with some general
Remarks on the Pyritic Region of the Sierra Morena.” By J. H.
Collins, Esq., F.G.S.
    After briefly describing the geographical position of the Rio-Tinto
mines and the occurrence at the same of pyritous ores amongst
slates and schists which abut against gneissose rocks to the north,
and pass under Tertiary beds to the southward, the author pro
ceeded to consider the general characters and associations of the
ºyrites-deposits, and then gave a general account of the Rio-Tinto
district. The slates were described, and the fossil evidence recapi
tulated upon which an Upper Devonian age had been assigned to
them.      Analyses were furnished to show the changes due to
Weathering and to infiltration. The various intrusive rocks (syenite,
diabase, and porphyries) occurring in the schists were described,
and analyses of them given. The sedimentary iron-ores and their
 composition were next noticed, and the author ascribed their
 formation to deposition in lakes.
   .The masses of pyrites which furnish the principal ores of Rio
 Tinto were then described, their mode of occurrence in fissures be
 *Ween dissimilar rocks explained, and their formation discussed.
 The different kinds of ore obtained from the mines were noticed in
 detail, and several analyses added, giving samples both of the mixed
 Orº, and of the pure minerals.
    The manganese-lodes were next described, and shown to be
 Pºllel to the pyrites-fissures, and frequently to be only branches
 of the latter.

 the district, the ore-deposits, and the surface-geology was appended.

    The following communications were read:—
    1. “The Tertiary and Older Peridotites of Scotland.” By John
 W. Judd, F.R.S., Sec. G.S.
    The very interesting rocks known as “peridotites” have been
 regarded by many petrographers as peculiar to, and, indeed, cha
 racteristic of, the older geological periods; but in the Western
 Isles of Scotland there occur a number of rocks of this class, con
 stituting portions of intrusive masses, which the author, in a pre
 vious paper, has shown to be the central cores of Tertiary volcanoes
 of vast dimensions.
    These Tertiary peridotites are most intimately associated with
 the gabbros and dolerites, the folspathic and non-felspathic rocks
 passing into one another by insensible gradations, and the rocks of
 either class being intersected by veins of the other. The peridotites
 exhibit the same varieties of microscopic structure as the associated
 gabbros and dolerites, these structures being described under the
 names of “granitic,” “ophitic,” and “porphyro-granulitic.”
    The felspars, which are rare in the peridotites, are intermediate in
 composition between labradorite and anorthite; they rarely, however,
exhibit evidence under the microscope of being built up of laminae
 belonging to different species. The study of the lamellar twinning,
 which is a common, but by no means universal, character in these
felspar crystals, points to the conclusion that it has been induced by
pressure or strain, like the similar structure in rock-forming calcite.
The pyroxenes are represented by many varieties, both of the
monoclinic forms (augites) and the rhombic forms (enstatites), the
former being by far the most abundant. The olivines below are,
for the most part, highly ferruginous varieties. The spinellids,
magnetite, chromite, and picotite occur in these rocks, as do also
titano-ferrite and its alteration-products. Among the accessory
constituents biotite is the most abundant.
   It was shown that each of the minerals of these rocks is found to
undergo remarkable changes as we pass from the superficial to the
central portions of these intrusive rock-masses. The most impor
tant of these changes is that for which the author proposed the
name “schillerization.” It consists in the development of micro
scopic enclosures, in the form of plates and rods, along certain
planes within the crystal, giving rise to metallic reflections or a play
of colour. The felspars, pyroxenes, and olivines are all found to be
affected in this way when they have formed the deepest parts of
these volcanic cones. In this way common augite is seen at
gradually increasing depths, passing into the deep brown variety
known as pseudo-hypersthene.          The last-mentioned substance
presents a curious “mimicry" of true hypersthene and paulite,
which is the schillerized form of a ferriferous enstatite.
   The Tertiary peridotites present many variations, not only in

                 Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.          229
their structure but also in their mineralogical constitution. Among
them occur examples of the rocks which have received the names of
dunite, picrite, and lherzolite, with some curious types composed of
felspar and olivine.
    Among the older peridotites of Scotland a new and very interest
ing type is described from near Loch Scye in Caithness. It appears
to have been originally a mica-picrite, but the whole of the original
minerals have been converted into paramorphs, firstly by schilleri
zation and subsequently by amphibolization and serpentinization.
    In conclusion, it was pointed out that the discrimination between
the effects of the changes described as schillerization and those
known as uralitization, amphibolization, serpentinization, and
kaolinization is of the utmost importance, not only to the petro
grapher but to the mineralogist.
    2. “Boulders wedged in the Falls of the Cynfael, Ffestiniog.”
 By T. Mellard Reade, Esq., F.G.S.
    This paper briefly described certain phenomena of stream-denu
 dation observed in the bed of the Cynfael, which has cut a deep
 channel through the Lingula Flags, the course of the channel being
 mainly dependent on the jointing of the rock. In one spot the
 upper beds at the top of the gorge have slid upon the lower along
 their dip, about 10° to north by east, so as to project over the
 stream like a corbel; and advantage has been taken of this to
 form a bridge by means of a slab of rock laid from the projecting
 mass to the top of the opposite bank. At another point several
 Very large boulders are stuck fast in the channel, and the stream
 flows beneath them.       The boulders could not possibly have been
 Carried down the existing gorge, and they had not, the author
 believed, fallen from above. He suggested that they might have
 been carried down by the aid of ice, probably in the glacial period,
  when the stream ran in a wider channel, and that they had been
  Polished by the action of the water.

It is still incomplete, and the leading facts only are mentioned here
to take date.
   Not all colouring-matters are capable of uniting with the silver
salts, but the number of those that do so unite is considerable.
What is curious and tends to show that the combination is intimate,
is that the colour assumed by the silver-salt is not always that of
the dye, but may differ from it considerably. Also the three silver
salts may be differently coloured by one and the same colouring
matter.
   More frequently, however, colouring-matters impart their own
shade or something approaching to it. Thus, silver bromide preci
pitated in presence of excess of silver nitrate takes from aniline
purple a strong purple colour; from cardinal-red a bright flesh or
salmon-colour; from naphthaline-yellow a light yellow colour; from
eosin a brilliant pinkish or salmon; and so on.
   Different specimens of the same colour gave sometimes quite
different results: thus, silver bromide precipitated in presence of
silver nitrate was dyed by one specimen of methyl-green to a bluish
green. Another specimen of the same colour obtained from a dif
ferent source coloured the same silver-salt a deep purplish shade.
Silver iodide showed the same difference.
    Sixteen years ago I proposed to colour or stain the photographic
 film in order to modify its behaviour towards light, principally to
prevent blurring or irradiation*.
    Of many colouring-matters then tried, the best proved to be
litmus coloured red by acetic acid. This was very effectual for the
purpose, and was long used by others as well as myself. So far as
I have been able to ascertain, it was the first suggestion made of
this mode of acting on the sensitive plate. Since then, staining
the film has been found to have other applications; and many others
have experimented in this direction, in most cases with a view to
 alter its sensitiveness relatively to the different colours of the
 spectrum. Major Waterhouse was, I believe, the first to recognize
 this effect.
    Dr. John W. Draper appears to have first advanced the view
 that substances sensitive to light are affected by the rays which
 they absorb. There is much to support this theory, although it
 cannot be considered as definitely established.
    Some years since Dr. H. W. Vogel expressed the opinion that,
 when sensitive films were washed over with solutions of colouring
 matters, the films gained sensitiveness to those rays of the spectrum
 which the colouring-matters absorb, with this condition—that the
 colouring-matter in question must be capable of combining with Cl,
 Br, or I, as the case might be. My own results were different. I
 found that the action of the rays was profoundly modified by
 colouring the film; but the result did not seem to conform to any
 law, and as often contradicted Vogel's view as agreed with it.
    Vogel's theory necessitates the assumption that the colour

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.              231
imparted to the silver-salt is identical with that of the dye used; and,
as has been shown above, that by no means follows. He supposed
that the capacity of any given colour to influence the silver-salt
depended upon its tendency to combine with Cl, Br, and I;
whereas, as we have above seen, its action most probably depends
upon its ability or inability to combine with the silver haloid.
    But the principal source of error has arisen from the fact that
when the film is stained, the effect is necessarily a confused one.
Besides any influence that may be exerted on the particles of silver
haloid, these particles are virtually behind a colour-screen, which
must materially modify the nature of the light that reaches then,
and the final effect must necessarily be a combination from two
distinct causes.     Moreover, the colour in the film tends to arrest
precisely those rays to which it is proposed to render the silver-salt
more sensitive; a consideration of the utmost importance, for the
one action tends to counteract the other, and thus leads to inex
tricable confusion. From a system of experiments so faulty no
just conclusions could be drawn.
     Whether, with these sources of error eliminated, Draper's view,
 that a sensitive substance is influenced by those rays which it ab
 sorbs, can be applied to these new combinations which I have here
 described, is a matter on which I am not prepared to express an
 opinion, having been, much to my regret, unable as yet to examine
 the question. It seems a priori probable; but in that case it is impor
 tant to observe that the effect will depend, firstly, upon the capacity
 of the dye to combine with the silver haloid, and, secondly, not on the
proper colour of the dye isolated, but on the colour that the silver
 haloid acquires under its action, which, as we have already seen,
 may be something quite different from the colour of theoriginal dye.
      I have observed that the silver-salts are greatly changed by con
 version into lakes, even when the colour imparted is but faint.
 They become in some cases much more finely divided and remain
 long in suspension. In one case at least a great increase of sensi
  tiveness to light for development was observed. Later I shall
  hope to give more definite details on these points.
       In the above facts will doubtless be found an explanation of
 many of the anomalies in the behaviour of coloured films which
  have caused such wide differences of opinion. And the new modes
 of operating deducible from the reactions here described will, I
  think, be found of extended utility. Silver-salts can be dyed first
  and emulsified afterwards; and the ability to colour the sensitive
  salt to any shade with certainty, and without introducing a counter
  acting influence into the film, gives a new power in photochemistry.

           ON A SELENIUM-ACTINOMETER.          By M. H. MoRIZE,
                             OF RIO JANEIRO.
   . . The object of this instrument is to measure the relative inten
  sities of solar luminous rays at different heights on the horizon.

 232          Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
    The selenium-actinometer consists of a cylinder of selenium pre
 pared on Mr. Graham Bell's plan. Thirty-eight disks of copper
 are isolated from each other by disks of mica of smaller radius;
the groove thus formed is filled with selenium by being rubbed with
 a rod of this substance. The cylinder being suitably heated, this
 selenium acquires a greyish aspect, and is ready for use. The even
 numbers of copper are united by conductors, and the odd numbers
 also by another set of conductors. By this arrangement not
 merely is the resistance of the selenium lessened, but we may still
increase the delicacy of the apparatus by increasing the number of
disks and that of the layers of selenium, while diminishing the
resistance of the latter.
   The selenium cylinder is insulated by glass supports in the in
terior of a glass cylinder, which is exhausted so as to protect it from
the disturbing influence of obscure heat.
   The whole is   ".    on a support high enough to avoid the effects
of light reflected from adjacent objects. In placing the cylinder
care is taken to do it so that its axis is parallel to the terrestrial
axis. In this way the sun's rays strike the selenium almost per
pendicularly at any hour of the day and always illuminate the same
portion. By a slight motion in the plane of the meridian the
cylinder could each day be brought into such a position that the
rays are quite perpendicular.
   If, now, we pass a constant current through this apparatus and
through a galvanometer, the copper will show by its various deflec
tions all the changes in the illumination of the selenium.
   In order to compare these variations we must first adopt a scale:
if we suppose the selenium in complete darkness, its resistance will
be a maximum, and the deflection of the galvanometer the least.
The greatest effect would be to annul the resistance of the selenium;
by withdrawing the latter from the circuit we should obtain a
greater deflection, which we call 100 or the maximum light. Divi
ding the interval thus obtained into 100 equal parts, we shall have
actinometrical degrees which are always comparable.
   In practice the battery to be used would be that of Clamond.
During the determination cf the 100 point and of zero the external
part of the pole would be kept at zero. By repeating the operation
at different external temperatures, we should obtain a table for
reducing the actinometrical degree obtained at a given temperature
to what it should be if the external part of the pile were at zero.—

ON   THE   SYNTHESIS OF TRIMETHYLAMINE AND               PYRIROL FROM
   COAL-GAs ; AND ON THE OCCLUSION OF HYDROGEN BY ZINC
   DUST. BY GREVILLE WILLIAMS, F.R.S.
   In a paper on “The Action of some Heated Substances on the
Organic Sulphides in Coal-Gas,” “I mention that on passing coal
       * See “Journal of Gas Lighting, vol. xli. pp. 913, 960.

gas that had not been purified by lime over palladized pumice at a
temperature considerably below a red heat, ammonia and distinct
traces of a volatile alkaloid were formed. The palladium was
charged with hydrogen by passing the coal-gas over it at about
212°Fahr. At this temperature palladized pumice absorbs hydro
gen from the coal-gas; and at a higher temperature gives it off
in such a condition as to react upon the vapour of cyanides and
produce ammonia and a volatile alkaloid. When the palladium
ceased to act—that is to say, when ammonia and the alkaloid no
longer continued to be formed—the tube containing the palladized
pumice was transferred to a trough of boiling water, and the
current of gas was kept up until the metal had become active—
that is, charged with hydrogen. The water-bath was then removed,
and the tube was heated by a very small gas-flame, when the
formation of ammonia and the alkaloid again commenced. The
quantity of the latter formed from 250 grains of palladized pumice
containing 20 per cent. of palladium was, however, so small that
I could not procure enough for analysis.
    Having found that zinc dust heated to a low temperature in a
current of coal-gas rendered hydrogen active in a similar way to .
palladium, I determined to ascertain if, by using a much larger
quantity than I had of palladized pumice, the synthesis could be
effected on a sufficient scale to enable me to analyze the products.
For this purpose I used the following simple apparatus —A
 globular flask was fitted with a cork carrying two tubes, one of
 which passed to within 3 inch of the bottom ; and, at its lower
 extremity, was protected by a cage of fine copper gauze, to prevent
 it from being stopped up by the zinc dust. The flask was then
 filled with the latter to the commencement of the neck. The gas
 passed through the zinc dust with the greatest ease.
    Experiment 1–The flask arranged in the manner described was
 heated with a small rose-burner; and, when the temperature
arrived at about 400° Fahr., sulphuretted hydrogen was evolved,
accompanied by the same peculiar odour that was observed when
 using palladized pumice. When a rod moistened with hydro
 chloric acid was brought near the exit, it fumed strongly. The
 odour was like that of fish. On holding a piece of fir-wood
 moistened with hydrochloric acid in the vapour, the red reaction
 characteristic of pyrrol was distinctly obtained. The vapour was
 now passed into dilute hydrochloric acid during the night, and in
 the morning a scarlet ring was formed on the sides of the beaker
 about $ inch above the solution. This was probably pyrrol red,
produced, in the well-known manner, by decomposition of the
 pyrrol by the acid.
    Experiment 2.—After the preliminary experiment just described,
 19 feet of the gas were passed as before; but the products were
 conveyed into a Geissler's potash-tube containing hydrochloric acid
 diluted with twice its volume of distilled water. The product was
 evaporated to dryness; the chloride of ammonium and tarry mat
ters removed; and the hydrochlorate of the base, which was very

deliquescent, was converted into a platinum salt. It weighed 2-7
grains. The smallest trace of this platinum salt gave the fingers
an intensely fishy odour. From its great intensity I inferred that
the alkaloid was not methylamine, as when working with palladized
º:         I, at one time, thought it might be, remembering Dr.
    ebus's synthesis of that base by the action of platinum black on
prussic acid”. The platinum salt produced in this experiment was
not analyzed, but reserved for further purification.
     Experiment 3.—The current was kept up for twelve hours, during
which 21.51 feet of gas passed. At this point the flask cracked.
 On cooling it was broken up; and it was found that the zinc had
 partly melted. On treating it with dilute sulphuric acid, sulphu
 retted hydrogen was evolved. The platinum salt weighed 47
grains. It yielded on ignition 38.83 per cent. of platinum. The
corresponding salt of methylamine requires 41.61 per cent. ; that
 of dimethylamine requires 39:53; and that of trimethylamine 37-20.
 It is not unlikely, however, that traces of methylamine or dime
 thylamine, or both, were present. It should here be noticed that
 the errors tend in the direction of too much platinum, owing
 to the difficulty of removing the last traces of ammonium salt when
 working on such minute quantities. It was found that ammonia
 and traces of the alkaloid were formed in this experiment when
 the zinc dust was cold ; but this was not always the case. At
 202°Fahr., the fumes with hydrochloric acid were more obvious ;
 at 226° they were observed the instant the rod dipped in the acid
 was brought near the exit tube. At 242° the fumes were very
 briskly evolved; and no apparent increase was noticed up to 356°.
     Experiment 4.—The gas was passed for 17 hours, to hydrogenate
 the zinc ; and 7 hours with heat. The chloride of ammonium pro
 duced weighed 15 grains; the platinum salt amounted to 7-7 grains.
 On ignition it gave 38.40 per cent. of platinum, or nearly the
 same as in Experiment 3. The gas passed amounted to 100 feet.
     Experiment 5.—Here 101 feet of gas gave 2-03 grains of platinum
 salt, containing 37-04 per cent. of platinum. This only differs by
 0.16 per cent. from the number required by theory for trimethy
 lamine. The sal ammoniac formed amounted to 6-2 grains.
     Experiment 6.—The volume of the gas used was not taken.
  Two precipitates of platinum salt were obtained. The first was put
  aside to be worked up afterwards with some others to obtain greater
  purity. The second weighed 7-2 grains and afforded 38.47 percent.
  of platinum. The chloride of ammonium weighed 1.9 grain.
      Experiment 7.-This time 42 feet of gas were passed. Two crops
  of crystals of platinum salt were obtained, weighing together
   8.0 grains. The mixture yielded 38.05 per cent. of platinum ; and
   2.1 grains of chloride of ammonium were obtained.
      In some of the foregoing experiments the whole of the platinum
   salts were not used in the determinations of the metal.             The

portions left were therefore mixed, distilled with soda, and the distil
late received in hydrochloric acid. The solution was evaporated to
dryness, traces of chloride of ammonium were removed, and the
solution treated with a very small quantity of platinic chloride.
The solution was then allowed to repose until next day; and the
platinum salt formed was filtered off and rejected. The filtrate
was treated with more platinic chloride dissolved in alcohol. A
copious precipitate was obtained. On analysis it gave 14-16 per
cent. of carbon, 3.79 of hydrogen, and 37.81 of platinum. Trime
thylamine requires 13:57 per cent. of carbon, 3.77 of hydrogen, and
37°20 of platinum. The following is a summary of the above

    The mean percentage of platinum is 38:10, which is 0.90 per
 cent. too high for trimethylamine, and 1:43 per cent. too low for
 dimethylamine. As the errors of experiment tend to give too high
a number for the platinum, I conclude that the base formed was
 principally trimethylamine. It might also be propylamine, which
requires the same numbers, and be formed from cyanide of ethyl
as in Mendius's well-known process. Such a supposition, however,
does not account for the ammonia formed at the same time—
C.H.CN+2H,-C, H.N. But as the ammonia formed simul
taneously with the base is in such large excess, further experiments
 are necessary to explain all the phenomena. The base butylene
 diamine, obtained by Fairley from cyanide of ethylene, requires
 9:59 per cent. of carbon, 2.80 of hydrogen, and 39:45 per cent. of
 platinum *; and moreover would not have the characteristic smell
 of trimethylamine.
    If we assume that the base is formed from prussic acid, the
 equation becomes 3CHN + 6H,-C, H, + 2NH,                    The produc
 tion of sal ammoniac in the experiments was too irregular to enable
 this equation to be confirmed from its amount.
    According to Lange t a polymeride of prussic acid exists having
 the formula C.H.N. If formed from this substance, the equation is
 the same as that given above.
    It appeared to me that some light might be thrown upon the

question, if hydrogen instead of coal-gas were passed through
hydrocyanic acid and then into heated zinc dust; because, if in
that case I obtained a number for the platinum in the salt nearer
to methylamine, it would show that the formation of trimethy
lamine from coal-gas did not arise from a peculiarity in the action
of the zinc, but from the substance in the gas which gave the
alkaloid not being ordinary hydrocyanic acid.
    Experiment 8.—Hydrogen prepared from zinc and dilute sul
phuric acid was passed through a warm acidulated solution of
 cyanide of potassium for one day, after a previous passage during
the night to render the zinc active. The resulting alkaloid was
converted into platinum salt, and weighed 320 grains. It gave on
ignition 42:59 per cent. of platinum. The platinum salt of methy
lamine requires 41.68. Error +0-91. The chloride of ammonium
amounted to 24.1 grains. It is by no means easy to completely
separate so small a quantity of methylamine from so much
ammonia; and the excess of platinum is probably due to this cause.
The 24.1 grains of chloride of ammonium contained 7-6 grains of
ammonia; whereas the 320 grains of platinum salt of methylamine
only contained 0.41 grain of the alkaloid, or less than half a grain.
The equation CHN +2H,-CH.N does not involve the forma
tion of any ammonia. If we suppose the base to be formed from
 cyanogen, we have of course C, N,+5H,-2 CH, N, which also
dispenses with the formation of ammonia.
    The smallness of the quantity of alkaloid formed in the reaction
(only amounting to 7.2 grains in the six experiments in which it
 was estimated) would have prevented me from carrying out this
preliminary investigation, if I had not, fortunately, had much
previous experience in working on minute portions of these
substances. The substance or substances which yield ammonia
and pyrrol are not entirely removed by treating the gas with lime;
as I found in one experiment that, on passing well-purified gas over
heated zinc dust rendered active, turmeric paper was reddened and
pyrrol evolved.
   The source of the pyrrol I hope to clear up by future experi
ments; but I may mention that I found, in 1855, that it is formed
in numerous cases where nitrogenous animal and vegetable matters
are subjected to destructive distillation *.
   I must not omit to state that, having on one occasion treated
zinc dust with very dilute sulphuric acid, with a view to its puri
fication, the washed and dried product refused to act upon the gas
in the manner described in the foregoing experiments. I propose
to return to this question.—Journal of Gas Lighting, Jan. 6, 1885.

       XXIX. Contributions to the Theory of Magnetism.
                     By WERNER SIEMENs".
    INCE the efficient construction of electromagnetic ma
       chines has acquired great practical importance, the
question has arisen in very various forms, how to choose the
form and mass of the magnets so as to obtain the greatest
efficiency with the smallest expenditure of material ºft space.
The ingenious theories which have been proposed as the result
of the greatest skill and mathematical knowledge seldom give
the required indications for the solution of these problems.
The reason of this is, no doubt, that the production and distri
bution of magnetism in magnetic bodies, of which practically
only iron in its various molecular conditions is in question,
the action at a distance of the magnetism present, and the
consequent strength of the magnetic field, and, lastly, the
reciprocal action of the latter upon the strength of the mag
netism produced in the iron and its distribution, have, as a
rule, been separately considered and submitted to calculation.
Even if we obtain thus the fundamental data for the solution
of the numerous problems proposed, yet the practical man is
bewildered by a number of laws and empirical formulae, which
make it impossible for him to obtain a clear conception of the
causal connection of phenomena which may serve him as a
guide in his designs. This unsatisfactory condition may
result from the fact that all magnetic theories started from
permanent magnetism, in the same way as electric theories

 238                M. Werner Siemens on the
 have been based upon the first-known electrical phenomena.
 But permanent magnetism is only a secondary phenomenon.
 It is what remains of a previous more intense magnetization
 whose laws can only be deduced from those of        i.
 netism, since magnetism is undoubtedly to be conceived only
 as an electrical jº.              The electric current, or, more
 generally, electricity in motion, is the only known source of
 all magnetism. I have already expressed the opinion that
 this must also hold good of the earth's magnetism, and have
 assigned as a reason that, so far at least, no other cause is
imaginable than the rotation of the electricity accumulated at
rest upon the earth's surface with the earth about its axis.
The loadstone, and other bodies occurring in nature in a
magnetic condition, obviously derive their magnetism from
that of the earth, or in particular cases possibly from the direct
action of electric discharges.
    If, on the other hand, we start with the assumption of a
body directly or indirectly magnetizable by means of electric
currents, and which retains no magnetism so soon as the cause
of magnetism ceases to act, and assume with Faraday that,
moreover, the magnetic action, both in the magnetic body
itself as well as in the surrounding space, is propagated only
from molecule to molecule, or from space-element to space
element, then the further assumption lies close to our hand
that both actions—the internal and external—must be com
pletely dependent on each other. In an iron rod round which
an electric current circulates there can be, then, only so much
magnetism produced by the electric disturbance which acts
upon it as is associated in the space surrounding the iron rod
with the magnetic disturbance—advancing in the direction of
Faraday's lines of force from the north magnetic to the south
magnetic superficial elements of the rod—and thus arranged
in the form of a magnetic closed circuit.
    If this conception is shown by experiment to be allow
able, then the laws of the molecular communication of heat,
electricity, and electrostatic distribution must also hold good,
with the necessary modification for magnetism. We should
then be able to lay down a universal law for the intensity of
magnetism of the form “Sum of the magnetizing forces di
vided by the sum of the opposed resistances,” which would
avoid many difficulties and apparent contradictions. The
following further law must also hold good, that “In each
sectional plane which cuts all the lines of force the sum of the
magnetic moments of all the magnetic molecules cut through

neutral south and north magnetism, and then the sum of the
magnetic moments of the molecules of iron cut through must
be equal in magnitude to that of the molecules or space
elements cut through outside the iron.
   The order of the electrical phenomena would then be, that
an electrical difference of potential appearing between two
bodies situated in an insulating medium would produce upon
their surfaces an accumulation of electricities at rest of oppo
site polarity, the magnitude of which would depend upon the
resistance opposed by the surrounding insulating material to
the electric disturbance. This resistance depends upon the
geometrical conditions, and upon a special coefficient of dis
tribution belonging to the particular material. If the sur
rounding space is not insulating, but more or less a conductor
of electricity, then electric currents are produced the strength
of which is again dependent upon the sum of the resistances
opposed to the propagation of the electricity. The electric
current, or the .. in motion, has, again, the property
of attracting   iº                  currents, or the bodies con
veying them, and of repelling oppositely-directed currents.
If we assume, with Ampère, that the magnetic material is filled
with preexisting molecular currents, then the electric current
must tend to turn these elementary solenoids out of their
position of equilibrium, so that their axes fall upon the peri
phery of circles which concentrically surround the current
carrier. If any particular material (e. g. iron) contains a
larger number of such circular currents in the unit volume,
then the work of the current must be greater, since a greater
number of solenoids in which the current produces rotation is
contained in each cross-section of the concentric ring. But
since, moreover, the strengthening effect which the consecu
tive cross-sections must produce upon each other, on account
of the diminished distance apart of the elementary solenoids,
is now greater, therefore, for both reasons, the sum of the
moments of a concentric ring consisting of iron must be
greater than that of a space-ring of like dimensions, filled
with a less magnetic material. This may also be expressed
by saying that iron and the other so-called magnetic sub
stances oppose a less resistance to magnetic polarization than
the non-magnetic substances, or that their magnetic conduc
tivity is greater. Magnetic action at a distance cannot take
place with rings of homogeneous material which encircle a
conductor concentrically, since all the lines of force run within
the ring. The conditions are different in an iron ring which
is not complete. Since the resistance offered by iron to mag
netic disturbance is only about   gº2   of that of air, as appears

 240                 M. Werner Siemens on the
 from experiments to be described later on, the total magnetism
 in an interrupted ring must be less, corresponding to the great
 increase in resistance to the magnetic disturbance caused by
 the air-filled space of the gap ; and the disturbance-lines, or
 lines of force which bind together the parts of the ring, must
 occupy the whole surrounding space in very different inten
 sities, and produce in it the     iº           of magnetic attraction
 and distribution, or those of the so-called free magnetism.
     Hence the Amperian theory must be extended by supposing
 that not only magnetic substances, but all bodies, as well
 as empty space are filled with circular currents of véry small
 dimensions, and that magnetic substances differ only from
 nonmagnetic substances inasmuch as the number of circular
 currents present in the unit volume is much greater in the
 first case than in the second.
    All magnetic phenomena may then be referred to the pro
 perty of the electric current of exerting a directive force upon
 the molecular solenoids which fill all space, but which are
 present in greater numbers in the º magnetic bodies,
 which place their axes at right angles to its direction and
 tend to bring them into closed concentric attraction-circles.
 The magnitude of this rotation of the axes depends, on the
 one hand, on the magnitude of the directive or magnetizing
force, and, on the other hand, on the number of the molecular
 circuits preexisting in the unit-volume, for which condition
the term “magnetic conductivity” may be employed, or that
of “magnetic resistance” for its reciprocal value.
    To test the admissibility of this view, the case of an iron
ring, or closed ring of iron tube, uniformly wound with insu
lated wire, which case has been repeatedly examined experi
mentally and theoretically, seemed to me especially suitable,
since, according to G. Kirchhoff's investigations, such a ring
produces no magnetic effect at a distance.
    For the magnetism of an iron tube having a thickness of
wall, s, traversed by an axial current, I have previously"
obtained the value
                               M-4Tlsi
from Ampère's formula—where s is the thickness of metal,
l the length of the tube, and i the strength of the current—and
have shown its correctness by means . experiments.
    If we surround an iron ring of sectional area q and mean
radius p with a closely wound spiral, then, in accordance with
the above considerations, the magnetizing force is proportional

 to the current-strength i multiplied by the number of windings,
 for which we may put the length of the ring 2pm nearly.
     The resistance which opposes itself to this magnetizing
 force is directly proportional to the length of the bent iron
 rod (that is, again, 27p), and inversely proportional to the
  cross-section and to the magnetic conductivity of the iron,
 which may be denoted by J. Consequently the magnetic
 moment of the iron ring in each of its cross-sections is

    To investigate the crucial question whether the magnetism
 which is produced by a magnetizing force in an iron bar or in
 an open horseshoe is also inversely proportional to the total
 resistance of the magnetic circuit, I had a horseshoe made out
 of iron bar 20 millim. thick, and bent at right angles. The
legs of the horseshoe were 70 millim. long, and . WaS Sult
rounded by a spiral 35 millim. long, consisting of from 126 to
 130 windings of insulated wire 1 millim, thick. The straight
back of the horseshoe was provided with an induction-coil of
 1160 turns of wire, 0.2 millim. thick. A prismatic piece of
iron, of the same cross-section as the horseshoe, could be used
to make it into a closed metallic circuit. The legs of the
magnet projected 20 millim. beyond the coils.
    The experiments were made by momentarily reversing the
direction of the current through the magnetizing coils by
means of a suitable commutator.            The strength of the
current before each reversal was measured by        aºri.
the difference in potential between the terminal screws of
the magnetizing spiral by means of a torsion-galvanometer
with many coils of thin wire. By interposition of resist
ances or by using shunts the desired current-strength was
easily obtained. The current which the reversal produced
in the induction-coil was led through the coils of a nearly
aperiodic reflecting-galvanometer. The deflection then mea
sured the double magnetic moment produced in the magnet
by the acting current. By taking the precaution to reverse
the current several times after each change of current-strength
before making the measurement, concordant results were ob
tained even with the greatest differences of current-strength.

    The foregoing Table gives in the first column the observed
 current-strength, in the first column of each succeeding series
 the corresponding deflection, and in the second the increase
 of magnetie moment calculated from it for an increase in
 current-strength of 0.01 ampere, both in the open condition
 and when closed.             The result is, that in the closed horseshoe
 the magnetism at first increases in more rapid ratio than the
 current-strength. With the open magnet for feeble currents
 (0.05 ampere) the magnetism is about one fifth of the mag
 netism produced by the like magnetizing force in the closed
 magnet; for the double current-strength (0-1 ampere) about
 one eighth. The increase of magnetism, on the other hand,
 is nearly constant with the open magnet, i. e. the magnetism
 was nearly proportional to the current-strength up to the limit
 which the wire-coils permitted without too great heating.
     Next I cut 20 millim. off the projecting poles of the electro
 magnet and repeated the experiments. As is seen in the
 third and fourth columns of the above Table, the magnetism
  of the closed magnet was much increased by this shortening
  of the poles; whilst the magnetism of the open magnet de
  creased in a still greater ratio, so that now for a current of
  0-05 ampere the above, ratio has decreased to ºr and for 0.1
  ampere to 33. This disproportionately large decrease is evi
  dently to be ascribed to the circumstance that not only has

                          Theory of Magnetism.                     243
the resistance to the magnetic disturbance of the surrounding
space been increased by the shortening of the magnet, but the
º                force has also been decreased, since the coils of
wire exerted some magnetic force upon the portions cut off.
I endeavoured to determine the length for which the mag
netism of the open magnet would, with a constant current,
become doubled, by lengthening the poles with pieces of iron
of the same diameter and 10 millim. in height. This con
dition, according to the following Table, was exceeded when
five pieces had been added to the poles, corresponding to an
increase in length of the original magnet by something more
than half.

    We see from the increase in magnetism for each lengthening
 of the magnet by 10 millim. that there is a considerable falling
 off in this increase with the number of pieces added. This is,
 partly at any rate, a consequence of the stronger direct action
 of the coils upon those of the added pieces which were nearer
 to the coils, which also explains the too rapid doubling of the
 magnetism with increased length. Nevertheless these expe
 riments render it in the highest degree probable that the
 magnetism produced by a magnetizing force in an open mag
 net is a function of its surface.           This was further confirmed
 by the observation that the magnetism was increased just as
 much by placing on the magnet-legs pieces of thin-walled
 iron tube as by using solid cylinders of equal diameter.
 Closing the tubes by means of iron covers made no perceptible

    # determine the resistance opposed to the production of
 magnetism by the nonmagnetic surrounding space, it was
 necessary to compare the resistance offered to magnetic dis
 turbance by a space filled with air, or empty, with that of
 iron.     This ratio cannot be constant, since the specific

     244                      M. Werner Siemens on the
     magnetic resistance of iron varies with the strength of its
     magnetization.
        As is known, and as we may also see from the above expe
     riments, the magnetism in a closed electromagnet increases
     at first more rapidly than the current-strength. The increase
     of magnetism then soon attains a maximum, and with further
     increase of current-strength sinks slowly down to a very
     small amount. In this behaviour of magnetic substances the
     initial increasing action of the magnetizing force to a maximum
     is very striking. The position of this maximum is dependent
     upon the properties of the iron. With soft iron the maximum
     is sooner attained with equal magnetizing force than with
     harder iron. It is therefore not improbable that this initial
     feebler action of the magnetizing force is always only a con
     sequence of the imperfect softness of the iron. In order to
     examine this more closely I had two similar rings made, the
     one of the softest iron rod possible, the other of soft steel.
     The external diameter was 50 millim. and the internal dia
     meter 35 millim. ; and they were similarly wound each with
     two coils, the lower one of 350 turns of wire 0.2 millim. thick,
     the upper one of 190 turns of wire 0.75 millim. thick. The
     second coil served for the             magnetizing         current, the first as
     induction-coil. The first column of Table III. gives the
     current-strengths as measured ; the second the corresponding
     magnetic moments of the iron ring as measured by the de
     flection of the reflecting-galvanometer; the third the increase
     in magnetism for an increase in current-strength of 0.001
     ampere calculated from these numbers; the fourth and fifth
    columns give the same values for the steel ring.

    It results from these experiments that the maximum increase
of magnetism in the case of the iron ring was attained for a
current of 0-1 ampere, whilst with the ring of soft steel the
maximum was not reached until the current rose to 0:5
ampere; and, further, that this latter maximum amounted to
only one half of the maximum increase in the case of the iron
ring. Since the direction of the current is reversed in each
measurement, the residual magnetism could exert no direct
influence upon the results of the measurement; but the in
ternal friction, which opposed itself to the rotation of the
hypothetical circular currents, must no doubt produce a de
crease in magnetization which would be smaller in the ring of
soft steel than the iron ring. It hence appears very probable
that, with absolutely soft iron, the maximum action would be
attained even with the feeblest currents. We may therefore
 regard this anomaly which appears in the magnetization of
iron as a consequence of the frictional resistance, which hin
 ders the rotation of the Amperian circular currents. This
 resistance will be so much the more perceptible the smaller the
 angles of rotation; since the work done by friction must be
 proportional to the angle of rotation itself, and not to the
 magnetic moment produced by the rotation.
    The following Table gives the results obtained when, instead
 of a closed ring, a straight iron bar of equal length and thickness
 was subjected to magnetization by means of a current of in
 creasing strength. The iron bar was provided in the middle
 with an induction-coil, and, together with this, was pushed
 into the middle of a magnetizing-coil of nearly double length.
 In the deflections of the mirror-galvanometer the direct action
 of the coils upon each other is allowed for.

    The increases in magnetism, calculated for 0-001 ampere,
show here also a small increase with increase of current
strength. The maximum increase could not be attained with
out unduly heating the coil.
     If the assumption is correct, that nonmagnetic material, in
the same manner as magnetic material, is filled with pre
existing molecular circular currents, it is to be assumed that
in it, as in magnetic material, there exists a maximum of
magnetism. An approach to a maximum of magnetization
must then become perceptible with very great magnetic
moments of a magnetic field, as in iron.
    In order to investigate this, I placed two prismatic pieces
of iron on the poles of the horseshoe-magnet described, which
could be made to approach each other closely. The parallel
surfaces opposed were reduced to one square centimetre. The
increase in magnetic moment of the magnetic circuit was
measured for increasing current-strength. The results are
given in the following Table –

    The pole-pieces were placed at distances of 0:1, 1, and 3.5
millim. apart. The current-strength was increased to the
highest possible value, i.e. 6 amperes. . As seen from column
1, with a closed magnet the maximum increase occurred with
a current of only 0.2 ampere. It is remarkable that with
approximated pole-pieces the turning-point for each distance

                        Theory of Magnetism.                  247
apart fell nearly at the same current-strength of about 1 am
pere. The increases themselves cannot be in proportion to
the distances apart of the parallel faces, since the side faces
of the pole-pieces must take so much the more part in the
 ºf.         action the further the parallel faces were separated,
and consequently so much the greater must be the magnetic
resistance of the interval.     That a maximum increase takes
 place with all distances apart, and that with increasing current
 strength this uniformly decreases to a small amount, is a
 consequence of the large moment of the electromagnet itself,
 which, in consequence of the small magnetic resistance of the
 entire circuit, with strong currents approaches its maximum
 of magnetization. The experiments certainly seem to indicate
 an increase in the resistance and magnetic disturbance of the
 nonmagnetic material for very high magnetic moments, but
 not decisively. For such experiments we must employ electro
 magnets of small length and so large section that the resistance
 of the iron to magnetic disturbance may remain very small in
 comparison with that of the surrounding medium.
     #. experiments show, however, that a maximum of mag
  netization does not occur sooner with atmospheric air than
 with iron, . It follows from this that the strength of a mag
  netic field is limited only by the maximum of magnetism in
  the iron, and that the magnetic conductivity of nonmagnetic
  material may be taken as constant. Since this value for iron
  is very variable and the law is not yet known of its dependence
  upon the magnetic moment of the mass of iron, there is
  no possibility of comparing the magnetic conductivity of the
  two in general. Since, however, in the construction of mag
  netic machines it is always precisely that magnetic condition
  of the iron for which the increase of magnetism with increas
  ing current-strength is a maximum which is of the most im
  portance, we must make this point the starting-point of the
  ".  o investigate this point I had two square iron plates made,
  4 millim. thick and 80 millim. square, which could be screwed
  on sideways to the prismatic movable pole-pieces of the pre
  viously described horseshoe-magnets. At a distance of 5
  millim. from each other, with a current-strength of 0-1 ampere
  the plates gave the same increase of magnetism as a piece of
  sheet-iron of 1 square millim. section which, after screwing
  ºff the plates, was made to connect the pole-pieces through a
  distance of 5 millim.
     With feeble magnetizing-forces the iron was the more
  Powerful, with stronger currents the plates. This shows a
   magnetic conductivity for iron in its condition of greatest

248               M. Werner Siemens on the
magnetic susceptibility of 480 to 500, when that of air is taken
equal to 1. The experiment was repeated with greater dis
tances apart of the plates, and further with iron wire, sheet
iron, and prismatic rods of iron, and the same ratio was
obtained.
   The question next presented itself whether this resistance of
the air, amounting to some 500 times the resistance of iron, was
not in part to be ascribed to the magnetic oxygen contained
in the air. In order to investigate this, I connected two round
iron plates of 8 millim. diameter by means of a ring of brass
soldered to them. By means of tubes closed by taps fitting
into two openings in the brass ring, it was possible to fill the
space between the metal plates, which were 5 millim. apart,
with any desired gas or to exhaust the chamber. The iron
plates thus connected were fastened to the pole-pieces of the
electromagnet, and the magnetic moment of the magnetic
circuit measured for different current-strengths. Not the
smallest difference could be observed whether the space between
the plates was filled with air, oxygen, or hydrogen, or whether
it was exhausted as completely as possible by means of the
mercury-pump.
   It follows therefore that the magnetic properties of oxygen,
and in general the influence of matter, with the exception of
iron and the other so-called magnetic metals, upon the magne
tization only become of influence with very great magnetic
moments, such as those with which diamagnetic phenomena
occur, and that for nonmagnetic substances, only the geo
metrical conditions of space need to be taken into account in
magnetic phenomena. Whether this will not lead us, in ac
cordance with the views of Secchi and Edlund, to replace the
Amperian molecular circuits by ether-vortices which fill all
space, but are present in magnetic substances only in greater
number or of greater intensity, may remain here undiscussed.
The striking fact that a vacuum permits magnetic distribution
and attraction like nonmagnetic matter would, however, be
º          by it.
      at space filled with nonmagnetic material as well as a
vacuum is affected by electric currents quantitatively exactly
in the same way as iron in its condition of greatest magnetic
susceptibility, but some 500 times less energetically, is seen
from the following experiment. I had two coils made of
insulated wire 1 millim. thick, of 87 millim. diameter, and 100
millim. length, and placed them with axes parallel and at a
distance apart of 131 millim. The pole-surfaces of these
solenoids opposite each other were each covered by an iron
plate, which was wound between the solenoids, with an

                             Theory of Magnetism.                              249
induction-coil. The iron plates were held fast together by
thin brass bolts which traversed the axes of the solenoids. The
two solenoids and the two iron plates formed together a closed
horseshoe-magnet, whose magnetic moment was to be mea
sured by means of the induction-coil on the iron plates. In
the following Table VI. these measures are brought together.
It will be seen from the table that all the phenomena were
exactly the same as if the iron plates had been connected by
iron cylinders instead of brass bolts. On actually making the
experiment with iron cylinders of 4 millim. thickness (which
had therefore ºn of the section of the solenoid"), the magnetic
moment was, in fact, nearly twice as great as before with a
current-strength 0:2 ampere, as shown in the sixth column of
the table, which gives the quotients of the deflections with
and without iron cylinders. That with feeble currents the
quotients are not greatly different from unity, but then rise
rapidly to the double value, and then slowly decrease, is due
to the property possessed by the keepers of this air-magnet,
and the iron cylinder of opposing a great resistance to mag
netization, both with very feeble magnetic moments and
with very powerful ones.

length, is, anywhere sufficiently far from the ends, encircled by
a coil of wire, and if we denote by y the magnetic moment
which a current flowing through this coil gives to the unit
section at any desired distance a from the centre of the coil, then
the magnetic moment of this section is rºtry. This magnetic
moment must become smaller as w increases, and, if our theory

   These equations show, first, that for the same iron cylinder
the ratio of the magnetic moments of two sections equall
distant from each other is constant upon the whole half
cylinder ; that therefore also equal displacements of a test coil
must always result in equal percentage decrease in magnetic
moment. They show, further, that with rods of different thick
ness, and for equal displacement of the test-coil, the logarithms
of the ratio of moments vary inversely as the diameter of the
rods. In writing the differential equation, however, the as
sumption is made that the moment of the layer of air in con
tact with the surface of the rod depends only on the moment
of the unit section of the rod at the point in question. This
would mean that the resistance to magnetic disturbance of all
external magnetic circuits was the same. But in fact the
disturbing action takes place between each element of the
surface of one half of the rod and all the oppositely magnetic
  oints of the other half. It is therefore also dependent on the
#º. from the centre of the rod.           This source of error will

   The above experiments confirm the assumption that there is
 no such thing as free magnetism, but only bound magnetism,
 and that a magnetic force can produce in magnetic bodies
only so much magnetism as is bound in them and in the sur
rounding medium by magnetic distribution in the form of
closed attraction-curves with equal magnetic moment in each
section. This mode of regarding the matter is exactly analo
gous to the theory of electric molecular distribution; and hence
the laws which hold good for this may be applied to magnetic
 distribution; and, by the aid of the coefficient 480, which ex
presses the ratio of the resistance of air to that of iron, the
influence of the mass and form of iron to be employed in the
 construction of a magnetic field may be determined.
    If an iron bar, upon the middle of which a magnetizing
 force acts, may not be regarded as endless, the formula calcu

 s not directly applicable on account of the magnetism of the
end-surfaces.
   The distribution of magnetism in a bar of definite length is
quite different if the magnetizing force acts equally on all parts
of the bar. The decrease in magnetic moment from the
middle of the bar towards the ends loses then its logarithmic
character, and assumes the form of a catenary (as already
shown by Rees), or nearly that of a parabola. In a rod 150
millim. long and 7.70 millim. diameter, which was enclosed
in a glass tube of double length uniformly wrapped with a
 magnetizing-coil, the magnetic moment of each section could
 be i. by means of an induction-coil wound over the
 middle of the tube, when the direction of the magnetizing
 current was reversed.

14. The ratio of the magnetic moments of points of the rod
equidistant from each other is therefore not constant, as in the
case of the endless rod, but increases as we approach the end
of the rod, as indeed was to be expected.
   Van Rees found that in a homogeneous prismatic magnet
the magnetic moments of the sections decrease parabolically,
as with the uniformly magnetized iron bar. This, however,
holds good only for those magnetic bars to which, in the
process of magnetization, a uniform moment has been com
municated through the entire length. As soon as the magne
tizing force has ceased to act, all the molecular magnets have
the same tendency to return again to the unmagnetized con
dition, whence at last the same condition of magnetic equili
brium results, as with the uniformly magnetized iron bar.
   Lastly, I should like to make a few further remarks on a
previous communication of mine ".
   I proposed the theory at that time, that the molecular mag
nets assumed in the Ampère-Weber theory must consist each
of two elementary magnets or solenoids close together with
opposed poles, capable of free rotation together in any direc
tion without meeting with resistance, but directed by external
magnetizing forces, and separately rotated, as would be the case
with astatic pairs of needles capable of free and independent
rotation. I did not then know that Stephan had already ex
pressed the same view, and accompanied it by important
mathematical considerations. Now, in accordance with the
theory explained above, the Amperian theory must be extended,
as already mentioned, by supposing all space to be filled with
paired molecular solenoids, or, if we adopt Edlund's view
that the electric current consists in aether in forward motion,
filled with aether vortices, and that these are present in magnetic
material in greater numbers than in nonmagnetic material.
Since, now, a magnetizing force acting upon the mole
cular magnets only exerts a perceptible influence on the rota
tion apart from each other of the paired elementary magnets
when all the neighbours in the magnetic circuit follow the
motion, and so are able to produce a closed system of equilibrium
capable of mutual attraction, it follows that the rotation di
rectly produced    }.  the magnetizing force must be very small
in comparison with the mutual strengthening of the rotation
in the closed magnetic circuit. The magnetic moment pro
duced must thus be essentially the product of the mutual
strengthening of rotation of which the magnetizing force is
the cause. fi. the difficulty is presented that the rotation

ceases again, in the absence of coercitive force, as soon as the
magnetizing force ceases to act. Such a condition of equili
brium cannot be imagined as produced otherwise than by the
simultaneous action of attractive and repulsive forces. There
must then be produced a nearly, but not quite, unstable equi
librium of the elementary magnets by the mutual action of all
the neighbouring attractive and repulsive molecular forces, if
the assumptions of Ampère's theory are to correspond to facts.
That a combination of molecular forces fulfilling this necessary
requirement can be shown to be possible I do not venture to
assert.

 7.  THE result of the survey in                         regard to our special sub
           ject of discussion may be summed up thus:–(1) that
 there is certainly an E.M.F. at the junction of two different
 substances, or even of the same substance in two different
 states; and (2) that the total E.M.F. of a circuit is the alge
 braic sum of all such contact-forces at every junction in the
 circuit. I do not know that these two propositions could be
 passed mem. con., but I believe that, provided they are properly
 understood, the dissenting minority would be a very small
 one.    It is probable that Professor Exner would be in the
 minority, but I am unable to be sure of any one else.
    We can also make a negative proposition which will com
 mand almost universal assent—viz. that if in the above second
 proposition, instead of the sum of the contact-forces at                                              every
 junction, we attend only to the contact-forces at the metallie
 junctions, the proposition will no longer be true. This fact,
  that the metallic junctions are insufficient to account for all
  the E.M.F., was established by Becquerel, De la Rive, and
    • Scarcely any of this portion was read at Montreal, but it was given
 in substance to the Society of Telegraph Engineers on March 20th.

             Electromotive Forces in the Voltaic Cell.               255
others, and still more thoroughly and exhaustively by Fara
day. It is the easiest possible thing to make a number of
batteries which shall give a current without any metallic
junction whatever. Faraday gives some thirty of them".
   One more certain proposition we can lay down—viz. that
whenever a current is produced, the energy of the current
must be maintained by absorption of heat, or by chemical
action, or by gravity, or by some other such agent, not by
mere contact.
   So much being agreed to, what remains as subject-matter
for controversy 2 This : A voltaic circuit contains at least
three junctions; what is the value of the contact force at each
of them P and especially to which junction is the major part of
the observed E.M.F. due?           Is it the zinc-acid 2 or is it the
copper-acid 2 or is it the zinc-copper ? There is no other
question. The old chemical and contact controversy has died
out, but another controversy remains. Most physicists pro
bably would say today that the major part of the E.M.F. of
the cell resides at the zinc-copper junction. This was Volta's
view, and this is the view of the text-book writers taught
by Sir William Thomson. Some few would say at the
zinc-acid junction, and among them I must confess myself.
   It is no question between contact and something else; it
is a question between a feeble energy-less metal-metal con
tact, and an active energetic metal-fluid contact with poten
tialities of chemical action straining across the junction.
What is there to distinguish between the two? Electrostatic
experiments with air-condensers prove nothing. They add
up three E.M.F.s, air/M+M/M/+M'/air, and give you the
sum. The experimenters usually assume that M/M/ is what
they are measuring, but there is no proof to be given in sup
port of the assumption, except that if you substitute water for
air the effect remains almost unaltered ; but then water con
tains oxygen as the active element the same as air does.
Well, then, it may be urged, the effect is the same in vacuo
and in hydrogen as in air ; and to this I answer, Not proven.
    Can any further assertions be made with reference to elec
troscopic experiments as bearing on voltaic theory                 Yes, it
can be asserted that by adding up the Volta effects for A/B,
   * Exp. Res. ii. 2020. Dr. J. A. Fleming describes another of these
batteries in Phil. Mag. June 1874, and gives some very cogent and read
able arguments in favour of the “chemical theory" of battery E.M.F., sug
gesting that the difference of potential between the terminals of a º
on open circuit is due to potential chemical combination of the meta
and electrolytes. He does not, however, explain the old Volta experi
ment; and, as Prof. Chrystal has pointed out (Encyc, Brit, “Electricity,”
p. 99), upholders of the chemical  *g  2
                                          are bound to explain this.

E.M.F. of the circuit A, B, C . . . . A. True, but what then?
   The Wolta effect you call A/B is really

that you call B/C is
                         air/B+B/C+C/air;
and that you call Z/A is
                         air/Z + Z/A--A/air.
Add them up, and you get
                        A/B+B/C+. . . --Z/A,
which must be the E.M.F. of a circuit by common sense—i.e.
without violent experimental disproof, which no one has ever
attempted to give. This fact, that the sum of the Volta effects
equals the sum of the true forces, in a closed circuit of any
conducting materials, has nevertheless caused persons to sup
pose that air/metal forces are negligibly small. But it is
clear that they may have any value they like without affect
ing the truth of the law. They could only affect it if air/M
were not equal to —M/air. The experimental proof of the
 summation law, therefore, establishes that air/M is equal to
 —M/air, as well as the important fact that the contact-force
at each junction is independent of all other junctions of what
kind soever.
   8. Leaving electrostatic determinations as without bearing
on the point at issue, let us ask, Is there no direct and straight
forward way of measuring the actual E.M.F. at a particular
junction without disturbance from other junctions 2 The
answer is most clearly given by Clerk Maxwell", thus:—
   “Sir W. Thomson has shown that if II is the coefficient of
 Peltier effect or the heat absorbed at the junction by unit
 current in unit time, then JII is the E.M.F. at that junction
acting with the current. This is of great importance, as it
is the only method of measuring a local E.M.F.; the ordinary
 method of connecting up by wires to an electrometer being
useless. This Peltier measurement is quite independent of
the effect of contact-forces in other parts of the circuit. But
the E.M.F. so measured does not account for Volta's force,
which is far greater and often opposite. Hence the assump
tion that the potential of a metal is to be measured by that of
the air in contact with it must be erroneous, and the greater
part of Volta's E.M.F. must be sought for, not at the junc
tion of the two metals, but at one or both of the surfaces

because so easy of reference.

               Electromotive Forces in the Voltavc Cell.            257
which separate the metals from the air or other medium which
forms the third element in the circuit.”
     And in another place he says":—
     “In a voltaic circuit the sum of the E.M.F.'s from zinc to
electrolyte, from electrolyte to copper, and from copper to
zinc, is not zero, but is what is called the E.M.F. of the cir
cuit—a measurable quantity. Of these three E.M.F.'s only
one can be measured by a legitimate process, that namely
 from copper to zinc. If we cause an electric current to pass
from copper to zinc, the heat generated in the conductor per
unit of electricity is a measure of the work done by the cur
rent, for no chemical or other change is effected. Part of this
heat arises from the work done in overcoming ordinary re
 sistance within the copper and the zinc. This part may be
diminished indefinitely by letting the electricity pass very
slowly. The remainder of the heat arises from the work done
in overcoming the E.M.F. from the zinc to the copper, and
the amount of this heat per unit of electricity is a measure of
 the E.M.F. Now it is found by thermoelectric experiments
 that this E.M.F. is exceedingly small at ordinary temperature,
 being less than a microvolt, and that it is from zinc to copperf.
 Hence the statement, deduced from experiments in which
 air is the third medium, that the E.M.F. from copper to zinc
 is 75 volt, cannot be correct. In fact, what is really mea
 sured is the difference between the potential in air near the
 surface of copper, and the potential in air near the surface of
 zinc, the zinc and copper being in contact. The number 75 is
 therefore the E.M.F., in volts, of the circuit copper, zinc, air,
 copper, and is the sum of three E.M.F.'s, only one of which
 has yet been measured.”
     With every word of Maxwell I cordially agree.
     9. While on the theoretical aspect of the subject, it may be
 well to see what Pellat, as one of the best experimenters on
 it, has to say. Pellat substantially observes as follows:–
     “Does the apparent difference of potential between two
 metals in contact indicate a real difference of potential be
 tween them 2 In all rigour, No 1 but the slight variation of
 its value when different gases or even liquids are used renders
 it extremely probable that there is such a real difference of
 potential,   ºf that it is very nearly what is measured in elec
 troscopic experiments.”
     As to difficulties connected with energy considerations

Electricity, p. 149.
    t Further on (sect. 23) I point out that this statement is not quite
true, but it does not affect the main argument.

258             Prof. Oliver Lodge on the Seat of the
and mere contact, he refers to Helmholtz” and Clausiust,
who, he says, relieve him of all responsibility on this head.
    The fact that the voltaic order of the metals is much the
same as their order of oxidizability must have struck nearly
everybody, and must also have been felt as a difficulty by the
upholders of the efficacy of mere contact.             Pellat considers
he disposes of it thus –“Since the E.M.F. of a pile is that
represented by chemical action, and since by experiment vol
taic contact-forces have much the same values as the E.M.F.
of piles, it follows that there is some vague relation between
A/B and the heats of combination, say of substitution of one
metal for another in a salt (as in a Daniell).”
    He sums up his experimental conclusions as follows:–
    (1) “Two different metals united metallically are covered,
in the state of equilibrium, with electric coats of unequal
potential.”
    (2) “This difference of potential only depends on the
superficial coat of metal. It changes notably when the sur
face is mechanically scratched, becoming always more positive.
As the scratching effect disappears with time, so does the
extra difference of potential. The state of polish of the sur
 face is immaterial, but traces of foreign substances, forming a
coat so thin as to be invisible, are able to modify the value
of the observed effect enormously.”
    (3) “The effect depends somewhat on temperature.”
    (4) “The pressure and nature of the gas surrounding the
metals have a very distinct but           ...tº;       feeble influence,
but, since the effect produced is a lagging one, it is probably
due to some secondary cause, and it is probable that the
difference of potential is really independent of the gaseous
dielectric.”
    (5) “The difference of potential between the electric coats
on two metals united metallically has the same value as the
E.M.F. of an element of a liquid pile formed by these two
   * Die, Erhaltung der Kraft, p. 47, where Helmholtz develops Volta's
original hypothesis about an attraction of matter for electricity, of an
amount depending on the kind of matter, so that it gets pulled one way
or another across a junction of two dissimilar substances. He points out
that the Volta effect is explained if zinc be    ted a stronger attraction
for electricity than copper has. This view he returns to in his Faraday
Lecture 1881, where also he refers to Berzelius's electrical theory of che
mical affinity. The opinions of Professor Helmholtz are too weighty to
be merely referred to in a footnote, but we may have occasion to consider
them later.

 metals, provided that the E.M.F. is determined before any
 alteration of the metallic surface wetted by the liquid has
 occurred ; but these alterations produce themselves very
 rapidly.”
    Ér, theoretical conclusions being short may also be
 here quoted, and I will number them on with the others.
    (6) “It is extremely probable that the difference of poten
 tial between the electric coats which cover two metals con
 nected metallically represents the true difference of potential
 which exists between them. No reason, either theoretical or
 experimental, can be invoked against the existence of a dif
 ference of potential between two metals in contact.”
    (7) “This last quantity has no connection with the thermo
 electric E.M.F. measured by the Peltier phenomenon.”
    (8) “It has only a vague and distant connection with the
 difference of oxidizability of the metals.”
    Concerning these propositions, I may remark that while
 number 2 is likely to annoy contact theorists (though I
 know they have methods of explaining it away), numbers 4
 and 5 are calculated to restore their equanimity. The five
 experimental conclusions I accept as in duty bound, only per
 mitting myself to doubt the perfect generality of numbers
 4 and 5 under all circumstances; but the three theoretical
 ones I am unable to wholly accept. Thus with respect to
 the second part of number 6, I beg entirely to differ from
 M. Pellat if I am called on to simultaneously admit number 7.
 Whether one is prepared to accept any of his theoretical con
 clusions or to reject them all, depends upon how one regards
 them. If in the way he himself intended, then I reject them all.
 If with one's own interpretation, then I say that the second part
 of 6 and 8 are true (though for “only a vague and distant ’’
 I would substitute “no ''); and 7 is also true if it be held to
 refer to the quantity first mentioned in number 6, while
 number 8 refers to the other quantity. Number 6 Ishould also
 consider true if the prefix “im ” be made to the fourth word.
    10. Pellat then proceeds to explain why he considers the
 Peltier effect to be quite distinct from, and have no relation
 to, the true E.M.F. of contact. In explaining this he makes
use of a piece of unpleasantly plausible reasoning, which I
 myself have heard Professor Ayrton use, and which, when
unexpectedly suggested, is so painfully benumbing that it is
worth while to quote it, and to indicate its weak point. Pel
lat’s statement of the argument is rather long; perhaps it can
with advantage be abbreviated.
    Two metals A and B put into contact are at different poten
tials, the difference A/B being due to and equal to the E.M.F.

260             Prof. Oliver Lodge on the Seat of the
of contact. There is, then, at the junction not only the con
tact-force E, but also the equal opposite force —dV, due to
the difference of potential established. Either of these forces
alone would resist or aid the passage of electricity across the
junction and so give rise to a Peltier effect, but both together
will do nothing of the sort; and so if there be any É.
effect, it must be some small residual phenomenon, or it must
be due to some other and totally distinct cause".
    Professor Ayrton's way of putting the argument, which I
think he said he got from Sir William Thomson, was some
thing like this.         hen Q units of electricity are transmitted
against a force E, work EQ is done; also when they are trans
mitted up a difference of potential W'—W, work Q(V'—W) is
done; but, in an open circuit containing an electromotive
junction, V-V' is produced by and is equal to E. Hence,
at an electromotive junction no work need be done by a cur
rent ; in other words, the existence or non-existence of a
Peltier effect has nothing to do with the existence or non
existence of a local E.M.F.
    The fallacy of the argument, in either form, lies in over
precise specification of locality; it gratuitously asserts as
true for the junction what is only proved to be true for the
whole circuit.       It assumes that there can be no work done at
a junction if it be perfectly easy to drive electricity either
way across it—i. e. if there be no work done on the whole.
    11. To exhibit the fallacy, consider a hydrostatic analogy.
Two vessels of water connected by a pipe in which is a motor
 of some kind, which, without leakage, exerts a specified force
 on the water and maintains a constant difference of potentials,
 but then remains stationary, doing no further work.                  We
 typify it feebly in the diagram by an impracticable close
 fitting water-wheel driven by a weight without friction.
    W–V' is the equivalent of the force exerted at the junction,
 and everything is in equilibrium. It is perfectly easy for
 water to flow from one vessel into the other under the influ
 ence of the slightest extra force, for W helps the water up the
 hill V-W',      . the flow is in that direction; and, when
 ever the flow is reversed, it lets the water gently down a ain,
 taking all its energy out of it.       If water is  º to flow from
 A to  #, say by pouring more into A, the weight W is lowered,
 or energy disappears       (heat absorbed) at the junction;       if it is
 made to flow from B to A the weight is raised, or energy
    * Thus it may be, suggests Pellat, due to a slight difference between
 E and – d.V produced by the mere fact of a current passing; i.e. contact
 E.M.F. with electricity at rest may be slightly different from what it is
 with electricity in motion.

(say heat) is generated at the junction. Thus there is a true
É. effect at the junction           despite the existence of V-V/
and its equality to the junction force, and yet no resistance is
offered to the flow of water either way. Thus is the first form
of the argument controverted.

Hydrostatic analogue of the true contact or Seebeck force, and of the real
   though small difference of potential which it maintains between two
   metals in contact. A and Brepresent the two metals, C their junction;
   W is a weight driving a water-tight wheel until stopped by the dif.
   ference of potential set up. The hydraulic raising or lowering of the
   weight represents the Peltier effect.
    To pump water from A to B by any other pipe would need
 work to be done equal to Q(V–V'), and to pump water
 against the force of W, acting alone, would also need work EQ:
 but when the water goes from A to B via W, or vice versa, no
 work is done on the whole.          Quite true: but the conclusion
 that no work is done at the junction by no means follows.
 Work must be done at the junction in proportion to the force
 there (by inspection of the diagram); and accordingly the
 existence or non-existence of a Peltier effect has everything to
 do with the existence or non-existence of a local E.M.F. This
 controverts the second form of the argument.
    If the argument be now considered upset, are we to pro
 ceed to assert that the difference of potential, or force, con
 cerned in the Volta effect, and the heat-destruction or           gene
 ration concerned in the Peltier effect, are closely connected,
 and in fact different ways of observing the same thing?
 By no means. All we have proved is that the Peltier effect
 accurately and necessarily represents and measures the true
 contact-force at a junction. True we have considered a
 difference of potential W —V' as produced by this contact-force
 in an incomplete circuit; and so it is. But nothing has been
  said to imply that this difference of potential has anything to
  do with what is observed in electrostatic experiments as the
  Volta effect.      So far from this, I will assert that what is

 262            Prof. Oliver Lodge on the Seat of the
 usually observed when two metals are touched and separated
 is not primarily a difference of potential between the metals at
 all. They are at different potentials when separated, no doubt,
 because they are oppositely charged; but they may have been
at the same potential until separated. The real Volta effect is
almost independent of the true contact-force, and of the dif
 ference of potential which it produces. In other words, a
good Volta effect can be observed when there was no difference
of potential whatever between the metals when in contact.
    According to my view the Volta effect is produced, not by
a contact-force at the junction of the two metals, but by a
                                  Fig. 15.
Hydrostatic analogue of the Volta effect, or apparent difference of poten
   tial produced by metallic contact, and of the opposite charges but
   uniform potential which it maintains between two metals in contact.
   The vessels are covered by air-tight elastic bags differently stretched.
contact-force at their free surfaces, between the metals and
the air or other medium surrounding them. To represent this
hypothesis by a hydrostatic model, we shall have to maintain
the difference of level in the two connected vessels, not by a
force at the junction, but by a force at the surfaces; say by
using closed vessels and compressed air, or more pictorially by
differently stretched elastic membranes or bladders tied over
the tops of the vessels.
    Note that the difference of level in this case implies no dif
ference of potential; and, as before, no work is required to
transfer water between A and B. Hence it is not easy to
distinguish this case from the former; and this difficulty of
distinguishing between the two cases is what has given rise to
most of the confusion. The only easy criterion is the non
existence in the second case of any Peltier effect at the junc
tion C.     Naturally it is possible and common for the two
effects to be superposed, but they are essentially independent.
    Since the two vessels in the second case are at the same
potential, the way to observe the effect is to cut and seal the

              Electromotive Forces in the Voltaic Cell.                  263
pipe at C, and then show that the vessels are differently
charged; which is what Volta did. The model does not
indeed represent the gradual change of potential induced as
the distance between the condenser-plates increases; and it is
scarcely worth while to complicate the matter by making a
more elaborate model. The thickening of the i. layer
of a condenser, when its plates are separated, corresponds
exactly to the thickening and strengthening of an elastic
membrane; and rise of potential in the one case is accurately
representable by increase of pressure in the other; but such
considerations belong to general electrostatics, and have no
special bearing on our present subject.
    12. This is perhaps the most convenient place to introduce
the notes or condensed statements which I drew up and dis
tributed at the meeting before the discussion.                      ey were
intended to be critically exact (allowing of course for mistakes
 and possible slips) so as to bear analysis; and hence it is
 probably worth while to reproduce them here with notes and
 comments.

question of words, viz, the definition of potential. Sir William at the
meeting said he had always defined potential as the work done in bring
ing a unit charge close up to, but not into, the body. This definition
explains some apparent inconsistency in one or two of his utterances which
I had never quite understood. But seeing that there is no difficulty what
ever in giving a charge up to a metal body, but rather the contrary, wh
not define its potential in the more simple manner which followers of his
have unconsciously, and I believe universally, adopted, not knowing that
they were thus putting themselves out of harmony with him P. Given his

    13. Before proceeding to the statements embodying my
own views, it will be more interesting if I try to explain in a
fuller and more connected manner what they are f.
    Let us regard the air as a dielectric bath of oxygen, in
which metals are immersed, and picture a piece of zinc sur
rounded by oxygen molecules which are straining at it, and
but the potential of the medium close to it, statements Nos. ix. and x. are
undoubtedly true; and No. xi. is also true, I suppose, for it then only
means that there is not much E.M.F. between the medium close to a
metal and that at a little distance.
   * It is much more natural to suppose that the potential of a metallic
conductor is uniform, whether it is homogeneous or not. Indeed, it is
not only more natural, but it is true, that two parts of a conductor can
only differ in potential by reason of an E.M.F. located at the junction.
Now there usually is an E.M.F. at a junction, but it is only of such a
magnitude as is concerned in thermoelectricity. This, indeed, does produce
a difference of potential between the metals, but nothing else can. N.B.
Always provided that by “the potential of a metal” is meant that potential,
and not the potential of air near it.
   f The experiments supposed to establish this, really prove only that
there is very little difference between the air and the water in which a
metal is partially immersed. I do not quite know how to understand, on
Sir William's plan, the potential of a metal which is half in one medium
and half in another.                                                                                                 -
   f The reason I set them forth at length is because I had no time at the
meeting both to open the discussion and also to properly express my own
ideas, and Sir William Thomson was kind enough to tell me to write out
the paper completely, and to explain the position I took up fully. This,
therefore, I have endeavoured to do.

 266            Prof. Oliver Lodge on the Seat of the
 endeavouring to combine with it. They may indeed partially
 succeed ; but suppose they do not, we have here a strong
 º         chemical action or chemical strain, which must pro
  ably be accompanied by some physical phenomenon. Now
 remember that oxygen is an electro-negative element; and
 without endeavouring to examine too precisely what significa
 tion is involved in that statement, it will be not out of accord
 with orthodox views if we assume that it means that at least
 any dissociated oxygen atoms are negatively charged, each
 with the characteristic charge of a free dyad atom. Granting
something equivalent to this, without pressing the form of
expression too closely, we perceive that the strain of the
oxygen towards the zinc will result in what I metaphorically
call a slackening up, or attempted compression, of the nega
tive electricity in it; i. e. in a rise of negative potential.   e
may therefore say that zinc is at a lower potential than the air
 surrounding it, and that the step of potential in crossing the
boundary from zinc to air is closely connected with the
 ...,               between zinc and oxygen. Observe that this
step of potential does not obviously nor probably depend on
the amount of oxygen present. It is possible that a few
million molecules may be as effective as a large number.
Note also that the step of potential is by no means caused by
actual oxidation : in so far as the zinc surface is tarnished by
oxidation the strain will be diminished and the step of poten
tial become less.
   Nothing is said here about the possible effect of the nitro
gen, because it is simplest in the first instance to ignore it,
though whether experiment will justify this simplicity or not,
I do not yet know.
   We may go further and assert that if in general the
chemical affinity of two substances can be measured by their
energies of combination, then the step of potential in the
present case may perhaps be calculable from the heat of com
bustion of zinc.
   And one may justify this assertion thus.         Let an atom of
oxygen combine with an atom of zinc ; it will generate an
amount of heat h, and its characteristic charge, q, will be
given up to the zinc and will thereby fall down the step of
potential, v, which separates the zinc from the air. Now if
we suppose that the heat h is the representative and equivalent
of the fall of energy q v, it follows of course that
                                     Jh

Make the hypothesis and see what comes of it.

   14. The oxidation energy of zinc per gramme-equivalent
(i.e. 65 grammes of zinc or 16 of oxygen) is, according to
the determinations of Julius Thomsen, Andrews, and Favre
and Silbermann, 85,430, 84,825, and 83,915 respectively.
   The amount of electricity needed to deposit a gramme
equivalent of zinc, or of any dyad element, is, according to
the modern determination of Lord Rayleigh *, 19,320 units.
   Hence the value of l, which is a ratio evidently independent
of the number of atoms dealt with, lies between $43% and
##!}}} probably. Let us say it is $33.9% or 4:4,
     ow J in absolute measure is 42 x 10"; so the value of v,
which is    ('')   according to the above hypothesis, comes out
1.85 x 10°, that is 1.85 volt.
   This then, I say, is the step of potential between zinc and
air. (To avoid circumlocution I will henceforward speak as
if the above hypothesis were admittedly true, and all I now
say stands or º with it.
   All clean bright zinc is thus about 1.8 volt below the
potential of the air near it; tarnished or oxidized zinc will
exhibit less difference; and it is perhaps possible that perfectly
oxidized zinc need show no jº. of potential at all be
tween itself and the air. The step of potential by no means
therefore depends upon the occurrence of oxidation ; it is the
oxidation tendency which causes it, but so far as oxidation
actually takes place the step diminishes.
   Proceed to consider a piece of copper similarly. Oxygen
molecules are straining at it also, but with less force. The
combustion energy of copper per gramme-equivalent is given
by the three authorities     ..      quoted as 37,160, 38,290, and
43,770 respectively. These do not agree well, and it is difficult
to know which to take ; but Thomsen's results are, I believe,
generally relied on; so, assuming his, the step of potential
                                    •42 × 37200    lts, that is about
between copper and air will be -Lago- volts, that is about
‘8 volt. This then is the amount by which clean bright copper
differs from the air. Oxidized copper will differ less. Com
paring this value for copper with that just obtained for zinc,
we perceive that a piece of zinc and a piece of copper are,
when separate, not at the same potential; they differ by about
a volt from each other. If the zinc is oxidized, they differ
less : if the copper is oxidized, they differ more.

hour” (Montreal Address). This gives the electrochemical equivalent of
silver 0.1118, and of hydrogen 00010852.

268            Prof. Oliver Lodge on the Seat of the
   Now put the zinc and copper into direct metallic contact,
and neglect for the present the third of a millivolt of E.M.F.
developed at the junction, which acts so as to drive positive
electricity from copper to zinc. A rush of electricity must
take place from the copper to the zinc to equalize their
potential; it is impossible that they can remain at different
potentials when directly united : all parts of a conductor must
be at a uniform potential, and the rush has taken place because
they were not so when put into contact.
   15. Picturing to ourselves the effect as produced by the
straining oxygen atoms, we shall perceive that they could not
get at either metal when separate : first, because they sur
rounded it everywhere, and strained equally on all sides; and
second, because, being all charged with negative electricity,
they could not move in on all sides at once without, so to
speak, compressing the electricity in the body and giving it
an absolute charge. But directly the copper touched the zinc
the oxygen atoms were cleared away at the point of contact,
and the stress of those at the rest of its surface was no longer
counterbalanced. Moreover, they can now all move nearer to
the zinc because a way of escape for electricity is provided
into the copper, whose surrounding oxygen atoms will be thus
driven back somewhat further from the surface, until the
dielectric strain, assisting the chemical strain on the copper
surface and opposing it on the zinc surface, prevents §.
displacement, and equilibrium is again attained. The electri
city which escaped from the zinc to the copper was negative
electricity (oxygen being essentially an electro-negative ele
ment), the negatively charged oxygen atoms have moved a
little nearer to the zinc than their normal distance: i. e. the
thickness of its layer of negative electricity is reduced, or its
surface is positively charged; the negative layer on the
copper has been slightly thickened—its surface is negatively
charged.
   This is a pictorial way of representing the process, and may
be regarded as somewhat fanciful; it is, however, the way in
which the theory originally occurred to me, and it permits
more insight into the processes than a mere statement in terms
of potential can ; though it may well be that the imagined
processes are but distant likenesses of the real ones.
   The oxygen atoms have moved nearer to the zinc; it is now
more easily oxidized than before. The copper, on the other
hand, is by contact with zinc somewhat protected.
   Observe that the contact has not developed any force; it
has only, by sweeping away the oxygen from the point of
contact, enabled previously existing forces to do work and
produce their effect.

   The air surrounding the metals in contact is in a state of
slight dielectric strain, such as would be produced by two
pieces of any one metal of similar size and position, charged
so as to differ in potential from each other by a volt.
   Zinc and copper plates in contact may therefore be regarded
as the plates of a condenser, but they form a peculiar con
denser, for they are not really at different potentials; the
whole step of potential which throws the air into its state of
dielectric strain is located on their bounding surfaces.
   Let s and 8' be the electrostatic capacity of the zinc and the
copper respectively; think of them as two independent spheres
united by a fine wire; and let a be their common potential ;
then the zinc has, by the fact of contact, gone up 1.84-w, and
the copper has gone down al-'8; and, since the quantity of
electricity which left the one went to the other, it follows
that—
                      s(1.8—a)=s' (w—-8)

   There is no necessary relation between 8 and 8' in general,
but in the ordinary form of the Volta experiment the two
plates are of equal size and shape ; in which case s-s', and
w-1-3 volt below the potential of the unconstrained air.
   All this is wholly unlike a condenser investigation. To
treat it as a condenser we must consider the air-surfaces close
to the two metals as the plates of the condenser, and we can
then speak of its electrostatic capacity S in the ordinary way,
and say that it is in the present case charged with the E.M.F.
of a volt.
   The quantity of electricity on either plate of such a con
denser is S (1-8–8) or S; hence
               s (1.8–4)=s' (v-8)=S (1.8–28).
And the general relation between the three S's is like that
of two Leyden jars in cascade, viz.,
                                  s s'
                             S= s+s'

and at a distance 2 apart, the value of S is of course 42     -
   In Volta's form of the experiment, two plates are put near
each other, connected for an instant, then removed from each
other, and the potential of one of them observed. This

    In Pellat's form the charges acquired by contact are
neutralized, and the oxygen atoms driven back to their normal
distance, by an extraneous E.M.F. carefully adjusted until
the plates, after separation, exhibit no charge. This measures
1-8–’8 directly.
    16. So far  five spoken as if I were sure that (granting
the hypothesis) the potential of clean zinc is 1.8 volt below
the air; but I am not really sure that this is anything better
than an approximation. The fact that no actual combination
occurs makes the matter perhaps a little indefinite. If an
oxygen atom unites with a zinc atom, one has a right to say
distinctly that q has stepped down v.; but suppose they are
only facing one another, and wishing to combine, are we
justified then in asserting that the step v is ready for q to go
 down, and that it is the same v as before? It almost seems
 to depend on whether chemical attraction becomes greater as
 two atoms approach one another, or becomes less.
     Suppose, first, it becomes greater, which is the natural
 hypothesis, then the v calculated from data obtained by per
 mitting the combination to occur will be too large for the step
 of potential caused by the attraction of metal for oxygen over
 a standard distance. On the other hand, the differential force
 urging electricity across a junction of two metals, which is
 observed in the Volta effect, may be somewhat greater than
 simply the differences in their pull reckoned at standard
 distances, because the approach of atoms to the zinc will
 increase it on this side, and the recession of atoms from the
 copper will decrease it on that. Hence the Volta effect ma
 perhaps be expected to agree better with calculation than the
 air/metal potential-difference    does, if this latter could   be
 º                observed, which it never yet has been.
       ext, º: that chemical attraction becomes      less as atoms
 approach: the step of potential between a metal and air will
 now be greater than that calculated from chemical data;
 nevertheless the Volta effect will be somewhat less than that
 due to the differences of such steps for two metals, and may
 thus possibly agree pretty well with calculation.
     The agreement or non-agreement of Volta effects with
 calculation does not therefore quite establish the accuracy of
 our calculated metal-air contact-forces. But we have no right
 to assume that even Volta effects will agree with calculation
   articularly well so long as our data are so slender. They
   ave no chance of accurately agreeing unless the metals used

            Electromotive Forces in the Voltaic Cell.        271
are pure and perfectly clean—a most difficult condition to
attain for even a few seconds.
   Before leaving this subject it may be well to point out that,
whereas the calculation of a Volta effect depends on data
obtained by allowing oxygen atoms to approach the metal so as
completely and actually to combine, the experimental determi
nation by Kohlrausch's and similar methods depends on letting
the atoms approach somewhat nearer to one metal and recede
somewhat further from another; while the compensation form
of the experiment employed by Pellat and others depends
upon forcing back and restoring the atoms to their original or
standard positions. Now if the views here just expressed
have any sense or signification whatever in actual fact, it
would be very natural to suppose that the numbers obtained
in these three ways might be slightly different. But to
specify the direction in which we should expect the differences,
if any, to lie would require us to have made up our minds as
to the probable variation of chemical attraction with distance.
Assuming an inverse variation, the Pellat method should give
the least, the Volta or Kohlrausch method the next, and the
calculation method the greatest, value for the Volta effect.
   But all these ideas complicate the matter somewhat, and
they are quite possibly unnecessary. If it be considered that
we have no data at present, it may be permitted to work on
the simplest hypothesis, viz. that the  ...] v is independent of
how nearly chemical action has occurred—that it is the same
for atoms straining at one another at their normal distance as
for atoms on the verge of combination. And it may be argued
in favour of this view that we really have some data, viz.
these.
   If it were not true, results obtained by Pellat's method
could not be expected to agree exactly with those obtained by
Kohlrausch's (of which Ayrton and Perry's or Clifton's may
be taken as the best examples). Now results obtained by
these different methods do agree very fairly well; exact
agreement cannot be predicated, for the most trifling circum
stances cause large variations in the Volta effect, but no
decided disagreement is observable. Again, if it were not
true, the Volta effect observed when two metals far apart in
 the series (e.g. zinc and platinum) were employed would be
inconsistent with the results obtained by using metals nearer
together, say zinc and tin, or tin and platinum ; and if this
were so, the metals could not be arranged in the linear series
which eighty years ago Volta showed they could be. These
arguments throw no light on what may happen just before
actual combination, still they are encouraging as far as they go.

    272             Prof. Oliver Lodge on the Seat of the
       17. Let us therefore endeavour to suppress further qualms,
    and calculate a series of metal-air contact-forces from the
    heats of combustion; remembering that all we have to do, in
    order to convert heats of combustion per dyad8 gramme       w
    equivalent
    46,000.        into volts, is to divide by lº,         42 x 10
                                                                          that is by
       But the decision as to what numbers we shall take to repre
    sent heats of combustion is a matter of some difficulty, for
    not only do the numbers obtained by different observers for
    the same reaction differ, sometimes considerably, but it is not
    obvious when different oxides are formed which of them we
    are to consider as most applicable to the case of the Volta
    experiment. Perhaps one should take the most common or
    stable oxide ; perhaps, seeing that no combination is supposed
    actually to occur, and since the metal is, so to speak, in excess,
    it is most reasonable to take the lowest oxide which the sub
    stance will form. It may be that the data are not known for
    this ; it may even be that they have only been obtained for
    the hydrate instead of for the oxide.
       I must therefore do the best I can, and quote several
    numbers wherever, there is obvious doubt. I imagine that
    J. Thomsen's are the most reliable when they are available.
       But it must be remembered all through, that since it is only
    the tendency to chemical action which is the cause of the Wolta
    effect, whereas combination-heats are obtained by permitting
    or causing the combination to actually occur, the numbers
    obtained by calculation are not likely to be quite right; and
    they may be expected to err on the side of excess, the calcu
    lated number being higher than the actual value if directly
    observed.

         * This number for sodic oxide agrees with Thomsen's value for the
     hydrated oxide, whereas for K, Ba, Sr, Ca the oxide is distinctly below
    the hydrate. By analogy, one would expect to have to subtract some
     25,000 from the hydrated oxide Na,0aq., and this gives the 130,000
     which I put down as a hypothetical number for Na,0.

   Numbers obtained from unsatisfactory oxides and hydrates
like those of aluminium, arsenic, and bismuth, are not likely
to be useful for our present purpose. I know of no better
data yet available however.
    It is now easy to write down a Volta series obtained by
pure calculation from heats of combustion. We can then
see how far it agrees with the results of direct experiment.
 The principle on which I determine which of the preceding
numbers to select is simply to choose Thomsen's when it refers
to the simplest oxide, and in other cases to take what one can
get. Metals about which there is obvious uncertainty, as for
 instance sodium, aluminium, bismuth, &c., are omitted.

    To compare this series with those obtained by experiment,
 we may as well take zinc as the metal of reference, and write
 down the Volta effect between it and the other metals, first as
 abstracted from the above table, and then as found by different
 observers. Strictly, one ought first to subtract Peltier forces
 from the observed numbers before comparing them with
 theory; but these forces are too small to make any appreciable
 difference.

    The alternative calculated number sometimes given is
merely to show the kind of variation probable in those cases
from uncertainty of data. In each case of agreement the
calculated number is a little higher than the observed, as was
to be expected. No reason occurs to me for the breakdown
and apparent interchange, in the case of lead and iron, but
such vague guesses as may occur to every one.

   I do not wish to blink the fact that some of the numbers in
the former of the above tables afford a rather poor support to
my theory; but it must be remembered, on the other hand,
that they are not relative numbers only that we have calcu
lated, but absolute; and the fact that the heats of combus
tion reduced to volts are numbers of the same order of
magnitude as the Volta effects, is of itself a strong confirma
tion of the belief that chemical strain at the air-contacts is
the real cause of the apparent contact-force at the junction
of two metals.                     -
   The agreement of the numbers, though not exact, seems to
 me too close to be the result of accident. One may, I think,
 claim that the hypothesis whence the calculated numbers are
 obtained is justified by the figures as far as they go. It is
 not put forward as a completed theory, but only as a first step
 to such a theory. I believe it to be a step in the direction of
 the truth, but it requires working out and elaborating by a
 scientific chemist.
    18. Not many measurements of metal pairs have been made,
 even in air; for mere permutations such as copper-tin, tin
 silver, &c. follow at once from the numbers given above by
 Volta's series-law; but in gases other than air one has at
                       * Ann, der Physik, x. p. 348 (1880).

276              Prof. Oliver Lodge on the Seat of the
present no experimental guidance beyond the barest qualita
tive one given by Mr. Brown, that copper-nickel reverses its
sign when changed from air to hydrochloric acid, and that
copper-iron is reversed in sulphuretted hydrogen. But satis
factory observation in these gases is difficult, because they not
only tend to attack the plates, but they do attack them ; and
so a film is formed and everything is rendered uncertain.
   Another complication results from the fact that, when metals
are taken out of air and put into a foreign gas, they are
already coated with a film of oxygen, and it is not clear in
what way this will affect the action of the new gas. It may
have to be replaced almost by substitution; the affinity to be
considered in chlorine, for instance, being something like
M, Cl,-M, O. In a compound like HCl, the hydrogen also
may have to be provided for, the resulting chemical strain
being, for instance, M, Cla–M, Cl- H, 0–2(H, Cl); but the
consideration of the hydrogen affinities will not affect differ
ences, and therefore will leave comparisons with experiment
unaffected. Taking the metals as clean, however, and without
air-films, we must suppose the following series to be right.

   All this supposes the metals to be perfectly clean, and not

   But it will be observed that this is nothing like the order
to be expected in sulphuretted hydrogen ; for it is popularly
known that copper is more easily sulphurized in this gas than
iron. Now assuming that the metal had been covered with
an air-film, and that the oxygen of this has to be replaced by
sulphur, the chemical tendency, instead of being M, S, is

   The series so obtained gives copper and iron in their proper
order; but it is scarcely likely to be really correct, because it
assumes that the orides of the metals are exposed to the gas
rather than the metals themselves. It is quite possible that
it is not very incorrect for tarnished metals, i. e. metals coated
with a film of oxide; but for ordinarily clean metals, coated,
not with a film of oxide, but with a film of oxygen, it is
nothing but a rough approximation, given because we have
no better data.
   It is to be noted that, as the film of oxygen diffuses away,
the Volta-effect depending on it must diminish; until at length
the active affinity causing the chemical strain is nothing more
than M, S or perhaps M, S-H, S. A gradual falling off
and ultimate even reversal of sign was observed by Mr. Brown
in both HCl and H. S.                In so far as actual chemical action
occurs and a film of chloride or sulphide forms, so far of
course also will the effect diminish ; because it depends essen
tially on the unsatisfied chemical strain, not on the accom
plished chemical action.

                Additional Note, March 13th, 1885.
   On page 176 of the March Number of the Philosophical
Magazine I quote from Von Zahn and others an extraordinary
statement, ascribed to Professor Exner, that a thermopile ceases
to work in a vacuum; saying at the same time that I had been
unable to find the statement myself in Exner’s writings. For
a sufficient reason as it now turns out, because it is not there.
   Turning over some back volumes of “Nature’ recently, I
accidentally came across a letter from Prof. Exner in vol. xxiii.
p. 170, December 1880, denying that he had ever said such a
thing, and maintaining that his memoirs were quite clear on
the subject of the relation, or rather want of relation, between
voltaic and thermoelectric phenomena. This is perfectly true;
Prof. Exner has expressed himself on this subject with decision,
and finds fault with Prof. Edlund for ever confusing the two
distinct things together.
   In the same volume of “Nature,” on page 312, appears a
note from Professor Young acknowledging that he ought to
have been more careful to refer to the original statement, and
giving one of the “Physical Notes” of “Nature, p. 156,
vol. xxii., as his authority. This “Physical Note” quotes
from l’Electricité; and so the error, however originally manu
factured, gets handed on from one paper to another.
    One of the memoirs which I have unfortunately overlooked
in my historical sketch of the experimental work done in
connection with the subject has come to hand this morning,
through the kindness of the authors, MM. E. Bichat and R.
Blondlot, of Nancy. It was published in the Comptes Rendus
(1883), t. xc. pp. 1202 et 1293, and in the Journal de Physique,
 2° série, ii. p. 533, and is an attempt to measure the Volta
effect for two liquids. The method employed involves the use
of three vessels, A, B, C, of which A and C contain one liquid
 and B the other. A and B are then connected by a liquid
siphon with porous diaphragm [the capillary E.M.F. possibly
 excited by this diaphragm is bad]; and the potential of the air
 between B and C is then rendered uniform [or, commonly
 speaking, the potentials of B and C are equalized] by making
 one of the liquids drip inside a cavity kept moist with the
 other. A and C are connected by platinum electrodes through
 a compensation resistance-box and battery to a quadrant
 electrometer, and the difference of potential between them
 measured. The arrangement is highly ingenious, but the
 difficulties of definite and certain measurement must be
 considerable.

280                   Miss Sarah Marks on the
   The same physicists have quite recently made a determina
tion, not of the Volta-effect, but of the true contact-force
between two liquids, by the use of mercury electrodes; em
ploying for this purpose a theorem of Helmholtz, that if by
judicious polarization the capillary constant of a mercury
liquid surface be made a maximum, then between the mercury
and the liquid there is no difference of potential".
   Their account of this last determination has not yet been
published, but it will appear shortly (before this is printed
probably) in the Comptes Rendus.
   The theorem gives evidently an admirably simple method
of measuring liquid/liquid contact-force, if it can be made to
work practically.
   MM. Bichat and Blondlot apparently hope, by a comparison
of the two methods, the results of which are quite different
(in accordance with the views expressed in the present com
munication), to be able to obtain values for air / liquid contacts.
This would be a most important and useful piece of work: the
only difficulty in accomplishing it is the difficulty of getting
both sets of measurements thoroughly dependable.              hope
they may succeed in overcoming all obstacles.

            XXXI. The Uses of a Line-Divider.
                    By Miss SARAH MARKsf.
Th;       ordinary method of dividing a given straight line AB
       into any number of equal º (fig. 1), without using a
special instrument, is to draw a line AC at any angle to it, to
cut off from AC the given number of equal parts AD", D'E', &c.,
to join M, the last of the points so taken, to B, and from D', E',
&c. to draw lines    <U+017F>ºil to       MB, meeting AB in D, E, &c.
These points D, E, &c. divide AB into the required number
of equal parts. This is exactly the method adopted in using
the line-divider.
   It consists of a hinged rule with a firm joint, having the
left-hand limb fitted to slide in an undercut groove upon the
 lain rule.   Both limbs are bevelled on their inner edges, and
the left one is divided both on the bevel and on the top into
eighths, quarters, half-inches, and inches, which are consecu
tively numbered, beginning at the hinged end, so that any

set may be used. The plain rule has two needle-points on its
underside to prevent it from slipping when placed in any

 position, and on the top has a single line drawn perpendicular
 to its longer edges.
    To divide the line AB into any number of equal parts, say
 seven (fig.2): slide the plain rule along the divided limb till its
                              Fig. 2.
  line coincides with one of the lines of this limb against which
  the number 7 is marked (it is generally best to use the largest
  Possible divisions), place the corresponding line on the bevel

282                 Miss Sarah Marks on the
of the limb on the point A, and open or close the rule till the
bevel of the  ... limb is on the point B. Now press
the plain rule down so that the needle-points enter the paper,
and keep it in position. Slide the hinged rule up till the line
numbered 6-on the line of reference is coincident with the line
on the plain rule, and mark the point where the bevel of the
undivided limb meets the line AB.         Continue to move the
hinged rule up one division at a time till the whole line is
divided. It is evident that the ordinary method has been
used; for the divided limb forms a line at some angle to AB,
and is divided into seven equal parts, and against the undivided
limb I can draw parallel lines through the points of section
of the divided limb cutting AB in points equidistant from
one another.
   This is the first method of using the instrument, and is
useful in many ways :—to artists, for squaring out their can
vases when they wish to enlarge or diminish their drawings,
although the second method would perhaps be best for this if
a very large divider were used ; to decorators, who frequently
find it necessary to divide lines into given numbers of equal
parts in order to get patterns into a certain space; it would
also be useful for finding the divisions on the scales of ther
mometers, as the distance between the freezing- and boiling
points is always an unknown length.
   The second method of using the instrument is this :—Let
ABCD be an area to be divided into any number of parts, say
five, by equidistant lines parallel to AD or BC. Produce AD
both ways: place the bevelled edge of the undivided limb
along BC, open or close the rule till the end of one of the
lines marked 5 on the bevel of the divided limb is on the line
AD.     Slide the plain rule up, taking care that it is held high
enough for its points not to tear the paper, till its line coin
cides with the 5-line, and press the points firmly into the
paper. Now slide the hinged rule up till the division marked
4 coincides with the line on the plain rule, and draw a line
along the undivided limb cutting AB and CD., Bring each
of the other three divisions against the line on the plain rule,
and draw lines as before. These are the lines required.
   It is evident that, since the angle ABC may be any angle,
it may be a right angle, so that lines can be drawn perpendi
cular to AB, dividing it into any given number of equal parts.
This method is used in finding the mean pressure in gas- and
steam-engines by means of an indicator-diagram.
   Let A i. CD (fig. 3) be an indicator-diagram, EF the atmo
spheric line; G. E., HC, tangents at the extremities of the
diagram   perpendicular to EF. To find the length of the line

area E H C G into ten parts by lines parallel to H C and E B,

and equidistant from one another; bisect each of the areas
thus obtained by lines parallel to the last. Let the points
where these last lines meet the diagram be a a', bb', &c. . . . .
Add together the lengths a a', bb', &c., and divide by 10; the
result will give the line representing the mean pressure of the
engine. This process of dividing the diagram, first by ten
equidistant lines and then bisecting the spaces between these
lines, is generally a very troublesome one, effected by means
of a system of parallel rulers and a T-square. In the figure
the dotted lines are those not required when the line-divider
is used.
    To divide the diagram by means of the rule, place the rule
as if for dividing    #. area by 20 equidistant lines parallel to
 HC. Draw the first of these lines, and then every alternate
 one, and the diagram is divided as required.
 . This method of dividing areas is also convenient for draw
 ing treads and rises of stairs, joists, roof-timbers.
    In the third method the divider is used simply as a parallel
ruler. As such it has the advantage of having a wide range,
 and of being firmly fixed at the same time. In graphical
 statics, where it is often necessary to draw a line parallel to
 another at a considerable distance from it, set squares have
 often to be placed and replaced five or six times before the
 necessary line can be drawn. This instrument will at once
 draw the line. The range as a parallel ruler may be still
 further increased by having the plain rule considerably longer
 than the hinged one.

284                 Miss Sarah Marks on the
   The special advantages of this instrument as a parallel
ruler may best be seen by drawing what surveyors call the
“give and take line.”
       hen two fields are divided by a curved boundary, it is
often required to find a straight boundary which will divide
the fields in the same proportions as before. This straight
boundary is what is called the “give and take” line.
   In order to understand the method of finding it, it will be
necessary to recall the method of finding a rectangle which
shall be equal to a given polygon.
                              Fig. 4.

   Similarly A A G C= A A BC.
   Having this triangle, it is easy to draw a rectangle equal
to it.
   Now let A 1234 B (fig. 5) be the curved boundary of a
field of which AC, BD are fixed boundaries; it is required
to find a straight boundary to replace the curved one through
A and B.
   Place the divided limb roughly parallel to AC, with its
bevelled edge nearest to AC, and at a distance about equal
to the breadth of either limb from it, and fix the points
firmly in the paper. Now move the undivided limb till it
cuts AC at A and 12 at 2; slide it along till it is on the point
1, and mark the point a where it meets AC. Move it till it
is against a and 3, and slide it along till it is against 2, mark
ing the point b where it meets AC produced, if necessary.
Move it till it is on b and 4, slide it till it is on 3, and mark c,

the line required, as may easily be seen by comparing the
portions given and taken by the respective fields. This line
would only divide the fields perfectly accurately as before, if
A 12, 2 3 4, &c., were rectilineal angles; but it is the nearest
approximation possible, and the one always used.
   #. divider would also be useful on board ships for drawing
lines on charts parallel to other lines at some distance. It
would be much better for this purpose than an ordinary
parallel ruler on account of its very large range and capability
of being fixed.
   Of course the line-divider can be used in all cases in which
parallel rulers are ordinarily used.
   In summing up, the advantages of the line-divider appear
to be these :—
   1. Lines of division can be drawn at any angle to the line
to be divided.
   2. Areas can be divided by equidistant lines parallel to any
given line.
   3. Since the divisions on the instrument are all equal, they
may    .            be made inches and parts of an inch; and
   4, consequently the number of divisions may be made as
great as we like without materially increasing the cost.
   5. Lastly, the cost of the instrument is small, and it is
made by Messrs. Stanley in three sizes—6, 12, and 24 inches
 in length.

IN     my work on the Algebra of Logic I investigated the
      meaning of Boole's analysis by the aid of diagrams. In
this paper I propose to make a further use of the same method.
   When the class of things considered (that is, the universe)
is subdivided by not more than three qualities, a modified use
of Euler's circles is sufficient. Let a square represent the
universe of objects considered, and let a circle separate those
having a particular quality. Diagram 1 represents the two
classes formed by the presence and absence of the mark a ;
and diagram 2 represents each of the four classes ab, ab", a'b,

marks a and b. Here the dash is used to denote non, as a<U+017F> for
non-a. It is a contraction for the complementary expression
1-a. The diagram 3 is quite general, because it represents
each of the eight classes abc, abc', ab<U+017F>c, ab<U+017F>c', a<U+017F>bc, a'be", a'b'c,

portions, the c part into four portions, the d part into eight

us easily to find all the portions belonging to any one mark.

 where the coefficients A1, Ag, ... As are numerical.          The
 coefficient for any term is found by supposing that term
coextensive with the universe, and substituting 1 or 0, as the
                                             ce+bf
case may be, for each of the letters in ae+bd" If U abcdef
is identical with the universe, then a, b, c, d, e,f are each 1,
 and
                          A1=_1T++ 11 = 1.
 If U abcdef" – U, then f is 0 and all the others 1, and
                              A2=#.
 According to Boole, these coefficients are susceptible of one
 or other of four interpretations: 1 means all, 0 means none,
 § means none or a portion     or all, and every other coefficient
 shows that the term is impossible.
     When I sought to determine the coefficients for w and y by
 the above method, I found that many coefficients assumed the
  indeterminate form ; and I found, on verifying the solution
 by means of the logical spectrum, that some of those terms
 could not be really indeterminate. Eventually I discovered
 a simpler method of    º       the coefficients; and the solution
 obtained by it may be verified by the spectrum. It consists
 in substituting the special values of a, b, c, d, e, f(due to sup
 posing a particular term identical with the universe) in the
 original equations, and then solving for a and y. The values
  so found are the coefficients for the terms.
     For the first term abcdef we get
                      a +y=1,      w—y=1;

                        Logical Spectrum.                    289

hence
                     A1 =1 and B1–0.
   For the second term abcdef" we get
                     a +y=1, a -y=0;
 hence y is complementary to a and also identical with a,
 which is impossible unless the term abcdef’ is null.
    For the fifth term abcd'ef we get
                     a +y=1, -y=1;
 but y cannot be negative unless abcd'ef is null.
    For the seventh term,
                     a +y=1, 0=1;
but the latter equation is impossible unless the term vanish.
    For the eighth term,
                        a +y=1, 0=0;
hence a and y are indeterminate, but complementary to one
another. In the case of the 58th term, we get w and y both
indeterminate but identical with one another.         These are
 interpretations which are not conceived of by Boole.
   For the nineteenth term,
                         a-1,    w=1;
hence Ala is 1 and Big is indeterminate, that is may have any
value between 0 and 1. In a similar manner, by solving
each of the sixty-four sets of equations the several coefficients
are found. In the last case only are both coefficients inde
terminate and independent of one another.
   I have exhibited the solution obtained by this analysis in
the accompanying spectrum (diagram 9). Each null term is
shaded ; each term which is wholly included is white; each
term which is totally excluded is black; and each term which
is indeterminate is partly black and partly white. The two
complementary indeterminates have complementary parts
white, and the two identical indeterminates have the same
parts white.
   The solution is verified by finding whether the aw together
with the by is identical with the c, and whether the da, ex
cepting the ey, is identical with the fi and by testing whether
any   other solution not comprehended as a particular case of
that obtained would satisfy the conditions.

            XXXIII. On the Quadrant-Electrometer,
                By J. HoPKINSON, D.Sc., F.R.S.*
IN      Professor Clerk Maxwell's ‘Electricity’ (vol. i. p. 273)
       it is proved that the deflection of the needle of a
quadrant-electrometer varies as     (A–B)( —Ajº.         , where
C is the potential of the needle, and A and B of the two pairs
of quadrants. Desiring to ascertain the value of the standard
charge of my instrument, I endeavoured to do so by the aid of
this formula, and also by a more direct method. The results
were quite discordant. Setting aside the special reasoning by
which the formula is attained, we should confidently expect
that the sensibility of a quadrant-electrometer would increase
continuously as the charge of the jar is increased, until at last
a disruptive discharge occurs. In my instrument this is not
the fact. As the charge was steadily increased by means
of the replenisher, the deflection of the needle due to three
Daniell's elements at first increased, then attained a maximum,
and with further increase of charge actually diminished. On
turning the replenisher in the inverse direction the sensibility
 at first increased, attained the maximum previously observed,
 and only on further reduction of charge diminished.
    Before giving the experimental results, it may be worth while
 to briefly examine the theory of the quadrant-electrometer.
 Let A, B, C, D be the potentials of the quadrants, the needle,
 and the inductor which is used for measuring high potentials
 (see Reprint of Sir W. Thomson's papers, p. 278). Let Q,
 Q, Q3, Q, be the quantities of electricity on these bodies
 respectively, and 6 the angle of deflection/of the needle, mea
 sured in terms of divisions of the scale, on which the image of
 the lamp-flame is projected. We have the equations
                  Q = qual-qiab-q13C-q14D,
                  Q3––412A + q22 B-q23C-q2, D,

  qu &c. are the coefficients of capacity and induction. They
  are independent of A, B, C, D, and are functions of 6 only.
  As above written, they are all positive. Let the energy of
  electrification be W:—

   Now when the electrometer is    º       adjusted, the needle
will not be deflected when A= B, whatever C and A may be.
Hence A–B is a factor of dw and we have

This should be true of any electrometer having the above
adjustment correctly made.
   But by suitably forming the three bodies A, B, C, further
relations between the coefficients may be obtained. The
condition of symmetry would give us     |   - -  *    ; but it is
not necessary to assume symmetry. If the circumferential
termination of the needle be a circle centre in the axis of
suspension (at least near the division of the quadrants), if
the needle turn in its own plane, if the quadrants are each
approximately a surface of revolution about the axis, and if the
radial terminations of the needle be not within the electrical
influence of the quadrants within which they are not, conditions

   We may now consider the methods of varying the sensibility
of the instrument (see Reprint of Sir W. Thomson's papers,
p.280). The methods dealt with are those of Sir W. Thomson,
somewhat generalized.
    (c) The quadrant B is connected with an insulated con
denser, capacity b, whilst A is connected to a source of elec
tricity:—

If b-0, we have the first reduced sensibility given by Sir W.
Thomson.
    (d) All methods of using the inductor may be treated under
 one general form. , Let the quadrants A and B be connected
with insulated condensers, capacities a and b; then connect
 the inductor to a source, potential V;
           0=(qu--a)A-qiab–qi,V-Ha6C,

 whence we have an expression for V proportional to 6. By a
 proper choice of a and b, we can make the sensibility as low
 as we please.
     Now the whole of these formulae rest on the same reasoning
 as the equation
                     0-x(A–B)( —Aft)
  I have mentioned that, in my instrument at least, this equation
 quite fails to represent the facts when C is considerable. It be
  comes a matter of interest to ascertain when the formula begins
  to err to a sensible extent. If a constant battery of a large num
  ber of elements were available, this would be soon accomplished.
  I have at present set up, only 18 Daniells. I have therefore
  been content to use the electrometer to ascertain its own charge

by the aid of the inductor, using the 18 Daniells as a standard
potential. As the charges range as high as 2600 Daniell's
elements, the higher numbers can only be regarded as very
rough approximations; sufficiently near, however, to indicate
the sort of result which would be obtained if more precise
methods were used. The first column in the following Table
gives the ascertained or estimated charge of the jar of my
electrometer in Daniell's elements; the second the deflection
in scale divisions caused by three elements; the third, the
coefficient X, deduced by the formula 6=XAC: this coefficient
ought theoretically to be constant.

   By connecting the jar and one quadrant to 18 elements and
the other quadrant to earth, I obtained 0.356 as the value of
\, making use of the complete equation
                    0-x(A–B)(c-º")
It will be seen that this equation may be trusted until C is
over 200 Daniell's elements potential, but that when C exceeds
250 a quite different law rules.
   The foregoing was read before the Physical Society a few
years ago,  i. I stopped its publication after the type was set
up, because I was not satisfied that my appliances for experi
ment were satisfactory, or that I could give any satisfactory
explanation of the anomaly.
   The electrometer had been many times adjusted for various
purposes before further experiments were made, so that those

296                  Dr. J. Hopkinson on the
 which I shall now describe cannot be directly compared with
 what goes before. The old experiment was first repeated, and
 the existence of a maximum sensibility again found. On
examination, it was found that the needle hung a little low so
that it was nearer to the part of the quadrant below it than to
 that above. It is easy to see that this would produce the
anomalous result observed, though there is reason for thinking
it is not the sole cause. The effect of the needle being low
 is that it will be on the whole attracted downwards; and so the
 apparent weight hanging on the fibre-suspension and the con
 sequent tension of the fibres will be increased. The increase
 of the tension will be as the square of the potential C; and
hence the formula for the deflection will be modified to
                        X.                A+B
                  0–Hºº<U+017F>a-B)(C-º),
where k is a constant depending upon the extent to which the
position of the needle deviates from its true position of
midway between the upper and lower parts of the quadrants.
By a proper choice of k, the results. I previously obtained are
found to agree well with this formula.
    The electrometer was next adjusted in the following way:
The needle was raised by taking up the fibres of the suspen
sion and adjusting them to equal tension in the usual way,
and the proportionality of sensibility to charge was tested, the
charge being now determined in arbitrary units by discharging
the jar of the instrument through a ballistic galvanometer.
The operation was repeated until the sensibility, so far as this
method of testing goes, was proportional to the charge of the
jar over a very long range. It was then found that the
needle was slightly above the median position within the
quadrants. Increased tension of the fibres from electrical
attraction does not therefore account for the whole of the
facts, although it does play the principal part. The sensibility
of the instrument being now at least approximately propor
tional to the charge of the jar, I proceeded to ..
accurately the potential of the jar when charged to the standard
as indicated by the idiostatic gauge.
    In what follows the quadrants, one of which is under the
induction-plate, are denoted by B, the others by A. The
quadrants B are connected to the case, A are insulated. The
jar is connected to the induction-plate, and the reading on the
scale noted ; the connection is broken, and the induction
plate is connected to the case, and the reading on the scale
again noted; the difference is the deflection due to the charge
in the jar. It is necessary to read the scale for zero-charge

                     Quadrant-Electrometer.                    297
on induction-plate last, because the charging of the in
duction-plate slightly diminishes the charge of the jar, and
considerably displaces the zero-reading by giving an induc
tive charge to the quadrant A. It is also necessary to begin
with the ãº      of the jar minutely too high, so that after sepa
rating the induction-plate from the interior of the jar, the latter
shall have exactly the correct charge as indicated by the gauge.
The deflection thus obtained was precisely 298%, repeated in
many experiments. The double deflection given by seventy
Daniell cells was 43-6 scale-divisions. By comparison with
two Clark’s cells, the value of which I know, the potential
of the seventy Daniells was found to be 74.2 volts; hence the
potential of º, jar is 1016 volts, when charged to the poten
tial indicated by the gauge.
   The constant X of the instrument was next determined by
the formula
                    0-x(A–B)(c _A+ *)     2
 Four modes of connecting are available for this —
                   A=C=74.2 volts, B=0;
                   B=C=74.2 volts, A=0;
                   A=C=0, B=74.2 volts;
                   B=C=0, A=74.2 volts.
 In each case the deflection was 253-5 if the charge on the
 needle was positive in relation to the quadrant with which it
 was not connected; and was 247 when the needle was nega
 tive. This at first appeared anomalous; but the explanation
 is very simple. The needle is aluminium, the quadrants are
 either brass or brass-gilded, I am not sure which. There is
 therefore a contact-difference of potential between the2
                                                             needle
 and the quadrants; call it wi Thus, instead of    6–4,    we have
                                   A.

                         6=\(—A)    (— **)
 this gives
                      •=º-0482          volt.
    The result was verified by using fourteen cells instead of
 seventy: the deflections were 10-0 and 8.8, which gives the
 same value to w.     It is worth noting that the same cause

 298                  Dr. J. Hopkinson on the
 affects the idiostatic gauge in the same way. Let the jar be
 charged till the gauge comes to the mark, Call P the differ
 ence of potential between the aluminium lever of the idiostatic
 #.       and the brass disk below which attracts it.      The dif
  erence of potential between the brass of the case and the brass
 work of the interior is P--w, and between the case and the alu
 minium needle within the quadrants it is P--2a. If, however,
 the charge is negative, the difference is –P+2a. Hence the
 sensibility will be different from two causes, according as the
jar is charged positively or negatively, till the idiostatic gauge
 is at its standard. For determining the constant X we must
take the mean of the two results 253:5 and 247, that is 250-25.
 Comparing this with the actual standard charge of the jar, and
the double deflection given by one volt 1724, when charged
 to the standard, we see that the irregularity has not been
 wholly eliminated. It appeared desirable to determine the
sensibility of the instrument for a lower known charge. The
charge was determined exactly as described above, and was
found to be 609 volts; whilst 1 volt gave 107-1 scale-divisions
 double deflection; whence in the equation
                              g_^{A-BC
                               T 1 + k02 °
we have, if
                    x=0:1816, k=7 x 107°,

          Observed     .   .   . . 250-2, 107.1, 1724,
which is well within errors of observation.
    This deviation from proportionality of sensibility did not
appear to be worth correcting, as I was not sure that other
small irregularities might not be introduced by raising the
needle above the middle position within the quadrants. It
appears probable that the small deviation still remaining does
not arise from the attraction of the quadrants on the needle
increasing the tension of the suspension, but from some cause
of a quite different nature, for if it were so caused the capacity
equations would be
             61=q11A—qigE-qssC–71, D+ 26C, &c.,

                Q, = -q14A-q2, B4 qualD.
   We are now in a position to determine the various coeffi
cients of capacity : in doing so it is necessary to distinguish
the values of q11 and q2, when the posts by which contact
with the quadrants is made are down and in contact with the
quadrants, and when they are raised up out of contact; the
former are denoted by qu-Ha and q22+a, the latter by qu and
qos, the capacity of the binding-posts being a. As a convenient
temporary unit of capacity the value of 81°, when the jar has
the standard charge, is taken. The first set of experiments
was to determine the deflections caused by known potentials
with varied charge of jar, one or other of the quadrants being
insulated. Three potentials of the jar were used—that of the
standard indicated by the idiostatic gauge and two lower. The
values of a are denoted by us, pia, p.1. It was found by con
necting the two quadrants to standard cells that

Suppose quadrant A be insulated, and potential B be applied
to quadrant B; then we have, if 6 be deflection which potential
B would cause with standard charge, if quadrant A were con
nected to the case, and q the observed deflection,

the two contact-posts to be of slightly different capacities; the

exist.

   The next experiment was similar, excepting only that the
insulated quadrant B was connected to a condenser; this con
denser consisted merely of a brass tube insulated within a
larger tube—its capacity is about 0:00009 microfarad. The
jar was at its standard charge. Calling the capacity of the
condenser b, in terms of our temporary unit, we have, as
before,           –6't at 7:2-q2           :=1

When 6=1259, † was observed to be 927, whence b=3:159,
   We are now in a position to obtain independent verifica
tion of the values already obtained for the constants. Suppose
A be connected to the case, that condenser b is charged from
a battery of known potential, such that it would give deflec
tion 6 if connected to B, and the charged condenser is then
connected to B. Suppose <U+017F>º be the deflection before con
nection is made, p after. Then
                 b(6–4)={qss--a+1}(p-NP).
When 6=1439 and Jº-0, it was found that p-915. The
value of b, calculated from the values of the constants already
obtained, is 928.
   When 6=1439 and Jº-–676, it was found that
$= +676; the calculated value is 688.
   A further experiment of verification, involving only the
capacity of the quadrant, is the following. The quadrant A
being connected to the case, B was charged by contact in
stantaneously made and broken with a battery of known
potential, and the resulting deflection was noted. The in
stantaneous contact being made by hand, no very great
 accuracy could be expected. Let }, and q be the readings on
 the scale before and after the instantaneous contact; then
                      *T*=–1––1345.

   We next determine the coefficients qia and qa, of induction
of the induction-plate on the quadrants. This is easily done
from the deflections obtained with the induction-plate, one or
both pairs of quadrants being insulated. First, suppose one
pair, say B, are insulated whilst A is connected to the case:—
                     0= + q22 B-q2, D–8pºp,
                     q = —pub,

the battery used would give if connected direct to the quad
rants, the needle having the standard charge. When 6 was
12,800 and pu-us, p was 418, whence q21–0.0504.
   In the same way A being insulated but B connected to
the case, q, was found to be 43-6, whence qu-0-00508.
   Again, when both quadrants are insulated we have
                   0= qua-gig B-q1, D+3.1%,

   The capacity qi, of the induction-plate is of no use; its
value, however, is about 0:004, in the same unit as has been
so far used.

   The capacity gas of the needle and the coefficient of in
duction of the needle on either quadrant #qas are also of no
use, but the method by which they may be obtained is worth
noting. Let quadrants A be connected to the case, and let
B be insulated, diminish the charge of the jar slightly by the
replenisher, and suppose the consequent deflection be ºb. Let
P. and u<U+017F> be the values of a before and after the diminution of
charge, as ascertained by applying a known potential-dif
ference between the two pairs of quadrants; we have

of no value for any instrument except that for which they are

 particular use of the instrument it is best to determine exactly
 that combination of constants which will be needed.       Nor is
 there anything new in principle in the discussion or expe
 riments here given; they are merely for the most part the
 application of well-known principles to methods of using the
 electrometer given by Sir William Thomson himself. The
 method of determining the capacity of a condenser by charging
 it and connecting it to an insulated quadrant has been used by
 Boltzmann. But the invention of the quadrant-electrometer
by Sir W. Thomson may be said to have marked an epoch in
Electrostatics, and the instrument from time to time finds new
 uses.   It therefore seems well worth while to make known
 observations made upon it in which the instrument itself has
 been the only object studied. Some practical conclusions
 may, however, be drawn from the preceding experiments.
 Before using the formula
                    0-x(A–B)(c-A."
 it is necessary to verify that it is sufficiently nearly true, or
 to determine its variation from accuracy. Unless it be
 sufficiently accurate through the range experimented upon,
 the electrometer cannot be applied by the methods well
 known for determining alternating potentials and the work
 done by alternating currents.
    My pupil, Mr. Paul Dimier, has very efficiently helped me
 in the execution of the experiments of verification.

XXXIV. The most Economical Potential-difference to employ
   with Incandescent Lamps. By Professors W. E. AYRTON,
   F.R.S., and JoHN PERRY, M.E.”
THE subject in connection with which the accompanying
       paper is a small contribution is one of considerable
commercial importance. It has long been known that the
luminous power of an electric lamp increased much more
rapidly than the power electrically expended on it; or, that
the number of candles per horse-power increased as the lamp
was made to become brighter and brighter. Perhaps the
earliest experiments on the subject were those published by
Sir William Thomson in 1881, and those made by our students
in 1880. Since that time (that is, during the last five years)
tests of the efficiency of various types of incandescent lamps
have been made over and over again by various persons,
without perhaps its being clearly realized that such efficiency
experiments by themselves gave us no idea of the commercial
value of any particular lamp.
   It is not sufficient to know that when a lamp is giving out
a certain number of candles it absorbs so much power per
candle, and when giving out a much larger number of candles
it absorbs so much less power per candle; but what must be
known in addition is the life of the lamp at each of these two
candle-powers, before we can decide whether it is more eco
nomical to use the lamp with the filament at not much more
than a dull red or when brilliantly luminous with a bluish tint.
For with the filament at a comparatively low temperature,
although the efficiency of the lamp is low, its life will be
great; whereas if the temperature of the filament be high, the
large efficiency will be to some extent balanced by its short
life and the consequent large cost due to lamp renewals.
    In the ‘Electrician’ for January 31st of this year M. Foussat
gives a table of values of the life of a 100-volt Edison lamp for
different potential-differences; and M. Foussat has assured us
that these numbers were obtained experimentally, and not from
calculation according to any theory. That the results should
lie so nearly in a curve is undoubtedly at first sight a little
striking; but if it be remembered that they are stated to
represent the results obtained from the averages of a very
extended series of tests, their great regularity is not more
striking than is a curve showing graphically the result of
mortality tables. We asked M. Foussat whether he had also
the results of experiments on the efficiency of the same type
of 100-volt lamps, as our own experiments on the efficiency
   * Communicated by the Physical Society, having been read at the
Meeting on February 28th, 1885.

 Potential-difference to employ with Incandescent Lamps. 305
of Edison lamps had been made with 55-, 108-, and 110-volt
lamps. As, however, he had no such results, and as his tests
of lives are the only ones that we now have, and possibly may
have, until the completion of the excellent work at present
being carried out by the Electric-Lighting Jury of the Health
Exhibition, we commenced this investigation by endeavouring
to combine the lives given by M. Foussat with the results
previously published for efficiency. To enable us to do this,
we assumed that the life of 1000 hours given by M. Foussat
for his 100-volt lamps when used with a potential-difference
of 100 volts would be the same as that for our 108-volt lamp
when employed with a potential-difference of 108 volts; or, in
other words, we regarded lives given by him as applicable to
our 108-volt Edison lamps when each of his potential-differ
                             108
ences was multiplied by 100'
    To ascertain the most economic potential-differences, we
 must proceed as follows:—Let f(v) be the life in hours as a
 function of the number of volts constantly kept on the lamps,
 6(v) the number of candles emitted by one lamp as a function
 of the potential-difference in volts employed, let p be the
 <U+017F>:     in pounds paid for one lamp, and n the number of
   ours per year that a lamp is kept burning; then
                                 p x m
                              f(v) x 60)
 stands for the cost per year per candle, as far as the renewal
 of lamps is concerned.
    Next, let H stand for the cost in pounds of an electric
 horse-power per year for the number of hours an electric
 horse-power is employed. It is often assumed that H is pro
 portional to the number of hours per day that the power is
 used, or that the yearly bill for power should be based on the
 horse-power hours, or total energy consumed ; but this idea,
 which runs even through the Electric Lighting Act, is quite
 an erroneous one. H will be of the form h-i-F(n), where h
 is a constant independent of the number of hours and depending
 on the rent of the site, capital expended upon engines, dynamos,
 leads, &c.; and F(n) is some function of the number of hours
 during which electric power is required, and depends on the cost
  of coal, superintendence, &c. If the light were only required
  for one or two hours in a district where rent was very high,
  h would be the all-important term and F(n) would be unim
  portant; whereas if the electric power were required for various
  purposes, for, say, 15 or 20 hours out of the 24, in a place
  where rent was low but coal dear, F(n) would be the important
  item in the yearly bill for electric power supplied.

      Let $(v) be the watts per candle, expressed as a function of
   the number of volts employed at the terminals of a lamp; then
                               H
                              is x*(t)
   represents the cost per year per candle as far as the production
   of electric power is concerned.
      The total cost, therefore, per year per candle is
                       x m        H

   and we must find the value of v that makes this a minimum.
      There are two ways in which such a problem can be solved:
   the one a graphical method, the other an analytical method.
   The former may be used by even elementary students, and will
  be given first. It consists in drawing curves to represent, 1st,
  f(v) in terms of v, 2nd, 6(v) in terms of r, and 3rd, d(v) in
  terms of v ; and from these the values of f(v), 6(v), and p(v)
  are each determined graphically for many values of v, and
  the value of A calculated for each of these values.      A fourth
  curve is then drawn, connecting the values of A with those
  of v, when it is easy to see by inspection for what value of v
  the expression A has a minimum value.
     The following is the result so obtained for the 108-volt
  Edison lamps used for lighting the Finsbury Technical
  College :
     p is taken at 5s, or £0.25;
     n as 560 hours, the time per year, approximately, during
           which the lamps are lighted ;
     H as £5 : this is perhaps a rather high estimate for the
          cost of power, considering that the interest on the
          steam-engine, dynamos, &c., price of coal burnt, wages
          of the engine-driver and stoker, have to be mainly
          debited to the driving of the College workshops, sup
          plying power for the dynamos worked for experimental
          purposes; but it will be accurate enough to take the sum
          of ''. per year as representing yearly interest on extra
          plant and the yearly interest on the extra cost of sup
          plying one electric horse-power during the 560 hours.
    Then the value of v which makes A a minimum turns out
 to be about 106 volts; and on account of the flatness of the
 curve connecting the expression A with v, we see that in this
 particular case the annual cost of supplying light is only in
 creased by 3.5 per cent., if the potential-difference between the
mains be kept diminished to about 104.8 or kept up to about
108 violts. Also, that keeping the potential-difference dimi
nished to about 104.5, or #º to about 108.5 volts,
increases our total annual cost of lighting by 5 per cent.

Potential-difference to employ with Incandescent Lamps. 307
   More recently one of our students, Mr. Robertson, has
been making efficiency-experiments on some Edison lamps
obtained from France ; and by trial he has found some that
give 16 candles at about 100 volts, and are therefore pre
sumably of the same type as those employed in the life
experiments given by M. Foussat in the ‘Electrician’ for
January 31st.
    Mr. Robertson's results from one such lamp are as
follow:—

               40             115.2           122-11
   We are therefore now in a position to take up the problem
in a more direct manner, without making any assumption
beyond this—that Mr. Robertson's 16-candle 100-volt French
Edison lamp is of the same kind as M. Foussat's 16-candle
 100-volt French Edison lamp.
    Solving the problem graphically, in the way previously
described, and using the same values of p, n, and H–viz.
cost of a lamp 5s., number of hours of burning per year 560,
and annual cost of an electric horse-power for those 560 hours
£5,-we obtain the curve AAA to represent the cost per
candle per year as regards renewal of lamps, B B B the cost
per candle per year as regards power, and the resultant curve
 C C C as the total cost per candle per year.
    The minimum value of this cost appears from the curve
 CCC to be at about 101.4 volts, and to equal about 11d. per
 candle per year. If the potential-difference be maintained
 constantly down at 98.7 volts, or up at 104 volts, then the
cost becomes 18, per candle per year. It will also be seen
 from the curves that the yearly cost for renewals of lamps is

but a small fraction of the total yearly cost, as long as we are
using potential-differences of not more than about 100 volts;
so that when using, with these lamps, this or a lower potential
difference, the actual sum paid for the lamps is not so very
serious an item in the yearly lighting bill. But if, on the
other hand, we maintain a       §ºtiºn.                of, say, 104

  Potential-difference to employ with Incandescent Lamps. 309
volts constantly at the terminals, then the lamp renewals
represent, in our particular case, nearly one third of the
yearly expenditure, and consequently any change in the price
of lamps becomes extremely important.
    We find that the simplest expression for the candle-power
of this incandescent lamp in terms of volts is
                        6(v)= a(v–b)".       . . . . . . (1)
Thus, for example, it will be found that if the cube roots of
the values of 6(v), given in the preceding table, are plotted
with the corresponding values of v as º: of points on
squared paper, the points lie in no regular curve so nearly as
in a straight line, discrepancies being apparently due to
errors of observation, and these errors of observation follow
a periodic law which may be of interest physiologically. Or
it may be that there really is a point of inflexion in the curve.
    For the particular lamp in question we find that
                         a=0.0002621,
                         b=62:12;
or, if the law remains true for a less number of volts than 84,
the lowest used in this experiment, then when v =62:12, the
candle-power is zero.
    We do not, however, find that the cube roots of the candle
powers of all sorts of incandescent lamps follow a line-function
 of the difference of potential at their terminals; for on exami
 ning the results of experiments that have been made with
various types of lamps, we find that with the first five of the
 following set of lamps the law
                           */6(b) ov—b
 is very nearly true.

     We may here mention that we have found the following plan
 very useful in helping us to draw correctly a curve at a place

310 Professors Ayrton and Perry on the most Economical
where there is a sudden bend and an absence of points, deter
 mined from experiments to guide us in drawing the curve.
 Instead of plotting w and y, and obtaining a curve which it
would be very difficult to draw correctly, we may by using
 some simple function of y obtain points which obviously
lie in a curve which it is easy to draw. Thus we may plot
  My and w, or Vy and r, or logy and a. When the curve
connecting y and a is not roughly asymptotic to the axis of r,
but to some line parallel to this axis, it is obvious that there
is a greater likelihood of obtaining simple curves by plotting
  My Fa and r, or Wy:F2 and w, or log (yia) and r, where
a is some constant obtainable by inspection, than by simply
plotting the function of y alone.

with considerable accuracy the equation

and these minimum values of v agree very closely with that
previously determined graphically.
   One very important problem in connection with incandescent
lamps, and one that cannot yet be regarded as solved, is the
determination of the life of a lamp for any given number of
volts, from experiments made either on the efficiencies at
several different potentials, or from experiments on the life
made at so high a potential-difference that the life will be
short, and the experiment made therefore in a comparatively
short time.
    If, however, an expression of the form
                         f(e)=10°-"
can be regarded as representing with sufficient accuracy the
 law of life for all º     of incandescent lamps, then if sufficient
experiments be made with a number of lamps at each of two
different potential-differences to enable us to determine the
average life at each of these potential-differences, the constants
a and b can be calculated from the equation, and hence the
 value of f(v), the life, calculated for any other potential
 difference.
    In connection with this investigation we have endeavoured,
 with the aid of one of our Assistants, Mr. Walmsley, to ascer
 tain whether some form of ordinary cheap candle could be
 used, at any rate for rough photometric measurements, in
 place of the much dearer      º,               and, as far as the
 following results obtained with seven candles selected at
 random from a packet of No. 8 sperm-candles go, it would
 seem that these candles do not differ so very much more in
 intensity from one another than standard candles are said to
 do. Of course many more experiments on this subject must
 be made before the possibility of using cheap candles as a
 rough standard can be decided on, but in the meantime the
 following experiments may be interesting.
    This particular type of candle, No. 8 sperm, and costin
  11d. per pound, was selected, because such candles were ...i
 to resemble in thickness the standard candles that we have
 been accustomed to use, and which cost 2s. 9d per pound.

 ON THE LIMIT OF THE DENSITY AND ON THE ATOMIC VOLUME
    OF GASES, AND PARTICULARLY OXYGEN AND HYDROGEN.                   BY
    E. H. AMAGAT.
THE        recent researches on the density of liquid oxygen by
       MM. Cailletet and Hautefeuille, Pictet, and by Wroblewski,
have led to values all of which are less than unity, in the different
conditions in which this density has been determined. It has been
concluded from this that, in agreement with the previsions of
Dumas, it will be equal to unity under a sufficiently powerful
pressure, or a sufficiently low temperature, and that accordingly
the quotient of the atomic weight by the density, or the atomic
volume, would be virtually the same for oxygen, sulphur, selenium,
and tellurium.
   In my second memoir on the compressibility of gases under
strong pressures (Annales de Chimie et de Physique, 5th series,
vol. xxii. 1881), I showed that at sufficiently high temperatures
the law of the compressibility of gases is ultimately represented by
straight lines which correspond to the ratio p-(v-a)=constant,
which at once gives the limiting volume a for p equal to infinity,
and therefore the limiting density; and that for lower pressures
the curves, starting from a considerable pressure, exhibit a portion
which is virtually rectilinear, and by which we can calculate, though
with less certainty, the limiting volume”.
   * In this memoir I have used the term atomic volume to denote the
value of a in reference to one litre of gas at zero, and under a pressure
of 76 centims. I make this observation to avoid any confusion.          -

314           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
   For oxygen and nitrogen the direction of the rectilinear parts is
not yet sufficiently marked, and to obtain it far higher pressures
must be obtained than has hitherto been the case.           With this
view I have constructed apparatus in which I have been able
to compress gas to about 4000 atms. Two accidents in succession
have hitherto prevented me from making regular numerical
determinations; but I may already announce the following result:—
I have frequently reduced oxygen to the nine-hundredth of its
volume; in these conditions its density was far higher than that
of water; with the greatest pressure I could produce, density
was higher than 1:25, and this when the surrounding temperature
was 17°; we must therefore abandon the idea of unity as a
limiting density.
   Compared with hydrogen, numbers are given as the density of
this body in the liquid state which present such extraordinary
differences that I shall not attempt to discuss them. The limiting
density, as deduced from my own experiments, is very nearly equal
to 0-12. Referring to the curve of L. Meyer, it follows that the top
of the ordinate which represents the atomic volume of hydrogen
will be on the prolongation of the curve, passing through the tops
of lithium, of sodium, and of potassium. This would enable us, in
conformity with the ideas of Dumas, to assume between this body
and lithium a period analogous to those which succeed, but in
which, it is true, no known body could be placed.
   The two accidents mentioned above appear to me to present
sufficient interest to be noticed. In one of the experiments the
gas-manometer was contained in a cylinder of cast steel with very
thick sides, and with mercury in the bottom. All at once a
screeching sound was heard, and a jet of pulverized mercury was
shot through the right section of the breach, striking the base of the
apparatus, and bounding off to more than 1 metre in all directions,
producing the same sound as steam escaping from a high-pressure
boiler; the section showed no defect when seen under the micro
scope. We have therefore before us the classical experiment of
the mercurial rain in the form of a true jet of mercury passing
through the pores of steel through a thickness of 0.08 metre. The
pressure was certainly at least 4000 atmospheres; the same appa
ratus under the same pressure does not allow a drop of glycerine
to pass; this is probably the case also for water and other liquids.
   Another apparatus, a solid block of steel with a closer grain,
weighing 116 kilog., was split parallel to the axes of the cylinder,
and although there was neither projection, nor even separation of
the parts any more than a sudden entrance of the gas, the fracture
took place with extreme violence; the mercury escaped through
the crack, as I had time to observe, in the form of a bright plane
vertical metallic sheet of 0-06 to 0.07 metre in breadth.
   Among other apparatus which I have used for measuring
  ressure, I may mention a manometer of Desgoffe's, in which I have
introduced the improvement already pointed out by M. Meraud
Deprey for piston-manometers.       This apparatus should give ex

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.           315
  cellent results; I do not know within what limits of pressure it
  can be employed.
     The measurement of the volumes of gas has been made by various
  methods, one of which, based on the use of electrical currents,
  was communicated to me by Professor Tait of Edinburgh; I shall
  :* it in my next communication.—Comptes Rendus, March 2,
  ON THE ELECTROMOTIVE ACTION OF ILLUMINATED SELENIUM,
     DISCOVERED BY MR. FRITTS OF NEW YORK.                BY WERNER
     SIEMENS.
     Mr. Fritts, of New York, sent me last summer a description of
  his method of preparing selenium plates sensitive to light, which
  differs from mine in many essential points, and he also sent some
  of the plates he had prepared. Unlike mine *, they do not consist
  of parallel platinum wires which are imbedded in a thin layer of
  selenium, but of a thin homogeneous layer of selenium which is
  spread on a metal plate, and after being heated, to convert the
  amorphous into crystalline selenium, is coated with fine gold-leaf.
  Mr. Fritts found that the green light which has passed through
  the gold leaf increases the electrical conductivity of the selenium
-
  which it traverses. In fact the conductivity of the selenium plate
  between the gold-leaf and the metal base is increased from 20 to
  200 times as much, when the sun's rays fall vertically upon it.
  And even when illuminated by diffused light, the action is greater
  with Mr. Fritts's preparation than with my own. One of the
  plates sent exhibited no sensitiveness to light, but had another
  and highly remarkable property, namely, that a galvanometer
  interposed between the gold-leaf and the base plate indicates the
  existence of an electrical current in the same direction as the
  motion of the light, as long as the gold-leaf is illuminated. I
  imagined at first that this current was not permanent, but resem
  bled a polarization-current which only continued until the molecular
  modification of the selenium by the illumination was complete; and
  my first experiment appeared to support this assumption. More
  recent and more thorough experiments have convinced me that
  this supposition was erroneous. We are here dealing with a
  phenomenon which is of the greatest scientific importance. My
  experiments have shown that when the gold-leaf is illuminated, a
  difference of potential is established, which apparently is propor
  tional to the light and which lasts as long as the illumination.
  Obscure thermal rays do not act as electromotors, and accordingly
  the assumption that the action is thermoelectric is excluded. Mr.
  Fritts assumes that the waves of light which penetrate the selenium
  are directly converted into electrical currents, and this view is

     favoured by the proportionality of the strength of the current to the
     intensity of light. This resulted approximately from the experi
     ments collated in the following table:—

          The luminosity was determined by means of a Bunsen's photo
     meter, and the strength of the current was determined by the
     deflection of a delicate reflecting-galvanometer.
          When the gold-leaf was exposed to illumination from the south
     east side of the unclouded sky, while the sun itself was hidden by
      adjacent high buildings, the measurements given in the following
      table were obtained.

           It follows from this that the electromotive force of the selenium
      plate increased pretty regularly from the morning at 9.30 to mid
      day at 11.35, and then remained constant with some variations,
      after which it decreased pretty regularly to 3 o'clock.
           Mr. Fritts is unable to offer any explanation as to the reason
      why some plates become better conductors, and some act as elec
      tromotors; he complains of the uncertainty in the preparation of
      the selenium plates, the properties of which cannot be foreseen,
       and he gives various methods of dealing with them, by which
       plates which are often inactive maybe used. . More thorough investi
      gations will therefore be necessary to establish what is due to the
      electromotive action of light on many selenium plates. Neverthe
       less the existence of a single selenium plate with the properties
       described is a fact of the greatest scientific importance, for here we
      meet for the first time with an instance of the direct conversion
       of the energy of light into electrical energy.—Sitzungsberichte der

XXXVI. Notes on the Use of Nicol's Prism. By JAMES C.
   M'ConneL, B.A., Assistant Demonstrator at the Cavendish
   Laboratory, Cambridge".
1. On the Error in the Measurement of a Rotation of the Plane
   of Polarization caused by the Avis, about which the Nicol
   turns, not being parallel to the Incident Light.
Su<U+017F>º.           we have a beam of parallel light traversing a
      Nicol's prism mounted in a graduated circle. Unless
we have taken special precautions, we shall find that, when
the Nicol is rotated, the plane of polarization of the emergent
light turns through an angle somewhat different from that
measured by the circle. . For instance, if the axis of rotation
of the Nicol is inclined 3° to the direction of the incident or
emergent light, as large an error as 1° may be made in mea
suring a rotation of 60°.
   It is, however, tolerably well known that, as far as this
error is proportional to the first power of the small angle of
deviation, it may be eliminated by taking the mean of the
readings in the two opposite positions of the Nicol circle
separated from one another by nearly two right angles. It
is of course only to a first approximation that this propor
tionality can be considered to hold good. And the main object
of the present investigation is to determine, what is the out
standing error we are liable to in assuming this proportionality;
or, in other words, with what accuracy we must adjust the
Nicol circle, that this first approximation may be sufficient.

3.18             Mr. J. C. M'Connel's Notes on
   The phenomenon in its simplest form may be described
thus:–If the emergent ray be parallel to the long edges of
the prism it is polarized in a plane perpendicular to the prin
cipal plane of the prism, i. e. to the plane containing the optic
axis and the normal to the face. If the ray be inclined to this
position but still lie in the principal plane, then the new plane
of polarization is as nearly parallel to the old one as is con
sistent with its containing the new ray. This indeed is
obvious from symmetry. But now let the ray lean out of the
principal plane : there is a marked change in the plane of
polarization. It has been twisted about the ray, and the angle
of twist is nearly one third of the angle of deviation. From
this explanation it is easy to see in a general way how the
error arises, and also how it may be eliminated          §  taking
readings in the two opposite positions of the Nicol.
    There is another important point that is apparent on the
face of the matter. If the direction of the ray coincide with
the axis of rotation, the ray will not move relatively to the
 º      when the prism is turned, and the rotation measured
  y the circle will be identical with the actual rotation of the
plane of polarization. We shall find, moreover, that to the
second order of approximation the final error depends entirely
on the angle between these two directions (see equation 8).
It is independent of any reasonably small errors in the adjust
ment of the Nicol in the circle.                      -
    In a Nicol's prism used as a po-                Fig. 1.    X
larizer, it is the second half of the
prism that determines the plane of
Fº             of the emergent light.
  f the optic axis of the spar in the
first half be not accurately parallel to

    Let P(a, be the plane of polarization of P' and PP'v-x.
 Then X is a function of P'P and PN.
    The exact function would be a very complicated expression,
 so we shall content ourselves with an approximation. PP is
always small, and P lies near some fixed point, Po say, in the
plane XN. Let
                        PP=a, PP,-8.
    We shall reject the cubes and higher powers of a and 8
and limit ourselves to expanding x as far as the squares. We
know that when a is zero, X is zero; so our expression can
only contain the terms a, a”, and 28.
      n a Nicol's prism it is the extraordinary ray which emerges,
so the plane .." polarization of Q' is perpendicular to Q'X.
Let us assume for the present that the plane of polarization
of P’ makes the same angle with the plane of incidence P'Q'N
as does the plane of polarization of Q'. The plane of polari
zation of Q makes with P'Q'N an angle 90°–NQ'X. Hence

     In the foregoing we have assumed that there is no rotation
  of the plane of polarization on refraction out of the spar, or,
  in other words, that the angle between the plane of polariza
  tion and the plane of incidence remains unchanged. There
  is of course a change, but it is merely due to the disturbing
  effect of reflection and is very small. If we treat the spar as

                    the Use of Nicol's Prism.                321
a homogeneous medium and use Fresnel's formulae, we find
the rotation is about 005 a in the case of an ordinary Nicol.
   I have calculated from Neumann's theoretical formulae for
refraction at the surface of crystals what the rotation would
be in the case of light entering the Nicol and exciting only
the extraordinary wave, and find it is less than with a i.
geneous medium. In the case of light leaving the Nicol
there are two reflected waves, so the formulae would pro
bably be very complicated. I think we may safely assume
that the rotation is less than .012, and may therefore be
neglected. In the case of a flat-ended Nicol the incidence is
nearly direct, and the rotation may obviously be neglected.
   Owing to the circumstance that this rotation is negligible,
the j. of this investigation applies without alteration to
the case when the Nicol is used as an analyzer, and the light
is consequently incident on the spar. In this case we have to
find the position of the plane of polarization that only the
ordinary wave may be excited, and the formula for the rotation
is the same as in an isotropic medium.
   We are now in possession of a convenient formula for ex
pressing the position of the plane of polarization in terms of
the direction of the emergent light relative to fixed planes in
the Nicol. We shall apply this formula to the discussion of
the error in measuring a rotation. This part of the investiga
tion would be very short if we confined ourselves to the first ap
proximation. A number of com-                Fig. 2.

   NP the principal plane,
   P' the emergent wave-normal,

This fixes Po, which has hitherto
been arbitrary within certain
limits.   A and P' are fixed in
space, while N and Po are ro

   For simplicity,    suppose
circle-reading  is zero  when theP'           K
lies on A Po. Then 6= Poa P' is the reading at any time.

so let a PK="). As before, let P/P= a, PPo–8, and let

   To render these formulae intelligible to one who has not
read through the investigation, we may remark that we
have to deal with one plane fixed in space, viz. the plane con
taining the axis of rotation of the Nicol circle and the direction
of the emergent light.
    6 and 180°--6, are the readings of the circle in the two
ºppo<U+017F>ite positions, and 6–0 when the principal plane of the
Nicol is at right angles to the fixed plane.
    * is the angle between the plane of polarization and the
fixed plane.
    a is the angle between the axis of rotation and the principal
plane.
    r is the angle between the axis of rotation and the emergent
light.
   *The angles are supposed to be expressed in circular measure
in these as in all the other formulae.
     The first term on the right-hand side of equation (8) is
 a constant, and is therefore of no consequence in measuring
 a change of Jº. The second term is a measure of the out
 standing error.                                         -
     Let us suppose
                          r=3°, y=30°.
 Then
                          ‘24r” sin lºcos y = 1/;
 but if k = –30°,
                          the same= –1'.
     So in measuring a rotation of 60° we may be subject to an
 error of 2' if the axis of rotation be inclined to the emergent
 light at an angle of 3°. To make sure that the error shall be
 less than 1", the last-mentioned angle must be kept within 2°.
     Equation (9) affords the means of deducing the value of r
 from the difference of readings in the two opposite positions.
     The second term of (8) is due to two main causes. One is
 that the rotation of the plane of polarization takes place about
  one axis, while the rotation is measured about another.      The
 effect of this appears in the coefficient – #. The other part of
 the error is due to the values of X in the two opposite posi
 tions not exactly neutralizing each other. This appears in
  the coefficient m—l”.      If these two causes had reinforced
  instead of counteracting one another, the resultant error would
  have been five times as large.

324              Mr. J. C. M'Connel's Notes on
   If the arrangements permit of taking readings when the
plane of polarization is inclined at 90° to its two first positions,
we can, by taking the mean of all four readings, get rid of
the error depending on the squares of small quantities, as is
evident from (8). This is what Lord Rayleigh has done in
his recent measurements of the electromagnetic rotation in
bisulphide of carbon.                            Fig. 3.

   The formula (6) applies to almost

So the numbers are almost exactly the same as in the case of
the ordinary Nicol.
   As a test of the accuracy of the above calculations, I made
a few observations on a flat-ended Nicol. I found that, turn
ing the Nicol through 30', about an axis in the principal plane

and at right angles to the incident light, turned the plane of
polarization through 11/+1'.
   In a paper on Polarizing Prisms (Phil. Mag. 1883) Mr.
Glazebrook has suggested a new form of flat-ended prism in
which the axis of the spar is at right angles to the length of
the prism. In this case XN = 90°, and u = 1°49.
                         ... la 0, m = -73,
                             m—l”—# = -23.
So instead of equation (8) we have
                          64-6,
                             2   — = 23r” sin i<U+017F> cos ),
and the outstanding error is substantially the same as before.
   Equation (9) appears to be inconsistent with a result ob
tained by Mr. Glazebrook (Phil. Mag. Oct. 1880, p. 252).
For the sake of simplicity, he supposed the ordinary ray only
to emerge from the crystal. He examined two positions of the
Nicol. First the emergent ray lay in the principal plane, so
that the plane of polarization coincided with the principal plane.
Next he supposed the Nicol to be turned through 90° about
an axis, lying in the principal plane, but inclined at 5° to the
emergent ray, and he found that now the plane of polarization
was inclined at 5°3' to the principal plane. But this does
not show that the plane of polarization has been turned through
90°,+ 5° 3' about the direction of the ray, as is evident on
 examination of the annexed figure.
    P' is, as before, the emergent light; N, N', X, X’ are the
two positions of the normal to the face and the axis.

326               Mr. J. C. M'Connel's Notes on
   In the first position the plane of polarization is P’ A N X.
   In the second position let it be P’ K.
   Mr. Glazebrook finds P'KA=5°3'.
   The angle, however,that we wish to find, is the angle through
which the plane of polarization has been turned about the
direction of the ray, viz. A P' K, and this, of course, is not
equal to 90°–P' K.A.
   After I had written the greater part of this paper, I found
that the ground had been already traversed by Sande Bak
huyzen (Pogg. Ann. cxlv. p. 259, 1872). His investigation
is  ...;          longer than mine, and he only examines the
case of the ordinary Nicol. He obtains results of the same
  eneral form; but he <U+017F>alls into at least one serious error; so
 is numerical values are quite different. Instead of assuming,
as I have done, that the rotation of the plane of polarization
on refraction out of the crystal is negligible, he uses a com
plicated formula, giving directly the     º       of the plane of
polarization of the incident ray in which only the extraordinary
ray is excited in the crystal. This formula he has apparently
deduced from a formula given by Neumann (Pogg. Ann. xlii.
p. 11). And it is here that the error occurs. ife has not
paid sufficient attention to Neumann’s explanation of how
the quantities in the formula are to be measured. He puts 8
for a ; whereas he should put 8–7 for o. Making this cor
rection in his equation (5), we find all the terms in the deno
minator are of one sign, and the value of tan A is consider
ably diminished. We find, too, that 90°–A is practically the
same as the angle between the plane of incidence and the plane
of polarization in the crystal, which is what I have assumed.
   }. this very same operation Bakhuyzen falls into another
mistake. He is considering the case of light emerging from
the Nicol, while he uses the formula for light entering the
crystal. Even with glass this would have been wrong; but
with crystal the cases are totally distinct, for when light is
refracted out of the crystal there are two reflected rays instead
of only one.
   It may not be out of place here to describe a simple method
for testing the necessary adjustment, which I lately found
convenient. In my arrangement (fig. 5) the source of light
was an illuminated slit A, whence the light passed through a
lens B, placed so that the slit was at its º        focus. Thus
a parallel beam of light fell on the polarizing Nicol C. To the
Nicol circle I attached a plane mirror D as nearly as possible
at right angles to the axis of rotation. Between B and D, I
interposed a lens E at a distance of half its focal length from
D. An image of the slit is thus formed at a on the surface

                    the Use of Nicol's Prism.                 327
of the lens E, or rather on a scrap of paper attached to it.
The image a of course remains at the same point on the paper,
however the lens E is moved laterally in its own plane. On
 rotating the Nicol circle I found that a did not move ; so I
knew that the mirror was at right angles to the axis of rota
 tion. I then adjusted the Nicol circle till the middle point of
the image of the slit fell on the optical centre of the lens,
 which f had previously marked on the paper. If I had
chosen a wrong point as the optical centre, the error would
have been at once evident on turning the lens E through 180°
 in its own plane. This method gave without much difficulty
 an accuracy of 1°, with a lens E of only 4 inches focal length.
     2. On a new Method of obtaining the Zero-reading of a
                           .Nicol Circle.
    In a large class of experiments on polarized light, it is
 necessary to know the reading of the N. circle when the
 plane of polarization is parallel to the axis of rotation of some
 part of the apparatus, e.g. of the table of a spectrometer. The
 usual method of obtaining this reading depends on the pola
 rizing power of a glass reflecting surface. It is easy to fix
 the surface on the spectrometer-table parallel to the axis of
 rotation. If the angle of incidence be made that of maximum
 polarization, and the Nicol turned till the reflected light is
 reduced to a minimum, the plane of polarization is then per
 pendicular to the plane of incidence. This method is simple,
 but it is not very sensitive. Even with poor illumination the
 minimum reflected light is, with glass at any rate, by no
 means evanescent; and as the      N. is turned the intensity
 remains sensibly constant for some distance on either side of
 the minimum point. The sensitiveness, too, does not increase,
 but rather falls off with a more powerful light.
    The method I am about to describe is nearly as simple;
 and, as it depends on the crossing of two Nicols, its sensi
 tiveness is only limited by the power of the source of light.
 In its simplest form the process is as follows:—An auxiliary
 Nicol is fixed on the table of the spectrometer, the polarizer
 turned till the light is quenched, and the reading taken.

328               Mr. J. C. M'Connel’s     Notes On.
Then the table of the spectrometer is turned through two
right angles—the axis of rotation having been previously set
perpendicular to the incident light—the light quenched, and
the reading taken again. The plane of polarization now leans
as much to one side of the avis as it did before to the other.
So the mean of the two readings is the reading when the
plane of polarization is parallel to the axis of rotation of the
table.
   The above is of course only a general explanation. The
statement in italics requires fuller examination, and we shall
find that it is only strictly true when the Nicol is symmetrical.
Let us, then, first suppose that the Nicol is perfectly symme
trical—that is, that the two faces are parallel and the optic
axes of the two halves coincident. We shall assume through
out the investigation that the axis of rotation is accurately
  erpendicular to the incident light. In the previous note we
}. carefully determined the position of the plane of pola
rization in terms of the direction of the emergent light, and
we have shown that, to a very close approximation, it is at
right angles to that position of the plane of polarization of
light incident along the same path which gives complete
extinction in the Nicol. The discrepancy was shown to be
negligible. So there is no ambiguity in speaking of the
plane of polarization of either half of the Nicol for a particular
direction of the light.
   In the first position of our Nicol on the spectrometer, the
emergent light is parallel to the incident, and the planes of
polarization of the two halves are also parallel. The axis of
rotation, too, is at right angles to the incident º:     Imagine,
then, a line fixed relatively to the Nicol to be drawn from the
second face parallel to the emergent light. When the Nicol
has been rotated through two right angles, this line becomes
again parallel to the incident light, and the plane of polari
zation of the second half of the Nicol now leans exactly as
much to one side of the axis of rotation as the plane of pola
rization of the first half leant before to the other. The process
therefore is so far strictly accurate.
   Secondly, let us suppose that the Nicol, though not sym
metrical, yet produces no angular deviation on light traversing
it. We have seen in the previous note that the plane of pola
rization of a Nicol is nearly at right angles to the principal
plane, and that to a first approximation the small deviation is
proportional to the angle between the external light and the
principal plane.
   Let Xn, Xin, be the principal planes of the two halves.
       B, B, their poles.
       P the direction of incident and emergent light.

    Draw B m at right angles to B P and Bim at right angles
to B m. We may assume that BB, is very small and BP
                              Fig. 6.         X1
nearly a right angle. The angle between the planes of
polarization of the two halves is composed of two parts, of
 which one, BPB1, is approximately equal to Bm, and the other
 is approximately proportional to the difference between Pni
and P n and therefore to Blm. So the angle is independent
of small variations in the position of P, and is therefore a
constant for each particular Nicol. In some Nicols, as we go
from one half to the other, the plane of polarization is turned
in the direction of a right-handed screw. These we may call
right-handed Nicols with a certain rotation-angle. Supposing,
then, our auxiliary Nicol is right-handed, the plane of the
 second half leans at first too much to the right, but, when the
 Nicol has been rotated through 180°, it leans too much to the
 left. The correct reading in the case of a right-handed Nicol
is therefore that obtained by turning the Nicol circle from
the mean reading through half the rotation-angle in the right
 handed direction.
    The question now arises, how we are to determine the rota
 tion-angle. The following process explains itself. Place the
 auxiliary Nicol B on the path of the light from the polarizer
 A, which is mounted in a graduated circle. Turn A till the
  light is quenched and take a reading. Then turn A so as to
  allow the light to pass through B, and place in the path of
  the light from B a third Nicol C. Adjust C. till the light
  from B is quenched. Remove B, cross C with A, and read
  again.

330              Mr. J. C. M'Connel’s Notes on
    So far the matter is tolerably simple, but if the Nicol
produce deviation of the light complications are introduced.
                               Fig. 7.

    The figure represents a flat-ended Nicol B traversed by a
 ray of light PLMP1. The argument, however, is perfectly
 general. A small error is due to the Nicol C having to deal
 first with light, parallel to MP, and afterwards with light
 parallel to P. P." This may be eliminated by taking two
 readings, the Nicol B in the interval having been turned
 through two right angles or thereabouts about L. M. The
 mean thus # gives us the position of the plane of polari
 zation of PL, which is most nearly parallel to the plane of
 polarization of MPI. We know nothing about the plane of
 polarization of light which issues parallel to M P. Clearly
 therefore, when our Nicol is mounted on the spectrometer
 table, we ought not to turn it exactly through 180°, but we
 ought to turn it till the incident light is related to the face
 M in the same way as P, M was at first.
    We have then this practical rule.         Place the auxiliary
 Nicol on the spectrometer in such a position that the deviation
 lies wholly in the plane of rotation. To get the second
 reading, turn the table in the direction of the deviation through
 an angle equal to 180° less the deviation. Correct the mean
 of the two readings by half the rotation-angle as before.
     Thus we are able to get an accurate value of the zero
 reading in spite of the dissymmetry of the Nicol and the
 deviation of the light, provided only the two faces of the
 Nicol are good planes. We have been compelled, however,
 to limit ourselves to first approximations. On this point it is
 to be noticed that the outstanding error is due to two causes,
 the inaccuracy of adjustment of the auxiliary Nicol, and the
 dissymmetry of the Nicol itself. The latter we may assume
 to be very small; while the former has very slight effect.
  It only comes in as a secondary cause, for if the dissymmetry
 were removed the outstanding error would be zero. Hence it
 is not necessary in  º       to take elaborate precautions about
 the setting of the Nicol in the determination either of the
 zero-reading or of the rotation-angle. If great accuracy be

                  the Use of Nicol's Prism.                   331
required, it will be sufficient to attach permanently to the
Nicol a small reflecting surface, and make this always perpen
dicular to the incident light. The planes of polarization of
both halves will then be perfectly definite.
   I have treated the method as applied to a Nicol used as
polarizer, but it is by no means restricted to this case. The
polarizer may be any kind of polarimeter, or if necessary the
polarimeter may be the analyzer, while the auxiliary Nicol is
used as polarizer. The method occurred to me when I was
engaged on some observations on the refraction of polarized
light at the surface of Iceland spar. I will describe the
arrangements in so far as they bear on the matter in hand;
for, as it happened, they gave a very high degree of accuracy
in the determination of the zero-reading.
    As my source of light I employed part of the filament of a
Swan incandescent lamp. I selected a straight piece, and cut
off the light from the rest of the filament with a diaphragm
placed immediately in front of the lamp. The filament was
placed at the principal focus of a lens, from which the light
passed to the polarizing Nicol. Then came the spectrometer,
from which the collimator had been dismounted; so only the
telescope remained. When the telescope was focussed for
infinity and directed towards the light, a sharply defined
image of the selected portion of the filament was seen. The
top and bottom limits of the image were not hard lines, owing
 to the diaphragm not being quite at the principal focus of the
 collimating lens. They were, however, sufficiently definite
 for practical purposes.
    It was necessary for my other observations that the axis of
 rotation of the spectrometer should be set at right angles to
 the light coming from the middle of the filament. I accom
 plished this in the following manner.         I first mounted a
 reflecting surface on the table of the spectrometer, and ad
 justed it to be parallel to the axis of rotation. This may be
 done with accuracy although the telescope be tilted. Next I
 adjusted the axis of the telescope to be at right angles to this
 surface, by   <U+017F>º       the cross wires to coincide with their
 image formed by reflection at the surface. Then I removed
  the reflecting surface, directed the telescope towards the
 light, and tilted the spectrometer till the cross wires coincided
  with the middle of the image.
     When the auxiliary Nicol was mounted on the spectrometer
  table and the polarizer turned past the crossed position, the
  image of the filament by no means entirely disappeared ; but
  a patch of nearly complete extinction moved down the image
  from the top to the bottom. This was of course to be expected,
  since different positions of the image correspond to different

332               On the Use of Nicol's Prism.
directions through the Nicols, and therefore to different posi
tions of the two planes of polarization. The reading was
taken when the patch was halfway down the slit. This
method of reading proved to be very sensitive. Without any
special care I could get a number of successive readings
whose greatest difference was 1'. This was quite sufficient
for my purposes. Indeed my verniers were only graduated
to 1'. But I am convinced that a far higher degree of sensi
tiveness could be reached if desired, by proceeding on the
same lines.
   In  º; great accuracy          two precautions become very
important. The source of light should be of uniform bright
ness. Here a well-made carbon filament is nearly perfect.
Again, as much light should reach the eye from the top of
the filament as from the bottom, abstraction being made of
course of what is stopped by the polarizing properties of the
Nicols.   For this it is convenient that the lateral throw of
the Nicols should be as small as possible. Flat-ended Nicols
are therefore to be preferred. But if a pair of Nicols were
made for the purpose, it would be easy so to slant the faces
that the extraordinary ray should go straight through, and
there should be no lateral throw.
   The incandescent lamp is a more powerful source of light
for this purpose than is perhaps at first sight apparent. #.
it may be º that with a given slit and object-glass the
intensity of the illumination of the surface of the first Nicol
depends solely on the intrinsic brightness of the source of
light. The filament is practically a slit with the source of
light brought into contact with it, so there is no difficul
about the whole of the surface of the Nicol being illuminated,
and the illumination is just as powerful as would be given by
a. º       sheet of the same brightness half an inch broad
placed a little distance behind a slit. The intrinsic brightness
of the filament of a Swan lamp is many times greater than
that of a good gas-flame viewed edgeways. Besides, even if
the gas-flame be placed very close to the slit, it is only the
nearer portion of the flame that illuminates the whole surface
of the Nicol. The further portion only lights up a narrow
strip in the middle of the surface.
   I used two flat-ended Nicols, belonging to Mr. Glazebrook,
of about half an inch aperture. One of these, which gave an
angular throw of 15', had a left-handed rotation-angle of 38.

XXXVII. Electromagnets.-III. Iron and Steel. New Theory
   of Magnetism. By R. H. M. BosanquET, St. John's College,
    Oaford.
    To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,
IN      the February number of the Philosophical Magazine
       (p. 73) I gave a number of experiments on the Perme
ability (u) of Iron and Steel, with empirical formulae founded
on Fourier's Series. I also gave the elements of a new theory
leading to equations of the form
                      Au-A(l; , –13) cos 8,
                      8=f3,

                     $– p     Tsin 9
and gave the comparison of this theory with experiment in
the cases of Crown (soft bar) Iron ring E, and §. ring J
 (first soft state). I propose now to communicate the com
parisons of all the remaining experiments of the former paper,
and of three additional sets on J.
    For clearness I will recapitulate shortly the bearing of the
 formulae.
    Each molecule has one, and only one, axis of transmission
 (like" a bead with a hole in it). The axis is capable of trans
 mitting 13. lines of force and no more, and the molecular
 permeability is proportional to 13,-13, or to the defect of
 saturation. (If we pack the hole in the bead with thin wires,
 the aperture remaining is represented by the number of wires
 that remain to be got in.)
    A is the molecular permeability per unit defect of satu
 ration.
    8 is an auxiliary angle representing the obliquity of a
 zigzag which would augment the resistance to the amount
actually observed.
    6 is the average inclination of the axes of the molecules to
the direction of magnetization ; initially it is always 60°.
o is the unit angle.
   f is the factor connecting 6 and 8.
    K represents the force of molecular torsion which is in equi
librium with the tendency of the lines of force further to
deflect the average molecule.
   * These statements are not to be taken as actual hypotheses, but as
geometrical analogies of the distribution.
    Phil. Mag. S. 5. Vol. 19. No. 120. May 1885.            2A

334               Mr. R. H. M. Bosanquet on a
   The inferences as to these constants to be drawn from the
numerous experiments now discussed are not so clear as they
appeared to be from the two cases treated in the last paper.
     he first of the following Tables contains the constants from
all the experiments that have been reduced, finishing with
those obtained from Rowland's Table I.
   The remaining Tables contain the detailed comparison of
the theory with experiment in all the cases, except ring E,
and J first soft state, which two were given in the last paper.
   The last column but one of the first Table gives the product
of A, the reciprocal of “, and a constant. This quantity may
be compared with the maximum observed value of A in the
last column.
   A has been spoken of as the molecular permeability for a
certain unit. Regarding magnetism as a motion or displace
ment, whether dynamic or static, we may thus speak of A as
a coefficient of freedom within the molecule.
   & being the coefficient of the forces which tend to prevent
the rotation of the molecule as a whole, we may speak of its
reciprocal as a coefficient of freedom without the molecule.
   The last column but one may be therefore regarded as the
product of coefficients of intra-molecular and extra-molecular
freedom, and a constant.
   This product (c x intra- × extra-molecular freedom) is a
characteristic of a given approximate state of a given piece of
metal. It runs generally with the maximum of a ; but is
liable to be depressed with respect to u where f has high
values, as in the first, second, and fourth entries. As between
the hard steel and the iron, the product of the coefficients of
freedom is proportional to the maximum permeability.
   The further general conclusions, so far as these data go, are
as follows:—
   In soft steel the molecular forces are chiefly extra-molecular,
the freedom intra-molecular.
   In hard steel the molecular forces are chiefly intra-molecular,
the freedom extra-molecular.
   In soft iron the average intra-molecular freedom is nuch
  reater than in hard steel, the extra-molecular freedom about
the same.
   In soft steel the extra-molecular freedom is much dimi
nished, the intra-molecular freedom is moderate or high.
   The distribution of the freedom between intra- and extra
molecular conditions depends minutely on the condition of
the piece of iron or steel.

                        New Theory of Magnetism.                          335
    The variations thus arising are comparatively moderate in
iron, considerable in hard steel, and enormous in soft steel.
    In one or two cases the equations do not represent the values
quite so well; in G two sets of constants are given.
    The dimensions of the rings and details of the experiments
are given in my paper of February last.
    Steel ring J was examined first soft, then hard, then soft
again, then hard again. Its saturation-point is taken to be
20,000 throughout. It was wound with about 4000 turns in
the hard states.
    P.S.–From the above conclusions we can deduce the out
line of a chemical theory of the hardening and tempering of
steel.
    In hard steel the additional constraint, as compared with
iron, is wholly intra-molecular, i. e. due to chemical combi
nation with a steeling element. This combination must exist
naturally at a red heat, and be stereotyped by sudden cooling.
    In soft steel the intra-molecular constraint is much dimi
nished, and the extra-molecular constraint increased. Hence
in slow cooling dissociation of the steeling element takes
 place. This requires time. At any point in the slow cooling
 the condition of partial dissociation can be stereotyped by
 completing the cooling suddenly. This constitutes tempering.

  19.          AVING now explained why I believe the main part
                 of the Volta-effect to take its rise at the surface of
    * Very little of this chapter, and none of Chapter V., has yet been read
  anywhere.

               Electromotive Forces in the Voltaic Cell.        341
contact between metal and medium, rather than between metal
and metal, it remains to consider whether this belief requires
one to assert that there is no true contact-force at all at the
junction of two metals. By no means : the existence of such
a force is undoubted; but for metals it is usually very small
and may be neglected in comparison with the Volta-force,
though, strictly speaking, what is observed electroscopically
is a mixture of the two. . It is the true contact-force which
gives rise to the Peltier effect, and its variation with tempe
rature (assisted by the Thomson effect) causes thermoelectric
currents.      A contact-force exists, as Thomson has shown, not
only at the junction of two different metals, but also between
parts of the same metal at different temperatures.
   In another place* I have endeavoured to gain some insight
into the nature of this true contact-force and to suggest its
cause. This has been done by many others; but I may be
permitted to repeat my own notion, vague and incomplete
though it avowedly is. Molecules of matter do not move in
independence of electricity; at any rate the converse is cer
tainly true—electricity does not move independently of matter.
Electricity, in flowing through a wire, meets with resistance;
there is something analogous to friction between the matter
and the electricity, and the opposing force is precisely pro
portional to the strength of the current. This much is
expressed by Ohm’s law, E=RC, which is a carefully verified
though empirical statement. But, analyzing R into specific
resistance of material (p) and sectional area of conductor, and
permitting ourselves to regard        * as proportional to the
velocity of electricity in a circuit of different thicknesses, we
perceive that Ohm's law means that
                         dW           locity
                         4 =px velocity.
   Let us then postulate, between electricity and any given
kind of conducting matter, a connection which shows itself as
an E.M.F. proportional to the speed of their relative motion
and to the specific resistance of the material. Molecules of
matter are not at rest, but (say) vibrating at a rate depending on,
or rather itself determining, the temperature. These motions,
as we have seen, cannot be independent of electricity, but
they result in no force urging it to flow, because their motions
are symmetrical. But         i.   two metals in contact—one hot,
the other cold ; or one copper, the other iron: at the junction
  * Phil. Mag. December (Supplement) 1876, “On a Mechanical Illus
tration of Thermoelectric Phenomena.”

342              Prof. Oliver Lodge on the Seat of the
symmetry disappears, there must be constraint and accom
modation ; and, in whatever precise way this acts, it seems
probable that it can be conceived of as having the same effect
as a layer of molecules moving faster on their outward
journey than on their return. # any such dissymmetry of
velocity were produced, it would exert a propelling force on
electricity" in the direction of the greatest velocity, because
the force is proportional to the velocity. This is the crude
and tentative way in which I picture to myself the Seebeck or
true contact-force—the cause of thermoelectricity and of the
Peltier phenomenon.
    But now, why is this force so small in ordinary metals?
Because it depends on p, the specific resistance, and this is
small. Choose badly conducting metals like bismuth and
antimony, or still better selenium and tellurium, and the force
will be greatly increased. Choose so-called nonconductors,
like glass and silk and ebonite, and it becomes enormous.
But when one uses nonconductors we cannot expect to excite
currents flowing in closed circuits; we can only expect elec
trical displacement and electrostatic phenomena; and indeed
it is no such easy matter for electricity to move in such sub
stances, even though the force urging it be excessive; and a
little mechanical violence (friction) may be necessary to help
it to move. But remember that no amount of friction can
determine the motion in one direction rather than another:
working a pump-piston exhausts no air unless there are valves.
Friction may supply some of the energy, but the directing
force must be in the substances in contactf.                To assist the
passage it is customary in electrical machines to touch together
a conductor and insulator rather than two insulators.              I doubt
not that when metal touches glass the surface of contact
would become chilled as soon as any transfer of electricity
were really produced by the force; but the heat developed, by
the friction apparently necessary to aid the transfer, effectually
masks any chilling.
    Measurement of contact-force between insulators is beset
   * I do not say necessarily on positive electricity. It seems a complica
tion; but Sir William's researches show that it is positive in some metals
and negative in others. In the case of lead only does the grip on both
electricities seem the same.
   + Mr. Joseph Thomson (Proc. Roy. Soc. 1876) endeavoured to extend
ordinary contact methods to nonconductors. He was hardly likely to get
very clear results; but he was able to find some electrical transfer as the
result of mere contact, if it be admitted that it is possible to apply mere
contact and no sort or kind of violence—a supposition which is probably
inadmissible. Yet the least violence destroys all novelty, and sends us
back to Thales.

with difficulties, because it is so difficult to make electricity
[. across the junction.       No limit to the force has at present
  een observed: whenever an electrical machine reaches its
limit, and refuses to charge its prime conductor or a Leyden
jar to a higher potential, it is accounted for by saying that
the rate of leakage is now equal to the rate of production
 (which is undeniably true), but nothing is said about whether
 the rate of production is the same as it was when the jar was
 uncharged. It is a difficult matter to settle, because most of
 the leakage takes place close to the rubber; and, though it is
 quite possible, it is unlikely that a limit to the force will be
 discovered, by finding the activity of a frictional machine less
 at high potentials than at low. When the substances in con
 tact are two metals, it is impossible for them to drive electricity
 very hard, for it would, so to speak, slip through their fingers;
 but when an insulator is concerned, its grip is so great that
 probably there is no limit to the force until its insulating
 power is overcome, and through it also electricity begins to
 slip. Certainly any upper limit must be a very high one, for
  the force can readily pile up a charge till it produces sparks
 a foot or more long.
    Whether Volta forces, or contact-forces between substances
 and the medium surrounding them, exist for insulators also
 we do not know ; we have no reason whatever to deny their
 existence ; but whereas in the case of metals these exceeded
 the forces acting between the substances themselves, here in
 the case of insulators they are absolutely negligible by com
 parison. For intermediate substances they may have corre
  spondingly important values; and it seems not unlikely that at
  the junction of metals with electrolytes, and of electrolytes
  with one another, the total contact-force may be a complex
  one—partly chemical, and due to the possibilities of chemical
  action straining across the junction, and partly physical, due
  to different velocity of the molecules.
     20. The preliminary experiments of Bouty have caused
  him to believe in the existence of physical contact-forces, at
  the junction of metals with electrolytes, which cannot be
  brought into harmony with energies of chemical action. And
  though the subject is too unexplored in this direction to be
  ripe for discussion, it may be well to point out that these
  contact-forces are important in the theory of the voltaic cell
  even in its simplest form.
     Why is the E.M.F. of a zinc-copper battery less than that
  of a zinc-platinum ?
     Why is the E.M.F. of a zinc-lead or iron battery smaller
  than either?

344            Prof. Oliver Lodge on the Seat of the
   The same chemical action goes on in each, zinc is dissolved
at one end and hydrogen liberated at the other: how, then, can
the E.M.F. be different if it is calculable from the chemical
reactions?"
   If we picture to ourselves the actual forces in action we
shall get a kind of answer indicated to us. In a zinc-iron
cell the E.M.F. is due to the zinc pulling at oxygen harder
than the iron does ; but, since the iron does pull too, with no
inconsiderable strength, the balance of force is not so great
as if the iron were replaced by copper, which pulls less, or by
platinum, which barely pulls at all until it is coated and
alloyed with hydrogen.                    -
     his answer cannot be considered as complete, and in order
to complete it consider a more precise experiment.
   Arrange a series of common dilute acid voltameters, with
their plates respectively, zinc zinc, zinc iron, zinc copper, and
zinc platinum. Pass one current through the series, from zinc
to the other metal, and measure the #. of potential
between the plates in each cell. Now the same chemical
action is going on in each. In each, zinc is dissolved at one
side and hydrogen evolved at the other—the only difference
being that it is liberated from surfaces of zinc, iron, copper,
platinum, in the four cases. What is to prevent the E.M.F.
between the terminals of each voltameter from being the
same? But it is not the same (pace Prof. Exner): the zinc
zinc cell shows the greatest difference of potential between its
terminals, the zinc-iron less; and the zinc-platinum may
easily show a reverse difference because it helps the current on
instead of hindering it. It will be understood that the precise
behaviour of the cells is determined by the intensity of the
current (i.e. current per area)—if it is weak, even the zinc
iron cell may help it on, but the zinc-platinum will help it on
most : if it is very strong, even the zinc-platinum will retard
it, but the others will retard it more, and the zinc-zinc most.
    Now why is all this? . . Take the difference between the
heats of formation of Zn, SO, and of H, SO, at the comma,
and you will have the total energy assimilated by the current
   * Professor Exner cuts this knot in characteristic fashion by asserting
roundly that the E.M.F. of all such cells is the same, and that it matters
nothing what metal is opposed to the zinc of a cell so long as it does not
alter the chemical action going on. He further asserts that all batteries
are non-polarizable and quite constant, as soon as they have got rid of
dissolved air and before sulphate of zinc has accumulated. He verifies
these extraordinary statements, to three  i.          figures, by straight
forward experiment. See his paper “On Inconstant Voltaic Batteries,”
cited above.

             Electromotive Forces in the Voltaic Cell.        345
in each cell. This energy is the same in all the cells, but not
in all does it take the same form. In the zinc-platinum cell
it mainly results in driving the current forward. In the zinc
zinc cell it wholly results in a Peltier (or Bouty) generation
of heat. In going out of the cell by a cathode zinc plate, it
has to move hydrogen towards it, and (ipso facto) oxygen
away from it, in opposition to the strong chemical attraction ;
thus it will do work and liberate energy, which, since there is
nothing better to do, must exhibit itself as heat. At an iron
surface less heat is generated, and at a copper less still ; but,
at any cathode which attracts oxygen, some heat must be
generated by a current made to do work in opposition to this
attraction.
   In the zinc-zinc cell there is no propulsion of electricity at
all by the cell; on one side, where the current enters, zinc is
dissolved and the current helped forward with the full ener
(or nearly the full energy) of the combination, so that no    %.
nearly no) waste energy or heat is there produced; but on
the other side, where the current leaves, the same combination
is (not exactly undone but) opposed and the current hindered
with (probably something less than) the full energy of the
combination, and there the heat of combination is generated.
   Thus, regarding the passage of hydrogen to the cathode as
a virtual separation of O (or SO) from it, we may say in
general that in any one of the above cells used as a volta
meter, the energy available for helping the current on is that
 represented by the difference between the combination-energies
 of the substances respectively attacked and liberated ; i. e.
 Zn, SO,-H, SO, ; but that besides this, the combination
 M, SO, is virtually undone; and, since the energy of this com
 bination appears as a generation of heat at the cathode, it is so
 much to be subtracted from the propelling force available for
 the current, only the balance being left for this purpose, viz.,
                  Zn, SO4–Hz, SO,-M, SO,.
 Whether one ought to write SO, or O in these expressions I
 am not sure, but it is not essential to decide this at present.
    Another way of regarding the matter is to say that the
 force propelling the current is that due to the difference of
 energies Zn,0–M,0, but that as soon as a current actually
  º and hydrogen is liberated       it coats the cathode more or
  ess thickly, and an extra term must be subtracted from the
 above to represent the opposition force of this hydrogen.
  The efficacy of this hydrogen as a current-opposer must

346            Prof. Oliver Lodge on the Seat of the
depend in some way on the intensity of the current itself,
since with a feeble current it will be able to dissipate itself
faster than it forms, and with a strong current it will
thoroughly coat the plate and the balance will escape. Sup
}. then, we represent the force exerted by the hydrogen as
   ,,Of (C); where f(0)=0, and f(x )=1 or something like
1; then the force available for urging the current forward in
any of the above cells is, in volts,
                zºo {Zn,0–M,0–H,0f (C)}.
   There is an obvious objection to be taken to this last
hypothesis, viz. that it supposes the second metal M
completely operative, even though it be thoroughly coated
with hydrogen. This is hardly reasonable; and a compromise
between the two preceding hypotheses is afforded by one of
greater generality in which the available force is symbolically
represented by.
                      Zn–M p (C)—H, f (C),
where q is a function such perhaps that b (C)=1 +n. f (C).
   On this hypothesis the propelling E.M.F. is
       e=rºm {Zn,0–M,0–(H,0+n. M,0) f (C)}.
   This is too much like miscellaneous guessing, and we will
make no more of such hypotheses; but if experiment could
fix an empirical formula for this force in any case, we could
apparently at once obtain the Joule or Bouty effect,” or rather
the difference of two such effects, for that case; because we
should have the E.M.F. experimentally observed on the one
hand, and that calculated from pure energy-considerations on
the other, as          Z

                       *†<+Bu-B,
 where the two B's stand for the Bouty coefficients at the zinc
 and the other metal respectively.            e only objection is that
 in the cells now under discussion M is coated more or less
 with hydrogen, and hence the Bouty effect obtained is nothing
very easily definable.
   * That is the thermoelectric contact-force at a metal-liquid junction:
see section 6,

             Electromotive Forces in the Voltaic Cell.       347
   21. To see if the actual behaviour of such cells at all bears
out a hypothesis formed on the above plan, I have made some
rough experiments on the lines suggested ; that is, I passed
the same current through different simple cells. There are so
many sources of uncertainty and of variation, that it would
be very difficult to get really definite and reliable results.
Thus, for instance, the back E.M.F. will depend considerably
upon how long the current has been flowing, and so the read
ings will differ according to the time they are taken. The
metals I used were zinc-zinc, zinc-copper, and zinc-platinum ;
and it was found necessary to put the cathode-plate in a porous
cell to avoid deposition of zinc on it.    But it was now diffi
cult to compare the cells easily when arranged in series,
because different porous pots had different resistances. I
therefore ultimately decided to use the same porous pot and
the same anode zinc plate, and to substitute the other plates
one after the other, making the current as nearly the same
each time as convenient (by adjusting resistance) and allowing
for outstanding discrepancies. An amperemeter placed in
circuit measured the current, and the voltameter used was a
reflecting galvanometer with some 30,000 ohms in its circuit.
Its indications were interpreted absolutely by tapping off, at
the same time as the cells, the difference of potential between
the terminals of an ohm (or 4 or § ohm) coil placed in the
circuit.
   Any two values of the strength of current enabled the in
ternal resistance of the cell to be calculated, provided its
E.M.F. remained constant.       With low currents it did seem to
be fairly constant, and a mean value of the internal resistance
r is reckoned from these as , ohm.
   The area of each plate under the liquid was exactly the same,
and measured 3 inches by 2% inches. Both faces of each platé
 were exposed, though naturally one face was more active than
the other.
    The arithmetical reductions are rather long ; the results are
all that I give. . It will be perceived they are anomalous in
places, a great deal of this being dependent on whether the
 reading of E.M.F. was taken soon after a current-change or
 not. . As I said before, the plan of experiment is avowedly
 rough, though the actual readings were carefully taken ; but
 without understanding more about the circumstances of the
 case, and what possibilities of variation there are, I do not see
 how to plan a perfect system of experiment on the subject.
    I will first give relative numbers, simply comparing the
 differences of potential between the terminals of the three

 348              Prof. Oliver Lodge on the Seat of the
cells when the same current is going through each, the resist
ance of each being the same, viz. ohm ; and then I will
interpret the observations absolutely, calculating the E.M.F.
of the cell under different currents, and seeing what empirical
 formula will best fit it.

terminals is written negative when it opposes the current, and
positive when it helps it on.
   We will now interpret similar measurements absolutely,
reckoning the actual E.M.F. of each cell, and try to fit an
empirical formula to it on the plan of those (in sect. 20)
already guessed ; assuming f(C) a linear function, for sim
plicity, until forced to try something more complex. It is
quite impossible that f(C) can be a linear function really, but
it very likely begins by being so, and only for big currents
diverges notably. A hyperbolic tangent function, at a guess,
would seem most likely to represent the case properly.

    Here two alternative formulae are given ; it is a matter of
opinion which shows the least divergencies from the column
of observed values.
    The first is the one most naturally suggested by the theore
tical considerations of sect. 20, the 8 standing for      % º
or what is commonly called Zn/Cu.

    Here also are two alternative formulae given, of which the
first agrees best with the experimental results. But it is very
strange that the E.M.F. of this cell should be so low when the
 current is feeble : it is scarcely more than that of the copper
 cell. The only way I see of accounting for the error (if error
 it be) is that the platinum was put into the liquid after the
 copper plate, and it was sometimes found coated with a very
 thin evanescent film of copper when taken out. Theoretical
 considerations would suggest something more like the second
 formula as the probable E.M.F., the 1-2 being what is ordi
 narily called Zn/Pt.
    22. I can now continue the quotation of the remainder of
 the preliminary notes with the certainty that they will be at
 any rate intelligible. I begin with statements intended to be
 true for substances of every kind, and then specialize them
 for the case of metals.

              Electromotive Forces in the Voltaic Cell.                   351
   III. Statements believed by the writer to be true, though not
                            entirely orthodow.
   xii. A substance immersed in any medium tending to act
upon it chemically is (unless it is actually attacked) at a
different potential to the medium in contact with it; positive
if the active element in the medium is electro-positive, negative
if the active element is electro-negative.
   xiii. The above difference of potential can be calculated
approximately from the potential energy of combination
between the substance and the medium ; the energy being
measured by compelling the combination to occur, and obser
ving the heat produced per amount of substance corresponding
to one unit of electricity.
   xiv. In addition to this contact-force, due to potential
chemical action or chemical strain, there is another which is
independent of chemical properties but which seems to be
greatest for badly-conducting solids, and which is in every
case superposed upon the former contact-force, the two being
observed together and called the Volta effect. Very little is
known about this latter force except in the case of metals;
and in these it varies with temperature, and is small. In the
case of non-metals it is often much larger than the chemical
contact-force*.
   xv. The total contact-force at any junction can be expe
rimentally determined by measuring the reversible energy
º             or absorbed there per unit quantity of electricity
conveyed across the junction (practical difficulties, caused
by irreversible disturbances, being supposed overcomef).
   xvi. In a chain of any substances whatever, the resultant
E.M.F. between any two points is equal to the sum of the true
contact-forces acting across every section of the chain between
the given points (neglecting magnetic or impressed forces).
   xvii. In a closed chain the sum of the “Volta forces,”
measured electrostatically in any (the same) medium, is equal
to the sum of the true contact-forces; whether each individual
  * I here assume, what I suppose is recognized as true, that what is
known as frictional generation of electricity is really due to a contact-force
between the substances rubbed—a force which is exceedingly great for
insulators (see § 19). Davy seems to have held this view, from a note
on p. 50 of his Bakerian lecture in 1806, cited before.
   f These difficulties are, however, tremendous for most substances
except metals. M. Bouty's is the only attempt I know of to examine
junction-energy between metals and solutions of their salts, which is the
case next in simplicity to metals. Observe that the statement says energy,
not heat only.
                                  2 B 2

352             Prof. Oliver Lodge on the Seat of the
Volta force be equal to each individual true force or not. See
section 7.
    xviii. Wherever a current flows across a seat of E.M.F.,
there it must gain or lose energy at a rate numerically equal
to the E.M.F. multiplied by the strength of the current".
    Development of the above and special application to Metals.
    xix. A metal is not at the potential of the air touching it,
but is always slightly below that potential by an amount
roughly proportional to its heat of combustion, and calculable,
at any rate approximately, from it. For instance, clean zinc
is probably about 1.8 volt below the air, copper about 8 volt
below, and so on. If an ordinary oxidizing medium be sub
stituted for “air” in the above statement it makes but little
difference.
    xx. Two metals put into contact reduce each other instantly
to practically the same potential; and consequently the most
 oxidizable one receives from the other a positive charge, the
effect of which can be observed electrostatically.
    xxi. There is a slight true contact-force at the junction of
two metals which prevents their reduction to evactly the same
 potential; but the outstanding difference is small, and varies
 with temperature. . It can be measured thermoelectrically by
 the Peltier effect, but in no other known way. It is pro
 bably entirely independent of surrounding media, metallic or
 otherwisef.
     xxii. If two metals are in contact, the potential of the
 medium surrounding them is no longer uniform : if a
 dielectric it is in a state of strain, if an electrolyte it conveys
 a current.
     xxiii. In the former case the major part of the total dif
 ference of potential is related closely to the difference of
 the potential energies of combination, and is approximately
 calculable therefrom.         In the latter case the total E.M.F.
 is calculable accurately from the energy of the chemical
    * A current gains energy at any junction at which heat is absorbed, or
 chemical combination permitted, or any other form of energy destroyed,
 by the passage of the current. The current gains the energy which has
 in the other form disappeared.
     A current loses energy at a point where it causes other forms of energy
 to make their * e.g. generation of heat, decomposition of che
 mical compounds, &c.
     # To distinguish between Peltier-force and Volta-force henceforward
 it will be best to write BiºSh or Zn/Cu for the former, and Zn/Air/Cu or
  Fe/Water | Pt for the latter. The force electroscopically observed is
  Air//n/Cu/Air, but this involves both : the right way of denoting the
  Volta effect pure and simple is Zn/Air/Cu.

processes going on, minus or plus the energies concerned in
 ...'
    xxiii a. “The E.M.F. of an electro-chemical apparatus”
whose energy is entirely expended in maintaining a current
“is equal to the mechanical equivalent of the chemical action
On   º   electro-chemical equivalent of the substance.” (Thom
S011.
    xxiiib. “If the action in a cell consists in part of irreversible
 processes, such as (1) frictional generation of heat, (2) dif
 fusion of primary or secondary products, (3) any other
action which is not reversed with the current, there will be
 a certain dissipation of energy, and the E.M.F. of the circuit
will be less than the loss of intrinsic energy corresponding to
the electrolysis of one electro-chemical equivalent. It is only
the strictly reversible processes that must be taken into account
in calculating the E.M.F. of a circuit.” (Maxwell ; ‘Elemen
tary Electricity, p. 148.)
    xxiv. There are two distinct and independent kinds of
series in which metals (and possibly all solids) can be placed :
one kind depends on the dielectric or electrolytic medium in
which the bodies are immersed, the other kind depends on
temperature. The one is the real Volta series, but it is the
commonly observed Volta series minus the Peltier; the other
is the Peltier or thermoelectric series. To reckon up the total
E.M.F. of a circuit, we may take differences of numbers from
each series and add them together.
    23. It is necessary to illustrate the meaning of this last
statement, No. xxiv. By “real Volta series " I mean such
series as we have attempted to calculate from purely che
mical data, because they depend on chemical tendencies.
By “Peltier or thermoelectric series” I mean those giving a
purely physical E.M.F., produced we know not quite how,
whose energy-source is not chemical but thermal. We have
on the one hand a number of Volta series, each for a special
medium, and on the other a table of thermoelectric powers at
different temperatures. The latter can be conveniently repre
sented by a number of curves, because temperature varies
continuously; Volta series, on the other hand, can hardly be
represented geometrically, because the transition from one
medium to another is probably per saltum ; at least, it is not
   * Such, for instance, as we have been discussing under the head of in
constant or simple voltaic batteries (sects. 19–21). These reversible heat
effects indicate the presence of thermal contact-forces which, wherever
they exist, prevent chemical data from giving E.M.F. accurately: they
also must be taken into account. We have called them Joule or Bouty
effects.

354              Prof. Oliver Lodge on the Seat of the
known what is the effect of mixing media, and so passing
gradually from one to the next.
   We have given several Volta series; and, for the sake of
completeness, I will now give some Peltier series for a few
substances according to the experiments of Professor Tait at
different Centigrade temperatures. Expressing each number
as a function of the temperature, we are able to give an infi
nite number of Peltier series in one table. The range of
temperature over which this table may be interpreted is from
 —18° to 400° or so, provided the metals do not begin to melt.
Non-metallic substances have not yet been introduced into
such series: much experimental work remains to be done
before they can be. The metals used by Tait were not
chemically pure.

    To find the E.M.F. of a junction at a specified temperature
we have only to subtract the numbers in the above table,
inserting the value of the temperature. Thus a junction of
zinc and copper at 10° has an E.M.F. of 320 microvolts, act
 ing from copper to zinc.; and a unit current sent across such
 a junction from copper to zinc, or from zinc to copper, absorbs
 or generates heat at the rate of 320 microwatts, and the current
 #.      or loses energy at the same rate. Clerk-Maxwell says
 that the force is one microvolt, and that it acts from zinc to
 copper (“Elementary Electricity, p. 149, note); but he only
 means, I suppose, that the E.M.F. of a zinc-copper circuit
 with one junction a degree hotter than the other is a micro
   * This row of numbers is little better than a guess from some curves
 given in Wiedemann's Elektricität. A more probable deduction from
some quite new experiments of C. L. Weber (Wied. Ann. November
 1884), gives, for mercury, 1181+5.684-005!”. (Cf. note to sect. 27.)

volt, and is such as to drive the current from zinc to copper
acrºss the cooler junction; at least this is true above —60° or
–80°*.
    Hitherto we have supposed the circuit to be all at one
temperature; but if different parts are at different tempera
tures, we shall have to use a yet further series, viz. a Thomson
series, for the E.M.F. acting in any one substance with a
difference of temperature between its ends, or the force acting
at a junction of two pieces of the same metal at different
temperatures. This series can be deduced from the preceding,
using only the coefficient of t”, and multiplying it by the
difference of the squares of the absolute temperatures of the
two ends of the piece of metal. Such a series then stands
thus:–

      Zinc . . . . –'024 (t1–t,);274+}(t)+t.);
and so on.
    Whether a series of this sort can be made to include any
non-metallic conductors also, has not yet been discovered.
M. Bouty's experiments provisionally indicate the very inter
esting fact that Sir W. Thomson's general thermodynamic
laws of the thermoelectric circuit apply perfectly to circuits
which include some electrolytes as well as metals.
   Now the meaning of statement No. xxiv. is as follows:
Regard zinc and copper in contact as a circuit completed by
air or by water, as the case may be, and let the temperature
be uniform, and say 10°; to reckon up the total E.M.F. we
must look in the proper Volta series for Zn/air (or Zn/water),
which we find 1.8 say ; for Zn/Cu, which we don’t find, or
find zero; for Cu/air, which we find 8. Then we must look
in the 10° Peltier series for Zn/air or Zn/water, which at
  resent we shall not find there for want of data (possibly we
i.     no right to put them there if we had data); for Zn/Cu,
   * It is always easy to tell from thermoelectric data which way the
force acts at a junction; but it is not always the same way as the current
flows, by any means. A current, excited by differences of temperature in
a simple metallic circuit, may be urged against the force at both junctions.
This is the case, for instance, in a copper-iron circuit with one junction
above 275° and the other below it by a greater amount. It is customary
to say that the current flows across a hot junction from the metal of
higher to the metal of lower thermoelectric value: this is not necessarily
true. The safe statement is to say that the electromotive force acts from
high to low thermoelectric value, at either junction.

356            Prof. Oliver Lodge on the Seat of the
which we find about 320 microvolts; and for Cu/air, which
again we don’t find. . Add them all up with their proper signs,
and we have the total E.M.F. of the circuit.
   Again, consider the case of a Daniell cell at a given tem
perature producing a current; we shall have to look in each
series for Zn/ZnSO, for ZnSO/CuSO, for CuSO/Cu, and
for Cu/Zn, and add them all up. It is true that these tables
of numbers have practically yet to be made, for at present
they include so few substances; but that does not affect the
question of the existence and independence of these two kinds
of series.
    It is, of course, a question how far all E.M.F. of contact
may be found to depend on chemical tendency. For instance,
when bismuth and antimony are put into contact, does the
E.M.F. developed measure i. alloying affinity of these two
metals? When sodium is dropped into mercury, does the
heat produced represent the thermoelectric power of a sodium
mercury junction ? When metal touches glass, does the
tremendous E.M.F. developed represent a tendency of the
metal to combine with the glass? These are questions for
experiment to decide; but to me it does not seem probable
that it will reply in the affirmative.
    We know that Sir W. Thomson, and Davy before him, con
sidered the apparent contact-force at the junction of zinc and
copper to be due to the chemical affinity between these two
metals, and to be measured by the heat of formation of brass;
but this we have seen strong reasons for disbelieving. It
 sounds more probable that the real contact-force at a junction
 of bismuth and antimony should be due to the chemical
 affinity between these metals; but perhaps it is no more true.
 The greater part of a contact-force of this kind is probably
 due to a physical difference between the metals, such as
 difference in atomic velocity, and has no close relation to their
 chemical affinities for each other. It is, however, just possible
 that part of a metallic junction-force is due to chemical ten
 dency between the two metals in contact. For instance, take
 the case of zinc and copper. There is, I suppose, an undoubted
 affinity between them, as shown by the formation of brass
 under proper conditions.       <U+017F>º  chemists assume the right to
 demur to this, on the ground that the two metals mix equally
 well in any proportions, one can choose any other pair of
 metals—say,    *N.       copper and tin—for which the statement
 does not hold.] Now does this affinity result in any E.M.F.
 between them on making contact? This question, I appre
  hend, is to be answered by passing a current for a long time
  across a copper-zinc junction and seeing if any brass does,

              Electromotive Forces in the Voltaic Cell.                  357
after a long time, result. Thermopiles show a curious secular
deterioration with use, and it may be that some alloying action
  oes on, though I have never heard of its being noticed.
  ut if no such alloying goes on during the passage of a
current, then I should say that, in whatever ways chemical
affinity between two metals is able to show itself, it does not
show itself as an E.M.F.
    Observe, I do not for a moment question the existence of a
few hundred microvolts of E.M.F. at a zinc-copper junction.
I only ask, is this chemical, or is it physical, or is it a mixture
of the two 2 Statement No. xxiv. is general enough to take
into account the possibility of its being a mixture of the two
at every kind of junction. It is easy to write one of them
 zero, if so it turns out.
    24. We have been led into a pretty wide discussion of contact
 force in general; and, before digressing again on the question
 of a contact-force-determination of the size of atoms, it may
 be convenient here to quote the remainder of my preliminary
 notes, which aim at summarizing, in a compact form, the
 main argument with respect to the immediate subject of dis
 cussion, viz. the seat of electromotive force in a voltaic cell,
 and in ordinary Volta-condenser experiments.
               IV. Brief Summary of the Argument.
    xxv. Wherever a current gains or loses energy, there must
 be a seat of E.M.F.; and conversely, wherever there is a seat
 of E.M.F. a current must lose or gain energy in passing it".
     xxvi. A current gains no appreciable energy in crossin
 from copper to zinc, hence there is no appreciable E.M.F.
 there.
     * Note added January 1885,--My attention has just been called to an
 article by Mr. Oliver Heaviside in the ‘Electrician’ of 2nd February,
 1884, in which he states views very like those contained in these state
 ments. Had I known of this paper earlier I should of course have
 mentioned it, but I did not know of it.
    Mr. Sprague also, in his book on ‘Electricity, its Theory, Sources, and
 Applications,' on §: 331 expresses his belief in much the same sort of
 way. Although Mr. Sprague is rather too much occupied in               tilting
 against what he considers the absurdities of orthodox and “mathematical”
 views to work out his own ideas in a very thorough and clear form, there
 can be no doubt that he has in his own way arrived at very many of the
 same conclusions as Clerk-Maxwell, though of course in a far less pro
 found and satisfactory manner. He has scarcely received the credit due
 to him for this, and a cutting review of his book in “Nature’ some years
 back, though justified in parts by Mr Sprague's supercilious tore, yet
 falls into more important errors legarding electrical facts than Mr. Sprague
 himself falls into. See “Nature, June 24, 1875, vol. xii. p. 144.

358            Prof. Oliver Lodge on the Seat of the
    xxvii. When a current flows from zinc to acid, the energy
 of the combination which occurs is by no means accounted
 for by the heat there generated, and the balance is gained by
 the current ; hence at a zinc-acid junction there must be a
 considerable E.M.F. (say at a maximum 2-3 volts).
    xxviii. A piece of zinc immersed in acid is therefore at a
 lower potential than the acid, though how much lower it is
 impossible precisely to say, because no actual chemical action
 occurs. [If chemical action does occur, it is due to impurities,
 or at any rate to local currents, and is of the nature of a dis
turbance.]
   xxix. A piece of zinc, half in air and half in water, causes
no great difference of potential between the air and the water
 (Thomson, Clifton, Ayrton and Perry, &c.); consequently air
must behave much like water.
   xxx. If it makes the air slightly positive to the water, as it
does (Hankel), it may mean that the potential-energy of com
bination of air with zinc is slightly greater than that of water,
or it may represent a difference in the thermoelectric contact
forces between zinc and air and zinc and water, or it may
depend on a contact-force between air and water. [If such a
contact-force between air, and water exists, it is obviously of
flº importance in the theory of atmospheric electricity, for
the slow sinking of mist-globules through the air would
render them electrical”.]
   xxxi. Condenser methods of investigating contact-force no
more avoid the necessity for unknown contacts than do
straightforward electrometer or galvanometer methods; the
circuit is completed by air in the one case and by metal in
the other, and the E.M.F. of an air-contact is more hopelessly
unknown than that of a metal-contact.                          -
   xxxii. All electrostatic determinations of contact-force are
really determinations of the sum of at least three such forces,
none of which are knowable separately by this means.
   xxxiii. The only direct way of investigating contact-force
is by the Peltier effect or its analogues. [Maxwell.]
   xxxiv. Zinc and copper in contact are oppositely charged,
but are not at very different potentials; they were at different
potentials before contact, but the contact has nearly equalized
them.
   xxxv. The potential of the medium surrounding them is,
however, not uniform. If a dielectric, it is in a state of
strain; if an electrolyte, it is conveying a current.

    25. I may now claim to have accomplished my task, and
terminate this long paper; but there are several interesting
points which arise in connection with Sir W. Thomson’s
deduction of a limit to the smallness of atoms from contact
data, and these I may be permitted to indicate. Indeed it
evidently becomes a question whether or not his argument
remains quite valid if the chemical-strain view be taken of
 Volta's force.
    Let us then inquire whether any modification has to be
made in Sir Wm. Thomson's argument, if the hypothesis set
 forth in this paper be adopted. He says (virtually), Take a
 number of plates of zinc and copper of specified thickness,
 arrange them alternately like the leaves of a book with the
 covers doubled right back, and then shut the book. Directly
 they touched at one edge they became oppositely electrified
 and attracted each other, and therefore did work as they
 approached. By making the leaves numerous and thin
 enough, and shutting them º close enough, any required
 amount of work can be thus done with given quantities of
 metal, provided the thin plates retain the same properties as
 masses of metal possess; i. e. provided they are not only a
 few atoms thick. So far there is no possible objection; but
 Sir William proceeds to consider the attraction as depending
 on the affinity of zinc for copper, and the work he requires of
 his plates is that evolved in the formation of brass. But if
 we regard the attraction as depending on the difference of
 combustion energies, Zn/0–Cu/O, we must, to keep the
 charge constant, not only take the plates several atoms thick,
 but we must suppose films of air of sufficient thickness to
 preserve their normal activities in the way of chemical strain
 to be shut up with the plates. Given these, the amount of
  work he has calculated would certainly be done in shutting
  the book, and a corresponding amount of heat generated.
  But would this heat have anything to do with the making of
 brass? So far as I can see, nothing whatever.

  360           Prof. Oliver Lodge on the Seat of the
     If we intend to make brass, must we not regard the air
  surrounding the plates as a simple accident, and imagine all
  air-films removed before beginning the operation ? Work
  with the zinc and copper plates in absolute vacuum, where
  (on my hypothesis at any rate) the only difference of potential
  between them is a minute thermoelectric one; there will be
  an attraction caused by this difference of potential, and work
  will be done in shutting the book, but to get any appreciable
 amount of heat the plates must be terribly thin. How much
 heat really is produced in the formation of brass I don't
  believe any one knows; but if it be enough to warm the
 metals sixty degrees, the lower limit to the size of atoms
 becomes greatly depressed.
     In a note near the end of this paper I show that a rise of from
 # to 2 degrees is all that is probable, on the usual estimate of
 atomic dimensions; the smaller evolution of heat being caused
 by alloying the metals at 10°C., the larger being produced by
 alloying them at 400°C.
    26. Is there much heat produced in the formation of brass?
 Is there any way of attacking the question simply? The
 only way which has occurred" to me is to dissolve brass in
 acid, and to see whether one gets appreciably less heat than
 by dissolving its constituent copper, and zinc separately.
 When an alloy is dissolved, I suppose the affinities of its con
 stituents are unloosed, or the combination undone; hence the
 heat developed during the solution of an alloy, subtracted from
 that produced during the solution of its constituent metals
and mixing of those solutions, ought to measure the heat of
 formation of the alloy. Dr. Forster Morley, of University
 College, London (also on the boat), said he might be willing
 to undertake this observation, which is doubtless a delicate
 one, for he was engaged in some thermo-chemical researches.
It may not be practicable for the actual case of brass, because
of the complication and uncertainty introduced by secondary
products, but a better pair of metals may no doubt be readily
found.
    Adhering to zinc and copper as convenient for explanation,
the argument, though obviously not the order of experiment,
will stand as follows:–Take definite weights of zinc and
copper, dissolve them separately, getting heats H1 and H,
respectively; then mix the solutions, getting a possible further
heat-production h. This is one plan of passing from separate
zinc and copper to a solution of a salt of brass.
   * It occurred in conversation with Professor S. P. Thompson and Dr.
J. A. Fleming on board the Quebec excursion steamer ‘Canada', and I
am unable to say who suggested it.

            Electromotive Forces in the Voltaic Cell.         361
   Next take the same weights of zinc and copper as before
and alloy them, getting heat H; then dissolve the brass in the
same acid as before, getting heat Hs. This is another plan of
passing from separate zinc and copper to a solution of a salt
of brass.
   Now, unless external work and secondary products are
different in the two cases, we are justified in writing the heats
evolved in the two cases equal :—
                      Hi + H2 + h- H + Hs.
H is the unknown quantity to be determined, and its determi
nation involves four separate measurements, H1, H2, Hs, h.
   The only one of these at all easy to observe is h, and this
my assistant, Mr. Butler, has done. Proportions of zinc and
copper sulphate, containing equal weights of zinc and copper,
are dissolved in as little water as will keep in solution any
double salt that may be formed on mixing. #. zinc sulphate
is enclosed in a thin bulb or tube inside the other solution,
and left, screened from stray heat, for some hours. The bulb
is then broken, or the liquid otherwise blown out of it, and
the liquids mixed. No certain change of temperature so great
as a hundredth of a degree has been observed.
  27. In thinking over what metals were more suitable, it struck
me that the heat of formation of amalgams was a subject easy
of direct attack. I therefore, as a preliminary, have dissolved
a little granulated tin in mercury. Of course the latent heat
of liquefaction of tin has to be allowed for, and the actually
observed result is a cooling; but I hoped that the cooling
observed would be less than what the latent heat would
account for, and that I might then calculate the real evolution
 of heat due to combination. Unfortunately the only data I
 know of with reference to the latent heat of tin relate to its
ordinary melting-point, at which point it is given by Rudberg
as 13-3, and by Person as 14.25. We have no ground what
 ever for believing latent heat to be constant, and I am therefore
 utterly in the dark as to what the latent heat of tin at ordi
 nary temperatures may be. That liquid tin could be super
 cooled to ordinary temperatures without solidification is
 unlikely. I give, however, the data of my experiment (which
 was carefully performed) in case better latent-heat data are
 known to some one else:—2:10 grammes of thin granulated
 tin at 12°4 were dropped into 502:00 grammes of mercury at
 a steady temperature of 10°85, contained in a large thin pro
 tected test-tube, of which the part sharing the temperature of
 the mercury weighed 8 grammes. After solution, which took
 ten minutes, the resulting temperature was found to be 8°82.

362          Prof. Oliver Lodge on the Seat of the
Three minutes later it had risen to 8-99 from surrounding
influences. The thermal capacity of the immersed part of the
thermometer was equivalent to 48 gramme of water.
   Working on these data, and taking the specific heat of tin
as '056, latent heat 14:25, specific heat of glass 19, and of
mercury 033, we find:—
Heat disposed of in cooling and liquefying tin . 30.45 units.
Disappearance of heat actually observed . . . 43’57 ,
More than can be accounted for without any combination
heat at all ! This is rather depressing; but it only shows
how wrong is the estimate of 14:25 for the latent heat of
liquid tin at 10°C.
   Ignorance of the true latent heat thus effectually prevents
our obtaining any information whatever, about the heat of
combination of tin and mercury, from the experiment. It
seems indeed easier to observe the combination-heat by a
process of dissolving the amalgam and the metals separately
in acid, as already explained for brass, and then to use the
above experiment to calculate latent heat from. One might
perhaps thus get the latent heats of fusion at various tempe
ratures for metals soluble in mercury.
   Another alternative, however, presents itself. Instead of
trying to reduce the latent heat to ordinary temperatures, one
might form the amalgam at a temperature just below the
miting-point of tin, and obtain, if possible, the net evolution
of heat then.
   Suppose the heat of combination of the 2-1 grammes of tin
with mercury to be somehow or other determined, we have
next to suppose the amalgam made otherwise, bringing the
molecules together in a reasoned way. Let the same quantity
of tin be brought to within molecular distance of the mercury
in successive pieces of very thin foil, first made to touch at
 one corner and then laid down.
    It is quite true that each flake would be charged with a
 Wolta E.M.F. of, say, 6 volt, and so would attract the mer
cury and do a certain amount of work in laying itself down.
 But it is not fair to compare an operation thus conducted in
air with the dropping of a solid mass of tin into mercury: to
 be able to compare the two operations, one must perform the
foil experiment in absolute vacuum. This being done, the
contact E.M.F. is no longer 6 volt, but only º •00015
volt according to the experiments of Matthiessen. Good data
 for this quantity are, however, wanting. Mercury is not one
of the metals included in Professor Tait's series.   It was ob
 served by Gaugain; and by rather hypothetical deduction

                Electromotive Forces in the Voltaic Cell.                363
from his numbers, as given pictorially in Wiedemann’s
Elektricität, I make the tin-mercury Peltier force 1.75
millivolt at 10°".
     Taking one of these numbers (15,000 or 175,000 in C.G.S.
units), or a better one when determined, we can calculate how
near the given mass of tin must be brought to the mercury in
order to generate the actual heat of combination, provided
one knows the specific inductive capacity of absolute vacuum f.
But I do not know it. Thus the supply of data for this case
is distinctly unsatisfactory.
     28. Let us try whether we cannot do better with a single
metal exposed to air, not troubling about the contact of two
metals, which is unnecessary, but simply considering one metal
in contact with air.                                                   -
    * Since this was in type, a paper by C. L. Weber has appeared in
Wiedemann's Annalen for November 1884, on the thermoelectric pro
    rties of amalgams, in which mercury itself was examined; and from the
   ata there recorded, together with Tait's value for copper, I reckon the
thermoelectric value of mercury at tº C. as
                   431 + 5t absolute electromagnetic units.
Whence the Peltier force at the same temperature is
                        1181+5.68t-H-005t” microvolts.
The Peltier force between tin and mercury at 10° is therefore 123,800
absolute units, or 1:24 millivolt, which agrees well enough with the rough
estimate above.
    t Taking this as 1, and assuming the estimate of molecular dimensions
hereafter established, and working backwards, one can show that the
Peltier force of tin and mercury at 10° is connected with the heat of com
bination of our 2.1 grammes of tin with the 502 grammes of mercury by
the relation
                              JII=3.6x10" VH.
The two rough estimates of JII deduced from Matthiessen and Gaugain
respectively (15,000 and 175,000) thus give H as about + and tº
of a unit respectively. Either of these is too small a quantity to be
observed in º process of dissolving tin in mercury; so neglecting it we
get, from that experiment, the latent heat of molten tin at 10°C. as 20:4.
Another experiment made in a similar way gave 19-6.
    If the above reasoning be regarded as legitimate, a combination of
thermoelectric measurements with observed heats of solution in mercury
may furnish a means of estimating latent heats of fusion at various low
temperatures in general.
        orking back similarly to the heat of combination of 1 gramme of
copper     . 1 gramme of zinc, we calculate 077 unit as the heat developed
 at ordinary temperatures; only enough to raise the mass of brass formed
 through three eighths of a degree Centigrade. At a higher temperature,
 such as 400° C., the Peltier force for these metals is greater, being 4600
 microvolts, and the calculated heat of combination is then 3 of a unit per
 º
      mme of each, sufficient to raise the whole mass of metal through nearly
    degrees Centigrade. This, then, is the sort of elevation of temperature
 one may expect in making brass at a temperature of 400°.

364          Electromotive Forces in the Voltaic Cell.
   Take a gramme-equivalent of any metal, say 65 grammes of
zinc, and imagine it rolled out into a thin sheet of foil of
area A. The difference of potential between it and the air
being V in electrostatic units,   *   in volts, its charge will be
º     y
        where w is the distance between it and the air, a quan
tity of molecular magnitude. The electrical energy of this
charge is 27 º' which must therefore have been the electrical
work done (i.e. the amount of potential chemical energy trans
muted into electrostatic energy) in spreading out the zinc
over so much surface. [Capillary tension is part of the
mechanical work done.]
    Now let it be rolled so thin that every atom of it is in con
tact with air, i.e. let its thickness be also of molecular mag
nitude w. We can regard its potential energy in two ways:
either as chemical or as electrical. Chemically its energy,
measured by heat of combination, is
                             46,000 VJ,
 where V is expressed in volts. Electrostatically its energy is
                           sº. (…)
    Equating these two values, and writing for the quantity of
 metal m-Arp, we have the general relation
                   m W = -8287 pa”J x 10";
 whence, taking m =65, p=7, and W = 1-8, we get, as our esti
 mate of linear molecular dimensions,
                          a = 4 x 10-9.
    The data in this calculation are all very definite; hence if
the reasoning is legitimate, this estimate ought to be a pretty
 good one. It is true that another metal would give a rather
 different estimate, unless mV. were constant for all ; but for
 ordinary metals—e.g. zinc, iron, copper, mercury, silver—this
 is not so outrageously far from being the case; though discre
 pancies arise with such metals as sodium on the one hand,
and platinum on the other. But it is very doubtful whether
 platinum could be regarded as an oxide, however thin it were
 beaten; and sodium would probably take fire long before the
 proper molecular thinness was reached.
    The several estimates of Sir William Thomson for the size of
atoms were given in “Nature, March 1870, and are reproduced

             Lecture-Eageriments on Spectrum Analysis.           365
in Thomson and Tait, Part II. Appendix F. In a lecture on
the size of atoms delivered at the Royal Institution in February
 1883 he restates these estimates with slight modifications
thus:–
    If atomic dimensions are comparable with 10-9 centim.,
brass would rise 62° C. at the instant of formation; while if
atoms are so small as 2.5 x 10-9, it would rise 1000° C.
Hence 10-8 is to be regarded as a limit of smallness.
    A soap-film so thin as 10-9 centim. would raise itself 280°
by collapsing; therefore there are not several molecules in this
thickness.
    The theory of gaseous collision, combined with the density
of liquids, suggests a range lying between 7 × 10-9 and
 2 x 10-9.
    The dispersion of light seems to require atomic dimensions
to lie between 10-7 and 10-9.
   The final estimate made by Sir William is something between
                          2 x 10-7 and 10-9.
    But if the reasoning in the present paper be admitted as
correct, it would seem possible to reduce this range of uncer
tainty, and to make an even more precise estimate.
     XXXIX. Lecture-Eageriments on Spectrum Analysis.
               By E. CLEMINSHAw, M.A., F.C.S.*
I    PROPOSE in the following paper to explain some pro
       cesses by which all the phenomena in spectrum analysis,
usually shown upon the screen in class-demonstrations, may
be exhibited without the use of the electric light, which for
various reasons is frequently not available. The methods
employed depend upon the use of the limelight and the oxy
hydrogen flame : these of course do not give the same brilliant
effects as the electric light, but all the phenomena may be
shown upon the screen with much simpler apparatus; and for
some of my methods I think I may claim advantages over the
usual method of demonstration.
          i. Spectra of the Alkalis and Alkaline Earths.
   Debray (Ann. Ch. Phys. [3] lxv. p. 331) proposed the use
of the oxy-hydrogen flame for the volatilization of the alkalis
and alkaline earths. By a modification of the ingenious method
of Bunsen for procuring a monochromatic flame, the sub
     * Communicated by the Physical Society: read March 14, 1885.
   Phil. Mag. S. 5. Vol. 19. No. 120. May 1885.           2 C

366       Mr. E. Cleminshaw’s Lecture-Eageriments
stances in question . be conveniently introduced into the
flame. Bunsen made hydrogen in a bottle containing a strong
solution of sodium chloride with zinc and hydrogen sulphate,
passed coal-gas into the bottle in order to increase the size of
the flame, and to assist in the mechanical carrying-over of
the spirtings of the sodium-chloride solution, and burnt the
mixed gases in a description of Bunsen burner.
   Instead of burning the mixed gases in air, I propose to
burn them in an atmosphere of oxygen, by which I find a
sufficiently bright flame can be obtained to show the spectra
on the screen.
   The mixed gases are burnt from a jet consisting of two
concentric brass tubes, the inner of ºld passes into the gas
generating apparatus, and the outer is connected with a supply
of oxygen; the inner tube is from -iº, inch diameter, and
may with advantage be wider at the bottom. A better result
is obtained by passing hydrogen into the bottle, since it is
not easy to render the coal-gas perfectly non-luminous by the
oxygen.
   A rapid evolution of hydrogen is necessary for a good
result. The lens or lenses should be arranged so as to obtain
as bright an image of the slit as possible, even at the expense
of some spherical aberration.
   The  i.    obtained with sodium  chloride is perfectly mono
chromatic and very bright. I venture to recommend this
method of obtaining a bright monochromatic flame for lecture
demonstrations.
   With a strong solution of lithium chloride the red band
(Li a) can be shown, and on adding some strong solution of
sodium chloride the yellow band of sodium.
   For showing the spectra of the alkaline earths I use a
saturated solution of the chlorides and generate hydrogen
with zinc and hydrogen chloride. With two CS-prism
bottles a red, orange (Sr a), and blue (Sr 8) can be shown
on the screen; and, if the slit is narrow, the yellow band
of sodium is clearly shown as soon as some sodium-chloride
solution is introduced into the gas-generator. If a stron
solution of lithium, sodium, and calcium chlorides are     .
with two CS,-prisms five bands can be shown on the screen,
including the orange, green, and violet bands of Ca.
   The above method is applicable for all compounds which
can be volatilized in the oxy-hydrogen flame, and which are
not reduced by the nascent hydrogen.
   If hydrogen gas is passed into the bottle, or sufficient
oxygen used to destroy the luminosity of the coal-gas, no trace
of a continuous spectrum can be seen     An occasional addition

                       on Spectrum Analysis.                367
of acid, to maintain the evolution of hydrogen, keeps the
flame burning brilliantly for some time ; this method might,
therefore, be useful for spectroscopic observations for com
parison.
        ii. Continuous Spectrum showing Bright Bands.
   If the slit is narrow, the orange and green bands of calcium
may often be seen on the spectrum obtained with the lime
light. If the chlorides of the alkalis or alkaline earths are
previously melted upon the surface of the lime-cylinder,
the bands of these compounds become very bright. Four
different compounds might be melted upon different portions,
and the spectra of each shown in turn by turning the cylinder.
The lime-cylinder should be a “hardlime;” the softer cylinders
are too porous.
                       iii. Reversed Spectra.
   The important fact that the light emitted by incandescent
sodium vapour is opaque to light from the same source, is
easily shown in a striking manner upon the screen by placing
the apparatus used for showing the yellow band of sodium in
§ i. in the centre of an ordinary optical lantern ; a bright
disk of monochromatic sodium-light may be obtained on the
screen from 4–5 feet in diameter.      A small Bunsen burner is
then placed as near as possible to the condensing lens, with
the top of the tube projecting # inch above the edge of the
lens, which shows the shadow of the tube at the top of the
disk upon the screen. When a platinum wire containing a
  uantity of sodium chloride is introduced into the flame of
 . Bunsen burner, the dark appearance of the cooler flame is
clearly seen on the screen.
                         Reversal of D line.
   Mr. Lewis Wright states that this can be done with the
limelight by burning sodium in a Bunsen burner placed as
close to the slit as possible. I have not been able to obtain
very satisfactory results by this method ; the flame is too hot.
I have been more successful with the following methods :—
The sodium is burnt in a small spoon placed between the lens
and prism, just below the focus of the rays from the lens,
which must be made as small as possible, so that all the rays
are made to pass through the flame where the sodium vapour
is densest, and none of the light from the sodium vapour is
focused on the screen, and a much smaller flame may be used.
Or the spoon may be placed a little in front of or beyond the
focus in the path of the rays; a shadow of the spoon is seen
                              2C 2

368       Dr. J. A. Fleming on the Characteristic Curves
across the spectrum, and with a small flame a marked thicken
ing of the dark line is seen just above the spoon. The sodium
may be burnt in a Bunsen burner or in the flame of a spirit
lamp.
    # the sodium-flame is placed between the slit and the lime
light, I have obtained a good result by using a Bunsen burner,
the flame of which is cooled down to a proper temperature by
a mixture of air and carbon dioxide.           Care must be taken not
to pass carbon dioxide into the flame to excess, otherwise too
great a lowering of its temperature takes place. I have, for
instance, obtained in this manner a bluish flame which did
not show the slightest trace of sodium in a room where suf
ficient sodium had been burnt to make every gas-flame give
a strong sodium reaction.
   The supply of carbon dioxide to the Bunsen burner may be
adjusted in the following manner —A cork is attached to the
movable cover which closes the two holes for admitting air,
and two holes made in it opposite the air-holes; to one a
glass tube is attached which is connected with a bottle, into
which carbon dioxide is passed, fitted with three openings.
By opening clamps the carbon dioxide may be all passed into
the Bunsen burner, or passed directly out from the bottle.
The sodium is first brought into vivid combustion, and then
the flame cooled down by admission of the proper supply of
carbon dioxide.
   The reversed line may also be shown by burning sodium in
a spirit-lamp with four wicks, in the centre of which is a jet
for the admission of oxygen. This is placed between the
slit and the limelight. On passing oxygen into the flame,
the heat may be raised sufficiently high to produce a bright
Na band upon the screen, especially if the light from the
incandescent lime is somewhat moderated, and turned into a
dark band when the oxygen is shut off, proving that the
production of a dark or bright sodium-band depends upon
the temperature of the absorbent vapour.
XL. On the Characteristic Curves and Surfaces of Incan
   descence Lamps. By J. A. FLEMING, M.A., D.Sc. (Lond.),
   Fellow of St. John's College, Cambridge".
Rºº<U+017F>            issues of a scientific journal f have contained
        some interesting letters and notes on the life of incan
descence lamps, and on resulting deductions to be made
   * Communicated by the Physical Society: read March 14, 1885.

              and Surfaces of Incandescence Lamps.            369
 therefrom. The difficulty of the full and complete discussion
 of this subject is the absence of sufficiently prolonged experi
 ments to give statistics reliable for this purpose. These can
 only be obtained at great º: and by experiments lasting
 over a considerable time; but the results to hand make a
 preliminary investigation interesting on the connection which
 exists between the life of incandescence lamps and other
 correlated quantities.
    The manufacture of incandescence lamps has now advanced
to such a condition that the accidents of manufacture are
greatly under control. The conditions necessary to get a
 good lamp are fairly well understood, and the physical actions
going on in the lamp are also to a great extent known. We
 now know that the expectations of earlier investigators of
 getting an absolutely unalterable carbon incandescence lamp
are not destined to be fulfilled; but we know that the gradual
 destruction of the filament is an operation dependent upon
 several causes, which may be greatly delayed by attention to,
and success in, certain operations of manufacture.
   The gradual destruction of the carbon filament in a vacuum
lamp is a kind of erosion taking place at one or more points.
Observation seems to show that in a single loop-filament this
cutting through takes place most generally near the negative
side. The determining cause of breakage is, however, tem
perature; and carbon imº which present such inequalities
of resistance as to give rise to spots of    º       temperature
might, other things

                      ††,    equal, be expected to be doomed to
                     Lamp-filaments are therefore like human
lives: some come into the world with a taint of disease upon
them, in the shape of irregularity of structure, which pre
disposes to an  º      death; but nevertheless, as even in the
case of suicide, the great law of averages overrides particular
instances, and gives us, in the case of a sufficiently extended
series of observations, a law connecting the average behaviour
under fixed circumstances.
   Experience gained during three years of commercial manu
facture and use of incandescence lamps has demonstrated that
when a large number of filaments are prepared with identical
care, and the lamps made with them sorted out into batches,
and worked with varying electromotive force, there is a very
constant relation between the average efficiency or candles
per horse-power and the average duration or life, and the
working potential or volts of the lamp. Now, in a general
way we do not know what the form of the function is that
connects these three quantities, or any two of them, but there
have been a large number of observations on the relation of

370      Dr. J. A. Fleming on the Characteristic Curves
certain variables which indicate as a most probable form an
exponential function.
   There are four variables between which a relation is required
—electromotive force, resistance, candle-power, and life. The
third of these is at present somewhat vague and indeterminate.
What we really are concerned with is the total eye-affecting
radiation ; and our present methods only allow of a certain
more or less imperfect comparison of this as a whole with that
of a standard candle, or a calculation of the integral deduced
from observation of the relative intensities of certain rays.
Accordingly, of these four quantities two alone can be measured
with any great accuracy. One is merely an average, and the
other is necessarily a somewhat ill-defined quantity.
   Between any two of these variables we can seek a relation,
and having a number of observations we plot down these in
what are best called the characteristic curves of the lamp.
Now two of the most important of these curves are those
connecting the electromotive force and efficiency, or candles
per horse-power, and the electromotive force and life; and they
may therefore be called the principal characteristic curves of
the lamp. Three other useful curves may be obtained by
plotting down the curves connecting candle-power and current,
candle-power and electromotive force, and electromotive force
and resistance. These may be called subsidiary characteristic
Cul"Wes.
   Since the life and efficiency of a lamp vary together with
the electromotive force, we can only properly represent the
relation between the three by a surface, which may be called
the characteristic surface of the lamp.
   Take three rectangular axes, w, y, z (fig. 1), and let dis
tances measured outwards represent life, candles per horse
power, and electromotive force. Let a curve be drawn on
they a plane, representing the relation of electromotive force
and life, and one on the ºr 2 plane representing electromotive
force and efficiency; let the ordinates be drawn at various
points to both these curves, starting from abscissae, representing
certain pressures vi, r, &c. Complete the rectangles on the
ordinates k, l, &c.; and we see that these rectangles form the
orthogonal sections of a solid bounded respectively by the
two planes a y and a 2, and two curved surfaces, of which the
characteristic curves l and k are the traces on these planes.
The surface of this volume may be called the characteristic
surface of the lamp. We see that the area of the orthogonal
section parallel to y z gradually increases to a maximum, and
then decreases. This is obviously because, for zero electro
motive force, life is infinite and candles per horse-power zero;

             and Surfaces of Incandescence Lamps.                  371
whilst for very high electromotive force, life is zero and
candles per horse-power or efficiency a maximum. Now the
area of cross section which is a maximum for a certain value
vs of electromotive force represents the product of life and
candles per horse-power, or the maximum candle-hours per
horse-power it is possible to get; and the value of k l is there
fore a very important quantity. I shall call this maximum
value of k l the principal modulus of the lamp, because the
value of the lamp for commercial purposes is obtained by
dividing the numeric representing this principal modulus by
the price of the lamp, taking either the cost of manufacture
or the selling-price,   º             as the question is considered
from a manufacturer's or purchaser's point of view.
   Fig. 1. Diagram of the principal Characteristic Curves of a Lamp.
   The product k l is itself a function of the electromotive
force, and the value of the electromotive force which makes
this quantity a maximum is an important one to determine.
It is the pressure at which the lamp should be worked in order
to realize the greatest quantity of light for a given expenditure
of energy in the lamp.
   Let us next consider the form of the function which ex
presses these characteristic curves. Take, for instance, the
curve of life and electromotive force.             We do not know
 whether this curve is a continuous curve, whether it is
asymptotic to axis of y, or, in fact, how it behaves beyond

372       Dr. J. A. Fleming on the Characteristic Curves
the limits of the values of electromotive force v, for which
lamps are incandescent. We have, however, certain values
for l corresponding to values of v not lying far on either side
 of the ordinary so-called “marked volts” of the lamp. When
 the writer was in America he was shown a large number of
 observations, made with the view of determining the relation
 between average life and electromotive force, not far on either
 side of 100 volts, taken for the Edison 108-volt A lamp. For
 this lamp the life-pressure curve at or near the working
pressure is approximately a logarithmic curve whose equa
tion is
                              l=Av-",
where A and a are constants; and for the Edison 16-candle
 105-volt lamp a is nearly 25; and, accordingly, life varies
inversely as the 25th power, roughly, of the electromotive
force. In the figures shown to the writer the life-pressure
curve had been drawn for pressures corresponding to lives far
in excess of what could actually have been observed during
the time filament-lamps have been made, reaching up to
11,793 hours. This is obviously       iº.         : we do not know
that a is not itself a function of v, and for pressures departing
far from the ordinary working-pressure the variation of
average life and pressure is not probably expressed by so
simple a relation; and we cannot go fairly beyond the limits
of actually observed lives. M. Foussat has recently communi
cated to a scientific journal the results of observations on the
life of French Edison lamps.

of observations on the relation of average life and pressure at

               and Surfaces of Incandescence Lamps.                      373
and taking logarithms of both, we have the figures given in
Table I.
   Writing down the differences between successive values of
log v and log l, we get the numbers—
         455    .........   11621          432     .........   10513

   Now, if l-Avi-", then
                 log l-log li– —a(log Av-log Avi),
where l and li, v and vi are adjacent values of l and v;
accordingly,

                            T    log Av-log Avi
   The mean of the differences of log l divided by the mean of
the differences of log v gives 25:4 nearly; and, accordingly,
M. Foussat’s numbers agree with those found in America in
assigning to a a value not far from 25 for the Edison lamp.
In the neighbourhood of 100 volts
                                  l= Av-”;
or, average life varies inversely as the 25th power of electro
motive force.
   This, however, is easily seen to be a very rough approxi
mation. The successive quotients of life-difference by volt
difference are not constant; and the above simple exponential
formula cannot be admitted as anything more than a very
imperfect connection. In examining the Carlisle Tables of
Mortality, which give the expectation of life at every age
drawn from a very large number of observations, it was appa
rent that an empirical formula connecting the two quantities
could be obtained of a form
                         log e=a+ba + ca”--&c.",
where e=expectation of life at any age a.
   I was led therefore to try if such an empirical formula
better suited the present case; and a process of trial and
   * Let r be the age, and e the expectation of life at that age. Then by
the Carlisle Tables of Mortality at the several ages 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60,
70, 80, 90, the  jº.            expectations of life are:—48-82, 41.46, 34:34,
27.61, 21:11, 14:34, 9:18, 5:51, 328; and it can easily be found that
              10loge=172–1:     IOO T 10,000

the calculated values from which are:—496,44,366,286, 209,143,964,

374        Dr. J. A. Fleming on the Characteristic Curves

is a formula which       #.      very nearly correct results in calcu
lating the life of a lamp l, given the working-pressure v in
 volts. This may be expressed otherwise:—

for log l and l, l being the average life in hours of the 100

    It is evident, then, that the simple exponential function
does not give nearly so good results as a formula of this latter
description; and there is no doubt but that by a suitable
selection of constants a formula can be cº expressing
the life of the lamp as a function of electromotive force

larger collection of statistics is obtained we shall not be in an
position to determine if these constants are definite for eac
type of lamp or kind of carbon, and whether the average life of
a lamp can be predicted from a knowledge of these constants.
   An attempt was made, in the next place, to endeavour to
obtain an approximate empirical formula connecting the
efficiency of a lamp, or the candles per horse-power, and the
electromotive force. On April 13, 1882, Prof. A. Jamieson
read a paper before the Society of Telegraph Engineers and
of Electricians (Journ. Soc. Tel. Eng. vol. xi. p. 164), “On
Tests of Incandescent Lamps,” and he has there given a
number of tables and curves for different lamps, giving the
efficiencies and resistances for various electromotive forces.
   These observations afford a convenient means of putting to
 the test empirical formulae, because the observations seem to
 have been carried out with very great care, and being done
 with secondary and primary batteries as current generators,
 the observations are more likely to be accurate than when a
 current from a dynamo machine is used; also because the
 observations for candle-power were entrusted to Dr. Wallace,
 gas-analyst for Glasgow, and were therefore in the hands of
 an observer whose eye was probably more trained to detect
 minute differences of illumination than one not so familiar
 with such work.
    Professor Jamieson gives one complete table of the constants
 of an Edison 8-candle lamp over a great range of candle
 power. Selecting that portion of the table in which the
 electromotive force was high enough to illuminate the lamp,
 we have as follows:—

   Excepting the first and last values, which are the result of
observations on the candle-power at extreme values, the inter
mediate figures are not very far from constant, and indicate,
as a first rough approximation, that efficiency varies as the
fourth power of the electromotive force.
   At both high and low candle-powers the comparison of the
light with a standard candle is difficult. In one case an
excess of red, and in the other an excess of violet rays makes
the comparison of the naked lights much more difficult at
extremes, and, as is well known, the efficiency for very high
or low candle-power must be stated for a definite radiation.

Committee appointed to report on the incandescence lamps in
the Paris Electrical Exhibition, an abstract of which appears
in the same volume of the ‘Journal of the Society of Tele

four varieties of lamps into the following numbers for the

difference of the logarithm of the efficiencies with the differ
ence of the logarithm of the corresponding electromotive
forces for each lamp, we have the following ratios:—

represents an approximate formula for calculating the effi
ciency. If, now, approximately, in the case of an Edison
lamp, the candles per horse-power vary as the 4.5 power of the
electromotive force, and the life varies inversely as the 25th
power of the electromotive force, it follows that
                                        1
or, roughly, that the life varies inversely as some power
between 5 and 6 of the candles per horse-power.
    The writer was given in America an extensive series of
observations on the relation between the candles per horse
power and the average life, which were as follows:—

   The length of life, 11,793 hours, given as corresponding to
an efficiency of 100 candles per horse-power, is nearly equal
to four years of average burning in working hours, and could
not have been the result of actual observation; but these
numbers agree very closely with the law that
                                      1
                               loc
where l represents life in hours and k candles per horse
power.      It is most probable that this law has been deduced
from observations on the life lying within an observed range
and then extended by calculation to efficiencies below those
actually observed. . In any case these observations are not in
great discord with the above deductions made from the
numbers furnished by M. Foussat on the connection between
life and electromotive force, in conjunction with other observa
tions on the relation of efficiency to working pressure in the
case of Edison lamps.
   It is, however, far more probable that the connection between
the candles, per horse-power and the working pressure is
expressible by a formula of this kind,
                       log k=2 + 8 + yº” +&c.,
where 2, 8, y are known constants; and in this case we should
have then both the life-pressure characteristic curve, and the
efficiency-pressure characteristic curve expressed by analogous
equations:—                                  -
                        log l-a+bv-H ce”--&c.,
                        log k=2 + 8v +yv°--&c.
We have seen above that such a formula does fit in with
observed values for one pair of variables.             Further examina
tion of this point is desirable.

              and Surfaces of Incandescence Lamps.                  379
   Professors Ayrton and Perry have drawn attention * to a
connection between the candle-power of a lamp and the working
potential, and they find that in very many cases the cube root
of the candle-power is proportional to the working potential
minus a constant. Now, this is equivalent to saying that the
candle-power of the lamp is proportional to the cube of the
potential measured above a certain point.
   I have examined some records of measurements of Edison
lamps to put this law to further test, and the results are
given below for two 16-candle Edison lamps measured by
myself, and one 8-candle lamp measured by Prof. Jamieson.

380       Dr. J. A. Fleming on the Characteristic Curves
    In these cases we see that the cube root of the candle-power
is very nearly proportional to the excess of the electromotive
force above a certain point. Now, on examining a number of
such cases, it appears that this constant is the value of that
electromotive force at which the lamp just begins to give signs
of incandescence. In the case of the 8-candle lamp above,
Professor Jamieson marks in his table against the E.M.F.
287 “filament bright red.”. It will be very interesting if
further examination should give confirmation to this surmise;
but the above figures seem to indicate that the cube root of
the candle-power is proportional to the electromotive force
reckoned from the neighbourhood of that pressure at which
the filament begins to give out light. If we call this excess
pressure the “effective volts,” then we can state the rule that
the cube root of the candle-power is proportional to the effec
tive volts. We have then, according to the observations of
 Professors Ayrton and Perry, in a certain number of cases
an empirical law of this kind,
                            &/K= a(v-b),
in which K is the candle-power measured at a pressure v.
    This may be written
                     § log K=log a +log (v-b).
    By ordinary algebraic theory we have

sponding working electromotive force.

fact, that within a certain     º the        candle-power of a lamp
varies approximately as the sixth power of the current passing".

   The table shows that, with considerable accuracy, over a
range from two to sixteen candles, the incandescence varies as
the sixth power of the current.
   In those characteristics into which candle-power enters in
any way, there is a considerable difficulty in getting results
with sufficient accuracy to determine the constants of the
characteristic equations. There is, however, one pair of
variables, namely electromotive force and resistance, both of
which can be measured with very high accuracy over a great
range; and some very interesting examples of these pressure
resistance curves are given by Professor Jamieson in his
memoir above alluded to.                        -
   A very short examination of the way in which an incan
descence lamp behaves under increasing electromotive force,
shows that the resistance decreases with increase of electro
motive force, but that it does not decrease without limit; it
tends to a minimum value, beyond which it appears to be
constant. This is very strikingly shown for some of the Swan
lamps tested by Professor Jamieson. In his paper certain
formulae are given connecting various lamp-constants, and as
a first approximation to a pressure-resistance equation is given
the following:—        log P=log E + ar,
 where P is a constant, E=E.M.F., and r=resistance.
    It is not possible that such a formula should represent
 correctly the relation of resistance to pressure at high pres
 sures, because it in no way expresses the fact that resistance
tends to a minimum with increasing electromotive force.
    An empirical formula can, however, be obtained which will
 express this in the following way:
    }. R be the resistance of a lamp measured with any elec
 tromotive force, E, at the terminals. Let Eo represent the
 electromotive force at which the lamp just becomes incandes
 cent, and let Ro be the corresponding resistance. Let r be
 the minimum resistance to which the lamp approximates, as

E increases, until the filament breaks. Then
                       R=r-i- 10 log (Ro-r)-A(E-Eo)
is an expression which has the following properties:—
                       If E=Eo, then R-Ro;
                       if E = 0: , ,, R=r.
   The above formula is otherwise written
             log (R-r)|=log (Ro-r)—A(E–E).
This formula has been tested for an Edison 8-candle lamp of
which the resistance was measured over a considerable range
by Professor Jamieson, and the resistance-pressure curve
given in his paper. For this lamp luminosity commenced
at 28-7 volts, and at this pressure it had a resistance of 734
ohms; its resistance gradually decreased with increasing pres
sure until it became apparently constant and equal to 53.5
ohms. Taking A equal to sº, we have
50 log (R—53-5)+(E–28:7)=50 log (73.4–53'5)=64.945.

   The accordance between the observed and calculated resist
ances is fairly close. It seems very probable, from an inspection
of the values at very low electromotive forces, that the resist
ance is a function of the electromotive force, reckoned from
the pressure b, at which the lamp-filament begins to be bright
red, and that of R is the resistance corresponding to any
electromotive force, E, and r is the minimum resistance to
which the lamp tends. Then
          log (R—r)=A + B(E—b)+C(E–b)*+&c.,
where A B C, &c. are constants. If this should be the case,
then it may be possible to express the life, candles per horse
power, candle-power, and resistance of a lamp, all as similar
functions of the electromotive force, knowing certain constants

             and Surfaces of Incandescence Lamps.                383
and the two values of electromotive force at which the lamp
becomes incandescent, and the resistance to which it finally
tends to obtain. When, however, we are dealing with com
paratively small variations of electromotive force, it is possible
to calculate both life and efficiency from a simpler exponential
function of the form—         l or ºr
                             R octy
when a and y are numerics. Assuming such an approximate
formula, it becomes possible to deal with an interesting
question, which has been discussed also by Professors Ayrton
and Perry", but which is capable of being investigated in a
slightly different manner from that adopted by them in their
paper. We shall take the warrant we have in the above
figures for the assumption that for electromotive forces not
far from those at which the lamp is intended to be used in the
case of an Edison lamp, say 100 volts,
   Average life varies inversely as the twenty-fifth power of
     the electromotive force ;
   Efficiency, or candles per horse-power, varies as the fourth
      power of the electromotive force;
   Candle's light varies as the sixth power of the current, and
      therefore as the sixth power of the electromotive force,
     seeing that the resistance alters very little after the lamp
     has reached fair incandescence ;
   And that therefore life varies inversely as the sixth-and-a
      quarter power of the efficiency, and also inversely as the
      fourth-and-a-quarter power of the candle-power.
   Let p be the price of a lamp in pounds sterling, or fractions
of a pound.
   Let l be the average life in hours, c the actual candle-power,
and k the candles per horse-power, when run at a certain
electromotive force v.
   Then: is the cost of one candle-light per hour as far as the
lamp itself is concerned. Let P be the cost of 1 horse-power
hour of electric energy expended in the filament. P will not
be the same for all amounts, 1000 P costs less than ten times
100 P, but for the small variations we are considering we
shall consider P to be a constant.       Then    º is the cost of the
power in making one candle-light for one hour, and the
total cost of getting one candle-light for one hour is
                            Plº–

   The first term is the expense of the translating device, and
it may be called the cost of lampage.
   The second term is the cost of the production of the energy
which passes through the translating device or lamp-filament
and is converted into eye-affecting radiant energy, and this
may be called the machinage; hence the total expense of
keeping going incandescent light is made up of lampage and
machinage. Now, we can procure a given amount of light
either by running the lamps very high, in which case lamps
will cost a great deal, and power less in proportion, or we can
run the lamps very low and save in lampage, whilst expending
more in power in a greater number of lamps; and the question
arises, apart from capital expenditure, at what point is the
greatest economy obtained, or, in other words, what proportion
ought lampage to bear to machinage in order that the total
cost may be a minimum? To solve this we shall assume, as
is very probable, that for the limit of variation of E.M.F.
employed the average life of the lamp is an exponential
function either of the candles per horse-power k, or of the
candle's light c, for the particular lamps considered.
   Let lie :   and l =  º be the functions.  a. and 8 have defi
nite values at a given E.M.F.; A and B are constants.

in which B' and A<U+017F> are constants.
   Now this expresses the total cost of working as a function
of the average life at a certain E.M.F.

and hence ratio of lampage to total cost is 23    4 =17.4 per cent.
   Hence we arrive at this curious result, that independently
of the cost of the lamp, or electrical energy, we must run at
such a pressure that lampage is about 18 per cent. of the
total cost. Now, if instead of employing these approximate
exponential expressions for the values of l, c, and k in terms
of the electromotive force, we had introduced the more accu
rate forms of equation indicated above, we should have had an
equation in terms of v to solve as the result of equating the
differential to zero, which would, by the introduction of the
proper constants, give the value of electromotive force at which
the total cost becomes a minimum. In their paper, Professors
Ayrton and Perry have calculated to a fraction of a volt what
 this economical potential is. As, however, the characteristic
 equations are only approximate, it seems hardly necessary to
 do more than obtain a similar approximate expression for the
 economical working.
    At the Edison lamp-factory in America calculations were
made, on the assumption of a particular type of lamp and
 length of life and cost ofj.". to ascertain the ratio of lampage
 to total cost, which made the total cost a minimum, and the
 result appeared to be to fix it at about 16 per cent. These
 calculations are therefore in singular accord with the deduc
 tion of theory based on determination of the constants of the
 characteristic curves, arrived at both by graphic and analytical
methods.
 XLI. Experiments on the Electromagnetic Action of Dielectric
            #. By Prof. W. C. RöNTGEN”.
 THE theory of electrical and magnetic phenomena proposed
        by Faraday and elaborated by Clerk-Maxwell, is based
 upon the assumption that in insulators bounded by electrified
 conductors there exists a dielectric polarization or displace
 ment—a change which, in whatever way produced, exerts
 electrodynamic effects exactly like an electric current flowing
 in a conductor.
   * Translated from the Sitzungsberichte der Berliner Akad. der Wissen
 schaften for February 26, 1885.

386        Prof. W. C. Röntgen on the Electromagnetic
    Helmholtz has shown that none of the consequences of this
 assumption are opposed to the fundamental laws of mechanics,
and that this assumption, together with the extended law of
potential, affords a complete explanation of the phenomena
presented by closed and by so-called open conductors.
    So far as I know, however, no direct experimental proof
has been given of the correctness of the assumption of F.
day and Maxwell; and I have for several years         the inten
 tion to fill this gap when the opportunity presented itself.
After many fruitless attempts I have at last been successful in
finding a method which yields practical and decisive results,
 of which I venture here to give an account. A good insu
 lating disk of ebonite, 0.5 centim. thick and 16 centim. dia
 meter, was mounted upon a vertical axis, which by means of
a string could be put into rapid rotation (120 to 150 revolu
tions per second) in a horizontal plane. Beneath the disk
and parallel with it was placed a perforated glass plate of 17.5
centim. diameter, provided with two half-ring coatings of
tinfoil: the inner radius of the rings was 2.25 centim. and the
outer radius 7 centim. ; the portion cut out between the two
half-rings was 1.4 centim. wide. Above the ebonite disk also
was fixed a second horizontal glass plate of 21.5 centim. dia
meter, which was completely coated with tinfoil. The tinfoil
coatings of the two glass plates faced the ebonite disk, and
were at a distance from it of about 0:1 centim.; the coating
of the upper plate was permanently connected to earth. Either
of the half-rings could be placed in connection with the
inner coating f a large Leyden jar, so that the one became
positively electrified, and the other at the same time nega
tively. A commutator permitted the electrification to be
changed.
   It will now be understood that the dielectric polarization
produced in the rotating ebonite disk by the electrification of
the tinfoil coatings changes its sign at the point where the
interval between the coatings occurred. Upon the one half
of the disk (say the front half) the particles moved from the
positive towards the negative half-ring, and a displacement of
  ositive electricity took place while they passed from the one
|.         to the other, which would have a vertical component
tending downwards. At the same time on the other (hinder)
half of the disk, there would be a vertical component tending
upwards. These displacements lasted as long as the disk
rotated with unaltered electrification; and they must there
fore, according to the theory of Faraday and Maxwell, pro
duce the same electromagnetic effect as continuous currents,
which, for the direction of rotation assumed, would circulate
downwards in the front half of the disk, and upwards in the

                Action of Dielectric Polarization.           387
back half. The question is, then, whether these vertical com
ponents do actually exert such an effect.
   In order to determine this, the upper glass plate was sur
mounted by a metallic case, connected to earth, which con
tained an extremely sensitive astatic pair of needles; the
lower needle was about 0:6 centim. distant from the ebonite
plate, its centre being in the prolongation of the axis of
rotation of the disk, and its direction parallel to the dividing
line of the two half-rings; the length of the needle was
about 4.8 centim., a little more than the inner diameter of the
half-rings. The second needle was situated 21.5 centim.
above the lower one. The deviations were read by means of a
telescope and scale at a distance of 3 metres. All the neces
sary precautions were taken that the needle should not be
affected by external statical electricity; and a special con
struction of the axis was adopted so that the deviations pro
duced by rotational magnetism should be as small as possible
(2 to 3 divisions of the scale). Notwithstanding, upon rapid
rotation of the disk the needle changed its position of rest
continually, which made the observations much more difficult.
The reason of these motions lay, as I satisfied myself, in
currents of air, and more particularly in small vibrations to
which the apparatus was       ;          in consequence of the
defective arrangements of the Institute here.
    The experiments were arranged so that one observer sat
at the telescope whilst an assistant revolved the disk, and
another changed the commutator upon a signal from the
 observer.
    The observer intentionally remained ignorant of the direc
 tion in which the commutator was moved until the end of the
 series of experiments;  $º         the commutator was changed
 eight times during each series of experiments. There was
 no possibility of accurately determining the magnitude of the
 deflection produced by reversal of the commutator, since in
 all cases it was very small and under the best conditions only
 amounted to 1-5     #.       of the scale, generally amounting
 only to a fraction of a division. The observer therefore con
 fined his attention to determining the direction of the deflec
 tion each time, and for this a certain amount of practice was
 necessary in consequence of the continual small motions of
 the needle.    As the result of more than 1000 observations I
 have obtained so much practice that in the later experiments
 I have been able almost without mistake to determine every
 time the direction of deflection.
    From these experiments, which were varied in many ways,
 the result was obtained that the deflection always agreed with
 that given by Faraday's theory. The change in the dielectric

388               Notices respecting New Books.
polarization consequently exerts an electromagnetic force,
exactly like an electric current flowing through a conductor
in the same direction in which the displacement of positive
electricity in an insulator takes place.
   The complete description of the experiments here briefly
described, as well as of the numerous experiments made for
the purpose of excluding all possible deception, will be given
elsewhere.
    I am now occupied with the construction of a piece of
apparatus upon the same principle, which I hope will possess
 fewer defects and will be capable of producing greater deflec
 tions than those described. Also I intend to put to experi
 * eory.

 arranged apparatus I have repeated Rowland’s experiment
 described by Prof. Helmholtz as a test of its sensitiveness.
 The ebonite disk without coatings was charged by means of
 points. Upon reversal of the electrifications a deflection of 8
 to 10 scale-divisions took place each time.

 Lenses and Systems of Lenses, treated after the manner of Gauss.
    By CHARLEs PENDLEBURY, M.A. Cambridge: Deighton, Bell, &
    Co.; 95 pp.
 IN the ordinary treatment of a lens it has been usual in our text
      books to limit the discussion to the case of a “thin" lens only.
 The result is, a number of interesting propositions are obtained
 which are practically false. Gauss, as Mr. Pendlebury states, in
 a paper which he communicated to the Royal Society of Göttingen
 (Dec. 10, 1840), shows “how the solution of the (general) problem
could be made to depend upon the determination, for each system
 and once for all, of four fixed points situated upon the axis of the
 system. These points having been determined, the complete solu
tion became a matter of simple algebra or geometry.” The method
is applicable to any system of coaxial lenses, whatever their thick
nesses, provided the angle made by any ray with the axis, and the
distance from the axis of the point of section of any surface, are
small. This is, so far as our reading extends, the first attempt to
introduce the treatment to English readers in a work intended for
students; for this the author deserves their thanks.       We have
noticed a very few passages where an idiom reminds us of a Ger
man origin; some few more where there are slips which may
mislead the student; and some which appear to be incorrect. As,
however, the author will no doubt have detected these and will
remove them in the more extended treatment of the subject upon
which we believe he is now engaged, we do not note them here.

ordinarily employed at Kew Observatory in place of those of the
 ‘Nautical Almanac.' This year's issue differs slightly from its
predecessors, the times of transit being given to the nearest tenth,
instead of, as previously, to the nearest hundredth, of a second.
There is also an additional set of Tables, giving for each alternate
day certain astronomical data, among others, the Sun's semidiameter.
The last would be much more conveniently placed immediately
after the column containing the time of the Sun's transit. The
introductory matter contains much useful information as to the
method of using the Transit instrument and obtaining true time
in any part of the world. The book will prove a very useful
adjunct to the private observatory.

   The specimens described in this paper were collected by Mr. J.

390                      Geological Society:—
Eccles on the Dom du Gouté, about 14,000 feet above the sea-level.
The rock, which has been fused by the lightning, is a hornblendic
gneiss. The fusion in the specimens examined is quite superficial.
The hornblende has been converted into a dark, and the felspar into
a white, glass, which, as a rule, remain distinct. The fulgurite in
some cases consists of small spheres of glass, mostly of dark colour,
which, in one instance, appear to have been spurted over the surface
of the rock while in a state of fusion. The fulgurite glass is quite
free from microliths, and shows only gas-bubbles and enclosures of
glass, the latter usually containing nests of such bubbles. In
conclusion, a comparison was made between this fulgurite and
the Bouteillenstein or pseudo-chrysolite of Bohemia, which is now
regarded by Makowsky and others as an artificially formed glass.
    3. “On Brecciated Porfido-rosso-antico.”        By Frank Rutley,
Esq., F.G.S.
   The variety of this well-known hornblende-porphyrite here de
scribed shows a distinctly brecciated structure when examined in
thin section under the microscope.          The fragments sometimes
appear to fit together, at others they are more or less widely sepa
rated, so that the section at first sight presents almost the aspect of
a tuff.   Careful examination shows that this brecciated structure
is due merely to the rock having been crushed and the fragments
connected in situ by siliceous infiltrations. Delesse's observations
upon the varieties of the rock were discussed.       A few additional
remarks were also made upon the mineral constitution of the spe
cimens described.

   The following communications were read:—
   1. “The Granitic and Schistose Rocks of Donegal and some other
parts of Ireland.” By C. Callaway, D.Sc., F.G.S.
   The Author first recalled attention to the current theories on the
nature of the Donegal granitic rock—one which described it as a
highly metamorphosed portion of a sedimentary series, another which
regarded it as a mass of Laurentian gneiss. In his view, however,
it was a true igneous granite, posterior in age to the associated
schists.   In six districts examined it was intrusive and sent out
veins. The apparent interstratification with bedded rocks was ex
plained as a series of comparatively regular intrusions. Where the
granite was seen in contact with limestone, the latter contained
garnets and other accessory minerals. No gradation could be dis
covered between the granite and any other rock, the junctions (even
in the case of small fragments of schist immersed in granite) being
 well marked.
   The granite was distinctly foliated. In some localities there was
merely a linear arrangement of the mica; but near the western

         On Hollow Spherulites in ancient British Lavas.           391
margin of the granite promontory there was a striping of light and
dark bands, the colour of the latter being due to the abundance of
black mica. The gneissic structure was attributed to lateral pres
sure, the existence of which in the associated strata was seen in the
conversion of grits into schist-like rocks, in the production of
cleavage in beds of coarse materials, in the crushed condition of
some masses, in the overthrow of folds, and in the production of
planes of thrust. The direction of the pressure was perpendicular
to the planes of foliation in the granite.
    The schistose rocks of the region were divided into two groups.
The Lough Foyle series consisted of quartzites, quartzose grits with
a mineralized matrix, slaty-looking schists, fine-grained satiny
schists, black phyllites, and crystalline limestones and dolomites.
The semicrystalline condition of most of these rocks was character
istic. This series was well seen at Londonderry and on Lough
Foyle, and formed a broad band striking to the south-west. These
rocks were compared with similar types in the Hill of Howth
(north of Dublin), near Aughrim (co. Wicklow), and south of Wex
ford. The Leinster semicrystalline masses were quite unlike the
Wicklow Cambrians, and bore a strong resemblance to the slaty
series of Anglesey. They were lithologically intermediate between
the Donegal and Anglesey groups, and from a comparison of all
these areas the author referred the Lough-Foyle Series, with some
 confidence, to the Pebidian system. The prolongation of the Lough
 Foyle rocks into the Grampian region was well known, and Ireland
thus served to connect some parts of the Scottish highlands with
 South Britain.     The author was not prepared to correlate this
 Donegal series with any American group; but the lithological affi
 nities were rather with the Taconian than with the Huronian.
    The Kilmacrenan series, in which the granite is intrusive, was
 described as crystalline and older than the Lough-Foyle group. It
 was mainly made up of micaceous, quartzose, hornblendic, and hydro
 magnesian schists, quartzites, and crystalline limestones. There
 were no indications in these rocks of a metamorphism progressive
 in the direction of the granite. This series was lithologically similar
 to the Montalban system.
    Fifty-five microscopic slides of Donegal and Leinster rocks had
 been examined by Prof. Bonney, whose observations confirmed
 those of the Author both as regards the nature and relations of the
 granite and the general characters and state of crystallization of the
 two schistose groups.
    2. “On Hollow Spherulites and their occurrence in ancient
 British Lavas.” By Grenville A. J. Cole, Esq., F.G.S.
    Many of the felstones of North Wales have been shown to be altered
 lava-flows of an originally glassy type. In several localities, as in
 the Pass of Llanberis, at the foot of the Glyder-fawr, these rocks
 contain numerous nodular bodies, from I'm inch to some inches in
 diameter.    The smaller varieties have the appearance of spheru
 lites, but the larger are very often hollow, their cavities being
 partly filled with minerals deposited by infiltration. The lavas

392                       Geological Society.
thus receive a scoriaceous character, and have been described as
slaggy and vesicular. Similar structures, such as the “Lithophysen”
of Von Richthofen, occur in rocks of much later date, and the theory
advanced by Szabó, that their cavities have been formed by the
weathering-out of the centres of spherulites, has been pretty gene
rally accepted. A consideration of hollow spherulites of very dif
ferent sizes from Iceland, Lipari, and the Yellowstone area, tends
strongly to support this view, those portions that show radial struc
ture being most easily attacked by the agents of decomposition.
The merely concentric coats of the spherulite, on the other hand,
consisting mainly of globulitic particles and glass, remain but little
altered, and a series of hollow shells may arise one within the
other, by the complete removal of the intervening radial matter.
The frequent association of perlitic structure and hollow spherulites
in the same rock may be due to the number of channels provided in
such cases for the passage of water or acid vapours.
   Structures resembling the “Lithophysen” of Hungary occur in
the altered rhyolites of the Wrekin, the cavities being filled with
quartz; and the hollow nodules of the Silurian felsites in the Pass
of Llanberis prove, on microscopic examination, to have been ori
ginally spherulites. Many of these nodules show marked radial
structure in their central areas; and every gradation exists between
the solid varieties and those which have been hollowed out or re
placed by products of infiltration. The completion of such a process
of alteration might cause a rock not originally vesicular to be re
garded as an ordinary amygdaloid.

   The following communications were read:—
   1. “A General Section of the Bagshot Strata from Aldershot to
Wokingham.” By the Rev. A. Irving, B.Sc., B.A., F.G.S.
  The Author referred to earlier papers in the “Geological Magazine,’
in which the green colouring-matter so common in the Middle and
Lower Bagshot strata of the London Basin had been attributed to
the presence of vegetable débris and the materials resulting from
decomposition of vegetable matter. The marked difference in this
respect between these strata and the higher members of the series
furnishes a clue to the conditions under which they were respec
tively deposited, the former being delta- and lagoon-deposits, the
latter the deposits of a marine estuary. This implies a transgressive
overlap of the upper portions of the Bagshot series upon the London
Clay; and the present paper was devoted to a consideration of the
statigraphical evidence of this overlap.
   Sections were described in detail at Aldershot, Farnborough,
Yateley, Camberley, Wellington College and the neighbourhood, and
from the last-named place to Wokingham. From these, a general
section was constructed to exact scale, both as to thickness of strata
and altitudes, showing a relation of the Bagshot formation to the
London Clay, which was inconsistent with the generally received idea

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.            393
of their conformability, and at variance with the mapping of the
district as executed by the Geological Survey.
   The importance of the Bagshot pebble-bed as a basement-line of
the upper division of the Bagshot strata was shown, as was suggested
by the author, so long ago as 1880.
   The synclinal arrangement of the London Clay was shown to have
been produced before the deposition of the Bagshot series, though a
certain amount of movement (with a resultant amount of 150 feet
of tilting in 13 miles from south to north) has since taken place.

EXPERIMENTAL        RESEARCHES     UPON   THE   DETERMINATION       OF
   THE DIELECTRIC CONSTANT OF SOME GASES.               BY DR. IGNAZ
   KLEMENölö,      PRIVATDOCENT AND       ASSISTANT IN      THE   UNI
   VERSITY OF GRAZ.
THE author determined the dielectric constant of some gases and
      vapours by the following method:—A large condenser, con
sisting of 30 nickel-plated brass circular plates of 25-76 centim.
diameter, was put upon a plate and covered by a glass globe
fitting air-tight to the plate. The plates of the condenser were
separated from each other by small ebonite plates 0.89 millim.
thick; but the rest of the space could be filled with air or any other
desired gas. The density of this dielectric medium could be varied
within certain limits, and the pressure read off upon a manometer.
The condenser was placed in communication with an air-pump and
with two large glass globes by means of tubes provided with taps.
The condenser and glass globes could be exhausted to a tolerably
low pressure, and it was also possible by means of a branch tube
to fill the condenser with any gas at a high pressure. When it
was necessary to exhaust the condenser rapidly, it was simply
placed in communication with the exhausted glass globes.
   This condenser was charged 64 times in every second, and dis
charged as frequently through a sensitive galvanometer by the use
of a tuning-fork, from a powerful battery of 22 small Bunsen
elements with solution of potassium bichromate. The deflection of
the galvanometer-needle thus produced is, as is well known, a
measure of the capacity of the condenser. If the electromotive
force of the charging-battery and the frequency with which it is
charged and discharged remain the same, any change in the
capacity of the condenser produces a corresponding change in the
deflection of the galvanometer.
   If the dielectric constant of the medium varies with the density,
then every change in the pressure within the condenser must pro
 duce a change in the position of the galvanometer-needle. The
deflection produced in the present case by the discharge of the con

394           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
denser was much too large to render possible the observation of
such a difference in position: it was therefore necessary to com
pensate this deflection, i.e. by means of an equal opposite action
upon the galvanometer-needle.
   Of the various possible modes of compensation the author em
ployed that of a constant current. A weaker battery (compen
sation battery of 4 Daniell cells) was employed to send a current
through a large resistance, and through the coil of the galvanometer
in the direction required to produce a deflection opposite to that
given by the discharges of the condenser. By altering the large
resistance of the compensation-current, it was easy to arrange that
the needle should remain in its position of equilibrium under the
simultaneous action of the two currents. If this adjustment had
been made for a definite capacity of the condenser, and if then
only the density of the dielectric medium was varied, a deflection
of the galvanometer-needle was observed, due to the change in the
capacity of the condenser produced by the change in density, and
consequently in the dielectric constant of the medium. The ratio
of the dielectric constants for two different densities of the medium
may be calculated from the easily determined deflection produced
by the compensating current and the observed deflection. In this
calculation it is only necessary to take account of the circumstance
that a small part of the condenser-discharge passes through the
compensation-circuit, and not through the galvanometer. As is
well known, both Professor Boltzmann and Messrs. Ayrton and
Perry have employed the electrometer for their investigations on
this subject. The condenser was charged for a much longer period
than in the present case; and this constitutes an essential dif
ference between the two methods. It is a great advantage of the
galvanometric method that good insulation is by no means so
necessary as with the electrometric method, and thus one of the
chief difficulties which such measurements offer is avoided.      The
question whether the accuracy of the results is disturbed by
electricity produced by the friction of the gas admitted to the
condenser does not here arise.                           -
   Besides the seven gases already examined by Prof. Boltzmann,
the author has also examined the dielectric constant of five vapours.
The results obtained with the seven gases and the vapour of carbon
disulphide agree very well with the determination of Boltzmann, and
with the electromagnetic theory of light. The dielectric constants
 of the remaining vapours do not satisfy the conditions given by this
 theory. The deflection of the galvanometer-needle was observed by
 means of a telescope, mirror, and scale, and it should be noticed that
 a change of pressure of 690 millim. in atmospheric air caused a
 change in position of 185 scale-divisions. The results are given in
 the following table, in which D denotes the ratio of the two di
 electric constants which the gas possessed at 0° C., and at two
 pressures differing by 760 millim.
    The refractive indices n are taken from the determinations of
Mascart. For the sake of comparison the corresponding results
 obtained by Boltzmann and by Ayrton and Perry are also given.

     ForMATION of A STALACTITE BY WAPOUR.                            BY J. BROWN".
     The following curious phenomenon occurred during the electro
lysis of the double chloride of aluminium and sodium fused in a
small porcelain crucible provided with a porous partition. The
anode was of carbon, and the cathode platinum-foil.
     A considerable quantity of vapour was given off, especially from
about the anode, forming a white smoke and depositing a white
substance, doubtless mainly hydrated aluminium chloride, on the
carbon rod, and about the mouth of the crucible, ultimately closing
up the latter all but a small hole, through which the vapour poured
rapidly. From this hole there grew out a beautifully delicate little
tube about 13, inch long, and tapering from about , inch at the base
to Tºr inch in the middle of its length, after which it increased in
diameter, and also flattened out owing to the vapour-jet coming
close over the bend of the platinum-foil cathode, which seemed to
cause, by some kind of eddy current, a flattening of the stream of
Walpour.
      . afterwards the supply of vapour slackened, and there was
a corresponding diminution in the size of the tube in the last quarter
inch of its length till the end became almost closed. The formation
of this tube seems quite analogous to that of the ordinary tubular
lime-carbonate stalactite deposited from dropping water by contact
with the atmosphere; only we have here a tubular deposit of hy
drated aluminium chloride by the combination, at the edge of the
growing tube, of the water-vapour in the air with the anhydrous
chloride contained in the vapour-stream.

        MEASUREMENT OF STRONG ELECTRICAL CURRENTS.
                       BY JOHN TROWBRIDGE.
   In 1871 I described in Silliman's Journal a new form of galvano
meter which I called the Cosine Galvanometer. Six or seven years
after the appearance of my paper, with a large woodcut of my instru
ment, the same instrument was re-invented in England by Mr. Obach,
and the instrument now goes by the name of the Obach galvano
meter in England, and is manufactured by the Messrs. Siemens,
for the measurement of strong electrical currents.
   In the prosecution of an investigation upon dynamo-electric
machines I abandoned the cosine galvanometer in favour of a
dynamometer which I invented, and a full description of which
will be found in the Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts
and Sciences, and also in the London Philosophical Magazine. It
seemed to me then, and I have had no reason to change my belief,
that a dynamometer is the most suitable instrument for measuring
strong currents. I have lately, however, employed the cosine
galvanometer for this purpose in the following manner:—The
galvanometer is mounted so that its compass is at the centre of a
large circle of wire, the plane of which is vertical and is in the
magnetic meridian or in the plane of the needle of the compass,
whatever that is. When the current from a dynamo machine is
passed through the large vertical coil, which may consist of a
single wire, the arrangement answers as a tangent galvanometer.
I then connect the movable coil of the cosine galvanometer with a
Daniell cell of known electromotive force, place in the same circuit
a resistance so large that the battery resistance can be neglected,
and having joined the poles in such a manner that the deflection
produced by the coil of the cosine galvanometer shall be opposite
to that produced by the current from the dynamo machine in the
large outer coil, I incline the coil of the cosine galvanometer until
the compass-needle is brought again to zero.
   We then have, if we represent by F and F the force produced
 at the centre of the coils by the current from the dynamo machine
 and by the Daniell cell, S and S' the respective currents, r and r'
 the radii, n and n' the number of coils in the two galvanometers,
and H the horizontal force of magnetism :—
              2n-nSH      , 2wn'S'H                 S'n' r
         F=          = P’ =     F-cos a, or S= I-, cosa.
    The strength of the current from the dynamo is thus simply
 obtained in terms of the current from the standard Daniell cell,
 and the method is independent of the strength of the earth's
 magnetism, or of the special field in which the instruments may be
 placed. The diameter of the outer coil can be diminished by
 employing Professor Brackett's method of passing the current
 through one coil in one direction and through an inside coil in
 another. In an experimental trial I employed simply a scaffolding
 of wood, upon which a single turn of wire was fixed as a vertical
 circle.—Silliman's American Journal, March 1885.

          XLV. On the Electromagnetic Wave-surface.
                    By OLIVER HEAVISIDE".
MA. Wºº            showed (Electricity and Magnetism, vol. ii.
        art. 794) that his equations of electromagnetic disturb
ances, on the assumption that the electric capacity varies in
different directions in a crystal, lead to the Fresnel form of
wave-surface. There is no obscurity arising from the ignored
wave of normal disturbance, because the very existence of a
plane wave requires that there be none. In fact, the electric
displacement and the magnetic induction are both in the
wave-front, and are perpendicular to one another. The mag
netic force and ...}. are parallel, on account of the
constant permeability; whilst the electric force, though not
parallel to the displacement, is yet perpendicular to the mag
netic induction (and force); the normal to the wave-front,
the electric force, and the displacement being in one plane.
The ray is also in this plane, perpendicular to the ...
force. There are of course two rays for (in general) every
direction of wave-normal, each with separate electromagnetic
variables to which the above remarks apply.
   It is easily proved, and it may be      ºitimately   inferred
without a formal demonstration, from a consideration of the
equations of induction, that if we consider the dielectric to be
isotropic as regards capacity, but eolotropic as regards per
meability, the same general results will follow, if we translate
capacity to permeability, electric to magnetic force, and elec

and permeability. The electric displacement is then a linear
function of the electric force, and the magnetic induction
another linear function of the magnetic force. The principal
axes of capacity, or lines of parallelism of electric force and
displacement, cannot, in the general case, be assumed to have
any necessary relation to the principal axes of permeability,
or lines of parallelism of magnetic force and induction.
Disconnecting the matter altogether from the hypothesis that
light consists of electromagnetic vibrations, we shall inquire
into the conditions of propagation of plane electromagnetic
waves in a dielectric which is eolotropic as regards both
capacity and permeability, and determine the equation to the
wave-surface.
   For any direction of the normal (to the wave-front, under
stood) there are in general two normal velocities, i. e. there
are two rays differently inclined to the normal whose ray
velocities and normal wave-velocities are different.        And for
any direction of ray there are in general two ray-velocities,
i. e. two parallel rays having different velocities and wave
fronts.
   In any wave (plane) the electric displacement and the
magnetic induction must be always in the wave-front, i.e.
perpendicular to the normal. But they are only exceptionally
perpendicular to one another.
     n any ray the electric force and the magnetic force are
both perpendicular to the direction of the ray. But they are
only exceptionally perpendicular to one another.
   The magnetic force is always perpendicular to the electric
displacement, and the electric force perpendicular to the mag
netic induction. This of course applies to either wave. §
we have to rotate the plane through the normal and the mag
netic force through an angle 6 to bring it to coincide with the
magnetic induction, we must rotate the plane through the
normal and the electric displacement through the same angle
6 in the same direction to bring it to coincide with the electric
force, the axis of rotation being the normal itself.
   In the two waves having a common wave-normal, the dis
placement of either is parallel to the induction of the other.
And in the two rays having a common direction, the magnetic
force of either is parallel to the electric force of the other.

                 Electromagnetic Wave-surface.                399
   Nearly all our equations are symmetrical with respect to
capacity and permeability; so that for every equation con
taining some electric variables there is a corresponding one
to be got by exchanging electric force and magnetic force, &c.
And when the forces, inductions, &c. are eliminated, leaving
only capacities and permeabilities, these may be exchanged in
any formula without altering its meaning, although its imme
diate Cartesian expansion after the exchange may be entirely
different, and only convertible to the former expression by
long processes.
   If either p or c be constant, we have the Fresnel wave
surface. Perhaps the most important case besides these is
that in which the principal axes of permeability are parallel
to those of capacity. There are then six principal velocities
instead of only three, for the velocity of a wave depends upon
the capacity in the direction of displacement as well as upon
the permeability in the direction of induction. For instance,
if u<U+017F>, us, us and c, cº, c, are the principal permeabilities and
capacities, and the wave-normal be parallel to the common
axis of u1 and ci, the other principal axes are the directions of
induction and displacement, and the two normal velocities are
(cºus)- and (caus)73.
   The principal sections of the wave-surface in this case are
all ellipses (instead of ellipses and circles, as in the one-sided
Fresnel-wave); and two of these ellipses always cross, giving
two axes of single-ray velocity. But should the ratio of the
capacity to the permeability be the same for all the axes
(un/ci-As<U+017F> cº-ps/cs), the wave-surface reduces to a single
ellipsoid, and any line is an optic axis. There is but one
velocity, and no particular polarization. If the ratio is the
same for two of the axes, the third is an optic axis.
    Owing to the extraordinary complexity of the investigation
 when written out in Cartesian form (which I began doing,
but gave up aghast), some abbreviated method of expression
becomes desirable. ... I may also add, nearly indispensable,
owing to the great difficulty in making out the meaning and
 mutual connections of very complex formulae.          In fact the
 transition from the velocity-equation to the wave-surface by
  roper elimination would, I think, baffle any ordinary alge
  .. unassisted by some higher method, or at any rate by
 some kind of shorthand algebra. I therefore adopt, with some
 simplification, the method of vectors, which seems indeed the
 only proper method. But some of the principal results will
 be fully expanded in Cartesian form, which is easily done.
 And since all our equations will be either wholly scalar or
 wholly vector, the investigation is made independent of qua
                                2 E2

400               Mr. Oliver Heaviside on the
termions by simply defining a scalar product to be so and so,
and a vector product so and so. The investigation is thus a
Cartesian one modified by certain simple abbreviated modes
of expression.
   I have long been of opinion that the sooner the much needed
introduction of quaternion methods into practical mathematical
investigations in Physics takes place the better. In fact every
analyst to a certain extent adopts them : first, by writing only
one of the three Cartesian scalar equations corresponding to
the single vector equation, leaving the others to be inferred ;
and next, by writing the first only of the three products which
occur in the scalar product of two vectors. This, systematized,
is I think the proper and natural way in which quaternion
methods should be gradually brought in. If to this we further
add the use of the vector product of two vectors, immensely
increased power is given, and we have just what is wanted in
the three dimensional analytical investigations of electro
º            with its numerous vector magnitudes.
    t is a matter of great practical importance that the notation
should be such as to harmonize with Cartesian formulae, so
that we can pass from one to the other readily, as is often
required in mixed investigations, without changing notation.
This condition does not appear to me to be attained by Pro
fessor Tait's notation, with its numerous letter prefixes, and
especially by the -S before every scalar product, the nega
tive sign being the cause of the greatest inconvenience in
transitions. I further think that Quaternions, as applied to
Physics, should be established more by definition than at
present; that scalar and vector products should be defined
to mean such or such operations, thus avoiding some extremely
obscure and quasi-metaphysical reasoning, which is quite
unnecessary.
   The first three sections of the following preliminary con
tain all we want as regards definitions; most of the rest of the
preliminary consists of developments and reference-formulae,
which, were they given later, in the electromagnetic problem,
would inconveniently interrupt the argument, and much
lengthen the work.                       -
   Scalars and Vectors.-In a scalar equation every term is a
scalar, or algebraic quantity, a mere magnitude; and + and
 — have the ordinary signification. But in a vector equation
every term stands for a vector, or directed magnitude, and +
and – are to be understood as compounding like velocities,
forces, &c. Putting all vectors upon one side, we have the
general form
                    A +B+C+D+... = 0;

                  Electromagnetic Wave-surface.             401
 where A, B,..., are any vectors, which, if n in number, may
be represented, since their sum is zero, by the n sides of a
polygon. Let A1, A2, As be the three ordinary scalar com
ponents of A referred to any set of three rectangular axes,
and similarly for the other vectors. This notation saves mul
tiplication of letters. Then the above equation stands for the
three scalar equations
                 A1 + Bi-H C1--D1+... =0,
                 A3+ B2 + C2 + D,--..   º

                                      -
   The - sign before a vector simply reverses its direction—
that is, negatives its three components.
   According to the above, if i, j, k be rectangular vectors of
unit length, we have
                      A= i A1 +jA2+ kA3   -  -  -  -   -  - (1)
&c.; if A1, A2; A3 be the components of A referred to the
axes of i, j, k. That is, A is the sum of the three vectors
iA1, jA2, kA3, of lengths A1, A2, As parallel to i, j, k respec
tively.
   Scalar Product.—We define AB thus,
                   AB =A1B1 + A2 B, + A3B3,     -  -   s  - (2)
and call it the scalar product of the vectors A and B. Its
magnitude is that of A, x that of B x the cosine of the angle
between them. Thus, by (1) and (2),
                Ai-Ai, As =Aj, As=Ak ;
and in general, N being any unit vector, AN is the scalar
component of A parallel to N, or, briefly, the N component
of A. Similarly,
                      *=1, jº-1, k”=1,
because i and i are parallel and of length unity, &c. And
                      ij=0, jk=0, ki–0,
because i and j, for instance, are perpendicular. Notice that
AB = BA.
   We have also
                   A=#A. = A* = &c.,
and
Thus AT has the same direction as A ; its length is the
reciprocal of that of A.

402               Mr. Oliver Heaviside on the
    Vector Product.—We define WAB thus,
WAB =i(A,B3–AaB)+j(AaB1–A1Bs)+k(A1B2—AgB1), (3)
and call VAB the vector product of A and B. Its magnitude
is that of A x that of B x the sine of the angle between them.
Its direction is perpendicular to A and to B with the usual
conventional relation between positive directions of translation
and of rotation (the vine system). Thus, Vij= k ; Vjk= i ;
Wki-j. Notice that WAB= —WBA, the direction being
reversed by reversing the order of the letters; or by ex
changing A and B in (3) we negative each term.

The scalar product VA is the divergence of the vector A, the
amount leaving the unit volume, if it be a flux. The vector
product (7) is the curl of A, which will occur below. There
are three remarkable theorems relating to V, viz.

   Starting with P, a single-valued scalar function of position,
the rise in its value from any point to another is expressed in
(8) as the line-integral, along any line joining the points, of
VPds, the scalar product of VP, and ds the vector element
of the curve.
   Then passing from an unclosed to a closed curve, let A be
any vector function of position (single-valued of course). Its

                  Electromagnetic Wave-surface.                403
line-integral round the closed curve is expressed in (9) as the
surface-integral over any surface bounded by the curve of
another vector B, which =VVA. BdS is the scalar product
of B and the vector element of surface dS, whose direction is
defined by its unit normal.
   Finally, passing from an unclosed to a closed surface, (10)
expresses the surface-integral of any vector C over the closed
surface (normal positive outward), as the volume-integral of
its divergence within the included space.
   Linear Vector Operators.-If H be the magnetic force at a
point, B the induction, E the electric force, and D the dis
placement, all vectors, then
                     B=AH, and D=cE/4t . . . . (11)
express the relation of B to H and of D to E in a dielectric
medium. If it be isotropic as regards displacement, c is the
electric capacity; and if it be isotropic as regards induction,
A is the magnetic permeability; c and a are then constants, if
the medium be homogeneous, or scalar functions of position, if
it be heterogeneous.
   We shall not alter the form of the above equations in the
case of eolotropy, when c and u become linear operators. For
instance, the induction will always be uPI, to i. understood
as a definite vector, got from H another vector, in a manner
fully defined by (in case we want the developments) the fol
lowing equations (not otherwise needed). Let H1, ..., and
B1, ..., be the components of H and B referred to any rect

For completeness a proof is now inserted, adapted from that

what vectors A, B, C may be. Choose them then to be i, j, k,

   Transformation-Formula.-The following is very useful.

   The Equations of Induction.—E and H being the electric

The dot, as usual, signifies differentiation to the time. The

Its direction is defined by its normal. Let then N be the

   We can now, by (39) and (40), get as many forms of the
index equation as we please. We know that the displacement
is perpendicular to the normal, and so is the induction. Hence

are two other forms of the index equation. (41) and (42)
are the simplest forms. More complex forms are created with
that surprising ease which is characteristic of these operators;
but .. not want any more. When expanded, the different
forms look very different, and no one would think they repre
sented the same surface. This is also true of the corresponding
Fresnel surface, which is comparatively simple in expression.
In any equation we may exchange the operators u and c.
   Put a = Nu-' in any form of index equation, and we have
the velocity equation, a quadratic in tº giving the two velo
cities of the wave-front. And if we put Nvap, making thus
p a vector parallel to the normal of length equal to the velocity,
it will be the vector of the surface which is the locus of the
foot of the perpendicular from the origin upon the tangent
plane to the wave-surface.
    By (33a), remembering that a is parallel to the normal, we
see that
           cE, uB, and AN are in one plane;
or,                                                          (43)
             E, N, and u-'cE are in one plane.

              H, N, and c-'A H are in one plane.
 These conditions expanded, give us the directions of the elec
 tric force and displacement, the magnetic force and induction
 for a given normal. We may write the second of (43) thus,
                                DD
                            NW C Al =0; . . . . . . (45)

 and as these differ only in the substitution of B for D, we see
 that the induction of either ray is parallel to the displacement
 of the other; that is, the two directions of induction in the
 wave-front are the two directions of displacement.
     The Wave-Surface.—Since, the velocity-surface with the
 vector p=v N is the locus of the foot of the perpendicular on
 the tangent-plane to the wave-surface, we have, if p be the

410                Mr. Oliver Heaviside on the

But a the vector of the index-surface being = Nu-'-po-2, we
have by (47), dividing it by wº,
                              op=1. . .            . . .   .   . (48)
   To find the wave-surface, we must therefore let a be vari
able and eliminate it between (48) and any one of the index
equations. This is not so easy as it may appear.
   General considerations may lead us to the conclusion that
the equation to the wave-surface and that to the index-surface
may be turned one into the other by the simple process of
inverting the operators, turning c into cº-" and p into a '.
A.         this will be verified later, any form of index equation
giving a corresponding form of wave by inversion of operators,
yet it must be admitted that this requires proof. That it is
true when one of the operators c or u is a constant does not
prove that it is also true when we have the inverse compound
operator {(aca)w-'-nc-'}-' containing both c and u, neither
being constant. I have not found an easy proof. This will
not be wondered at when the similar investigations of the
Fresnel surface are referred to. Professor Tait, in his ‘Qua
ternions,” gives two methods of finding the wave-surface; one
from the velocity equation, the other from the index equation.
The latter is rather the easier, but cannot be said to be very
obvious, nor does either of them admit of much simplification.
The difficulty is of course considerably multiplied when we
have the two operators to reckon with. I believe the following
transition from index to wave cannot be made more direct, or
shorter, except of course by omission of steps, which is not a
real shortening.

Subtract (55) from (56) and halve the result; thus obtaining

   In the last five equations it will be understood that do and
d3, are differential vectors, and that dapua is the scalar product
of da and ug, &c.; also in getting (56) from the preceding
equation we have 31<U+017F>le-'31=3|c-'d&l= d81c-'31, &c. Equation

   Now (57) shows that the vector in the {} is perpendicular
to da the variation of a. But by (51) we also have, on dif
ferentiation,

h' being a constant, corresponding to (59); of this no sepa
rate proof is needed, as it amounts to exchanging a and c and
turning E into H, to make (39) become (40). And from

   Now to resume the argument, stopped at equation (63).
Up to equation (59) the work is plain and straightforward,
according to rule in fact, being merely the elimination of the
differentials, and the getting of an equation between p and a.
What to do next is not at all obvious. From (59), or from
 (64), the same with h eliminated, we may obtain all sorts of
scalar products containing p and 31, and if we could put 3,
explicitly in terms of p, (60) or (65) would be forms of the
wave-surface equation. From the purely mathematical point
of view no direct way presents itself; but (61) and (63),
considered physically as well as mathematically, guide us at
once to the second half of the transformation from the index

                Electromagnetic Wave-surface.               413
to the wave equation. As, at the commencement, we found
the induction and the displacement to be perpendicular to the
normal, so now we find that the corresponding forces are per
pendicular to the ray. There was no difficulty in reaching
the index equation before, when we had a single normal with
two values of v the normal velocity, and two rays differently
inclined to the normal. There should then be no difficulty,
by parallel reasoning, in arriving at the wave-surface equation
from analogous equations which express that the ray is per
pendicular to the magnetic and electric forces, considering
two parallel rays travelling with different ray-velocities with
two differently inclined wave-fronts.

                       WNE= rp H, . . . . . (26) bis
we must have two corresponding equations for one ray
direction. Let M be a unit vector defining the direction of
the ray, and w be the ray-velocity, so that
                          p=w M.      .  . .   . . . . (69)
Operate on (25) and (26) by VM, giving

Now use the formula of transformation (18), giving
               N(HM)—H(MN)=–wVMcE,
               N(EM)—E(MN) = wVMu H.
But HM =0 and EM=0, as proved before. Also v-w(MN),
or the wave-velocity is the normal component of the ray
velocity.   Hence

general, when a ray is solitary, its direction is that of the

XLVI. On the Rotation of the Equipotential Lines of an
   Electric Current by Magnetic Action. By E. H. HALL,
   Instructor in Physics at Harvard College".
IN     this article the results will be given of experiments
      made during the month of August 1883, and at intervals
since, in the Physical Laboratory of Harvard College. The
substances which have been chiefly examined are copper, zinc,
certain of their alloys, and iron and steel. Some mention will
be made also of gold, cobalt, nickel, bismuth, and antimony.
In most cases when possible the metal was used in the form
of a thin strip, about 1:1 centim. wide and about 3 centim.
long, between the two pieces of brass B, B (fig. 1), which,
soldered to the ends of the strip, served as electrodes for the
entrance and escape of the main current. To the arms a, a,
about 2 millim. wide and perhaps 7 millim. long, were soldered
                                                2.
the wires w, w, which led to a Thomson galvanometer. The
 notches c, c, show how adjustment was secured. The strip
 thus prepared was fastened to a plate of glass by means of a
 cement of beeswax and rosin, all the parts shown in the figure
 being imbedded in and covered by this cement, which was so
          * From Silliman's American Journal, February 1885.

420           Mr. E. H. Hall on the Rotation of the
hard and stiff as to be quite brittle at the ordinary temperature
of the air.
   The plate of glass   *       the strip of metal so imbedded
was, when about to be tested, placed with B, B, vertical in the
narrow part of a tank whose }. section is shown in
fig. 2. This tank, TT, containing the plate of glass with the
metal strip was placed between the poles P, P, of the electro
magnet. The tank was filled with water, which was sometimes
at rest and sometimes flowing. By this means the tempera
ture of the strip of metal was under tolerable control, and the
inconvenience from thermoelectric effects at a and a con
siderably lessened. The diameter of the plane circular ends
of the pole-pieces P, P, is about 3.7 centim.
   The general method of most of the experiments to be men
tioned did not differ much from that described in the Philo
sophical Magazine for November 1880. The intensity of the
magnetic field was estimated as before, by the impulse given
 to a galvanometer-needle when a small coil in connection with
 the galvanometer was suddenly removed from the field. This
impulse was compared with that given to the same needle by
the current obtained by turning an earth-inductor of known
 dimensions.          -
    The direct current through the strip under examination
 was measured by means of a tangent galvanometer. The
 transverse current was measured by means of a Thomson
 galvanometer, the reduction-factor of this instrument usually
 being determined by passing through it a current of known
 strength a few minutes before and a few minutes after each
 set of observations on the transverse current.
    The rotational powers will then be given in ostensibly
 absolute measure ; but an uncertainty of several per cent.
 attaches to the values given owing to uncertainty in regard
 to the following quantities:–1st, the thickness of the strips
 examined ;    j. the dimensions of the small test-coil used for
 getting strength of magnetic field; 3rd, the horizontal in
 tensity of the earth's magnetism ; 4th, the reduction factors
 of the tangent-galvanometer used ; 5th, the magnitude of the
 direct effect exerted by the electromagnet upon the Thomson
 galvanometer at a distance of about 50 feet.
    One of the most troublesome operations in these experi
 ments is that of determining the thickness of the metal strips
 examined. Owing to the inevitable slight roughness of the
 surface, direct measurements with calipers is       º     to give
 too great a thickness, . On the other hand, the density of
 many specimens is subject to considerable uncertainty, and
 therefore the indirect method by means of weight and density,

           Equipotential Lines of an Electric Current.         421
which is the method used, cannot be applied with full con
fidence. Moreover the latter method gives, at best, only the
average thickness of the strip, whereas I have heretofore as
sumed, and in this article still assume, that the effective thick
ness of the strip is the thickness of that part which lies between
the two arms a, a. My practice of late has been, therefore,
to determine the average thickness by the weight and density
method, making use of the best data available, and to estimate
the thickness between the arms by adding to, or subtracting
from, the average thickness, according as the calipers indi
cated the thickness at that place to be greater or less than the
average. In the case of several of the strips to be mentioned
 hereafter this correction was somewhat carelessly made, and
there may be an inaccuracy of four or five per cent. in the
j “effective thickness.” With other strips much
 care was taken in this respect, and it is believed that the un
 certainty in regard to the density of the metal is the greatest
 source of error in determining the thickness in these cases.
 Particulars will be given as the strips are in turn described.
    The 5th source of error was very troublesome in the ex
 periments upon certain alloys. The galvanometer was un
 fortunately so placed that not only the magnitude, but even
 the direction of this effect of the electromagnet might be varied
 when, by any means, the galvanometer-needle was turned a
 few degrees from its ordinary position of rest.
                  Copper, Zinc, and their Alloys.
    More than three years ago (B. A. Report, 1881) I found
 that if the rotational power of copper is called —, that of zinc
 is +. At the same time a specimen of brass, exact compo
 sition unknown, had been found to lie between copper and
 zinc in this respect, but nearer the copper, having in fact a
 small – rotating power.
    Through the kindness of Prof. Trowbridge and Mr. E. K.
 sº           had at command in the summer of 1883 several
 alloys of copper and zinc in widely varying proportions.
 Specimens of these alloys had been analyzed chemically by
 Mr. Stevens; but as they had lain for some time in an exposed
 position after he had finished his work upon them, I feared
 the labels upon them might not be intact, and Mr. G. D. Moore,
 of the Harvard class of 1884, has been kind enough to make
 new analyses for me, determining both the copper and the
 zinc in specimens furnished him in the form of thin strips
 such as were used in my own experiments.               Mr. Moore
 found :—

   Specimen E, which contained apparently about 50 per cent.
copper, was so brittle that I did not succeed in getting it
rolled into a thin sheet.
   Most, if not all, of these specimens were annealed one or
more times during the process of rolling. None of the strips
examined, however, were annealed after the final rolling. All
of the strips which were used were cut in such a way that the
arms a, a extended in that direction in which the strips passed
through the rolls.
   As it is a somewhat troublesome matter to determine accu
rately the density of a thin strip of metal, and as my imme
diate purpose did not demand great accuracy in this respect,
it seemed allowable to estimate the density of the alloys from
their composition. After certain rough experiments the
density 8-9 was assumed for the copper, and 7-2 for the zinc.
Assuming, what we know to be not strictly true, that the
density of an alloy decreases regularly as its amount of zinc
per unit mass increases, we find —.                             -

   The main object in the experiments upon these metals and
their alloys was to determine whether the alloys would range
themselves according to any simple law, so that the  ...i.
of the rotational power in any alloy might be inferred from its
known proportions of copper and zinc. Some attempt was
made, moreover, to determine the effect of change of tempe
rature in different specimens.
   It will be seen that the intensity of the magnetic field was
kept nearly the same throughout the experiments of August
upon copper, zinc, and their alloys. The strength of the
direct current was, moreover, of about the same magnitude in
all cases, except the experiments of August 11th on copper.
On that day the current used was less than one half as strong
as that used later. The same strip of copper was tested again
August 29th with a current of the usual strength; and the
agreement between the results obtained under so widely
different conditions is quite close.
   In the following table and throughout this article the
C. G. S. system is used wherever no statement is made to the
contrary. The following symbols used with the tables need
explanation :
   C means current along line C D (fig. 1).

          M means intensity of magnetic field perpendicular to plane
     of paper in fig. 1.
          R. P. means rotatory power, which is numerically defined
     by the expression PC. M. in which D is the thickness of
     the metal strip, and E is the electromotive force resulting
     from C and M which maintains the transverse current".
     The R. P. is considered positive when E is of such a character
     as to send a positive transverse current in that direction in
     which the conducting strip tends to move under the action of
     the main current and the magnetic force.
          The temperatures referred to in the tables are those indi
     cated by a thermometer placed in the water-tank containing
     the plates when under examination (fig. 2).

426          Mr. E. H. Hall on the Rotation of the
   This table shows the results of experiments with the metal
strips thus far described in detail.     elast two columns give
approximately the composition of plates which would have the
observed rotatory powers if copper and zinc in uniting retained
their individual powers unaltered. It will be perceived that
in every case the proportion of copper demanded upon this
basis is greater than the proportion in the actual plate.
   At the time these experiments were made I supposed plate B
to contain about 92 per cent. of copper, j. would have
furnished an exception to this rule. Thinking some serious
error might have been made in estimating the thickness of
this plate, or that of the copper plate, or the zinc, I prepared
with very great care plates No. 2 of A, B, and G. These
new plates were similar to those already described, but were
in length between B and B about 2.2 cm. As the vacation
was now over, and my opportunities for experimental work
were limited, I contented myself with making, in the main,
comparative experiments with these plates. I did not re
determine the horizontal intensity of the earth's magnetism,
and I made no attempt to determine the direct effect of the
electromagnet upon the Thomson galvanometer, with which
the transverse current was observed.      I knew that this direct
effect was small ; and I endeavoured to arrange matters in
such a way that it would affect all the new results with A,
B, and G in the same direction and to nearly the same extent.
The intensity of the magnetic field in the experiments with
these plates was about the same as in the previous experiments
with the alloys. This intensity was determined, as usual, on
October 20th, when the effect of change of temperature upon
the plate B No. 2 was tested, but on October 13th, when
A No. 2 and B No. 2 were compared, and on October 27th,
when A No. 2 and G. No. 2 were compared, this determina
tion was not considered necessary. On October 13th A No. 2
was tested first, then B No. 2, then A No. 2 again. This
arrangement tended to make the result of the comparison in
dependent of any progressive diminution in the strength of
the current operating the electromagnet, and it saved much
time.    On October 27th the same method was followed.
   I shall not attempt to give the results of these experiments
in absolute measure, but shall write the results obtained on
an arbitrary scale.

    This agreement was regarded as highly satisfactory, all
 things considered; and the apparent exception which, as stated
 above, had been noted in the case of B, appeared to be con
 firmed. The result of the chemical analysis, however, showed
 that this alloy, which, according to the label found upon it,
 contained nearly 92 per cent. of copper, really had the com
 position given in the tables above. Alloy B, then, does con
 form to the rule that the alloys of copper and zinc have
 rotating powers nearer to that of copper than the composition
 of the alloys would have led one to expect.
                     Influence of Temperature.
   It will be seen that in the case of copper, zinc, and all the
alloys except C, a fall of temperature appears to cause a slight
increase in the numerical value of the rotating power.       It is
possible that upon further trial the apparent exception fur
nished by C would disappear. It does not, on the other hand,
seem probable that the agreement in a particular direction of
five cases out of six is entirely accidental. In the case of D
the apparent change caused by fall of temperature is very
considerable ; but the observations made with this alloy were
particularly unsatisfactory, the needle of the Thomson galva
nometer being quite unsteady, while the total effect to be
measured was small.
   The experiments upon iron and steel were in the main
repetitions of those already published, but made with more
Care.

   The dimensions of the strip of soft iron used in the experi
ments were roughly as follows:–
       Length between terminals B, B (fig. 1) .                       2:9 cm.

 Like the strip used in 1882", it was obtained through the
kindness of Prof. Langley, of the Allegheny Observatory, and
the two strips had probably nearly the same composition and
 character.
    Although the test made in 1882 was not satisfactory, it
 seemed to me to indicate that the R. P. of soft iron was
 slightly greater at high than at low magnetic intensities, and
 I hazarded the opinion that future experiments would prove
 this to be the case. This opinion has scarcely been justified
 by the result. The table given below does indeed appear to
 indicate a very slight increase in the R. P. as M. rises from
 801 to 3264, and again as M. rises from 3264 to 5835, but
 the increase in the numbers, as observed, is too slight to deserve
 any confidence.

   On the other hand, the decrease in the observed value of the
R. P. as M. rises from 5835 to 8651, though slight, seems to me
strong evidence of an actual falling off in the value of the
R. P. of iron at magnetic intensities.
   In any case it appears, and this was one of the important
questions to be answered by the experiments, that the R. P. of
iron under magnetic forces of varying intensity is more nearly
constant than the R. P. of nickel, for according to previous
experiments” the R. P. of nickel in a magnetic field of in
tensity 8700 is many per cent., perhaps 20, less than in a
*:         field of intensity 2000.
    he one trial made at low temperature confirmed the in
ference drawn from a similar trial made the year beforef,
that a fall of 1° C diminishes the R. P. in soft iron about 3
per cent. It is with these experiments as a basis that I have
ventured to make the slight changes necessary to deduce from
the observed results the values of the R. P. at 28°.
   A test was made with this strip of soft iron for a permanent
change in the direction of the equipotential lines. A similar
experiment with tempered steel the year before had been suc
cessful, and the description of the method I will quote from a
previous article (Philosophical Magazine for May 1883, p.345).
“This plate, with the usual electrical connections, and with a
current flowing through it, was placed in the usual position
between the poles of the electromagnet, the magnet current
was turned on, then off, and the plate removed from between
the poles in order to avoid the action of the very considerable
residual magnetism of the electromagnet. A reading of the
Thomson galvanometer in the transverse circuit was now made,
then the plate was replaced between the poles and the current
turned on again, but in the opposite direction. The magnet
current being again interrupted, the plate was again removed
from the field and another reading of the Thomson galva
nometer was made.” Making this experiment with the soft
iron and with a battery of 50 cells, the result was a negative
one. If any permanent effect was produced, it was probably
a small part of one per cent. of the temporary effect produced
while the plate was subjected to the magnet's action.
                                Steel.
   The steel used in this series of experiments was obtained

and soft enough to be quite readily cut with a pocket-knife.

    The dimensions of this strip were not so accurately taken.
 It was so brittle that I felt obliged to use caution in applying
 the calipers to it. It appeared to be of about the same thick
 ness as No. 7, and I assumed it to have exactly the same thick
 ness.       The distance from B to B was about 2.6 cm.
     Results obtained with these two strips are shown in the
 following table :

             Decrease for 19 fall of temperature, approximately 4 per cent.
     The magnitude of the rotational coefficient in the soft steel
  is about 1, times, and that in tempered steel about 4 times as
  great as that in the soft iron. This agrees very well with the
  conclusion drawn from the hasty experiments of the year before,
  when a piece of steel from a clock-spring was used. When a
  sensitive galvanometer is used, an ordinary permanent horse
  shoe magnet of half-inch bar produces an easily discernible
  effect in the strip of tempered steel.
      It should be stated that two or three months before the

            Equipotential Lines of an Electric Current.     431
trials which furnished this table were made, both these steel
strips had been subjected, in the usual position, to a magnet
izing force of about 8500 intensity. It does not seem pro
bable that the results just recorded were seriously affected by
this previous experience of the steel.          -
   This first magnetization was for the purpose of detecting, if
possible, a permanent effect, such as had been observed a year
before in a piece of tempered clock-spring, but had been vainly
looked for in soft iron.
   No. 2 showed a permanent effect equal to about 1% per cent.
of the temporary effect, a result agreeing very well with that
obtained with the tempered clock-spring. No. 1 showed a
permanent effect relatively, and even absolutely, larger than
that in No. 2. It was about 5 per cent. of the temporary
effect. . In both cases the tests made were hasty, and the re
sults obtained are only approximately correct.      I believe it
has been observed that residual magnetization is, under certain
conditions, greater in soft than in hard steel.
                               Gold.
    The only experiment of importance made with gold was a
test for permanent effect. The strip used was the one experi
mented with the year before, a        jº.         of which has
already been   º         (Philosophical Magazine for May 1883,
  . 342). The permanent effect, if any was produced, must
  ave been a very small part of one per cent. of the temporary
effect.
                              Cobalt.
    In the “Philosophical Magazine’ for September 1881 I
said :—“No thin strips of the metal <U+017F>cobalt] being at hand, a
slice was sawn from a small block of moderately pure cast
cobalt and worked into the form of a cross. To the extremity
of each arm of this cross was soldered a thin strip of copper
        . for the purpose of making the electrical connections.
The cross of cobalt with the copper strips attached was now
fastened with hard cement [beeswax and rosin] to a strip of
glass,” &c. It was the same piece of cobalt, reduced now
with file and emery-paper to a thickness of about 0.062 cm.,
that served during this new series of experiments. The central
portion of the cross was about 2 millim. square, and the arms,
about 3 millim. long and 2 millim. wide, projected from it at
right angles.
   The main object of the recent test was to determine the
effect produced in cobalt by change of temperature. It is
assumed that the intensity of the magnetic field remained con

432            Mr. E. H. Hall on the Rotation of the
stant during these experiments. It is possible, however, that
it diminished one or two per cent, during the series. The
error introduced in this way is of slight consequence for the
present purpose. Again, the direct effect of the electro
magnet in disturbing the needle of the Thomson galvanometer
was neglected, together with certain other particulars which
 may have introduced a constant error of several per cent. into
the values obtained for the rotatory power.

     I can only confirm what Prof. Righi" has already published
 concerning the rotational effect in this metal. The rotational
 power appeared to be about 260 times as great numerically as
 that of tempered steel, and of the opposite sign.
    The slice of bismuth used was obtained, shaped, and mounted
 in much the same manner as the slice of cobalt already de
 scribed. The length and breadth of the bismuth cross were
 somewhat greater than the corresponding dimensions of the
 cobalt and the thickness was about 1 millim.
     It seems probable that a thin slice of bismuth, properly
 }. and mounted, will come to be a valuable instrument
   or measuring the intensity of strong magnetic fields.
                                    Antimony.
     The powerful effect observed in bismuth suggested an ex
  amination of antimony. A slice of this metal, much like the
  slice of bismuth just mentioned, was prepared. The cross
  suffered in shape a good deal in making the adjustment. The
  final average thickness in the central portion was estimated
 at 1.2 millim.

    The two trials of August 8th were not entirely independent
of each other, as only one test of the intensity of the magnetic
field and of the sensitiveness of the Thomson galvanometer
was made during the two trials of that date. The results as
they sland indicate an increase of the rotational power with
fall of temperature ; but the experiments were two hasty to
justify a conclusion upon the matter.
    Several experiments have resulted from the criticisms or
suggestions of other investigators.
                         Mr. Bidwell's Theory.
    This has been so recently and so widely published that it is
hardly necessary for me to state it in detail.
    In Science' (March 28th, 1884) I replied very briefly to
Mr. Bidwell's first paper, stating that I found the transverse
current in a strip of soft steel to be in the same direction
when the strip was fastened to the supporting plate by a clamp
across the middle of the strip only, as when it was fastened by
means of clamps at its ends only.
    Mr. Bidwell has, in his second paper (Phil. Mag. April
1884), described an experiment which he appears to consider
conclusive against the previously accepted view of the “rota
 tional effect.”     In brief he obtains what he calls a “reversal.”
 of the transverse effect in gold, using a strip of that metal
 having two narrow longitudinal slits lying on the same straight
 line and nearly meeting in the centre of the strip.
    I shall not undertake here an extended discussion of this
interesting experiment of Mr. Bidwell. My view of the matter
 is in substance as follows:–
    Let l in fig. 3 represent, an equipotential line in a strip of
 metal through which an electric current is flowing, the metal
being in a normal condition.
    In fig. 4 l represents the corresponding equipotential line
 when the metal strip is acted upon by a powerful magnetic
 force in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the paper.
    If, now, a and b be connected by means of a wire, a current
 will flow from a to b through the wire. If a' and by be con

434           Mr. E. H. Hall on the Rotation of the
nected in the same way, a weaker current will flow from a'
to b' through the wire.
   Fig. 5 represents a metal strip, having along its middle a
slit longer than the diameter of the magnetic poles, between
which the slit is placed, l and l being corresponding equi
potential lines when the strip is in its normal unstressed
condition.
   Let a magnetic force act as before. Each of the lines l, l
in fig. 5 is rotated about its centre through the same angle as
l in figs. 3 and 4. The result is shown in fig. 6.
   If now a and b be connected by means of a wire a current
will flow from a to b through the wire. If a' and by be
connected in the same way a current will flow from b to a<U+017F>
through the wire.
   To get Mr. Bidwell's case, imagine a narrow bridge of metal
to be left crossing the slit between a' and l'. Such a bridge
would serve as a shunt to the wire which we have imagined
connecting a' and b, but would not reverse the relative poten
tials of these two points. The lines l, l, as Sir Wm. Thomson
pointed out at the Philadelphia meeting, would now take a
form something like that shown in fig. 7.
   As the bridge across the slit becomes wider such lines as l
will become more nearly straight, till, finally, the condition of
things represented in fig. 4 will be practically reproduced.
On the other hand, if the slit in fig. 5 were short compared
with the width of the poles of the magnet, a reversal such as
Mr. Bidwell detected should not occur.
                   Mr. Tomlinson's Suggestion.
   In the ‘Philosophical Magazine’ for May 1884, Mr. Tom
linson stated that certain relations which he had discovered

            Equipotential Lines of an Electric Current.                   435
indicated that the rotational effect in nickel should be greater
at low than at high temperatures. He therefore called in
question the conclusion to the contrary which I had drawn
from certain hasty and very rough experiments made before
the use of the water-tank gave me the means of easily con
trolling the temperature of the metal under examination. I
have therefore recently taken up the matter again. I used
the same piece of nickel with which the former test was made
 (Phil. Mag. Sept. 1881, p. 163); but the strip was now so
much damaged while being fastened upon glass, that it was
necessary to cut its width down a good deal in order to obtain
the “arms” for the side connections. The following Table
shows the results obtained :—

    Decrease for 1° fall of temperature = approximately 6 per
cent.
    It will be noticed that the results obtained at low tempe
ratures do not accord so well as those at high temperatures.
This fact is in all probability due to the difficulty experienced
in preventing slight fluctuations of temperature while the
colder water was flowing through the tank. Irregularity in
the flow of this water causes disturbing thermo-electric
currents.
  f
    The quantity called R. P. in this paper corresponds to the
&    of my 1881 paper divided by the F. of that paper. Cal
culating the R. P. of nickel from the 188 experiments, I find
it to be about 12700 x 107", for a field of intensity 1660.

436          Mr. E. H. Hall on the Rotation of the
In looking about for an explanation of this disagreement, I
found that the thickness of the strip had been called '00104 cm.
in 1881, and 0012 cm. in the later experiments. The former
estimate was obtained by weight, the latter by measurement
with calipers. The difference accounts well enough for the
different values obtained for the R. P. Which estimate of the
thickness is the more reliable I will not undertake to decide.

    At the Philadelphia meeting of the American Association
I stated that I had compared the behaviour of a strip of soft
steel cemented to a plate of glass with that of a similar strip
fastened to a plate by means of a clamp. In preparing the
matter for publication, however, I found that the test had not
been made so carefully as was desirable; and I have therefore
just repeated the experiment with the assistance of Mr. W. A.
Stone, of the Harvard class of 1886.
    I shall call the cemented strip A. It has been already
mentioned as No. 1 in the preceding article. The clamped
strip I shall call B. Both strips were cut from the same
sheet of soft steel.   Each is about 1:1 cm. wide and 3.2 cm.
long between the terminals of brass. A is about 011 cm.
thick and possibly a few per cent. thicker than B. A suffered
rather more than B in the process of adjustment (fig. 1).
    A was not only fastened to its plate with the cement of
beeswax and resin, but was imbedded in the cement, the
latter covering it with a layer, probably a millimetre or more
in thickness. The plate was not placed in water for this test.
The bearing of the clamp which fastened B to its plate was
 of wood, possibly a millimetre wide, and extended nearly from
 arm to arm of the strip. To prevent any very great bending,
each end of the strip was loosely tied to the plate with a piece of
twine. Otherwise the strip was free and was exposed to the air.
    The measurements recorded below were made between five
 and six o'clock, January 17th. There was an interval of one
minute between successive readings of the Thomson galvano
 meter. No measurement of the intensity of the magnetic
 field was made. It is assumed that this intensity during the
 one trial of A, which was made between the two trials of B,
was equal to the mean intensity during these two trials.
    The signs + and — refer to the direction of magnetization,
 R and L to direction from the zero point of the Thomson
 galvanometer-scale. The zero position of the index in these
 experiments was a considerable distance to the right of the
 zero of the scale. The tangent-galvanometer measured the
 direct current through the strip.

  XLVII. On the Structure of Mechanical Models illustrating
    some Properties of the Æther. By Prof. GEORGE FRANCIS
    FITzGERALD, F.R.S."
      HE elements of which the model is constructed consist of
        pairs of wheels so geared together that when one of them
 rotates it causes the second to rotate in the same direction.
 The simplest way of effecting this is to connect them by a
 band, and this is sufficient for a one-dimensional model. Such
 a model may be constructed by fixing a number of wheels with
 their axes parallel and at    #      angles to a plane, and con
 necting each wheel with its neighbours by elastic bands. This
 represents a nonconducting region of the aether. A perfectly
 conducting region is one in which there are no bands, and a
 partially conducting region would be represented by the bands

slipping more or less. A short description of how electrostatic,
electrokinetic, and luminiferous phenomena are illustrated by
such a one-dimensional model will be clearer than the corre
sponding description of the tridimensional model, the structure
of which is the special purpose of this paper.
    As an illustration of an electrostatic phenomenon, consider
two conducting regions separated by a nonconducting region
everywhere except along one line where the bands are removed.
If anywhere in this line a rotation in opposite directions be com
municated to the wheels that abut on it, then all the wheels in
the nonconducting region will be turned more or less. If
anywhere two neighbouring wheels turn equally, there is no
straining of the band connecting them; but if one turn more
than the other, the commecting band is strained and one side
 becomes tight and the other loose. Now it will be found in
the case considered that all the bands are strained, and that
 all the tight sides are turned towards one conductor and all
 the loose sides towards the other. This represents the charging
 of the two conductors in opposite ways. The strain of the
 bands in any element of the medium represents the polarization
 of the element, and the line joining the tight and loose sides
 is the direction of polarization or of electric displacement.
 The energy of the system is in the form of this straining of the
 bands, which produces stresses tending to restore the unstrained
 condition. With a given strain at their respective surfaces,
 there would be more elements involved and more energy in
 the medium when the conductors are far apart than when near,
 showing that if we could represent in any way the fact that
 conductors can move through the aether there would be forces
 tending to produce this motion, or, in other words, there would
 be attraction between these oppositely electrified bodies. As,
 however, the model does not illustrate the connection between
 matter and aether, neither this nor magnetic attractions are
 represented, nor have electromotive forces such as exist in
 cells been represented. If the forces that have been supposed
 to turn the wheels along the conducting line connecting the
 two conducting regions cease to act, the state of strain will
 disappear, and what represents an electric discharge along this
 line will take place. All along this line, during the discharge,
 the wheels at opposite sides will be rotating in opposite direc
 tions; so that this is what represents an electric current at
 any point. It is the same as an electric displacement; and in
 a nonconductor such opposite rotation is resisted by the stresses
 in the band, but in a conductor it may take place to any extent.
 During the discharge the whole of the nonconducting region
 is full of rotating wheels, and their axes of rotation are at

440      Prof. Fitzgerald on the Structure of Mechanical
right angles to the direction of discharge. Their velocity of
rotation evidently represents the magnetic force accompanying
the discharge, and the momentum of the wheels represents the
electrokinetic momentum of the current, i.e. its self-induction.
This is further illustrated by this, that if the frictional re
sistance be small enough, this momentum will carry the wheels
beyond their positions of equilibrium, and there will resultan
oscillating discharge, such as occurs when an electric condenser
is discharged through a sufficiently small resistance. If we
suppose a certain amount of frictional resistance at any point
along the line of discharge, we may see that the energy ex
pended on friction is conveyed to the place by the bands in
the surrounding nonconductor and comes in at the side of the
conductor, in accordance with Prof. Poynting's theorem as
to the direction of the flow of energy in an electrodynamic
System.
 'º. mutual induction of two circuits may also be illus
trated by the model. Sufficient has been explained, how
ever, to show how electrostatic and electrokinetic phenomena
are represented on the model. If a sudden movement of
rotation be communicated to any set of wheels, it is evident
that inertia will prevent their neighbours being instantaneously
turned, while the connecting bands will be strained. Rotation
will, however, be communicated to the neighbouring wheels,
and from them to their neighbours, by a process which is a
species of wave-propagation. If we consider the nature of
the disturbance which is thus propagated, we see that it
consists in a rotation whose axis is at right angles to the
direction of propagation, and of a polarization of the bands
which is at right angles both to the axis of rotation and to
the direction of wave-propagation. These are respectively a
magnetic and an electric displacement, which are at right
angles to one another and to the direction of wave-propagation.
This is exactly in accordance with Maxwell's electromagnetic
theory of light-propagation.      It is thus seen how the same
model that can represent electrostatic and electromagnetic
phenomena also illustrates luminiferous phenomena by its
small oscillations.
   If we try to produce a tridimensional model by means of
wheels geared together by bands, we are met by the following
difficulty. The energy of the model we have been considering
may be represented in the following way:-Let & represent
the angular rotation of any wheel from a given position ;
then the kinetic energy of an element will evidently be pro
portional to º, while the potential energy of an element,

which is what it should be if it is to represent the aether.
   The electrostatic and electrokinetic energies of an element
of the aether may be expressed in this form by assuming
#, m, and tsuch that their velocities É, m, and ; are a, 3, and y,
the components of the magnetic force at the element. . Now
simple band-gearing will not enable us to arrange that no
straining shall result, when, for instance,      |= º,     but this
may be accomplished by the following arrangement:—Each
element of the aether is to be represented by a cube, on each
edge of which there is a paddle-wheel. Thus on any face of
the cube there will be four paddle-wheels. Now, if any oppo
site pair of paddle-wheels on a face rotate by different amounts,
they will tend to pump any liquid in which the whole element
is immersed into or out of the cube, and if the sides of the
cube be elastic there will be a stress which will tend to stop
this differential rotation of the wheels. If, however, the other
 pair also rotate by different amounts they may undo what the
first pair do; and thus the stress will depend on the difference
between the differential rotations of these opposite pairs of
      T   -      d
wheels, i.e. on 4–º.
                 da,   dy
    In order that these four wheels may not similarly work
with any other wheel in the cube it is necessary to place
 diaphragms, cutting the cube into six cells, each a pyramid
 standing on a face of the cube. These must be so made that
 liquid may not be able to pass from one cell to another through
 the diaphragm, nor beside the paddle-wheels. . In order
 actually to effect this, the floats on the paddle-wheels would
 have to be drawn down while passing the diaphragm (of

442      Models illustrating some Properties of the Æther.
course these mechanical details could hardly be carried out so
as to work with sufficiently little friction for the working of
any actual model to approximate sufficiently closely to that
of the aether for it to be worth while attempting to construct
it). The faces of the cube should be filled up with diaphragms
past which the paddle-wheels should pump liquid, and whose
elasticity should be the means of storing electrostatic energy
in the medium. It may be worth while pointing out some
of the results of having shown that the energy of a disturbance
of this medium would be represented by the same equations
as those Maxwell has shown to hold for the aether.        The most
complicated results follow from supposing the faces of the
cubes, of which the medium is constructed, to have different
elasticities. Such a structure represents a crystalline medium.
Its vibrations would be propagated according to the laws of
propagation of light in crystalline media. The wave-surface
would be Fresnel's wave-surface, and it would exhibit conical
refraction.    If the cubes were twisted, the structure would be
like that of quartz or other substances that rotate the plane
of polarization of light. In order to represent the rotation of
the plane of polarization of light by magnetism, it would be
necessary to introduce some mechanism connecting this aether
with matter. That this would be required is evident from
the consideration that no amount of inherent rotation of these
wheels would alter the plane of polarization of a vibration
transmitted by them. Now, although I am not prepared to
suggest any actual method of connection, it may be worth
while pointing out two different ways in which it may work.
In the first place the matter may be in rotation when subject
to magnetic force; and it may be connected with the aether in
such a way that the direction of its axis and rotation is altered
by the vibrations passing in the aether. It would then react
on the aether in such a way as to rotate the plane of polariza
tion of the wave. In the second place the matter might only
act as a link connecting aether elements rotating in rectangular
directions in such a way that the rotation of one element
altered the axis of rotation of a rectangular element. The
reaction of this latter on the former would then rotate the
  lane of polarization of a wave propagated parallel to the
|.        The first of these connections is that in accordance with
Maxwell’s theory as to the connection between the aether and
matter that he introduces in his ‘Electricity and Magnetism.’
in order to explain the rotation of the plane of polarization of
light by magnetism ; while the second is the one that I
supposed in my paper “On the Electromagnetic Theory of
the Reflection and Refraction of Light” (R. S. Trans, 1880).

             On the Theory of Illumination in a Fog.             443
    I need hardly say, in conclusion, that I do not in the least
intend to convey the impression that the actual structure of
the aether is a bit like what I have described. What phy
sicists ought to look for is such a mode of motion in space as
will confer upon it the properties required in order that it may
exhibit electromagnetic phenomena. Such a mode of motion
would be a real explanation of these phenomena. I have only
given a description of them.
    I think, however, that it is worth while considering these
models, because in them the disturbance which represents light
is not the same as the vibrations of an elastic jelly, for what
represents an electric displacement is a change of structure of
an element, and not a displacement of the element; and it
 seems almost certain that, notwithstanding the very high
 authority which seems to support the view that the aether is
 like an elastic jelly, nevertheless its vibrations are much
 more of the nature of alterations in structure than of dis
 placements.
       XLVIII. On the Theory of Illumination in a Fog.
                    By Lord RAYLEIGH, F.R.S."
 A* a step towards a better understanding of the action of
         fog upon light, it seems desirable to investigate what
 the phenomena would be in the simplest case that can be
 proposed. For this purpose we may consider the atmosphere
 and the material composing the fog to be absolutely transpa
  rent, and also make abstraction from the influence of obstacles,
  among which must be included the ground itself.
     Conceive a small source of radiation, e.g. an incandescent
  carbon filament, to be surrounded by a spherical cloud, of
  uniform density, or at any rate symmetrically disposed round
  the source, outside of which the atmosphere is clear. Since
  by hypothesis there is no absorption, whatever radiation is
  emitted by the source passes outward through the external
  surface of the cloud.       The effect of the cloud is to cause
  diffusion, i. e. to spread the rays passing through any small
  area of the surface (which in the absence of the cloud would
  be limited to a small solid angle) more or less uniformly over
  the complete hemisphere.
      Whether the total radiation passing outwards through the
  small area on the external surface of the cloud is affected by
   the existence of the cloud depends upon the circumstances of
  the case.    If it be laid down that the total emission of ener
   from the source is given, then the presence of the cloud
       * Communicated by the Physical Society: read April 25, 1885.

 444                   Lord Rayleigh on the
 makes no difference in respect of the energy passing any
 element of the spherical area. But this supposition does
 not correspond to a constant temperature of the source, in
 consequence of the energy received back from the cloud by
 reflection. To keep the total emission of energy constant,
 we should have to suppose a rise of temperature increasing
 indefinitely with the size and density of the cloud.
    Let us now suppose that the region under consideration
 is bounded upon all sides by a distant envelope of perfect
 reflecting-power. Then, whatever the density of the clouds
which may wholly or partially occupy the enclosure, we know,
by the second law of thermodynamics, that at every internal
 point there is radiation in every direction of the full amount
corresponding to the temperature of the source. In one sense
this conclusion holds good, even although the matter com
posing the cloud has the power of absorption. But in that
case equilibrium would not be attained until the clouds them
 selves to the remotest parts had acquired the temperature of
 the source; whereas under the supposition of perfect trans
parency the temperature of the cloud is a matter of indiffer
 ence; and equilibrium is attained in a time dependent upon
that required by light to traverse the enclosure. So far we
have made no supposition as to the distribution of the cloud;
but we will now imagine a layer of such thickness as to allow
 only a very small fraction of the incident radiation to pene
trate it, to line the interior of the reflecting envelope. This
layer itself plays the part of a practically perfect reflector; and
it is not difficult to see that the reflecting envelope hitherto
conceived to lie beyond it may be removed without interfering
with the state of things on the inner side of the layer of cloud.
We thus arrive at the rather startling conclusion that at any
distance from the source, and whatever the distribution of
clouds, there is always in every direction the full radiation due
to the temperature of the source, provided only that there lie
outside a complete shell of cloud sufficiently thick to be im
  ervious. And this state of things is maintained without (on
the whole) emission of energy from the source.
   Even if the material composing the cloud possesses absorb
ing-power for some kinds of radiation, e.g. for dark radiation,
but is perfectly transparent to other kinds, e.g. luminous
radiation, the general theorem holds good as respects the latter
kinds; so that in the case supposed the light would still be
everywhere the same as in a clear enclosure whose walls
have  throughout the same luminosity as the source. But in
order to compensate the absorption of dark rays, the source
must now be supplied with energy.

                 Theory of Illumination in a Fog.                 445
    Some of the principles here enunciated have an acoustical
 as well as an optical application, and indeed first occurred to
 me some years ago in connection with Prof. Tyndall's inves
 tigations upon fog-signals. The effect of “acoustic clouds.”
 analogous to fog (and unattended with absorption of energy),
might be very different upon the report of a gun and upon
the sustained sound of a siren, the latter being reinforced by
reflection from the acoustic fog.
    The theory presented in the present paper may be illus
trated by the known solution of the comparatively simple
 problem of a pile of transparent plates". If p denote the
proportion of the incident light reflected at a single surface,
then the proportion reflected p(m), and º *(m), by
a pile of m plates is given by
                 $(m) k(m)                    1
                  2mp T 1–p TT-F(2m-T)p'
    From these expressions it is evident that, however small p
may be, i.e. however feeble the reflection at a single surface,
we have only to suppose m large enough in order that the
reflection may be as complete, and the transmission as small,
as we please. Such a pile may, under ordinary conditions,
be regarded as impervious.
    But now suppose that after passing the pile of m plates, the
light is incident upon a second pile of n plates, and consider
the intensity between the two piles, the original intensity
being unity, as before. For the intensity of the light tra
velling in the original direction we have

When m and n are great, both expressions reduce to n/(m+n);
so that the light passing in the two directions is equally bright.
Moreover, and this is the point to be especially noticed, how
ever great m may be—that is, however impervious the first pile
is, the light between the two piles may be made to approach
the original light in brightness as nearly as we please, suffi|
ciently increasing the number of plates in the second pile;
that is, the light between the piles may be made to be the same
as if the first pile were removed. From this example we may
understand more clearly how a very small quantity of light
penetrating directly may be beaten backwards and forwards,
as between two reflectors, until the original intensity is
recovered.
    XLIX. A Monochromatic Telescope, with Application to
            Photometry. By Lord RAYLEIGH, F.R.S.*
THE purpose of this instrument is to exhibit external objects
         as they would be seen either with the naked eye, or
through a telescope, if lighted with approximately monochro
matic light ; that is, to do more perfectly what is done roughly
by a coloured glass.                                  -
    The arrangement is not new, though I am not aware that
 it has ever been described. In 1870 I employed it for deter
 minations of absorption, and, if my memory serves me right,
 I heard soon afterwards from Clerk-Maxwell that he also had
 used it.    It is, indeed, a very slight modification of Maxwell's
 colour-box.
     In the ordinary form of that instrument, white light ad
 mitted through a slit is rendered parallel by a collimating
 lens, dispersed by flint-glass prisms, and then brought to a
 focus at a screen, upon which accordingly a pure spectrum is
  formed. This screen is perforated by a second slit, immedi
 ately behind which the observer places his eye. It is evident
  that the light passing the aperture is approximately mono
  chromatic, so that the observer, if he focuses his eye suitably,
  will see the prism illuminated with this kind of light. The
  only addition now required to convert the instrument into a
  monochromatic telescope is a lens placed just within the first
  slit, of such power as to throw an image of external objects

upon the prism or diaphragm upon which the eye is focused.
If desired, an eye-lens may be placed at the second slit ;
but this is not generally needed.
   In the present instrument a direct-vision dispersing prism
is used, so that the optical parts can be all disposed in a
narrow box of nearly 3 feet in length. The lenses are all
single lenses, and work sufficiently well. The slits are of such
width that either coincides with the image of the other, and
their relative position is so chosen that the mean refrangibility
of the light is that corresponding to sodium. Objects seen

   The principal object which I had in view in the construc
tion of the instrument now exhibited was to see whether it
could be made of service in the comparison of compound
lights of somewhat different colours—a problem just now
attracting attention in connection with electric lighting. It
is scarcely necessary to say that a comparison of this kind is
physically incomplete unless it extends to all the spectral
components separately ; but for commercial purposes such an
 extended comparison is too complicated, and indeed useless.
 Determinations at two points of the spectrum, as proposed
by Capt. Abney, would certainly suffice for ordinary purposes;
and in view of the convenience of expressing the result by a
single number, it is not unlikely that people practically con
 cerned in these matters will content themselves with a com
 parison at one point. It seems desirable that some convention
 should be arrived at without much further delay; so that two
 lights should be considered to be commercially equal, if they
 have the same intensity of, e.g., sodium or of thallium light.
 It will be understood that such a mode of estimation assumes
 that the intensity varies along the spectrum in a gradual
 manner; and this consideration may tell against the use of
 the sodium light as a standard, inasmuch as the component in
 question often predominates unduly in candle-flames from the
 actual presence of sodium.
    Whatever choice be made, an instrument like the present
 may be employed to make the desired selection; and it is
 applicable to any photometric arrangement. For my own
 experiments I have used the shadow-method, and find it pos
 sible to compare any bright sources, however different in colour.
 The only difficulty arises from the necessary enfeeblement of
 the light by selection, and this practically precludes observa
 tion with standard candles. With gas-flames and glow-lamps
 the light is sufficient.

    N a paper written for the British Association at Montreal,
       44 8. the Seat of the Electromotive Forces in the Voltaic
 Cell,” printed in the Philosophical Magazine for March, April,
and May this year, there occurs the following footnote to
section 23 (Phil. Mag. May 1885, vol. xix. p. 355):
   “It is always easy to tell from thermoelectric data which
way the force acts at a junction ; but it is not always the
same way as the current flows, by any means. A current
often flows against the E.M.F. even at a hot junction, and it
may flow against the force at both junctions. This is the
case, for instance, in a copper-iron circuit with one junction
above 275°, and the other below that temperature by a greater
amount. It is customary to say that the current flows across
a hot junction from the metal of higher to the metal of lower
thermoelectric value: this is not necessarily true. The safe
statement is to say that the E.M.F. acts from high to low
thermoelectric value at either junction.”
   A short statement like this is apt to be buried in a long
paper on other matters, and      hº not of any high      import
ance, it is always worth while to keep as clear as possible on
all elementary matters, if only for the sake of one’s students.
The point is perhaps most easily illustrated by considering
special cases; but I may first briefly explain my general
point of view in case there may be some objection to it.
   It is well known that the whole E.M.F. of a thermoelectric
circuit is obtainable by integrating, all round, a certain func
tion of the temperature and of the metals in circuit, which may
be called the Peltier function, II,

where the 6 stands for absolute temperature. On Tait's
assumption that what. Thomson called “the specific heat of
electricity in a metal” is proportional to 6—equal, say, to k,6
for metal A, and to kºff for metal B–the value of II is
                     II = (ka-kº)6(60–6),
where 6, is a constant to be determined by experiment, just
as ka and k, are to be determined.

   From these equations the value of the total E.M.F. of the
simple circuit, with its two junctions at temperature 6, and 6,
is obviously
              E=(k,-k)(6–6);6,-4(6, 4-6)};
a well-known formula, first established empirically by Avena
 rius as far as the variable part is concerned.
   Now although II, the É.i. coefficient, can thus be re
 garded as a function to be integrated all round the circuit, it
is possible also to regard it as localized—part of it constituting
an E.M.F. residing at the junctions, and part of it having its
abode wherever a slope of temperature occurs in either metal.
And, indeed, the generation and destruction of heat at the
junctions, observable when a current flows round the circuit
and known as the Peltier effect, together with the apparent
convection of heat by electricity discovered by Sir W.
Thomson, and which in 1876* I ventured to call the Thomson
effect, compel us to picture to ourselves an E.M.F. at each
junction, which may be called specifically Peltier forces and
be denoted by III and II2, and another E.M.F. in each metal
wherever the temperature slopes; the total force in the metal A
between the temperatures        }.  and 6, being denoted by 6),
that in the other metal by 69, and both being called Thomson

rent passing; the existence of the forces is independent of such
an accident. The Thomson force depends for its existence
upon inequality of temperature; the Peltier force does not, it
varies only with absolute temperature, and nature of metals.
Equality of temperature throughout the circuit abolishes the
Thomson forces, but only renders equal the Peltier ones, their
continued existence being provable by producing the Peltier
effect. The resultant E.M.F. of the whole simple circuit,
with junctions at 6, and 69, is
                     E=III–II, + 0.1–0, ;
whence, from the preceding equations, we get
                     III = (ka-kº)6(60–61),
                     II2 = (ka–b)6,(6, 69),

where the k's may quite easily be negative in certain metals.

powers: the term “thermoelectric power” being defined,

   It is now easy to follow out the changes in magnitude and
sign of the four forces III, II, 6), and (), for a circuit of any
two metals as their junctions are varied in temperature; and
the diagrams (Plate III.), illustrative of twelve typical cases
observable with an iron-copper circuit, are not without
interest.
   The Peltier force acts from copper to iron for all tempera
tures below the neutral point 275°  E.   at this point it vanishes,
and above this point it is reversed : in other words, copper is
the metal of higher thermoelectric power below 275°, but iron
is, above. The Thomson force happens to act from hot to
cold in iron, and from cold to hot in copper, always; and it
increases uniformly with the difference º the squares of the
absolute end-temperatures.
   The temperature of each junction is indicated on the figures
in Centigrade degrees. The arrows indicate the direction of
the electromotive forces at the different places, and numbers
attached to the arrows show their magnitude. The central
arrow represents the resultant E.M.F., or current, in magni
tude and direction.    The unit in which all the E.M.F.s are
specified is the ten-thousandth of a volt.
   It will be observed that in cases 4 and 7 the current flows
against the force at the hot junction; and that in cases 6 and
9 it flows with the force at the cold junction, being helped on
thereby. The common statement that the current flows from
a metal of higher to a metal of lower thermoelectric value
across the hot junction is thus by no means necessarily true.
Its truth depends upon circumstances. It is not even true to
say that the self-generated current necessarily cools the hot
junction and warms the cold one. It may warm both ; it may
cool both. It may even, in some peculiar cases, cool the cold
junction and warm the hot: see below.
   These diagrams, though they express nothing but what is
well known, the numbers being calculated from Tait's table
of thermoelectric values as given in any textbook, yet are
interesting from the point of view of the second law of thermo
dynamics, being some of them apparent exceptions to, or con
tradictions of, some statements of that law.
    It will be observed that the current usually flows with the
 force at the hot junction, and therefore cools it; but it may

                      on Thermo-electric Circuits.                     451
flow against this force, thus increasing the temperature of the
hottest part of the circuit.
    Again, the current usually flows against the force at the
cold junction, and therefore warms it; but it may flow with
this force, thus lowering the temperature of the coolest portion
of the circuit.
    It would be curious to obtain a case where the current
flowed with the force at the cold junction and against that at
the hot, thus carrying heat from the coldest to the hottest
parts of the system. But, so long as the lines of a thermo
electric diagram are straight, this is not possible; as may be
seen by proving the following criteria:—

 and denoting by the average temperature (t1 +tº), we can
 SaV:--
    `i. current flows against the force at the hot junction only
        when the neutral point lies between the highest and the
        average temperatures;
 i. e. when
                                t| > to > t.
     The current flows with the force at the cold junction only
        when the neutral point lies between the lowest and
        average temperatures;
 i. e. when
                               t > to > t.3.
     These conditions, though either of them is easily possible,
 are mutually incompatible; hence both cases cannot occur at
 once. In other words, if the current flow against the force at
 the hot junction, it must flow against the force at the cold
 one too.
     The same thing is also evident by considering a thermoelec
  tric diagram, though perhaps not quite so easily. It will then,
  however, be further perceived that the impossibility under
  consideration is not a fundamental one depending on thermo
  dynamic laws, but is a mere consequence of the experimental
  straightness of the thermoelectric lines; and that if for any
  metal the line is really curved", as may well be the case, so
  that between it and another there are two neutral points, it
  is quite possible to arrange so that the current shall be assisted
  by the force at the cold junction, and opposed by the force

  p. 178).

at the hot. In other words, it is possible for the hot junction
to be heated and the cold junction cooled, or for the initial
inequality of temperature to be increased by the current ex
cited by reason of that very inequality; unless the electric
convection of heat along the metals reduces the inequality of
temperature to a greater extent. But for this act of repa
ration there is no necessity ; for instance, in the special
cases considered, the current opposes the flow of heat by
conduction both in iron and in copper; carrying cold with it.
so to speak, in both cases. Thus the electric convection of
heat, on the whole, tends to accentuate the difference of
temperature in these cases. Conduction may reduce it, but
in Thomson's theory conduction is carefully regarded as a non
essential concomitant.
   Now how is it possible for the hottest part of a system to be
automatically warmed, and for the coldest portion to be auto
matically cooled ” Or, again, how can an automatically
generated current be assisted by heat derived from the coldest
part of a system, and be opposed by having to generate heat
at the hottest part?
   According to some statements of the second law of thermo
dynamics, such a result would be paradoxical or impossible.
And yet the result is deduced by help of the second law itself:
the form of the law being, <U+017F>º   =0 when taken round a circuit,
Or * is a complete differential of a temperature-function ;
dependent therefore on end-temperatures only, not on nature
of metal or distribution of intermediate temperatures.
   If H is the heat converted into electrical energy at any
part of the circuit, and E the resultant total E.M.F., then no
doubt, as in any reversible heat-engine, the work done per cycle
                By-a<U+017F>"" taken round the circuit;
and the disappearance of heat exactly accounts for the elec
trical energy, without having to fall back upon degradation
 by irreversible processes such as conduction. But the note
 worthy thing is that, whereas usually heat is destroyed at the
 hotter parts and generated at the colder parts of a system, in
 this case heat may be generated at the hottest and destroyed
 at the coldest parts; i. great bulk of the conversion of heat
 into electrical energy being carried on at intermediate tempe
 ratures. H is not a bit proportional to absolute temperature,
 as it is in a simple heat-engine; it may even be zero or nega
 tive, and may attain its maximum at any temperature, except
 indeed at the very lowest in the system.

   I am sorry to say that I did not see this clearly at first, nor
do I see it now as clearly as I should like, and I have accord
ingly wasted three days in an attempt to take account of
conduction of heat, or at least of a certain minimum amount of
it, as if it were an essential part of the process; the raising of
heat-potential by the current in certain cases being only
accountable, as it seemed to me, by reason of a definite and
calculable amount of degradation by conduction ; after the
manner of a water-ram.

LI. On Supersaturation of Salt-Solutions. By W. W. J.

   “Le sulfate de soude dissous dans l'eau ä des températures quelconques
est anhydre.   Il n'y a de solution sursaturée.”f
 Bºº. I proceed to give an account of my experiments
         on this subject and the conclusions based on them, it is
 necessary to point out that there are two distinct kinds of
 supersaturation.
    Supersaturation, in general, may be defined as–
    The existence in solution of a larger quantity of salt than
 the water is normally capable of holding in solution at the
 temperature of experiment.
     Or as clearly expressed by Mulderf–
     “Oververzadiging is: meer in oplossing hebben bij eene
 zekere temperatuur dan bij die temperatuur in oplossing kan
 overgaan, wanneer men begint met het vaste zout en dat
 behandelt met water bij die temperatuur. ... Oververzadiging
 is dus: behoud van een toestand, aan het zout gegeven door
 eene hoogere temperatuur.”
     “Supersaturation is the holding in solution at a given tem
 perature more salt than can be dissolved at that temperature,
  starting with the solid salt and treating it with water at that
  temperature. It is thus the possession of a condition which
 is conferred on a salt by a higher temperature.”
      Supersaturation as thus defined is common to all salts
  without exception. But it will be seen on reflection that, as
  I have said, there are two kinds:—
     1st. That occurring in presence of undissolved salt.

454                   Dr. W. W. J. Nicol on
   2nd. That which manifests itself only in the absence of
undissolved salt.
   Of the above, the former occurs with all salts, hydrated or
anhydrous in the solid form. Its existence is dependent
solely on the fact that a finite time is necessary to permit of
the establishment of equilibrium or saturation in a solution.
When a hot saturated solution is cooled to the temperature
of the air, the first portions of the excess of salt crystallize out
at once, but more slowly as the excess becomes less and less,
until when equilibrium is nearly perfect separation of solid
salt is extremely slow. This has been commented on by
Kremers under the name of “Inertia,” and is a fertile source
of error in determinations of solubility. I have myself de
tected traces of this form of supersaturation even in the case
of solutions which have been prepared at a high temperature
and, after cooling, agitated for twenty-four i. with the
solid salt; the percentage dissolved was frequently slightl
greater than in the case of solutions prepared from '...; º
and water without previous heatingt.
   This is, I hope to show, true supersaturation; it is never
well marked, and is not permanent, the excess of salt thus
remaining in solution being exceedingly small, and becoming
less and less with time.
   The phenomenon usually termed supersaturation is the
second of the two kinds I      hº distinguished, and is quite
distinct from the former. It occurs only with hydrated salts,
and is well marked and permanent. The amount of salt thus
retained may be very large, and crystallization may, under
certain conditions, be     i.      indefinitely. It is manifested
whenever a strong warm solution of a hydrated salt is allowed
to cool out of contact with the air or in contact with air
which has been heated or filtered through cotton-wool. In
nearly all cases such solutions remain permanently liquid, de
positing crystals on strong cooling, which dissolve again on
the application of a   gºi.         such as that of the hand. No
crystallization is caused by shaking or by the passage of elec
tricity; but crystallization takes place at once on the addition
of a crystal of the hydrated salt.
   It is with such cases of supersaturation that this paper has
to deal, and I hope to be able to show that, though a solution
may deposit salt under the above conditions, yet it is not
really supersaturated. I have confined myself strictly to the
state of the solutions, and have no remarks to offer on the
causes which bring about crystallization.

               Supersaturation of Salt-Solutions.            455
   The question I have set myself is: What is a (so-called)
supersaturated solution? And the answer I have obtained is
a very simple, though at first sight strange one. It is a non
saturated or just-saturated solution of the anhydrous salt.
   It is nearly three years since I made my first experiments
on this subject, by determining the density of supersaturated
solutions of sulphate and thiosulphate of sodium before and
after crystallization; but at that time the results obtained had
no meaning to me, and it is only recently that I have been
able to interpret them. The modus operandi was as follows:—
A quantity of salt was placed in a weighed specific-gravity
bottle, which was again weighed. A quantity of water was
added, and the whole reweighed; then some paraffin-oil of
known density was added, and the bottle was placed in hot
water till complete solution was effected. After cooling, the
bottle was filled up with paraffin, the stopper inserted, and
then placed in a constant-temperature bath for some time, and
finally dried and weighed. When the stopper was removed,
a minute crystal of the salt under examination, when dropped
through the paraffin into the solution, produced instant crys
stallization.  After three or four hours in the constant-tem
perature bath crystallization was assumed to be complete, and,
after refilling with paraffin, the bottle was again weighed.
From the data thus obtained it was easy to calculate the
 density of the solution, and also that of the mixture of salt
 and saturated solution resulting from the crystallization. It

456                       Dr. W. W. J. Nicol on
 was found that separation of Na, SO, 10aq. was attended by
 expansion, Na, S, OS 5 aq. by contraction; and it was this con
 tradictory behaviour of the two salts that caused me to abandon
 the experiments for the time.
    In more recent experiments I employed the apparatus in
 the figure, which is in many respects more accurate and more
 easily worked with than a bottle; at the same time I saw the
 futility of determining the density after crystallization: the
 whole secret was to be found in the solution before solidifi
 cation. Expansion or contraction was a mere accident
 peculiar to the salt employed.

   In the case of sodium thiosulphate, the first solution deter
mined was that saturated for the hydrated salt at 20° C., and
after that solutions of various strengths up to that consisting
of the salt fused in its water of crystallization. With sodium,
sulphate the solutions ranged in strength from the half-mole
cule up to one containing more than six molecules of salt per

                Supersaturation of Salt-Solutions.            457
hundred water-molecules; this last is the strongest solution
that can be conveniently worked with. In the case of both
salts the molecular volume constantly increases with the con
centration, very rapidly at first, and then more slowly, just as it
does in the case of an ordinary solution of an anhydrous salt,
such as potassium nitrate. The chief point of importance is
the absence of any abrupt break above the ordinary satura
tion-point; there is no discontinuity, the steady increase is
unbroken ; there is nothing in the numbers for the molecular
volumes to indicate a difference in the constitution of the
solution. I ought to add that, owing to the unavoidable loss
of water during the heating necessary for the solution of the
salt, it is not to be expected that the density determinations
should be as accurate as those of ordinary solutions; not
much reliance can be placed, I fear, on the fourth figure; not
by any means so much as on the fifth figure in other cases: the
effect of this is to affect the molecular volume in the first
decimal to the extent of +5.
   It would seem, then, that these solutions were simply solu
tions of the anhydrous salt which are yet unsaturated. I
have already expressed my conviction that a salt in solution
parts with its water of crystallization *, and attempted to
prove it by experiment. If this were correct, and the super
saturated solution such as I conceived it to be, it followed
that anhydrous sodium sulphate should dissolve in a so-called
supersaturated solution ; in other words, a solution saturated
by contact with crystals of a hydrated salt should be able to
dissolve that salt when dehydrated.
   To test this a wide-mouthed bottle was nearly filled with
crystals of Nags,0s 5 aq., and placed in boiling water. The
quantity of salt was nearly 60 grammes; a small, thin glass
bulb containing less than a gramme of the dehydrated salt,
and sealed, was also placed in the bottle. When the thiosul
phate was completely fused, the stopper was put in, and, after
cooling slightly, the bottle was placed in water at about
15°C. Thiosulphate of sodium fuses at 48° to 50° C., yet
the solution thus obtained was perfectly stable ; no crystalli
zation was caused by gentle shaking. By a smart blow of
the bottle on the knee the small bulb was broken, and the
dehydrated salt brought in contact with the solution; no
crystallization took place; on the contrary, solution was com
plete in a few seconds. The experiment was repeated with
from 4 to 4.5 grms. of Na2S2Os to 40 grims. of Nags, Os 5 aq.
In this case solution was not complete at the ordinary tem
perature, but was readily effected by heat. When the solu

458                   Dr. W. W. J. Nicol on
tion thus obtained was cooled, crystals slowly separated out
at the air temperature. Some crystals thus obtained were
drained as completely as possible from the oily mother-liquor,
and then removed and pressed between filter-paper; in spite
of the draining they were found to be imbedded in a mass of
the solidified hydrated salt. On heating, the original crystals
did not change form, and remained nearly transparent. The
total loss of water on the mixture was 17 per cent., corre
sponding to NazS,0s 2 aq. The crystals cannot therefore con
tain more than one molecule of water; and in view of their
transparency and not changing in form on heating, it appears
probable that they were anhydrous. The crystalline form was
an obtuse rhombohedron. I have not been able to find any
account of a salt containing less than five molecules of water.
   A solution of sodium sulphate, which was distinctly super
saturated at 20°C., readily dissolved a considerable quantity
of the anhydrous salt when introduced as above, even at
15° C. Another solution deposited anhydrous salt at 30°C.,
which redissolved on cooling to 20°C.; while Na2SO, 7 aq.
crystallized out on cooling a few degrees. These crystals,
however, quickly dissolved when the i. was warmed in
the hand. The most remarkable feature of these experiments
was that in no instance was any caking of the anhydrous salt
observed, as would have been the case had it combined with
the water to form a hydrate before dissolving ; it is, of course,
evident that no trace of the normal hydrate was in any case
produced, for this would have determined the crystallization
of the supersaturated solution.
   The only experiments in any way resembling those above
described that I have been able to find an account of, are
those of Coppet and Thompson.
   Coppet” describes the manufacture of supersaturated solu
tions of sodium sulphate and other salts by the addition of
anhydrous or partially dehydrated salt to water. He found
that, in order to succeed, it was necessary to exclude unfiltered
air and to add the salt in exceedingly small quantities at a
time. With sodium sulphate he found that he could thus
obtain a solution containing nearly five times as much anhy
drous salt as is contained in a solution prepared from the
decahydrated salt at the same temperature. In this case the
addition of the anhydrous salt must have been so slow, that
when the ordinary saturated solution was produced no deca
hydrated salt remained undissolved; or it is quite possible
that no decahydrated salt is formed by the addition of anhy
drous salt to any but very dilute solutions.

                 Supersaturation of Salt-Solutions.            459
    Again, J. S.Thompson", in experimenting with potash-alum,
found that a supersaturated solution, prepared by saturating
water at 90° C. with the ordinary hydrate, deposited no
º         on cooling to the ordinary temperature; but that a
solution saturated at 95°C. deposited small clear crystals.
On breaking the flask in ice-cold water and washing the
crystals, he found on analysis that they were ordinary alum
with 24 molecules of water.         This was of course to be ex
pected as the natural result of his mode of experiment, for the
anhydrous salt or a lower hydrate would at once take up
water to form the normal hydrate; while it is equally evident
that the crystals could not have been the normal hydrate, or
they would have caused crystallization of the supersaturated
 solution in which they were formed.
     There is therefore, it appears to me, little doubt that the
so-called supersaturated solutions furnish a further proof of
my contention that a salt exists in solution not as a hydrate
 definite or indefinite, but in the anhydrous state. This may
 appear a curious statement, but I fail to see what other
 explanation can be given of the water of crystallization
 possessing the same volume as the solvent water, as has been
 proved by the experiments by Ostwald and myself on the
 molecular volumes of solutions of nearly two hundred salts of
 various metals. This will not appear so strange when it is
 remembered that it is already pretty generally admitted that
 double salts as a rule exist only in the solid state, combina
 tion taking
 solution.
               F'.    only at the moment of crystallization from
                  have already (loc. cit.) pointed out the fallacy
  involved in the argument from the heat of hydration ; and
  the only difficulty that remains is the colour of certain salts in
  solutions of various degrees of concentration, or in the solid
  state. Thus anhydrous copper sulphate or the monohydrated
  salt is colourless, while the pentahydrate and the solution is
  blue. Again, cobalt chloride is red when hydrated and solid,
  blue when dehydrated; on the other hand, a strong solution
  of this salt is red when cold, blue when hot. This has
  always been regarded as a conclusive proof of the existence
  of the hydrated salt in at least dilute and cold solutions. But
  it is more than probable that the whole secret of the above
   colour-changes lies in the difference in the aggregations of
   molecules and not in the amount of hydration of the salt.
   We do not in the least know what multiple of the usual
   formula for a molecule forms the individual in the solid state
   or in solution ; and it would be by no means a forced explana
   tion of the above colour-changes to attribute them to the

simplification of these aggregations of molecules.      It would
 be quite possible that the volume-changes attending this
disgregation would escape detection by the methods I have
employed ; but the changes in volume produced by hydration
or nonhydration are far too large not to be detected by a
comparison of the molecular volumes of the solutions, especially
when dealing with salts containing a large number of mole
cules of water of crystallization. I do not at present wish to
lay much stress on this explanation; it is, it seems to me, a
point which has by no means received the attention which is
its due ; but I am convinced that until this is conclusively
settled one way or another, it is premature to bring forward
colour-changes as the sole evidence in favour of    ..i.
of salts in solution—a conclusion directly negatived by the
molecular volumes of the very salts on the colours of whose
solutions the whole hypothesis is based.
   Further, such colour-changes are well known to occur in
cases where no dehydration or other decomposition can occur,
and where the only explanation is to be found in an alteration
of the molecular constitution. Numerous instances are given
in a paper by Carnelley on the colour of chemical compounds
as a function of their atomic weights * ; but one or two may
be given here with advantage. Thus, mercuric oxide and red
lead are both red when cold, but darken when heated, ulti
mately becoming almost black though no decomposition has
taken place, as is proved by their regaining their original
colour on cooling. Again, the temperature of boiling water
is sufficient to turn the scarlet cuprous mercuric iodide black,
the scarlet colour returning when the salt is cold. The dif
ferences in colour of mercuric sulphide are also due to a
difference in molecular constitution. But perhaps the most
instructive instance of all is to be found in the effect of heat
on the hexhydrated cobalt chloride itself: when the solid
crystals are gently warmed they change from red to blue
without any loss of water, they do not lose their transparency,
and the colour-change is found to have extended to the very
centre of the crystal.
   The results of my experiments may be summarized as
follows:–
   (1) The individual in solution is not the same as that in
the solid state when hydrated salts are considered.
   (2) It is to this that supersaturation is due.
   (3) A supersaturated solution is a solution of the anhy
drous salt, which may or may not be saturated. So long as
no disturbing cause operates to bring about combination of

the salt and water a supersaturated solution differs in no
respect from an ordinary solution.
    (4) The state of unstable equilibrium existing in a super
Saturated solution is analogous to that existing in water cooled
below its freezing-point.

salt previous to solution occurs only when the salt is dis
solved in pure water or in a very dilute solution of itself.
LII. On Binocular Glasses adjustable to Eyes having unequal
      Focal Lengths. By Colonel MALCOLM, R.E., C.B.”
       HETHER many people are born with their eyes differ
          ing in focal length or not I cannot say; it is sufficient
that I have arrived at a period of life when glasses are neces
sary to enable me to read with comfort, and also that I found
a very highly treasured pair of binocular glasses, by Voigt
länder, become yearly more difficult to use, and at last useless;
but I found that I could see with equal distinctness with each
eye, using only one eye at a time, on condition of a very slight
alteration of focus.
   Mr. Browning, optician, in the Strand, having tested my
eyes for a pair of     º           told me that, as regards the
ordinary reading and writing distances at any rate, my eyes
were not a pair, and that after a certain age few people's were
who had used their eyes much.
   Accepting the fact, I set to work to make my binocular
glasses once more useful—in this way.
    One tube is left untouched ; the eyepiece of the other is so
arranged that it can be moved through a small range in and
out, with reference to the eyepiece of the untouched tube,
by turning round a milled ring. An index arrangement is
provided.
   The unaltered tube is used with one eye and brought to
the most perfect focus possible in the ordinary way; then the
other tube is used with the other eye, and by means of the
adjustment its definition is made as perfect as may be, the
ordinary adjustment not being interfered with. The two eyes
are then used together ; and the process of adjustment had
better be gone over again, as certainly the two eyes do help
each other.
    The final position of the index-mark is noted ; and that
holds good for all ranges, as far as I have tried.
    Having noted this, you may lend your glasses to your friend,

The increase of power in the glasses, and of comfort to the
user of them, has been a surprise to almost all who have tried
the improved adjustment.
    I do not enlarge upon the way in which Mr. Browning
has carried out the details; you can see for yourselves that
the improvement in no way disfigures the glasses, and as the
expense is 12s. 6d. for glasses made to the common pattern,
I think that the improvement is within the reach of most
people who use binoculars.
    LIII. On the Self-Regulation of the Compound Dynamo.
                By A. W. RücKER, M.A., F.R.S.*
THE        theory of the self-regulating power of the compound
        dynamo has not been treated in a satisfactory manner
in any discussion of the subject with which I am acquainted.
 Some conclusions as to the proper method of constructing
self-regulating dynamos have been drawn from equations in
which the power of perfect self-regulation is assumed. As
this perfection is known to be unattainable, no great weight
 can be given to arguments based on the assumption in ques
tion, and it will in the following paper be abandoned. A
 further inquiry will also be ...] upon, viz. how far the
 conditions of good self-regulation are consistent with the other
 desiderata aimed at in the construction of a dynamo–such,
 for instance, as high efficiency.
    The entire investigation will be based on Frölich's equation,
 which expresses the electromotive force in terms of the
 current and the constants of the machine, and will therefore
 not apply in cases where the prejudicial effect of the magne
 tization of the armature is apparent. The notation and
 diagrammatic representation of the machine are those which I
have found useful for teaching purposes.

   Let the values of the resistances be as indicated in the
figure. Let the total electromotive force be E, that between
Y and A ei, and that between A and X es. The currents in
r1 and pi may be represented by ci and yi, and a similar nota
tion used for the other conductors.
    Finally, let the whole resistance be R, let the resistances of
the multiple arcs between Y.A and A X be R', and R', respec
tively, and let c’ be the total current in each of these multiple
arCS.
    The current is to be conceived as flowing out of the arma
ture at Y, passing on to the three conductors pa; pi, and ri,
and returning .*.
    All the existing forms of dynamo can be represented by
leaving out some of the conductors shown in the above sym
metrical figure. Their properties are perhaps more easily
 ...i.             regarding them as particular cases of a more
highly generalized machine. The notation used has also
another advantage. The shunt in the Compound Dynamo
may be used in one of two ways—viz. as a shunt upon the
armature alone, or as a shunt upon the armature * series
 coils. It is usual to represent its resistance by a symbol which
 indicates only that it is a shunt, without showing in which of
 these ways it is used. If, however, it is agreed that r, shall
 always represent the external resistance, ri being in any prac
 tical case infinite, then p1 always represents the series-coils,
 and pa or p, the shunt-coil according as it is applied in the
 first or second of the methods above referred to.
    If we adopt Frölich's equation we may write
                  E={{MG70-tº-tº-tº);

 and a is a small constant depending on the gradual weak
             ening of the magnetizing effects of the currents as
             the iron approaches saturation.
     The product soyo represents the number of ampere-turns by
  which the initial magnetic field is, or may be supposed to be,
  produced. If yo is an independent current, this quantity may
  be large. If it is only a fictitious current which is regarded
  as the cause of the permanent magnetism, soyo is small. If
  the product of soyo and of a may be neglected, and if Ms/yo-k,

   We thus see that if the current or difference of potential
which it is required to maintain as constant as possible be
 represented by the general symbol b, then, in the case of
either machine,
                  $=P/(A+w)—Q/(B+a);
 where A, B, P, and Q do not depend upon the variable resist
 ance, and where w is either the resistance or the conductivity
 of the variable conductor.
    All problems on self-regulation in the case of either machine
 may therefore be solved by means of this formula, and the
 application of the results is made by giving to the constants
 the values proper to the machine, and to the meaning of the
 symbol © in the particular case under consideration.
    It will be observed that the constant A is always either the
 resistance, or the reciprocal of the resistance offered by the
 machine to a current produced by a battery placed in the

468        Prof. A. W. Rücker on the Self-Regulation
external circuit—i.e. it is either the resistance or the conduc
tivity of the machine. If that resistance be represented by Ra,
A= R, if q is the external current, and A=1/ R, if it is the
external electromotive force.
   If u and m are respectively the largest and smallest values
of a between which self-regulation is aimed at, then tº -m may
be called the range of w. There will in general be some par
ticular value of a which will be most frequently employed.
 This may be called the usual value of a, and may be denoted
by §. As it is sometimes necessary to distinguish between
the cases in which w is a resistance and a conductivity, the
value of r, which corresponds to £ will be indicated by ra.
                       Conditions of Efficiency.
   Although a self-regulating machine is primarily intended to
supply the same current or electromotive force whatever
(within certain limits) the resistance of the external circuit
may be, it is nevertheless desirable that it should be as
efficient as possible. It is well known that the efficiency
is a maximum for a given value of the external resistance;
and it is evident that the machine should not only have a high
efficiency, but that the maximum should, if possible, be attained
under the ordinary conditions of working.

   These formulae may be put in another form, which is useful
as it is very easy to remember. In either kind of compound
machine, and in the ordinary shunt dynamo, if the resistance
of the armature is infinite, it is possible for a current generated
in the external circuit to pass from one extremity of the external
circuit to the other, i. e. from one terminal to the other, exclu
sively through wires which form parts of the magnetizing
spirals. In the case of the Short-Shunt Machine this path
includes both spirals; in the ordinary Shunt or in the Long
Shunt Compound Machine it includes one spiral only. §
we call the resistance of this path X, then in all three cases
the maximum efficiency is given by the equation
               m=(VX-VR,)/(VX-- VR n);
and the value of the external resistance for which the maxi
mum efficiency is attained by
                             r;= XR.
   In cases where the resistance of the shunt is large, approxi
mate expressions may be deduced from the above by substi

                   of the Compound Dynamo.                      471
tuting the resistance of the shunt for X, and the sum of the
resistances of the armature and series-coil for Rºn.
   If the maximum efficiency is attained when r, has its usual
value, we may put the last expression in a form which will be
useful hereafter. Let Y be a quantity which has with regard
to X, the same meaning as a with regard to re; i.e. let it be
 =X or 1/X according as % represents the external current
or external electromotive force.     Then
                 m=(w/Y ~ WA)/(VY + w(A);
and if the maximum efficiency is attained for the usual value

 Hence q has two critical values corresponding to the values
 of a given by the equation
                w(v/PT VQ)=–BVP+AVQ.
 If we take the lower signs, w is necessarily negative unless B
 is negative ; which can only be the case if some of the indu
 cing spirals are wound in the negative direction, i.e. so that
 they reduce the strength of the magnetic field. If B is nega
 tive, it is evident that q is infinite for a positive value of w.
 This unintelligible result is explained by reference to the

472         Prof. A. W. Rücker on the Self-Regulation
general equation in which both k and a are included, viz.
                  (E–nk)(E+ R/a S)=nME/a.
For if some of the quantities sa, si, or sº are negative, and if
the value of r, is such that S=0, then E=nk. The approxi
mate expression which is being discussed fails therefore in this
case, but it applies to cases in which one of the spirals is
wound in the negative direction but in which B remains
positive. Reference to the expressions for B shows that this
will be the case in the Short-Shunt Machine if the series-coils
are negative and if the number of turns is < sapi /pa, and in
the Long-Shunt Machine if the shunt-coils are negative and
if sº 3 s. In other cases Q is negative also.
   Confining our attention therefore to the case in which B is
positive, let X be the critical value of a, and p the corre
sponding value of p.
   Then                  -         -       -      --
                X=(A VC)—B.VP)/(w/P– VQ), . . (11)

whence, at the critical point,

            † =–2(VP— VQ)/(A–B) v PQ. . . (13)
Hence if A- B, P is positive and is a maximum ; and if
A « B, P is negative and is a minimum.
   The value of X given by (11) is not necessarily positive,
and hence we must consider a number of cases         º     differ
from each other in the relative magnitudes of A, B, P, and Q.
   In distinguishing between them, it is convenient to remember
that
                      ºp= *(P-Q)+BP—AQ.
                              (A+a)(B+w)
   It follows from this expression and from (11) that
   (I.) If P/Q.<A/B & 1,
      q is negative for all positive values of w.
   (II.) If A/B & P/Q & 1,
      % is positive for values of a 3 (BP—AQ)/(Q–P).
   (III.) If A/B 313 v P/v/Q, and therefore & P/Q,
      ºb is positive for all positive values of a.

                   of the Compound Dynamo.                  473
   In both these last cases q has no maximum value; for in (II.)
X is positive but > (BP—AQ)/ (Q–P), while in (III.) it is
negative.
   §. taking cases in which A–B is positive, we see that
   (IV.) If A/B-1-P/ Q,
      q is negative for all positive values of a.
   (W.) If A/B-P/Q-1,
      q is positive for values of w x (AQ–BP)/(P-Q).
   (VI.) If P/Q> A/B- VP/w/Q-1,
       q is positive for all positive values of w.
   In cases (W.) and (VI.) ºp has a maximum value corre
sponding to a positive value of w.
   (VII.) If v P/w/Q> A/B-1,                    -
q is positive for all positive values of a, and X is negative, so
      that there is no maximum value of p.
   The physical meaning of these different conditions may be
best understood by considering the inequalities
            P/Q- or < 1 and P/Q- or < A/B.
   If q represents the external electromotive force, the first of
these becomes, in the case of the Short-Shunt and Long-Shunt
Machines respectively,
            nM(sapi-F sipa) > or < pira + pipa + rapa, . .   (14)
and
            nMs, > or <ra + p. . . . . . . . . (15)
   But, by equation (1), the condition that the velocity is
greater or less than the critical speed is
                        nM > or < R/S;
and if, in the case of the Short-Shunt Machine, we put re-0y
this becomes for the values of R and S given above,
                  nMX or < p1?"a + pipa + rape,
                                    Sap1 + 81pa
which is identical with (14).
    Similarly, in the case of the Long-Shunt Machine, we get
for the same condition,
                       nMX or < ra-H pi y
                                       s
 which is identical with (15).
    Hence, in these cases,
                         P/Q - or < 1

474        Prof. A. W. Rücker on the Self-Regulation
according as the speed is greater or less than the critical speed
for the resistance of the circuit when the external resistance
1S Zer0.
   In like manner, it can be shown that if p represents the
external current, the expression P/Q > or < 1 according as
the speed is greater or less than the critical speed when the
external resistance is infinite.
   Inasmuch, however, as a = 1/r2 when q is the external
electromotive force, and w=r, when p is the external current,
these results may be briefly expressed by saying that P/Q is
 > or < 1, according as the speed is greater or less than the
critical speed when w is infinite.
   Similarly it may be proved that
   P/Q> or < A/B according as the speed is greater or less
      than the critical speed when a vanishes.
   On referring to the conditions laid down in the seven cases
distinguished above in the light of these explanations, we see
that they may be readily interpreted.                     e constant P is
º              to the speed, and we may conceive the ratio P/Q
to be gradually increased by augmenting the velocity of
revolution.
   Thus when A–B is positive, Case IV. is that in which the
velocity is less than the      critical velocities when was 0 or oo.
   In Case W. the velocity is greater than the critical velocity
when was co, and less than that when was 0.
   In Cases VI. and VII. it is greater than either of these
critical velocities.
   The condition that there shall be a maximum value of q is
                       A/B > VP/VQ > 1.
   As an example of how such general formulae can be applied
to a particular case, we deduce from this relation and from
equations (3) that, in the case of the Short-Shunt Dynamo, the
external electromotive force can only have a maximum value if

 Similar deductions can be made in the other cases.

                   of the Compound Dynamo.                  475
   The fact that if P/Q be sufficiently large there is no maxi
mum value of p for any positive value of a, means that if the
velocity is so great that the inducing magnets are saturated
so that the total electromotive force is constant, any increase
in the resistance of the external circuit must be accompanied
by a decrease in the current which flows through it and an
increase in the electromotive force at its extremities.   In the
former case wers, and in the latter was 1/rs, so that in both
cases an increase in a produces a decrease in ºp. This state of
things is reached before complete saturation, viz. at the point
when the prejudicial effect due to the weakening of the cur
rent produced by an increase in r, overbalances the advantage
gained by the fact that a larger  }.         of the whole cur
rent passes through the shunt. This point is reached when
                         w/P/w/Q=A/B.
   We are now in a position to discuss the amount of change
in ºf produced by a given finite change in w, i. e. the self
regulating power of the dynamo.
   The treatment of this question must be slightly varied,
according as a maximum value of p does or does not occur for
a value of a intermediate to A and m, the largest and smallest
values of that quantity between which self-regulation is
aimed at.
   If it does not, we may write
                     P         Q —
                   AT<U+017F>, T B En = $1,      |          .  .   (16)
                     P        Q      bi
where $, is the value of the electromotive force or current to
be kept constant, and q is a quantity which will be smaller as
the self-regulation is more perfect, and which will be positive
or negative according as p diminishes or increases as w
InCreases.
   If, on the other hand, X lies between tº and m, then the
equations corresponding to (16) become

   If the constants are so chosen that the values of 4 corre

    (1) the value of p which is to be attained ($1 or p);
    (2) the extreme values of a (u and m);
    (3) the percentage variation in the value of q which can
be allowed (1004 or 100p);
    (4) the usual value of a (£), together with the condition
 that the maximum efficiency shall be attained for that value;
    (5) the value of the required maximum efficiency;
 then we have four equations, viz. either (16) or (17) and the
 two equations which connect m and # with A and Y (see p. 471)
 to be satisfied by the five constants A, Y, B, P, and Q. Of
 these, A and Y are absolutely determined by the conditions;
 but any one of the three P, Q, or B may be given any con
 venient value if the maximum value of qP does not lie between
 u and m.      If it does, we have the additional relation
                  q}=(VP—w Q)”/(A–B);
 and if the values of both p' and p" are assigned, there
 are in all five equations by which the five constants are
 determined. When these five quantities are known, we
 may equate them to their appropriate values in terms of the
resistances &c. of the various parts of the machine; and we
 thus obtain five equations between eight quantities, viz.:-n,
 M, a, 81, sa (or ss), ra, pi, pa (or p.); in the selection of
 which, therefore, there is considerable range for choice.
    Although the problem of the Self-Regulation of the Com
 pound Dynamo is solved as far as the algebra is concerned,
 it is possible that the values of P, Q, &c. found for arbitrarily
 selected values of p, w, m, &c. may be negative, or such as it
 would be impossible to attain in practice.
    The question as to what value of q it is physically possible
 to attain in any given case can only be answered if we have
 regard to the limitations to the values of A, B, P, and Q which
 apply to that case. If this be done, it is possible to obtain
 limits to q, that is to the perfection of self-regulation.
    I shall add two examples of the use of equations (16) and
 (18) for this purpose.
                        Case III. A 3 B, P-Q.

                  of the Compound Dynamo.                      477
which corresponds to P. must be less than that which corre
spond to m. Hence

           = º(B+b)(B+m)
   Now since A-B is negative, we must, if P and Q are
positive, have
                       q > (w—m)/(A + m),
and, a fortiori,
                         > (u-m)/(B+ m).
   Further, since P-Q,
         {q(B+ m)–(w—m)}(A+P.)(A + m) >
              {q(A + m)–(P.-m)}(B+ u)(B+ m);

     We find, therefore, that in both these cases an inferior limit
 can be found to p or q, which depends only on tº, m, and A.
 If, therefore, the latter quantity is determined by considera
 tions relative to the efficiency, we implicitly determine at the
 same time a limit to the perfection of the self-regulation.
     The last case is probably important practically, and the
 expression obtained shows that the inferior limit to p varies,
 if A is large, nearly as the square of the range. It will
 be less as A is greater; and this statement holds good for
 all the other cases enumerated above, so that a large value
 of A is favourable to good self-regulation. On referring to
 equations (8) and (10), we see that for a given usual value of
 w a high maximum efficiency is favourable to a large value of
 A if q is the external electromotive force, and to a small value
 of A if p is the external current. Hence we conclude that it
 is more difficult to combine a high efficiency with an approxi
 mately constant external current than with an approximately
 constant external electromotive force.
                    Postscript, April 30, 1885.
     Since the above paper was read before the Physical Society,

                   of the Compound Dynamo.                  479
I have seen a solution of the question with which it deals,
published by Dr. Frölich in the current number of the Elek
trotechnische Zeitschrift, April 1885. I should like, there
fore, to add a few words as to the relations between our
investigations in respect both of time and result.
   The method and chief conclusions given in my own paper,
including the formulae for b, q, and the method of finding
limits to the perfection of the regulation, were given to my
Senior Class in Technical Electricity in February last. In
March I had several engagements which made special calls
upon my time, and partly on this account, partly because I
wished to add a discussion of the case when Q or B is nega
tive, I did not publish my results at once.
   Towards the latter end of March I received my copy of the
Elektrotechnische Zeitschrift for that month, which contained
the first part of Dr. Frölich's paper. In that he gave the
formulae for the electromotive force, current, &c. in the cases
of the series, shunt, and both forms of compound dynamo, in
terms of the external and other resistances.       The formulae
were not reduced to any simple form like the equation in 6
given by me; and though the paper showed that Dr. Frölich
was engaged on the question of self-regulation, it did not
afford any indication ..} his method of attacking the problem.
The next day after seeing this paper I sent my own investi
gation to the Secretary of the Physical       sº         It was
brought before the Council of the Society on March 28th;
but as it was thought that the matter was of some interest,
the reading of the paper was postponed till the first Meeting
after the ñº. vacation (April 25th), and I was asked to
attend for the purpose of giving an account of it myself. In
the interval I made some improvements in the statements as
to the physical meanings of the inequalities which I de
scribed at the Meeting, and have incorporated these in the text.
It is only since the paper was read that I have received the
April number of the Elektrotechnische Zeitschrift, from which I
learn that Dr. Frölich has “seit dem Abdrucke des ersten
Theiles dieses Vortrages,” and guided partly by theory,
partly by experiment, arrived at a very satisfactory solution
§   the problem of obtaining a constant external electromotive
 OrCe.
   As far, therefore, as our work is common, I do not wish to
question Dr. Frölich's undoubted right to claim prior publi
cation. The above statement is, however, necessary to show
that my results were obtained independently.
   On comparing the two papers, it will be seen that I have
throughout considered the rººm with reference to the
                              2K2

480        Prof. A. W. Rücker on the Self-Regulation
efficiency as well as to the self-regulation, and have given the
equations a more general form, in which they apply, when the
symbols are properly interpreted, either to the external electro
motive force or to the external current.        Dr. Frölich has
dealt chiefly with the case of a constant electromotive force,
in which the conditions of high efficiency and good self
regulation are in accord, and both can be secured together.
To obtain the best result, if a constant current is required,
will need a careful balancing of opposing requirements.
   As regards, however, the practical determination of another
condition which shall render the problem determinate when a
maximum value of ºb does not occur between tº and m, Dr.
Frölich has advanced the question a step beyond where I left
it, and has added very greatly to the interest of his paper.
    He has shown that when the external electromotive force is
in question, and without any reference to the value of the
external resistance for which the maximum efficiency occurs,
excellent results may be obtained by taking (in the above
notation) A*Q= B*P. I had previously shown the physical
meaning of this condition ; geometrically it amounts to
choosing the arbitrary constant, so that dºp / dw-0 when was 0.
Since, in the case under discussion, w= 1 / r, Dr. Frö
lich's curves and mine are so related that the product of the
abscissae of corresponding ordinates is unity, and the tangent
to my curve at the point where it meets the axis of q becomes
in Dr. Frölich's figures an asymptote.
   As expressed by the curve between e, and r, (Dr. Frölich's),
good self-regulation can only be obtained in this case for
values of r, greater than that at which the curve may be con
sidered to have become practically parallel to its asymptote.
As expressed by the curve between e, and 1/r, (my own),
the corresponding condition is that u shall be small enough
for the curve to be at the corresponding point practically
parallel to the tangent at the point for      ...    a = 0. Dr.
Frölich has shown that these conditions are fulfilled in prac
tice, and has thus added very materially to the importance of
his paper.
    It must, however, be noted that this solution has nothing
absolute about it unless the efficiency is considered. If it
is left out of account another constant (A) is indeterminate,
and may be chosen so as to make q a minimum.           For when
A*Q= B*P,

       77 (A + n)(B+ m)             AB+ u(A+B)
In the case under consideration we may put m=0, and thus

   write
                    q=p'<U+017F> AB+p (A+B)};
  which shows that, among the various solutions which satisfy
  the condition A*Q= B*P, that will give the best self-regulation
  for which A and B are largest.
     The condition that A shall be large implies (since A=1|R,)
  that the resistance of the machine must be small, the necessity
  for which could of course be readily foreseen. The condition
  that B should be large leads to less obvious conclusions.
  Thus, in the case of the Long-Shunt Machine,
                       B3–(s) + s^)/ sip, ;
 and to make this as large as possible, we should have se/s1
 large and p, small. The first of these conditions is always,
 the second is never, fulfilled in practice. The reason of this
 is obvious, viz. that the efficiency would be reduced by dimi
 nishing the resistance of the shunt. The maximum efficiency
 is given by the formula
                 m=(v(p,-VR,)/(w/p, + w/R.),
 which diminishes with ps. It is interesting therefore to note
 that a high shunt-resistance is not in itself conducive to good
 self-regulation ; and that, within the bounds of Dr. Frölich's
 condition, there are still opportunities for choice by which
 improvements in the efficiency and regulation may be effected.
 Probably in practice the last adjustments will be best made by
some system of experiment like that described by Dr. Frölich.
The theory given above will, however, enable much to be done
by a few preliminary calculations.
    Since I read the paper, Prof. Silvanus Thompson has called
my attention to the question as to whether my formulae indi
cate the advantage of back winding in the case when a constant
external current is desired.     Dr. Frölich has constructed a
machine on this principle, to which he was led by theory.
To discuss this question fully would require an investigation
of the problem when B is negative; but it may be remarked
that in a case such as that discussed above, when a large value
of B is desirable, it may be increased in the case of the Long
Shunt Machine (BA) by taking s, negative and < 81.

   Poynting's Paper on the Transfer Energy in an Electro
   magnetic Field; and on the two Fundamental Forms of
   Energy. By OLIVER LODGE, D.Sc."
IT is well known that           Prof. Poynting has communicated
       to the Royal Society a most admirable and important
  aper, “On the Transfer of Energy in the Electromagnetic
É.      ” f; a paper which cannot but exert a distinct in
fluence on all future writings treating of electric currents.
   In that paper he introduces the idea of continuity in the
existence of energy—a natural though not a necessary conse
quence of its conservation; so that, whenever energy is trans
ferred from one place to another at a distance, it is not to be
regarded as destroyed at one place and recreated at another,
but it is to be regarded as transferred, just as so much matter
would have to be transferred; and accordingly we may seek
for it in the intervening space, and may study the paths by
which it travels.
    This notion is, I say, an extension of the principle of the
conservation of energy.            The conservation of energy was
satisfied by the total quantity remaining unaltered; there
was no individuality about it : one form might die out,
provided another form simultaneously appeared elsewhere in
equal quantity. On the new plan we may label a bit of
energy and trace its motion and change of form, just as we
may ticket a piece of matter so as to identify it in other
 places under other conditions; and the route of the energy
 may be discussed with the same certainty that its existence
 was continuous as would be felt in discussing the route of
 some lost luggage which has turned up at a distant station in
 however battered and transformed a condition.
    In this new form the doctrine of the conservation of ener
 is really much simpler and more satisfactory than in its j
 form ; and the doctrine may be proved rigidly and instanta
 neously from two very simple premises, viz. Newton's law
 of motion on the one hand, and the denial of action at a
 distance on the other; as I endeavoured in this Magazine some
 time ago to show<U+017F>, and will now repeat.
     I speak of Newton's law of motion because I believe it will
 be admitted that Newton's three laws of motion, in so far as

they are more than definitions, are really three very important
aspects of one law". They may be regarded as (1) a defi
nition of time, (2) a definition of force, (3) a statement of a
law of Nature.
    The law of Nature they embody is capable of various modes
of expression, such as these (in brief):—
            Change of Momentum=Impulse.
           Resultant   force=4%).
           Action + Reaction=0.
            Force is always one component of a stress.
    The last form is perhaps as convenient as any for our
present purpose, and is our first lemma.
    To deny action at a distance is easy; we have only to say,
“If a stress exist between two bodies they must be in con
tact.”    This constitutes a second lemma.
    We then only further require the definition of work and
energy; for instance, these:–A body does work when it exerts
force through a distance; the measure of work being \ Fds.
Energy is that which a body loses when it does work; and it
is to be measured as numerically equal to the work done.
 [The repetition with mere change of sign, about gain of
energy when negative work is done by a body, or positive
 work done upon it, may be understood.
    Now at once follows, simply and rigorously, the law of
 the conservation of energy; and not only conservation, but
 conservation in the new form, viz. the identification of energy;
 thus: If A does work on B it exerts force on it through a
 certain distance; but (Newton's law) B exerts an equal
 opposite force, and (being in contact) through exactly the same
 distance ; hence B does an equal opposite amount of work,
 or gains the energy which A loses. The stress between A
 and B is the means of transferring energy from A to B,
  directly motion takes place in the sense AB. And the
 energy cannot jump from A to B, it is tranferred across their
 point of contact, and by hypothesis their “contact” is abso
 lute: there is no intervening gap, microscopic, molecular, or
 otherwise. The energy may be watched at every instant.
  Its existence is continuous; it possesses identity.
     It is no use objecting that two pieces of “matter’’ are
  never in contact—nobody said they were. If they are not,
  and it seems quite certain that they are not, then evidently one

484                   Prof. Oliver Lodge on the
piece of “matter” cannot act immediately on another piece.
 A and B therefore are not two pieces of “matter ’’ in the
 ordinary sense. A may be a molecule of matter, M may be
 the nearest molecule to it, and energy may be transferred
 from A to M, but not directly ; A cannot act on M, cannot
 do work on it, because of the intervening gap. A can act on
 B, transferring its energy to B, B can act on C, C on D, and
 so on, handing on the energy to L, which is in contact with,
 and can act on, M, doing work on it and giving up to it the
 energy lost by A.              -
    What B, C, D, . . . . L are, I do not presume to say :
 but of course one supposes them to be successive portions of
 the perfectly continuous space-filling medium AEther.
 Relation between Potential and Kinetic Energy, from the contact
    point of view. Reason of the two forms; and Transforma
    tion into one another.
    In the older and more hazy view of conservation of energy
 the idea of “potential energy” has always been felt to be a
 difficulty. It was easy enough to take account of it in the
 formulae, but it was not easy or possible always to form a
clear and consistent mental image of what was physically
meant by it.
     A stone is raised, it gains potential energy; but how does
the stone “up” differ from the stone “down " ?, and how can
an inert and quiet stone be said to possess energy 2 Well, then,
the stone hasn't the energy but the earth has, or rather “the
system of earth and stone possesses energy in virtue of its con
figuration.” True, but foggy. The usual ideas and language
current about potential energy are proper to notions of action
at a distance. When universal contact action is admitted,
the haze disappears"; the energy is seen to be possessed, not
by stone or by earth or by both of them, but by the medium
which surrounds both and presses them together; and the
following statement may be made.
    Energy has two fundamental forms because work has two
factors, force and motion, F, s.
    Work cannot be done, except by a body exerting force
and in motion.       Force without motion is no good. Motion
without force is no good. Either factor separately may be
energy, but it is not work.
   * It is by no means intended that the natures of gravitation, elasticity,
cohesion, &c. become clear. What is meant is, that the seat of the energy
is clearly recognized: the reason of the stress recognizable in the medium
is a much higher and more difficult problem.        -

                        Identity of Energy.                     485
   The two forms of energy correspond to the factors in the
product work".
   “Potential” energy correspond to F.
   “Kinetic” energy correspond to s.
   But is this quite true and satisfactory? A strained bow is
exerting force and possesses energy. A pillar supporting a
roof is exerting force, but possesses no energy. What is the
difference between the two cases?        It is evident that some
thing more is needed than mere force.
   The difference of course is that the bow can recoil, it has a
range or distance through which it will continue to exert a
force: not the original force, but still some force. The pillar
is exerting a great force but it has no recoil in it; if released
it would at once cease to exert any force; consequently its
energy is minute.
   Thus, then, for a body to possess potential energy we must
have two things—the exertion of a force, together with a
guarantee that that force shall be exerted over a certain dis
tance; i.e. a continuance of the force even after motion is
permitted.
   And this is quite analogous to what may be said of the
other form of energy. “A body in motion possesses energy;”
but is it so necessarily Cannot a body in motion be conceived
as possessing no energy P Suppose it stops the instant you
give it work to do—the instant you make it exert force. It
is evident you must have not merely motion, you must have
a guarantee of persistence of motion, the body must possess
inertia; the motion must continue over a certain range even
against resistance. Hence we may exhibit the relation be
tween the two forms thus:—
    Kinetic energy corresponds to motion combined with inertia,
      so that the motion shall continue even against some force;
      and
    Potential energy corresponds to force combined with
      elasticity (or something like it), so that the force shall
      continue even though motion be permitted.
    Both forms of energy are potential work, but, qua energy,
one is as real and actual as the other.        Each has a factor
missing, which if supplied, work will at once be done.
Kinetic energy requires the Force factor to do work. Potential
 energy requires the Motion factor to do work.
    An important thing is now evident moreover, a thing
 which I have never seen accepted, though it has been pre

viously pointed out”. The statement is in two parts:–
(1) Energy cannot be transferred without being transformed;
and (2) it always transforms itself from Kinetic to Potential,
O7" ºyº Ce ve?"S(1.
    When A does work on B energy is transferred from A
to B; and I say that if the energy which A lost was kinetic,
then what B gains is potential ; if, on the other hand, A loses
potential, then B gains kinetic.
    I may make a converse statement, viz. that energy cannot
be transformed without being transferred; cannot take on a
different form without being at the same time shifted to a
different body. So that the common mode of treating a
 falling weight, saying that its energy gradually transforms
itself from potential to kinetic but remains in the stone all the
 time, is, strictly speaking, nonsense. The fact is the stone
 never had any potential energy, no rigid body can have any;
 the gravitation medium had it however, and kept on transfer
 *          to the stone all the time it was descending.
         e above statement, that transformation of energy neces
 sarily goes on from potential to kinetic or vice versä at eve
 act of transfer, almost proves itself. It follows from the .
 lowing facts:—When a body possessing potential energy does
 work, its “range ’’ necessarily diminishes, while the motion
 of the body on which the work is done increases. On the
 other hand, when a moving body does work its motion dimi
 nishes, and the body which resists the motion, since it yields
 over a certain distance, gains potential energy. For the first
 case think of a catapult, bow and arrow, or air-gun. For the
 second case think ºa bullet fired against a spring and caught
 by it.
   *These examples are favourable and easy, but any others will
 serve equally well to illustrate the matter if regarded from
 the right point of view. Thus, a bullet fired upwards gra
 dually transfers its undissipated energy to the gravitation
 medium, transforming it at the same time into potential. As
 soon as the highest point is reached, the gravitation medium
  proceeds to re-transfer and transform it. A pendulum exhibits
  the alternation of energy from the kinetic to the potential form
  and the accompanying transfer from matter to medium, at
  every half-swing. Any vibrating body does the same; but
  in considering a strained spring we must remember that the
  energy resides not in the spring as a whole but in its elemen
  tary parts. The strain resides not even in the molecules them
  selves, perhaps, but in something between those molecules (for

by hypothesis molecules are incapable of exerting direct force
on one another, not being in contact). The medium is exerting
the force, and will continue to exert it over a certain range,
hence it possesses the potential energy; when released it will
do work and transfer its energy to the steel, in the kinetic
form. If the spring overshoots its mean position, the energy
is re-transferred and transformed. A perfectly elastic bounding
ball has all its energy transformed into potential, at the middle
of every period of contact with the obstacle from which it
rebounds.
    One case possesses perhaps a little more difficulty, viz. the
case of a bullet fired into dough—when the body exhibits no
recoil : how can the energy of the bullet be said to be trans
formed into potential now * Only by remembering that heat
motion is a vibration of some kind, and that when a vibration
is excited by a blow or by friction, strain is the effect first
produced, and afterwards the recoil. Think, for instance, of
exciting a tuning-fork or a string by bowing or striking it.
    Alternations from kinetic to potential may be rapid in some
cases, slow in others : no matter; all I have stated is that
change of form is necessary and universal whenever energy
is transferred, i.e. whenever any kind of activity is exhibited
by any known kind of material existence.

Th; main conclusions to which I have been led with regard
        to the potentials of metals and the seat of E.M.F. may
be very briefly stated thus:–
    (1) A metal is not in general at the same potential as the
air in contact with it; the difference of potential (or contact
force) between any given clean metal and air being calculable,
at least approximately, from thermo-chemical data, though
there is no known way of experimentally observing it.
    (2) Putting two metals into contact equalizes their poten
    * Communicated by the Author. For the sake of completeness it may
be convenient here to mention that a report of a discussion on Seat of
E.M.F., at Montreal (Brit. Assoc., Sect. A), is published in the ‘Electrical
Review 'for Nov. 22, 1884, and that a more elaborate discussion on the
 same subject, by the Society of Telegraph Engineers and Electricians, will

  ate.

488             Prof. Oliver Lodge on the Paths of
tial, their surfaces becoming charged with the electrostatic
charges proper for effecting this equalization of potential.
    (3) The air surrounding a pair of different metals in contact
is therefore in a calculable condition of dielectric strain, espe
cially near the junction of the two metals; in other words,
there is in the air a slope of potential which is most rapid in
the neighbourhood of the junction, and is there easily observed
electroscopically.
   (4) This slope of potential observed by Volta, measured by
Kohlrausch &c. &c., near the junction of any two metals, has
caused observers to imagine that the metals themselves differed
in potential, and accordingly to postulate an E.M.F. or contact
force resident at the junction in order to maintain such dif
ference of potential in a conductor.
   (5) No such force exists at a metallic junction; because, if
it did, the passage of a current across such a junction would
produce violent reversible thermal effects, and none such
are observed.
   (6) This non-existent force has been imagined, and has been
utilized to account for the greater part of the E.M.F. in a
voltaic circuit ; in fact, it has itself been considered to be the
main E.M.F. in such a circuit; although it was manifestly
unable to account for the energy of the current.
   (7) The real seat of the E.M.F. in a voltaic or any other
circuit must be where conversion of energy, from some other
form (chemical, thermal, &c., &c.) into the form known as an
electric current, occurs.
   The object of the present Appendix or Supplement to my
paper is to supply an accidental omission in the history of the
subject, and more particularly to exhibit and illustrate the
mode of regarding conducting circuits which I advocate, by
diagrams of energy-paths, or erg-odes for those who like
Greek barbarities.
   The accidental omission from the history of the subject is a
notice of Dr. Gore's communication to the Royal Society of
November 1883", in which he makes an attempt to bring
liquids into a thermoelectric series.
   The contact-force between a metal and a liquid is shown to
vary with temperature; and the results indicate that this
contact-force is a complex one, not simply depending on the
chemical relations of the substances in circuit, i.e. on the cor

rodibility of the metals, but involving some other more purely
physical force also :-much as Bouty surmised from his expe
riments on the generation of heat at a metal-liquid junction
when a current was driven across it.
    A number of tables of the order of metals in different solu
tions of different strengths and at different temperatures are
given, together with some numerical values.
    It is possible that by an attentive study of Dr. Gore's work,
and of other work in the same direction, a more com
plete account could be given of the exact relation existing
between what may be called the thermal and the chemical
contact-forces at metal-liquid junctions; if indeed any valid
distinction can actually be drawn between them.
    At present, at any rate, I do not attempt this; but proceed
to the other matter spoken of, viz. the illustration of my views
 on the voltaic circuit by a diagram of its energy-paths.
    Prof. Poynting has taught us, in a paper of the very greatest
 interest and power", that modern views of vis a tergo, as
 opposed to action at a distance, lead necessarily to the idea of
 continuity in the existence of electric, as well as of all other,
 energy, and hence to a study of the paths along which it moves
 from one part of the field to another. He has shown that these
 paths are the intersections of the magnetic and the electro
 static equipotential surfaces, and that the rate of flow of energy
 is proportional to the product of the electrostatic and electro
 magnetic intensities at every point.                                     -
     This view of the electromagnetic field, though no doubt
 implicitly involved in Maxwell's equations, yet urgently
 needed to be dragged forth and exhibited ; and it is difficult
 to imagine how the developing process could have been done
 better than it is done in Prof. Poynting's memoir.
     The special cases by which his memoir is illustrated are not,
  however, in exact accordance with the views of the electric
  circuit which I am advocating; and in particular the diagram
  of the curves for a voltaic current is, in my view, wrong. I
  cannot say I thought it wrong at the first glance ; I was
  pleased to see that Mr. Poynting held what I consider the
  correct view, that the main seat of the E.M.F. in a simple pile
  is at the zinc-acid junction and not at the zinc-copper, and
  that his diagram embodied this view.
     But when I came to draw the curves myself for this case,
  taking account of the step of potential which I believe to exist
  between a metal and the air, } found the energy-paths refuse
  to start spreading out from the zinc-acid junction, as we had
    * Poynting, Phil. Trans. 1884, pt. ii., “On the Transfer of Energy in
  the Electromagnetic Field.”

490            Prof. Oliver Lodge on the Paths of
both at first sight expected them to : they insisted on di
verging from the zinc-copper junction,as a Voltaist would wish
them to. This behaviour is really in perfect accord with my
theory; though the fact is the cause of Voltaists’ views con
cerning seat of E.M.F. They locate the force at the zinc
copper junction just because the energy-paths diverge thence
and appear to start thence.
    Prof. Poynting's diagram, therefore, not only differs from
my theory, a thing which is natural and unimportant, but it
is discrepant with experimental fact.
    Rigid experimental truth would have led him to spread out
his energy-paths from the metallic junction, not from the acid
iunction as º has done. True such a proceeding would have
 anded him in difficulties and apparent absurdity, and he
would have been compelled to ask, “How can all the ener
start from an inert metallic junction?” And he might we
have considered such a conclusion absurd, as it is.
    The reconciliation between sense and fact is simple. The
lines do, indeed, diverge and spread out from this junction,
but they do not start thence. They all start from the zinc
acid junction; but they at first creep along close to the surface
of the zinc, investing it like the coats of an onion; and some
continue to creep along the copper too, but some do not.
More lines invest the zinc than the copper ; and the lines in
i. are given off at the junction, and thence diverge through
 (Ile alr.
    An electroscopic experimenter seeking the seat of E.M.F.
traces these lines, home as he thinks, to the zinc-copper junc
 tion, and hence regards this as their origin and the seat of the
 force. It is not. The lines do not start thence ; they start
 at the real seat of E.M.F. and source of all the energy, though
 their close-lying continuations between metallic junction and
 acid junction are impossible to trace out experimentally,
     With this preliminary, the diagram of energy-paths for a
 voltaic circuit in Plate IV. almost explains itself.
     The lines are loci of constant electrostatic potential; and I
 happen to have chosen a circuit whose external resistance is
 twice its internal. The junction of the two metals is placed
 at random wherever its peculiarities may be most conveniently
 observed. The liquid in which the metals are immersed is
 only faintly indicated by the outline of its trough, and, for
 simplicity, it is supposed to be one  º; in no electrostatic
 respect from air. Dilute sulphuric acid of a certain strength
 has been shown by Prof. 8. to satisfy this condition
 almost exactly.
     The particular metals for which the diagram is intended to

                  Electric Energy in Voltaic Circuits.                 491
be drawn are zinc and copper. Now thermo-chemical data
lead me to conclude that the step of potential between clean
zinc and air is 1.8 volt [the exact decimal not being insisted
on except for purposes of illustration]; hence, if an equipo
tential line be drawn for every tenth part of a volt, 18 of these
lines would closely invest clean zinc always, and form a
boundary between it and the air. In the diagram (Pl. IV.)
lines are only drawn for every fifth of a volt, and consequently
9 of them envelop the zinc.
   As for copper, it is probable that the step of potential
between it and air is 8 of a volt; and accordingly four lines
invest the copper at every point in the diagram. They are
not always the same four lines—that is of no consequence;
the essential thing to remember in drawing the diagram is
to keep the number constant at every point for the same
metal. Such a metal as gold or platinum may be nearly free
from lines.
   It is needless to say that the lines have to be drawn with
spaces between them for distinctness, but that in reality the
step of potential is of the most sudden description, and all
investing lines ought to lie close to the mathematical surface
of the metal.
   Now, since nine lines coat the zinc, and only four the
copper, it is manifest that five lines must leave the metallic
surface at the junction, and must spread out into the air.
These five lines correspond to the one volt" Volta effect
observed near a junction of clean zinc and copper, and which
has been called a difference of potential between zinc and
copper.                                -
   Of the five lines thus starting to spread out from the junc
tion, some make for points on the external circuit, and others
go through the internal circuit. Those which go to the ex
ternal circuit can by no means go through it, or into it, for the
º           of the copper differs by 8 volt from that of the air;
  ut they can go round it, and leave it on the other side just
as if they . gone through it. Moreover, a line does go
through, or into, the copper at the very point where the air
line abuts against it, viz. the line of potential 8 volt lower.
So the transfer of energy into the conductor of the external

Kohlrausch, to between 76 and '89, Ayrton and Perry and Clifton, up to
‘92, Pellat; but since tarnish or dirt on the zinc surface will certainly
lower it, and it is difficult to suppose any zinc surface absolutely .#
have not thought it necessary to modify the theoretical value of one
volt, which at any rate serves well enough for illustration, though it may
turn out to be about ten per cent. too high.                             -

492             Prof. Oliver Lodge on the Paths of
circuit is complete, except for just the metallic skin, and
everything goes on in the outer field as if the energy-paths
really started from both sides of the zinc-copper junction,
and some of them cut through the metal of the external
circuit with degradation into heat.
   Note, however, that the heat-energy in a wire is not really
thus carried through the air : it creeps along the surface of
the wire, some of it perpetually diving into the wire, and be
coming converted into heat.
   The energy which liberates hydrogen from the copper-acid
surface, moreover, does not reach it in the way Mr. Poynting
has supposed. Some of it crawls over the current the whole
distance ; all of it goes some distance with the current.
    In the electrolyte, however, this is not so ; and the heat
which there makes its appearance is produced at the expense
of energy which has arrived via the air from the zinc-copper
junction. This is on the supposition that no contact-force
exists between the electrolyte surrounding the plates and the
dielectric medium (air) enveloping the rest of the circuit.
In cases where such a contact-force does exist, some energy
will creep along the air-liquid surface, just as it does over the
surface of a metal.
    In the diagram one of the five lines here spoken of is
doubled back upon itself, so as never to leave the surface of
the zinc : the spaces between the lines are the real paths of the
 energy of course, not the lines themselves; the lines only
 indicate the directions across which no energy goes. There
 are five spreading-out energy-paths, then, and it is most
 instructive to watch the energy arising at the zinc-acid surface
 flow in its first narrow channels, then broaden out through
 space, and then cramp itself again into its tube, by which
 it reaches the copper surface, and is transformed into energy
 of chemical separation ; or, again, to watch that in the
 channels touching the copper fritter itself gradually away
 into heat.
         Energy-paths in Secondary Circuits. (Plate W.)
     The four figures in Plate V. are intended to indicate the
 transfer of energy to a secondary circuit, i.e. one in which an
 induced current is being generated.
     Fig. 1 shows a steady electromagnetic field disturbed by the
 presence of a stationary copper channel. The energy simply
 flows round it, as Prof. Poynting has said. Fig.2 shows a field
 no longer steady, but with the potential changing: the energy
 paths moving, say, toward the right. Each line, as it comes up,

folds itself round the circuit, and sends part of one of the pre
viously investing paths to the inside, where it displaces part of
one of the original inside paths, which at once begins to close
up. Fig.2 shows it half closed, on the hypothesis of absolute
suddenness. Fig. 3 the same thing, on the supposition that
energy possesses something like inertia. The induced current.
is produced by energy flowing along the semi-displaced path
through the copper. If the change of field stops, fig. 2 is
supposed quickly to revert to fig. 1, with an opposite trans
ference of energy. Three stages in the change of field are
shown in fig. 4: or this figure may be regarded as showing
three lines in a uniform field disturbed by a moving con
ductor.
   The arrows are drawn as if the energy flowed right away
again without loss, or at least without complete loss. It is
easy to reverse one of the arrows, so as to make energy flow
up from both sides to the secondary circuit; but it is not easy
to see how energy can reach the copper and be dissipated
when its path does not pierce the copper at all. The lines
have to be thought of as first embracing the circuit, then as
 moving away, having left a portion enclosing the circuit be
hind, and finally, more lines having come on, as sinking into
and through the copper, and shutting themselves up ; and so
 on perpetually, as long as the field is changing. ... The energy
 thus reaches the secondary circuit a little behindhand always,
which is not wrong. If all the energy is dissipated in the act
 of passing through the copper, arrows ought not to be drawn
 on the inside paths which are shutting up ; because though
 they are still paths for energy, it does not follow that they are
 made use of; in fact, they cannot be, if all the energy is extinct.
    Probably, however, what all these diagrams better represent
 is the steady state of a field disturbed by the presence of a
 perfect conductor in which there is no dissipation whatever—
 a conductor like the molecules postulated in Ampère's and
 Weber's theory of magnetism º diamagnetism.
                Voltaic Energy-paths. (Plate IV.)
    Returning to the Plate showing voltaic-energy path: the
  diagram seems to me to constitute the most absolute and
  complete reconciliation between the truth in the opposing
  views of the voltaic circuit.
    It not only justifies modern voltaic experimenters in their
  recognition of the slope of air-potential near a junction,
  but it partially justifies even the view of old Volta that this

junction is the source of all the energy. So far as the external
 circuit is concerned, the metallic junction is the source of the
 energy; all the energy does in a manner start thence, though
 it does not start originally thence. It reaches the junction
 from another place, its real source, but it travels thither by
 infinitely unrecognizable paths.
    Does the diagram, then, justify modern Voltaists altogether?
 Certainly not. It cuts the ground from under the feet of those
 who have asserted that there is an E.M.F. at the junction of
 zinc and copper—a contact-force which is the cause of the
 observed difference of air-potential in the neighbourhood.
 And it annihilates those who have seen in this imaginary and
 non-existent force any means of propelling the current in a
voltaic circuit.                  -
    On the other hand, the diagram of course justifies all those
 experimenters who have regarded the zinc-acid junction as the
 main seat of energy-transformation, and therefore of electro
 motive force. At the same time it exhibits the crudity of some
of their statements ; and, just in so far as it upholds the truth
 and consistency of the Voltaists with regard to a part of the
phenomenon, it contradicts some of the opposing statements
made by chemical theorists with regard to the Volta effect. In
 particular, it lends no support to the customary “chemical”
 view, which sets down the whole Volta effect as an accident due
 to unavoidable chemical action, and so practically ignores it.
    Imagine the lines investing the metals to be microscopically
close to them, and then look at the diagram as truly exhibit
 ing the facts of nature : it irresistibly suggests a voltaic or
 contact theory of the voltaic pile. It was right, therefore, for
the first observers of voltaic phenomena to found a contact
theory, and to adhere to it tenaciously, as in some sense true.
It was also right for later philosophers, imbued with notions
of energy, to feel the doctrine that the metallic i.     was the
source of power to be absurd and incomprehensible, and to
found a chemical theory.
    In the conflict both sides have made mistakes; but it is
the essence of truth in both views which has given them such
vitality and endowed their upholders with such energy of
persistence.

        LVI. On the Thermoelectricity of Molten Metals.
                     By F. BRAUN (Carlsruhe)*.
1.  IN a circuit of metallic conductors a current produced by
        difference in temperature must be the equivalent of heat
derived from an external source. . If we assume (1) that the
process is reversible, (2) that heat is absorbed only at the point
of contact of higher temperature, and is given out only at the
colder point .# contact, then it follows that the thermo
electric force must be proportional to the difference in tem
perature of the junctions for intervals of any magnitude. If
we assume a change in potential function at both junctions,
the result may be expressed thus: that the change in poten
tial is proportional to the absolute temperature of the junc
tion. The electromotive force therefore, expressed as a
function of the difference of temperature, ought to be a
straight line. But experiment shows that in all the thermo
piles as yet examined this linear relationship does not hold
good; in by far the majority of cases the curve is much
nearer a parabola. This led Sir W. Thomson to the conclu
sion that even in the interior of one and the same metal
unequally heated there must be produced, upon the passage
of a current, a quantity of heat proportional to the first power
of the current-strength (adopting Le Roux's term, we may
call this “the Thomson-effect ’’).
    In fact, if the thermopile works, not between two tempera
tures, but between an infinite number, it follows inversely
that its electromotive force can no longer be expressed as a
linear function of the greatest temperature-difference which
occurs in it. Although, strictly speaking, nothing can be
determined as to the <U+017F>odality of the electromotive force, yet
we should be disposed to add to the changes in potential
assumed to exist in the junctions (of which, however, no
proof has yet been given that they occur there) other
changes of potential occurring in the interior of the unequall
heated metal.                                                          .
    Hitherto, so far as I know, only thermopiles have been
examined in which at least one metal has been solid.               The
explanation is then obvious, that these internal thermo
electric forces are due to changes produced by the heat itself
in the solid metal—hot and cold metal behaving like two
different substances, or, as we may shortly express it, the
heat produces structural changes. In fact, as shown by the
   * Translated from the Sitzungsber, der königl. Akad. d. Wissensch, of
Berlin, of April 9th, 1885.      -

496                    M. F. Braun on the
experiments of Magnus, pieces of the same metal but of
different temperature produce a thermoelectric current when
brought    j       into contact. Only with lead could this re
sult not be observed with certainty. But in lead, as Le Roux
showed, the Thomson-effect is nearly or quite zero. In
general, those metals which show a large Thomson-effect
show also the further peculiarity that, upon heating a single
wire the ends of which are kept at a constant temperature, a
thermoelectric current is produced, the intensity (and even
direction) of which often varies with insignificant changes in
the distribution of the temperature or the structure of the
WIre.
    These currents, I may at once mention, are so energetic,
and especially so variable, particularly if the temperature is
raised to a red heat, that I have had to take precautions with
my thermopiles that there should not be any great differences
of temperature in the solid metal. With lead only have I
been unable to observe with certainty any such currents,
even when the solid metal was plunged into molten lead.
According to an experiment of Magnus's, often quoted,
which for short I will call the Magnus experiment, currents
are altogether absent in mercury.
    It is an obvious explanation to refer the currents, produced
 on bringing together a cold and hot metal, to differences in
structure (although we must then ascribe some influence
either to time or to distribution of temperature), and to class
them together with the Thomson effect—that is, the deviations
which the thermoelectric force shows from proportionality
 with the temperature-difference. If certain metals give no
thermo-current either in the Magnus experiment or when a
 wire, whose ends are maintained at a constant temperature, is
heated, this may be explained in two ways: either changes
 of potential take place on both sides of the point heated,
which, however, must decrease equally in both directions, or
no thermoelectric excitation takes place, because, in conse
quence of the nature of the metal, differences in structure are
impossible.
     o this latter, although more special, assumption it seems
 to me we shall be most inclined.    It is to be assumed that
other molten metals will behave as mercury does, which, in
 fact, I have found to be the case (cf. § 7).
    2. If we regard the Magnus experiment in this second
 way, it would follow that the thermoelectric force between
 molten metals must be proportional to the difference in
 absolute temperature between their points of contact. But
 this would show the possibility of measuring absolute tem

                 Thermoelectricity of Molten Metals.                   497
peratures to a very high point by a method presenting many
advantages over measurements made with an air-thermo
meter (smaller space of constant temperature, independence
of expansion and changes in form of the vessel). We should
further, and probably for the first time, obtain numbers
which are entirely dependent upon the chemical nature of
the substance, and free from uncertainties as to how hard or
soft the body is.        They would offer us a more ready con
clusion as to the internal processes by which thermoelectric
forces are excited. In fact, it appears very remarkable how,
under similar external conditions (where any desired quanti
ties of heat are available), large quantities of heat are trans
formed into the form of energy of mechanical work, at the
points of contact of many metals, and with others very small
quantities ".
   Since, further, each molten metal in thermoelectric rela
tionship must be characterized by a single constant (which
no doubt may vary with the pressure), this must stand in
some relationship to other constants, characterizing the par
ticular metal, and independent of the temperature; but of
such there is only the atomic weight available.
    3. These considerations induced me to measure the thermo
electric forces of molten metals against each other between as
wide limits of temperature as possible. A linear dependence
upon the temperature appeared to me à priori so probable,
 that I directed my attention from the first to the utmost
 possible chemical purity of materials, and, moreover, chose
 only elements. Alloys were investigated only in the second
  lace.
    In the following I give the combinations which were
 measured, as well as the range of temperature employed ; t
 denotes the temperature of the colder point of contact, T the
 highest reached at the warmer point of contact.
         NaHg . . . . t = 20° or 100°; T=370°.

         KHg . . . . t—20° or 100°; T=520°.
         SnHg . . . . t-20°; T=460°.
   * That we may regard the Peltierian heat as the equivalent of the
 work which the    ...,       does in passing to a lower potential-level at
 the points of contact, requires no justification. The work lost at the
 one contact-point can be restored by the equal amount gained at the
 other, just as the quantities of work in the portions of the two arms of a
 siphon at equal heights compensate each other. We cannot conclude
 anything, as Maxwell has done, as to the difference of potential produced,
 as a result of contact-electricity, from the Peltierian heat at the point of
 contact of two conductors.

   4. For the determination of high temperatures in spaces
frequently small I employed          ...i.  of platinum wire, whose
galvanic resistance had previously been determined as a func
tion of the temperature. I employed for this purpose a large
muffle furnace heated by coal, the description of which, as
 well as of other experiments made with it, I propose to give
shortly elsewhere. The vessels for the air-thermometer were
made of Meissen porcelain f. The dimensions could be so
chosen that, assuming constancy of temperature, temperatures
 of 1000° C. could be accurately measured to 1* or 2°.
    5. The metals were enclosed in glass tubes, wherever glass
could be used. Platinum wires melted into the glass served
for external connections. With some metals the platinum
 wire was in direct contact with the metals; with others this
 contact was made by means of a pencil of retort-carbon S or
 graphite, with others by means of an iron-wire. Two glass
 tubes filled with metal were placed vertically side by side.
 At the hotter (upper) point of junction the platinum wires
 were melted together outside the tubes by means of the oxy
 hydrogen blowpipe.         So far as the wires which serve to make
 contact with the fluid metal at the hottest and coolest points
 penetrate the ends of the tubes, uniformity of temperature
 must be maintained. The cooler (lower) ends of the tubes
 were plunged into two concentric vessels full of mercury, which
 were placed in a bath of constant temperature, though not
 always the temperature of the room. From these mercury
 vessels wires of lead conducted to a petroleum bath of the
 temperature of the room, from which the copper connections
 were made. The leaden wires of course could not be placed
 directly in contact with the mercury. Their ends were
 melted into a glass tube, through the lower closed end of
 which a short platinum wire passed. I pass over here
 the precautions found necessary in order to ensure that the

other portions of the circuit should be affected only by slight
thermoelectric forces, which remained constant for a con
siderable time and which were separately determined. The
electromotive forces were measured by compensation.
   6. The temperature of the hotter point of contact was
maintained:—(1) In a bath of mineral oil. high boiling-point,
which was kept agitated by a stirrer. In this way a tempe
rature of about 380° C. could be obtained. (2) In an air
bath, consisting of three concentric iron cylinders, surrounded
on the  ...i.      a jacket of iron and     .        which was
constructed according to my designs for another investi
gation, and which Ehrhardt" has recently described. It
was heated by means of gas, and permitted the attainment of
a temperature of 580°. (3) By a brisk current of vapour of
constant boiling-point, sent through a glass vessel protected
against external radiation of heat. The substances employed
were alcohol 80°C., water, xylol 140°5 C., aniline 183°C.,
dimethylaniline 192°C., toluidine 198°C., xylidine 214° C.
In order to decide with certainty particular questions I re
quired constant temperatures, not differing much from each
other. For the control of other measurements, I further
employed baths of vapour of benzoic acid 250° C., mercuric
iodide 357°C., and sulphur 448° C. For still higher tem
peratures (up to 980° C.) I employed (4) a muffle. The
vessels  wº.    contained   the metal were of eartlenware.
Imagine an earthenware tube inclined some 10° to the hori
zontal plane, and provided at both ends with vertical pipe
heads. Two such tubes of equal length were placed side by
side. Each contained a molten metal. The upper pipe-heads
were within the muffle, and heated to a higher temperature
than the lower ones. They were connected by a bridge of
thick iron-wire or of retort-carbon, by means of which a wide
thick-walled chamotte-neck passed from the muffle through
the heating-channel outwards, through which the earthenware
tubes passed ; the other two pipe-heads were outside the
muffle, surrounded by an iron box, which was heated by coal.
The temperature then was maintained as close as possible to
the melting-point of the more difficultly fusible metal. In
order to carry the circuit from the molten metal outside the
muffle, previous experience had shown lead to be the only
available metal which permitted the reduction of temperature
to that of the room.      e following arrangement was adopted
 in view of its properties:—At the lower end of a thin
 walled brass-tube of about 12 millim. diameter an iron tube
              * Wied. Ann, vol. xxiv. p. 217 (1885),
                                                                - - -->

500                   M. F. Braun on the
was brazed ; it was closed below by an iron disk screwed on,
to the inside of which a piece of platinum foil was soldered.
The screw closed against the molten metal in which the iron
tube plunged. A platinum wire was in contact with the
platinum foil. This was melted through the closed lower end
of a glass tube. The bottom of this was filled to a height of
about 10 millim. with graphite. Lead wire was pushed slowly
into the glass tube, which melted and formed a continuous
connection from the molten to the solid lead.      The solid lead
wire conducts again to points at the temperature of the room.
All the different conductors (iron, platinum, and graphite) were
completely surrounded by the molten metal in the pipe-head,
which stood some 4 centim. above the top of the graphite
layer. We may therefore assume equality of temperature in
all. This last-described arrangement was employed for the
circuits PbSn and SnBi.
   7. I pass now to the results obtained. If we take the
temperatures as abscissae and the electromotive forces as or
dinates, the following results are obtained. Most, if not all,
the curves are not actually straight lines; they are of such
a form that the centre of curvature lies on the side of the
curve turned away from the axis of abscissae, i. e. the electro
motive forces increase more rapidly than corresponds to
  roportionality with the temperature. Only the curve for
§. which is almost straight for a          considerable distance,
seems at higher temperatures to assume a curvature towards
the other side. The thermoelectric force of this element is,
however, so small that measurements with it offered special
difficulties. KHg is almost a straight line, but possesses
certain peculiarities (see below).
   The curves are certainly not of the second degree, but of the
third at least. Tait's assumption that specific heat of elec
tricity is proportional to the absolute temperature, which
would lead to the equation to a parabola, therefore does not hold
good for molten metals. I give here a few numbers from the
curve for the element PbHg. It is of especial interest, on ac
count of the property of lead, not to give any Thomson-effect.
The first column gives the temperature of the warmer point
of contact in Centigrade degrees, the second the same reckoned
from absolute zero. The temperature of the other point of
contact is throughout 20°C. The third column contains the
electromotive force e in micro-volts. If e is a function of 6,
                                                     %
represented by a curve of the second degree, then ought to
be a linear function of 6.      The fourth column shows the

observed value of     % and the fifth the value calculated from
the first two numbers of the fourth column.             The differences
are far greater than possible errors of observation. The last
column gives the quantities of heat in gramme-calories which
result at the point of contact of absolute temperature 6, when
the quantity of electricity electro-chemically equivalent to
2 grammes hydrogen (193,000 coulombs) passes through.
     f we conclude from the experiments of Le Roux (who,
however, gives no absolute value of the Thomson-effect) that
there is no Thomson-effect in lead, there must be such in
mercury. Moreover its magnitude must be considerable.
This follows from the observations with the couples HgCu,
 Hg Pt, HgFe, whose electromotive force I have measured
 for considerable differences of temperature. The Thomson
effect is very considerable in the metals Cu, Pt, Fe; in mer
 cury it must be at least of equal magnitude according to the
 results of these measurements.
    The wires employed of the three metals when heated in
 the middle, whilst the ends were maintained at constant
 temperature, gave very considerable electromotive forces
 (70 to 200 microvolts) even after they had been repeatedly
 heated. Mercury on the other hand, as is well known, gives
 none. This last phenomenon, and the Thomson-effect, cannot
 therefore stand in any direct connection.
    In the thermo-element PbHg, the contact-points may have
 the respective absolute temperatures 6 and 6 (9×9); it may
 be supposed to remain closed so long that its thermo-current
 has conveyed the electro-chemical unit of electricity through
 it. Then at the temperature 8 the quantity of heat IIo is #.
 sorbed, and at 6 the quantity of heat II6 is given off to sur
 rounding objects.       The difference IIe-IIb in the present

502                      M. F. Brann on the
example cannot be completely converted into electrical energy
(with an oppositely bent curve it would not be the only equi
valent), but there would be also heat from the interior of the
metals themselves converted into work.
   The following Table II. gives for different intervals of tem
perature the heat IIo–II6 in gramme-calories. Further, the
electrical work L in the same units.         The result is that in
the most favourable case 47 per cent. of the heat IIo–IIa
appears as useful electrical work. The remainder, at least 53
per cent., remains in the metals themselves, in the form of
(reversible) heat. It is given in the fourth column.
   The thermopile absorbs the quantity of heat IIe at the
highest temperature 6); at least, the pile works with this
heat-capital. How much of this heat appears as useful work?
The sixth column shows that it is at the outside 40 per cent.
If of the quantity of heat IIe the whole remainder not con
verted into work at the temperature 6 were given off, the
fraction   e;     must be converted into current-energy. The
next column shows this fraction.

    If we now enquire whether thermo-elements are suitable
arrangements for converting heat into work, we obtain the
following result:-Elements for which the electromotive
force increases greatly with rise of temperature, as is the
case for the element Hg Pb, work with very small useful
effect (not regarding the loss of heat by conduction, radiation,
&c.). Thermo-elements whose electromotive force decreases
with rise of temperature work with more useful effect, but
contribute absolutely less towards the work to be done.
    Other elements with liquid metals give essentially the same
results as the PbHg element. The curve for HgCHg + Br--Pb)
has nearly the same form. In this combination both con
stituents are fluid at ordinary temperatures; I have examined
them for an interval of more than 500°. It appeared to me

               Thermoelectricity of Molten Metals.           503
of particular interest to repeat Magnus's experiment with
this fluid alloy. If a portion of the amalgam was plunged
cold into the rest heated to about 300°, no thermo-current was
produced the electromotive force of which exceeded 0.5 micro
volts, which was the lowest I was in a position to measure.
    The curve for this element shows a remarkable peculiarity.
At 180° it is convex towards the axis of abscissae, but between
180° and 210° it becomes concave, and then again convex.
In this respect it is qualitatively exactly like the curve which
platinum-iron elements give, only that in the latter the pecu
liarity is more decided. With a PtFe element the curve
rises steeply to about 360° and somewhat concave towards
the axis of abscissae, then bends rapidly towards the horizontal
direction, having a maximum at 420°, then falls from this very
iittle (almost horizontal) to a minimum at 520°, rises then
slowly, and then from about 630° ascends again to 1000° as
steeply as from 0° to 36°.
    The element consisting of mohen potassium and mercury
 shows an exactly similar behaviour, the curve rising with
oscillations. Consistent results are, however, only obtained
with this latter element when vapours of constant boiling
point are employed as source of heat. Using the oil-bath or
the air-bath, the values obtained at the same temperature
 often vary considerably.
    We shall probably only be able to explain these phenomena
 by the assumption that molecular transformations take place
 also in liquid bodies (as is known to be the case, for example,
 with sulphur); and these changes appear, at least as far as their
 velocity is concerned, to depend on the rate of heating. The
 question then suggests itself whether molten cadmium, which
 in the form of vapour is monatomic, combined with a thermo
 element with the similarly constituted mercury, would show
 linear dependence of electromotive force upon temperature.
     The interval of temperature available seemed to be too
 small to determine this point with certainty; and I considered
 it beside the mark to employ cadmium amalgam, since we
 could no longer assume the existence of isolated atoms.
     8. Taking all the results together, we may come to the
 conclusion that in thermoelectricity we are still further
 from an insight into the true nature of things than most phy
 sicists have supposed. We must assume the existence of
  electromotive forces even in the interior of molten metals of
 unequal temperature; and, moreover, these follow no simple
 laws.    It would not be difficult to find formulae for the elec
 tromotive forces supposed to exist in the interior of metals
  which should satisfy the observations; but it seems to me

504          Mr. J. W. L. Glaisher on the Complete
that we do not thereby come nearer to a representation of
the processes which occur. We may say with certainty that
fluid unequally-heated metals are electrically charged, and that
by simple inequalities of temperature in a conductor the con
ditions for transformation of heat into work are fulfilled, only
that we cannot obtain the work in the convenient form of a
closed current. Perhaps this excitation of electricity takes
place in all fluids, and generally in all substances, i. e. also in
the so-called vacuum ; and the further question, important
in principle, may arise, what influence this hitherto disre
garded circumstance has upon physical processes.
   If we return to the facts detailed above, everything indicates
that thermoelectric excitement is an intermolecular process
dependent upon the number or arrangement of atoms in the
molecule. It is thus suggested that all the rough mechanical
changes, which exert so much influence on the thermoelectric
behaviour of a solid body, and which consist in drawing,
bending, hardening, annealing, &c., are also connected with
intermolecular, and thus in a measure chemical, changes.
This would be in harmony with the one already known fact,
that in steel, upon passage from the soft into the hard con
dition and vice versá (also by simple drawing), the quantity of
chemically combined carbon changes. Hard and soft steel
give, as is well known, a tolerably powerful thermoelectric
action.
LVII. On the Erpression for the Complete Elliptic Integral
   of the Second Kind as a Series proceeding by Sines of Mul
   tiples of the Modular Angle. By J. W. L. GLAishER,
   M.A., F.R.S.*
                 Series for K and E, §§ 1–4.
§ 1.  IN    vol. xix. pp. 51, 52 of Crelle's Journal, Guder
           mann has given the following interesting expres
sion for K in a series proceeding by multiples of the modular
angle 6:—
K      .      12 .        12. 32 .      12. 32.52 .

              Elliptic Integral of the Second Kind.                      505
   Of course for the actual calculation of the numerical value
of K corresponding to a given value of 6, the second formula
is much to be preferred ; for the trigonometrical factors dimi
nish rapidly, whereas in the first series they have no tendency
to diminish, and the gradual convergence of the series is due
solely to the numerical coefficients. Thus in (1) the nth
term is of the order   }:      but the corresponding term in (2) is
of the order   |sinº-º.         When 6=0, the series in (1) is of
the form 0 x 30, the true value being #; when 6=}T, the
series is infinite in value, as it should be.
    § 2. Gudermann's process is in effect as follows.             He shows
that the transformation which converts k into e-* converts
K into #e”(K.—iK'), where 6' denotes }T–0.                    Starting with
(2), he thus finds
           K—iK/             a , 1*     ..., , 14.3%
              T
                    = e-" +        ge—"     + 27.42% -9"+&c.,
from which (1) is immediately deducible by equating the real
parts.
    At the  end of the investigation Gudermann, after referring
to the slow convergence of (1), which renders it of no prac
 tical value, adds:—“Aus diesem Grunde iibergehen wir auch
 die Herleitung einer innlichen Reihe für den º E.”
    The main object of this note is to give the series for E
 which corresponds to (1). It does not admit of quite such
 simple derivation as the series for K.
     § 3. Gudermann's transformation corresponds to the change
 of q into ig"; and this change may be supposed to be produced
 by the change of q into q}, followed by the change of q into –7.
    By the   i.      of q into igº, k' is changed into e-", and K’
 is changed into   jºk         —iR). Starting with the series
          2K/        12           12. 32        12. 32.5%
          *::==1 + , k”+#, k"+ ...,k"+&c.,
 we thus find
    K/—iK    – 2-i6   12      –5:0    12. 32 –9ið     12. 32.52 -13ið L <U+017F>.
        T    E6     + ge           + 2.   The + 2.4.62°              +&c.
     § 4. In order to apply the same process to the series for
 E", viz.
         2E/        1 , ...,     1*. 3         12. 32.5
             =1-3, kº-ji. "-###"—&c.,
 it is necessary to determine the quantity into which E! is
  converted by the change of q into igº.

506         Mr. J. W. L. Glaisher on the Complete
   It can be shown that, by the change of q into q",
                   E’ becomes      E^+ kK'.
                                      1 +k '
 nd that, by the change of q into – q,
                   k becomes      º
                   K'      a     k'(K’—iK),
                   E/            E/–k"K/+i(E—k”K)

   Thus, by the change of q into igº, E' becomes
          e-"(E’—k”K’--kk/K+ i(E—k"K+kk'K')}.
   It follows, therefore, that

   § 5. The results obtained in the previous sections form
part of a general system of formulae which may be stated as
follows:—
   Consider two quantities I and G defined by the equations
                             I=E–K,

and let U, V, W denote
                  #(I+G), #(G+E), #(E+I)
respectively.
   The values of the six quantities, expressed in terms of E

    § 8. It appears from $ 5 that the quantities I<U+017F> and V’
resemble K'in being transformable, by the change of modulus
from k' to e-*, into expressions of the form e”(P/HiP),
where P’ is the same function of k” that P is of k”. Perhaps
the simplest method of obtaining the sine-series for E is by
deducing the sine-series for W from the k-series for I' and
then adding the sine-series for K ; and it was in this manner
that I was first led to the series for E*.           It will be noticed
that the process followed in § 4 also gives in the first instance
 the sine-series for E—#R or W, and that the series for E is
 deduced from it by the addition of that for #K.
    By the change of k' into e-”,
                       k'K' becomes #e-*(K’—iK),
and therefore
                  I'—k'K' becomes e-"(I'+ i E).
If then we start with the k-series for I'—k'K' and transform
k' into e-”, we obtain directly the sine-series for E by equa
ting the imaginary parts in the resulting formula. The
transformation therefore (of k' into e-*) which converts
                       K' into #e"(K’—iR)
converts also
              K’—E'+k'K' into e-"(K’—E'—iB);
and we may therefore derive the sine-series for E from the
k'-series for K'-E'+k'K' by a process exactly analogous to
that by which the sine-series for K is derivable from the
k'-series for K'.
   The six quantities E, I, G, U, V, W are considered in detail
in the Quarterly Journal of Mathematics, vol. xx. pp. 313–
361, and in the Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical
Society, vol. v. pp. 184—208. The formulae in these papers
show that E forms one of a triad of corresponding funda
mental quantities of which the other two members are I and G.

An Elementary Treatise on Dynamics, containing Applications to
   Thermodynamics. By B. WILLIAMSON, M.A., &c., and F. A.
   TARLETON, LL.D. London: Longmans, Green, and Co. 459 pp.
THIS       is unquestionably an important work on Dynamics, com
       prising within the compass of 459 pages the Dynamics of a
Particle (218 pp.), the Kinematics and Kinetics of a Rigid Body
(207 pp.), including two chapters on Energy (40 pp.) and one on
Small Oscillations (43 pp.), and a final chapter on Thermodynamics
(29 pp.). Except for a few applications to elastic material and
some to the thermodynamics of gases (as illustrations of the
Theory of Energy), the work is confined to the Motion of Rigid
Bodies, and is on the whole a most carefully thought-out treatise
on so large a subject.
   It professes to “start from the most elementary conceptions, so
that any student who is acquainted with the Calculus can commence
the Treatise without requiring the previous study of any other
work on the subject” (see preface). It is perhaps a natural result
of this that the early parts are easy and in considerable detail,
whilst the later parts are difficult from their conciseness. It may,
indeed, be doubted whether any student could really read this
Treatise through (and work out the examples) without external
help in the later parts. The examples have been chosen with
great care so as to form excellent illustrations of the text; of a
great many, however, it must be said that they are rather instruc
tive problems which have been solved by accomplished mathema
ticians than exercises for students; more or less full details of the
working of these are given :-e.g. Ex. 15 to 27, on Kinetics of a
Rigid Body, are “the substance of Prof. MacCullagh's Lectures on
Rotation.”
   It is singular that though the work bears the names of two
mathematicians on the titlepage, and seems to have received at
least partial revision from a third (see preface), a decided looseness

 of expression occurs here and there.         Thus the opening lines
 run :
    “We give the name of matter to that which we regard as the
 permanent cause of any of our sensations.”
    This definition would surely include heat, light, railway accidents,
 &c. Again the term velocity nowadays has surely the unique
 definite meaning of “space described (or capable of description) in
 a time-unit;” but the term is used in several places as if it had
 a simply spatial meaning, e. g. (p. 28) “a velocity of 400 feet,”
 (p. 29) “the velocity per minute,” and similar instances in many
 other places.                    ALLAN CUNNINGHAM, Major, R.E.
     Energy and Motion. A Textbook of Elementary Mechanics.
          By W. PAICE, M.A. Cassell and Co. (Pp. 114.)
 THIS is one more of the legion of small textbooks of elementary
 science the raison d'être of which it is hard to discover. The pre
 face states that there “appear to be no good books on the subject
 which approach it from a sufficiently elementary standpoint ;” but
 we fear that this book put into the hands of ordinary schoolboys or
 schoolgirls, unless supplemented by good oral teaching, will make
 too large demands upon their intelligence. There are a few good
 points of more or less novelty to be noted, but these are more than
 counterbalanced by erroneous teaching upon certain important
 matters. A few instances will suffice. The specification of an
 acceleration as “24 feet per second per second,” or as “24,000
yards per minute per minute,” is no doubt to be commended; but
 such unusual accuracy contrasts, unfortunately, with such state
ments as that “1 horse-power is equal to 550 foot-pounds” (p. 61);
or that “to produce a velocity v in munits of mass, or to stop the
mass m if moving with a velocity v, would require my units of
force” (p. 44).
   The author seems to be of opinion that the formula s = 3 ft.”
does not admit of rigorous    º      but always involves some assump
tion. Certainly he makes an assumption (p. 13); but using the
word “therefore,” he gives his readers no hint of this when he says,
“When a moving body is uniformly accelerated the increase of
velocity is the same throughout for every equal small portion of
time, therefore the distance passed over will be the same as if the
body moved uniformly with the average velocity for the whole
number of small spaces of time—that is, for the whole time.”
   The statement on p. 39, “If a bullet of lead and another of
wood of the same size be thrown at the same time with the same
velocity, the bullet of lead will go further than the bullet of wood"
needs no comment; it is sufficient to quote it. The meaning of
“mass” is not explained by saying that there is more of “some
thing” in a leaden bullet than in a wooden bullet of equal size;
and the statement that there is more “matter” or “stuff” in a
cubic inch of gold than in a cubic inch of water has simply no
meaning at all. Until it is proved that gold is a compound of
hydrogen and oxygen, in the proportions in which they occur in

water (which is possible, but extremely improbable), we shall not
know which of these two contains most matter; and in the present
state of chemical science it is simply idle to pretend to compare the
quantities of matter in two things of different chemical nature.
   We fail to see why a gramme should be called a “mass-gramme,”
and it is certainly not “the quantity of matter contained in a cubic
centimetre of distilled water at the temperature and pressure at
which water has its greatest density.”
   Until these and similar errors are corrected no competent teacher
will consent to employ this production as a textbook.

   2. “The Glacial Period in Australia.” By R. von Lendenfeld,
Ph.D. Communicated by W. T. Blanford, LL.D., F.R.S., Sec. G.S.
   Although several previous writers have suggested that boulders
and gravels found in different parts of Australia are of glacial origin,
the evidence is vague, and no clear proof of glaciation has been
brought forward. During a recent ascent of the highest ranges in
Australia, parts of the Australian Alps, the author succeeded in
discovering a peak which he named Mount Clarke, 7256 feet high,
and in finding traces of glaciation in the form of roches moutonnées
throughout an area of about 100 square miles. The best-preserved
of the ice-worn surfaces were found in a valley named by the author
the Wilkinson Valley, running from N.E. to S.W., immediately south
of Müller's Peak and the Abbot Range.          No traces of ice-action
were found at less than 5800 feet above the sea.
   The rocks showing ice-action are all granitic, and the fact that
the surfaces have been polished by glaciers is said to be proved by
the great size of such surfaces, by their occurrence on spurs and
projecting points, by many of them being worn down to the same
general level, and by their not coinciding in direction with the joints
that traverse the rock.
   In conclusion the author briefly compared the evidence of glacial
action in Australia with that in New Zealand.

            In elli gence and Miscellaneous Articles.              513
in the same volcano at different times, and between the eruptions of
different volcanoes, is a subject deserving the most attentive con
 sideration. The violence of a volcanic outburst does not bear any
relation to the quantity of material ejected. The union of water
 with lavas may be compared with the solution of a gas in water; but
there is reason to believe that in their deep-seated sources lavas con
tain little or no water. If igneous matter be extruded through dry
strata the eruption might take place without explosive manifesta
tions. But if igneous matter be extruded through water-bearing
beds, a kind of dialysis would take place between the igneous and
aqueous masses. In this way the tension of the steam in the fluid
rock may at last become so great that a fissure will be formed at the
surface and volcanic action will follow.                       -
   In this way the violence of a volcanic eruption will be determined
by the quantity of water contained in the strata through which the
lava passes in its passage to the surface, and by the temperature at
which it reaches the surface.
   This theory explains the acknowledged sequence of volcanic out
bursts of different degrees of violence, and the intervals which occur
between them. It also explains the differences between the central
and lateral eruptions of a great volcano, and the phenomena attend
ing its extinction.
   The structures of the igneous rocks, whether of basic or acid
composition, are greatly modified by the presence in them of volatile
ingredients.
   The succession of events indicated by the structure of Monte
Somma and Wesuvius, Roccamonfina, Monte Vulture and Monte
Nuovo, show that after a long cessation of volcanic activity we have
an extensive production of fragmentary and scoriaceous material,
and that this is gradually succeeded by the eruption of lava-streams.
   The water and other volatile substances, such as sulphates and
chlorides, which are given off abundantly in volcanic eruptions,
may act as solvents for the various minerals which constitute lavas.

APPLICATION OF PHOTOGRAPHY TO ELECTRICAL MEASUREMENTS.
       BY JOHN TROWBRIDGE AND HAMMOND WINTON HAYES,
IN     the study of electromotive force and of voltaic cells it is
     often desirable to have long-continued observations. The com
plete history of the action, for instance, of the Daniell cell with
different strengths of solution extending over hours or days, if it
could be presented to the eye as a curve, would be valuable to those
who desire to know the behaviour of such a cell while it is doing
work under definite conditions. Such curve could be obtained by
patient observation, but it would be unprofitable labour for one to
spend his time in watching the excursions of a galvanometer
needle, if the needle can be made to record its movements by any
device.

 514           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
    The method we have used enables one to study the action of a cell
 at one's own leisure, the apparatus running at night or during the
 day when one is occupied with other work. A beam of light from
 a gas-flame passes through a vertical slit placed in front of the
 flame, and is reflected from the concave mirror of a tangent-galva
 nometer, of few turns of wire, through a horizontal slit, in a dark
 box, in which a sheet of sensitive paper is placed. By means of
 this arrangement of a vertical and a horizontal slit, a small point of
 light is obtained. A stationary concave mirror is placed near the
 needle of the tangent-galvanometer, so that the same beam of light
 may be reflected by both this mirror and the one attached to the
galvanometer-needle. The spot of light given by the stationary
 mirror serves to mark the zero point of the needle when no current
is passing through the galvanometer. The photographic paper is
placed in a slide which is lowered uniformly by the unwinding of
a string from a little cylinder placed either upon the hour-hand or
the minute-hand of a cheap eight-day clock. When the electrical
current from the voltaic combination, which is being used, passes
through the galvanometer, its changes in strength for different
times are indicated by the relations of the two lines drawn upon
the sensitive paper. The line drawn by the light from the sta
tionary mirror is a straight one, and serves for the abscissa of
times; while the perpendicular distances from the curve drawn by
the mirror attached to the needle of the galvanometer to this axis of
times give the ordinates of the curve drawn by the latter. Rapid
printing-paper was used, and an ordinary gas-flame gave a sufficiently
strong spot of light to produce an actinic effect.
   Fig. 1 represents the action of a modification of Trouvé's battery.
During this experiment, which lasted for thirty minutes, there
were five ohms in the external circuit. The right-hand portion of

the diagram shows the strength of current when the circuit was
made, and it will be observed that the battery was not at its best

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.            515
until ten or twelve minutes after making the circuit; from this
maximum point the strength of the current gradually diminishes.
Fig.2 shows the action of the same battery with ten ohms external
resistance.    Under these conditions we find at the instant of
making circuit a strong current, which rapidly diminishes within
the first five minutes to one sixth of its first strength.
   Knowing the distance of the galvanometer from the sensitive
paper, the strength of the current may be calculated by measuring
the distance between the two lines at any instant, and proceeding
as with an ordinary galvanometer and scale.
   From a comparison of the two figures the electromotive force
may be determined by Ohm's law, if the distance between the lines
is measured at the instant the current is made. Then knowing
the electromotive force, current, and external resistance, we can
readily find the internal resistance. This resistance will be the
liquid resistance of the cell only for the moment that the circuit is
made, for afterwards the variation in electromotive force due to
polarization, and the change in resistance of the liquid due to
electrolytic action will combine to cause changes. Since, however,
the changes in electromotive force due to polarization are much
more rapid in their action than the changes in battery resistance, a
very small error will be introduced if we compare points near each
other on those parts of the curve in which the variation in current
is greatest: during the small fraction of a minute that is taken,
the change in battery-resistance will be infinitesimal and may be
neglected.
   We have selected these photographs as an example of the large
variations that some batteries present, and the consequent useful
ness of some such way of studying their action. From measure
ments upon these photographic charts the variations in electro
motive force and internal resistance can be studied by obtaining
such charts under different conditions of external resistance.      It
is evident that the same photographic method can be employed
to study the swing of the needle of a short coil-galvanometer,
 which indicates the gradual heating of a thermopile. In this
way the conduction of heat along a bar could be studied.—

ON AN INSTRUMENT RESEMBLING THE SEXTANT, BY WHICH ANGLEs
    WITH THE HORIZON CAN BE MEASURED.              BY E. H. AMAGAT.
   Imagine a sextant of which the optical axis of the telescope,
instead of being oblique in reference to the fixed mirror, which I
shall call B, is perpendicular to it. Arrange the movable mirror A
so that its axis of rotation coincides with one of its edges, and cuts
the optical axis. Suppose that the mirror B, instead of being fixed,
is movable about an axis parallel to the plane of the graduated
circle, and perpendicular to the optical axis; in these conditions,

516            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
the image twice reflected from any given point will be displaced in
a plane perpendicular to that of the circle, when B turns about its
axis. If the circle is placed horizontally, all the objects on the
same vertical plane will be seen to pass in succession.
    Now let us suppress the telescope, and replace it by a simple
 vertical slit placed between the eye and the axis of rotation of A;
 suppose, moreover, the mirror is silvered all over. By placing the
 eye at a convenient height in front of the slit, we can look directly
at an object above or below the mirror (according to its height),
and we can make it coincide with the image twice reflected of
another object which may be at any height, since the movement of
B may bring it vertically to the desired height. A reading made
as with the sextant will give at once the angle of the two objects
projected on the horizon, such as would be obtained with a grapho
meter.
   It follows from the preceding that the coincidence should be
exact with the image of the axis of rotation or vertical edge of A,
which would reduce to zero the field of the objects seen in B by
double reflection; but it is easy to see that by slightly inclining the
visual ray so as to have a sufficient field, the error produced will
be extremely small from the properties of minima, since we move
but little from the position in which the error is completely nul
lified ; with a small instrument which is only 7 centimetres in the
side, an operator who is but little practised may take, in a few
seconds, angles with sufficient accuracy for most ordinary opera
tions; the approximation mainly depends on the horizontality
of the instruments.       Although the coincidence becomes more
difficult and the exactitude less for very large angles, we may work
directly up to 140°.-Comptes Rendus, April 27, 1885.

ON THE PRODUCTION OF ALTERNATING CURRENTS BY MEANS OF
    A DIRECT-CURRENT DYNAMO-ELECTRIC MACHINE.                 BY JOHN
    TROWBRIDGE AND HAMMOND WINTON HAYES.
   It is often desirable to transform a direct current into an
alternating one for the purpose of obtaining electricity of high
tension by means of a Ruhmkorff coil, for studying the effects
of stratifications in vacuum tubes, or for employing alternating
currents in the study of magnetism. . The best way is undoubtedly
to employ an alternating dynamo-electric machine, as has been
done by Spottiswoode. When, however, only a direct-current
 machine is available, the following method can be employed:—
    The dynamo machine, if it is not a shunt—wound machine, is
 shunted by a suitable resistance. We have employed for this pur
 pose thin ribbon-steel about 1.5 centim. broad and .01 millim. in
 thickness. The remaining portion of the current from the machine
 is conducted to two brass or copper segments a, a', fig. 2. This
 current is led to the primary coil, for instance, of a Ruhmkorff coil
 from two other segments b, W. These segments are fixed upon a

revolve four brushes which connect the adjoining segments. The
brushes a a, b b are made adjustable, the two adjoining brushes
being electrically connected, and a small stream of water plays
upon the segments of the commutator. The character of the spark
produced by a Ruhmkorff coil which is marked by alternating
currents has been studied by Spottiswoode. Without condensers
in the secondary circuit, a bright yellow glow spans the distance
between the two terminals of the coil, which partakes more of the
character of a voltaic arc than of the ordinary discharge from a
Ruhmkorff coil. The apparatus which we used produced three
thousand reversals a minute. This rate was too rapid for the best
effects with a Ruhmkorff coil. It enabled us, however, to study
the musical note produced in the cores of the electromagnet by
rapid reversals of the current in the electromagnet, and also the
heating effects which have been so often studied.—Silliman's

                    BY PLINY EARLE CHASE, LL.D.
    The earliest attempt at measurement, with a view to demonstrate
 the correlation of thermal and electric energies, appears to have
been that of Principal Forbes, who found, in 1832 (Phil. Mag. iv.
 p. 27), that the conductivity of metals for heat and electricity is
 nearly the same. The dimensions of absolute measure involved
 were M, L.
    In 1843 Joule published his discussion of the calorific effects
 of magneto-electricity, and his determination of the mechanical
 equivalent of heat (Phil. Mag. xxiii. pp. 263, 347, 435), using the
 same dimensions, M, L.
    In 1856 Weber extended the correlation of Forbes (Pogg. Ann.
 xcix.), by showing the approximate equality of the electro-magnetic
 ratio to the velocity of light (L T-1).
    Wolf's discovery of the sun-spot period was followed, in 1857,
 by the investigations of Lamont and Sabine, showing the identity

518           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
of the sun-spot periods with the periods of magnetic perturbation
(Mag. and Meteorol. Obs., Toronto, III. lxviii.; St. Helena, II.
cxxi.-cxxxvi.).
   In 1860 Henshall showed the influence upon sun-spots which
is produced by Mercury, Venus, and Jupiter, when in conjunction
with the same face of the Sun (Cosmos, xvii. p. 573).
   In 1863 Chase showed (Proc. Amer. Phil. Soc. ix. pp. 283–288;
Phil. Mag. xxviii. pp. 55–59) that the mass of the Sun can be
approximately estimated from the influence upon the barometer
of the constrained “relative motions” of the Earth and Sun.        In
1864 he showed, by the investigation which received the Magellanic
medal (Trans. Amer. Phil. Soc. xiii. pp. 117–136; Proc. Amer.
Phil. Soc. ix. pp. 425–430; Phil. Mag. xxx. pp. 52–57), that the
magnetic disturbances of the Sun and Moon are many times
greater than simple tidal disturbances, and that they can be very
closely represented by the disturbances of gravitating pressure,
under constrained and “coercitive” relative motion.       In 1869 he
further showed (Proc. Amer. Phil. Soc. xi. pp. 103–107) that the
constrained relative motion at Sun's surface represents a cyclical
gravitating and electric disturbance which acts with the velocity
of light.
   i. 1873 Maxwell (Electricity and Magnetism) published his
theory that light consists of a disturbance in a medium susceptible
of dielectric polarization.
   In 1884 Langley (Researches on Solar Heat) confirmed the
identity of thermal, electric, and luminous radiation, for which
Chase had suggested probable reasons in 1864 (Proc. Amer. Phil.
Soc. ix. p. 408), and Draper in 1872 (Phil. Mag. xlvi. pp. 104–107).
   All of the foregoing investigations can be coordinated, in the
region of greatest known energy, by means of the kinetic unit
    2
*}, in which u represents an infinitesimal particle, and v, is the
velocity of light, the electric ratio, the projectile velocity which
represents thermo-dynamic energy at Sun's surface, and the
projectile velocity which represents the maximum energy both of
constrained rotation and of free revolution in the solar system.
   The greatest constant energy of free revolution, which can be
                                         2
given to p. by solar attraction, is   º, v,   being the velocity of
circular orbital revolution at the Kantian radius r, where solar
rotation and orbital revolution are synchronous. The same energy
would give synchronous radial or elliptic revolution through or
about a major axis 2r, under gravitating acceleration varying
inversely as r".
   The energy which would be required to produce synchronous
radial oscillation, under the constant gravitating acceleration g,
would be r" times as great, or  ºr.
   The energy which would be required to produce constant radial
oscillation in the region of maximum solar gravitation and coercitive

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.            519
force (at Sun's surface) would be k" times as great, or
k being the ratio of the Kantian radius to the solar radius.
   The time which would be required to communicate this maximum
energy is tº, the time of virtual projection against uniform resis
tance, in the region of greatest solar energy, which is also the time of
solar half-rotation, as well as the minimum time of synchronous
elliptic, circular, and radial oscillation in the solar system.
   The ordinary thermal and gravitating units may be deduced
from the general unit by means of the equations

  THE CHASE-MAxwell RATIO.             BY PLINY EARLE CHASE, LL.D.
   In 1872 (Proc. Amer. Phil. Soc. xii. p. 394) Chase showed
that the tendency of particles, in exploded gases, toward primary
and secondary centres of oscillation leads to a permanent vis
viva of equilibrium which is # of the vis viva of explosive projec
tion, and that the synchronous action of the Sun and the Earth
 upon the oscillating particles furnishes a ready method for
estimating the Sun's mass and distance. He also showed (ibid.
pp. 403-405) that the successive planetary positions in the solar
system illustrate the influence of aethereal oscillations of a similar
character. In 1875 he showed (op. cit. xiv. p. 651) that the
mean velocity of expanding gaseous pressure is * of the corre
sponding constant velocity of revolution; the ratio of vis viva

is therefore r” = '405285, and we have
                         K. : ]: : : 1-405285 : 1.
   In 1877, Preston (Phil. Mag. iii. p. 453; iv. p. 209) showed
“that a physical relation exists between the velocity of the particles
of a medium constituted according to the kinetic theory, and the
velocity of propagation of a wave in the medium.” Maxwell
calculated the numerical value of this relation at Vä, which repre
sents Chase's ratio of relative vis viva; but he did not give the
method by which he reached that result, and no record of it was
found among his papers. The following thermodynamic demon
stration may therefore be satisfactory to those who have found
any difficulty in accepting the more simple and more general
photodynamic proof which is furnished by reference to oscillatory
centres.
