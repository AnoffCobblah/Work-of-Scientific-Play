I.    On theLaw of Density of Saturated Steam expressed by a New
     Formula. By Tnoruas Rows EDMONDS, B..4. Cantab.*
          expansive force of a unit weight of saturated steam,
THEaccording      to temperature, is usually measured by the pro
duct of the pressure P in pounds to the square foot, multiplied
by the volume V in cubic feet occupied by one pound weight of
such steam.    The product PV represents the work done or re
sistancc overcome in foot-pounds, and is equal to the effect pro
duced by a constant force P pounds driving a piston, whose area
is one square foot, through the linear space represented by the
number which expresses V in cubic feet. When the laws of
pressure and volume are both known, the law of expansive force
represented by the product PV will be known also.     But such a
compound will not be entitled to the appellation of a third law,
if the two formulae for P and V, when united, do not yield for
result a third formula equal in simplicity.to either of the two
constituent formula.
   The pressure P of saturated steam appropriate‘to every tem
perature, from —30° to +230° Centigrade, has been satisfac
torily and accurately determined through the observations of M.
Regnault, published in the year 1847. The law of pressure
deduced from these observations has been investigated in the
Philosophical Magazine for March 1865, and the formula indi
cating the law has been found to be
                                    an                 t     “"

                  }i(=n+
which is the hyperbolic logarithm of 10.
     The <U+FB01>rst and only satisfactory observations made for determi
ning by experiment the density of saturated steam at various
 temperatures, are those of Messrs. William Fairbairn and Thomas
 Tate.     They are published in the Philosophical Transactions of
 the year 1860.        The dif<U+FB01>culties are great in the way of making
 correct observations on the density of saturated steam in free
 communication with water.            Such steam has not yet been ob
 tained in a pure state, there being always an admixture of water
 with such steam. Part of the water is suspended in the form of
 cloud or mist, and part is pressed as a <U+FB01>lm of <U+FB02>uid against the
 sides of the containing vessel.            Messrs. Fairbairn and Tate
 appear to have overcome the chief impediments to correct obser
 vation by the use of their “ saturation-gauge.”            On examining
 the results obtained, it will be found that the law of progression
 according to temperature for the density as given by these ob
 servations, is not much less regular than the law of progression
 for pressure as given by the observations of M. Regnault. It
 will be found that the function of the variable tinvolved in the
 law of densit is identical with the function of the variable t
 involved in t e law of pressure.           The differential coef<U+FB01>cient of

     In the investigation of the law of pressure above referred to, it
  has been shown (Philosophical Magazine, vol. xxix. p. 179) that
  for any given interval of temperature, the logarithm of the pres
  sure P of saturated steam is a simple function of the logarithm
  of the expansive force p of a unit weight of a perfectly elastic
  vapour maintained at a constant volume.           The quantity )2 being

The value of a in the formula for pressure has been shown to be
'03580, which represents the rate of increase per degree (Centi—
grade) of the pressure at the absolute temperature 376°, or at
100° on the Centigrade scale.          In order to represent the law of
volume, we have to put (for the same temperature) ¢,= — ‘03365 ;
and to represent the law of expansive force we have to put
a”: +'00215. We thus obtain the following expressions for
pressure, volume, and expansive force, reckoned from 100° Cen
tigrade :—
           P=e¢¢l°BP,    and      logP = +'03580 ¢ logp,

         PV=rf‘1-I5 1°", and log     PV= +‘00215        4) logp.
   By the aid of the three foregoing equations any one of the
three quantities P, V, or PV may he expressed in terms of either
of the other two quantities.         In order to express V in terms of
P, we obtain, by dividing log        V  by log P,

 paper Professor Rankine expresses his opinion that the results
 of the experiments of Messrs. Fairbairn and Tate are in near
 accordance with his own theoretical Tables at all temperatures.
 He adds, however, that at temperatures above 100° C., the
 aggregate of experiments indicate an excess of density above
 the theoretical density.     This excess he states to amount on an‘
 average to '27 parts of cubic foot, being the difference between

    In the year 1850, M. Clausius published a formula by means
 of which the density of saturated steam may now be calculated.
 This formula is given in the Philosophical Magazine for August
  1851, at page 107.   It contains two quantities which are super
 <U+FB02>uous, as they are not- found in the. new formula above given.
 Nevertheless the results yielded by M. Clausius’s formula for
volume, are nearly identical with the results of the new formula
for volume.    M. Clausius deduced his formula from a theory of
the moving force of heat originating with M. Carnot in 1824,
and improved by M. Clapeyron in 1834.
'
    The formula of M. Clausius is an expression for the latent
heat of saturated steam relative to water (L), in terms of oule’s                                 J

for volume       M. Clausius, in combination with the new for
                   by

the three series of results,     will be perceived that for all tempe

ratures above 60° C. the three series of results may be said to be
identical one with another.      At temperatures below 60° C., the
two series of M. Clausius and Professor Rankine continue to
agree with one another, but they disagree slightly with the
results of the new formula.       This disagreement arises from the
circumstance that the <U+FB01>rst two series of results are regulated                              by
the law of latent heat adopted          M. Regnault, which law

   In Table IV. will be seen, for various intervals of tempera
ture from 0° C. to 220° C., the relation between the numbers
for latent heat given         M. chnault, and the true numbers

formula for volume in combination with the new formula for

ence, however, to the account given by M. Regnault of the
various unsatisfactory experiments which he has made for tem

lieving that the new law for latent heat (expressed by the equa
tion L=PVp-"), which is indisputably true for all temperatures
above 60° C., is not also true for all lower temperatures.   (See

   The latent heat of saturated steam adopted by M. Regnault is
deduced from a well-known empirical law propounded by him,
as a<U+FB02>'ording a near representation of the total heat absorbed by
a unit weight of saturated steam during its conversion from
water, and its elevation in temperature from 0° C. to t° Centi
grade.   This “total heat” is called     and the formula
                                              7t,                  is

latent heat is obtained    by
                           subtracting from the “total heat

From this number     isto be deducted the heat absorbed            by
                                                                    unit

to 200° C.    This  is200 units of heat, together with 3'2 units
addition made for increased speci<U+FB01>c heat or capacity of water at
200° C.    We have consequently the resulting latent heat of
saturated steam at 200° C. = 667'5—203'2=464"3                 units of
heat, which  is the number adopted          M. Regnault, as stated in
                                             by
the last page of vol. xxi. of the Mémoires de l’Acade'mie, See.
   The lowest average temperature at which observations on
latent heat were made         M. Regnault was +10° C. At this
                               by
point the latent heat observed        is stated to have been 599'5,
whilst the new formula would give 587'4 Centigrade units of
heat.   The difference    is121, which        the maximum difference
                                              is
between theory    and a selected  series   of  experiments.    M. Reg
nault remarks that the dif<U+FB01>culties are great in obtaining results
to be relied upon from observations on latent heat of saturated
steam made at temperatures below 60° C., or at pressure less
than one-<U+FB01>fth part of an atmosphere.          He says that he has tried
various methods of observation at these low temperatures; he
assigns no reason for the preference given to the method of ob
servation <U+FB01>nally adopted   ;  and he expresses no con<U+FB01>dence in the

              Saturated Steam expressed by a New Formula.                                                               9
results  which he adopts.      In speaking of the “total heat ”
adopted for the lowest temperature observed, + 10° C., M. Reg
nault says that he “believes it will be found not very far from
the truth.”
   M. Regnault’s Table of latent heat is mainly dependent on
his empirical law for “ total beat ” expressed by the formula
A+Bt. This law is of extreme simplicity, and for that reason
the chances are very much against its being true for the entire
range of temperature from 220° C. to 0° C., to which M. Reg
nault tries to make it apply.      That it should be found to be
true from 220° C. to 60° C. is something extraordinary, and
ought to satisfy all reasonable expectation.       There      however,                             is,
a good  reason  for anticipating  failure in this empirical  law when
extended to low temperatures.       The point of temperature where
the suspected failure occurs     not very distant from
                                              is           remarkable                          a
point of temperature (44° C.) indicated (as already stated)        the                                         by
new formula for PV, where d. log PV=d. logp.              It highly                                      is
improbable that an empirical law so simple as A+Bt should in
dicate correctly the “ total heat ” for ranges of temperature below
this remarkable point (44° C.) as well as for ranges of tempera
ture above this point.

compounds, and which are no longer in harmony with much of
the system of nomenclature                      introduced by Lavoisier and his
colleagues      eighty or ninety years ago.                      The present         seems    by

  general consent to be a convenient time for carrying out such
  an attempt.
      Professor Williamson, in the paper which he published in the
  June Number of this Magazine, has particularly urged the im
  portance of improving the existing nomenclature by the sys
  tematic adoption and extension of a method largely used by
  Berzelius—a proposal which appears to have found very general
  acceptance.
     As, however, the carrying out of this plan will involve a some
 what extensive alteration of the names at present employed by
 chemists to designate inorganic compounds, it appears to be
 desirable to consider whether, before such changes be generally
 adopted, other alterations may not be bene<U+FB01>cially introduced at
 the same time.         It is with a view of aiding in a discussion, the
 results of which must be fraught with important practical con
 sequences, that the suggestions contained in the present paper
 are ofl'ered*.
     The fundamental alteration proposed by Professor W illiam
 son admits of a simple illustration.          When a metal, for exam
 ple,   has the  power   of  forming   two basic   oxides, and consequently
 of furnishing two distinct classes of salts, these oxides are distin
 guished from each other by the terminations our and ic, the oxide
 with the smallest proportion of oxygen being indicated by the
                                                                        '
 termination ous.
     Iron, for example, forms two basic oxides, FeO and Fe“ 03;
 the <U+FB01>rst is termedferrous oxide, the second ferric oxide; whilst
 the salts formed by the action of acids upon the <U+FB01>rst constitute
 the ferrous salts, such as Fe S04, ferrous sulphate; those from
 the second oxide the ferric salts, such as Fe“ 3804, ferric
 sulphate.                                       1
     To this plan, which gives simple and brief names, probably
 no exception could reasonably be taken, if all the oxides desig
 nated by these terminations had an analogous atomic composi
tion; but it is universally admitted that this is not the case, as
 will be immediately seen by comparing a few selected examples.

     Now it appears that in the introduction of any change in our
nomenclature it would be proper to aim at a greater degree of
precision than the plan in its present form permits.                   By a
    * In the following remarks the now usual atomic weights are
                                                                   adopted;
viz. 0= 16,   C:  12, 8:32 ; and the old atomic weights ofall the metals re
ferred to are doubled, with the exception of potassium, sodium, thallium,
silver, gold, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth.

            Prof. W. A. Miller   on Chemical Nomenclature.           13
modi<U+FB01>cation quite in harmony with the principles recognized in
the present mode of constructing names for chemical compounds,
the requisite precision may readily be given.         For instance, the
oxides of the four metals above mentioned represent four differ
ent types of atomic composition, which it is desirable to indicate
in the name, and which may be done by giving to them the fol
lowing designations :—
   Ag‘O     . Tetrargentous oxide.      Au’O     . Diaurous oxide.
   Ag'O     . Diargentic oxide.         Au“ ()8  . Auric sesquioxide.
    Cu’O    . Dicupreous oxide.          SnO     . Stannous oxide.
    CuO     . Cupric oxide.              Snl)sl  . Stannic dioxide.
     No doubt    some  of these names are longer and more clumsy
than those for which it is prop0sed to substitute them ; but the
ear soon becomes reconciled to words which are found to be
 useful.
     The Greek numerals are those which in most cases make the
 best words, and for some time past the tendency has been
 towards a systematic and exclusive use of these numerals as
 pre<U+FB01>xes, which are thus gradually displacing their Latin equiva
 lents.    It is true that the use of Greek pre<U+FB01>xes to Latin deriva
 tives is in itself objectionable;    but unfortunately the nomencla
 ture of science so abounds already in barbarisms of this nature,
 that it would be more a<U+FB01>'ectation in framing our names to dis
 card an old, convenient, and recognized term such as stannic or
 auric, because it is of Latin origin, whilst the characteristic
 numeral pre<U+FB01>x with which it is to be associated is of Greek
 derivation.
     In order to enable the reader to judge fairly of the general
 effect of the modi<U+FB01>cations        proposed by Professor Williamson
 with the extensions now suggested by myself, it will be useful
 to enumerate the more important oxides and chlorides, giving
 the names at present current, together with those which it is
 proposed to substitute for them.          The application of a few of
  these altered terms to some of the salts of the common acids,
  such as the sulphates and nitrates, will then suf<U+FB01>ciently illus
 trate the class of names which would be thus introduced, and
 in-this way it will be seen with how much precision compounds
  of this kind may be indicated.
     Let it not be for a moment imagined that any abolition of          ‘
 trivial names in common use is contemplated in the changes
 suggested.       Names such as calomel, corrosive sublimate, caustic
 potash, baryta, and the like, have become an integral part of the
 language of common life; they' are recognized by the mass of
 educated men, and are, moreover, in a scienti<U+FB01>c sense, valuable,
 as giving precision in many cases to the shifting names which,
 from the rapidly-varying views of chemical constitution, have

  14          Prof. W. A. Miller      on Chemical Nomenclature.
  often been given to the same substance.                Tetrapotassic ferro
  cyanide and tripotassic ferricyanide, though scienti<U+FB01>cally express
  ing the views now entertained regarding the salts they repre
  sent, will never supersede the commercial names of yellow and
  of red prussiate of potash; and muriatic acid will probably long
  maintain its ground against hydrochloric or chlorhydric acid,
  or its newer equivalent hydric chloride.                          _
      The point that [wish here to insist upon is this :—If a scien
 ti<U+FB01>c name be imposed on any compound, it should be strictly
 systematic and correctly expressive of composition, provided it
 professes to convey any knowledge at all of the composition of
the body to which it is assigned.            The formation and occasional
 or frequent use of such names is not intended to exclude the
employment of other arbitrary but already-admitted terms for
 the same substance, whenever the use of such arbitrary names
 may appear to be expedient.
      The following Table affords examples of some of the more
important applications of the changes proposed.

       The  same principle may in most cases easily be applied in the
  construction of names for the compounds of organic chemistry.
   Sulphate of methyle, (CH’U'i2 $0“, for example, becomes dime
  thylic sulphate; acetate of ethyl, (C2 H5, C“ H3 ()9), ethylic ace
  tate; and so on. Care must, however, be taken in the construc
  tion of names intended to designate the salts of the organic bases,
  such as sulphate 0f dimethylia, (C‘ H7 N)"2 112 $04.                 Dimethylic
> sulphate would be liable to be confounded with the ether
> above     mentioned ; dimethylia sulphate, or didimethylia                     sul
‘
  phate would distinguish it; and instead of triethylic phosphate,
   (C6 H"5 N)8 H3 P04, it should be triethylia phosphate, or tritri
’
, ethylia phosphate.
       In the simpler department of inorganic chemistry there are
  certain classes of compounds which offer dif<U+FB01>culties in any con
  sistent system of nomenclature.              Among these are the substances
  which have been termed anhydro-salts, such as certain chromates
  and iodates.
       Potash forms several such compounds with chromic acid. We
                                    '
  have, for instance,
       The  normal chromate            .   K9 Cr 04.
       The  so-called bichromate.          K2 Cr2 07, not K H Cr 04.
       The  trichromate       .   .    .   K9 Cr8 01°, not K9 H4 3Cr 04.
       The  tetrachromate.        .    .   K‘-z Cr4 013, not K H3 2Cr 0“.
       The formulas given in the second column -of the foregoing                       ‘
  symbols would in these cases represent salts formed on the nor
‘
  mal plan, in which the potassium had partially or completely
v displaced the hydrogen in one or more atoms of chromic acid.
. Such compounds, however, have not been obtained in the solid
  form.      In the salts really known, it appears that the normal
  chromate has been combined with quantities of chromic oxyl,
v (Cr 03), progressively increasing; and it seems to be necessary in
  naming them to adopt an arbitrary method.                        If the normal
  chromate, (K2 0, C10"), be called dipotassic chromate, the others
                                                                                       -

 And in order to point out the unusual nature of           these salts, a
 corresponding alteration in the mode of writing the formula:
 should be adopted.
     A similar principle, both of nomenclature and of notation,
 would be usefully applied in representing the composition of the
 silicates and borates.
     Cases like these are not of unfrequent occurrence, though
 they are on the whole comparatively rare and exceptional; but
 upon their existence Professor Williamson originally founded his
 chief argument in support of his proposal to limit the use of the
 term acid to the anhydrous electro-negative oxides.
     While admitting the ingenuity of his arguments,           I do not
 share the views adopted by Professor \Villiamson in this restric
 tion of the term acid. It is true that the use of so awkward a
 word as anhydride is objectionable, though it has been to some
 extent adopted from Gerhardt as a substitute for what appears
 to me still more objectionable, the phrase “anhydrous acid.”
     The dif<U+FB01>culty which really is felt in the use of the word acid
 at all arises from its ambiguity, inasmuch as it has been loosely
 and indiscriminately applied to two different sets of bodies,—one
 set consisting of the electro-negative oxides of Berzelius, such as
 C09, 308, Ne 05; the other set, the compounds of a halogen
 with hydrogen, such as 1101, HI, and HBr.              The compound
 HCl was regarded as possessing in an eminent degree the pro
 perties of an acid, long before its chemical composition had been
 ascertained; and it certainly has as good a right to be described
 as an acid as any known substance, so long as chemists regard as
 an acid compound which possesses a sour taste, reddens vegeta
 ble blues, and neutralizes the alkalies.    Hydric chloride has pro
 perties exactly answering  to this description, which, if not strictly
 expressive of the scienti<U+FB01>c sense of the term acid, unquestionably
 expresses the sense in which it is understood in ordinary cases.
 CO“, SO”, and N52 0-" possess none of these properties until they
 have become dissolved in, or till they have combined with water.
 The use of the term acid for bodies which possess properties like
 those of hydric chloride cannot, as it seems to me, be displaced
 from our popular language; and chemists of late years have been
 gradually accepting the necessity, and have adopted Gerhardt’s
 de<U+FB01>nition of an acid, as a salt whose base (or rather basyl) is hy
drogen—a de<U+FB01>nition which includes all the substances popularly
known as acids, and others which are chemically analogous to
them.

18          Prof. W. A. Miller    on Chemical Nomenclature.
     If therefore an acceptable term for the class now known as
anhydrides   can  be suggested, one principal dif<U+FB01>culty will disap
pear:   for these bodies, might not the term oxyl be introduced?
If this be adopted, SOa would be sulphuric oxyl ; N2 O5 nitric
oxyl ; N"2 03, nitrous oxyl ; CO’, carbonic oxyl ; and so on.
   There is no need to disturb the meaning which the word base
has long possessed.       Berzelius’s de<U+FB01>nition of a base as an elec
tro-positive oxide su<U+FB01>iciently expresses its nature; and K2 0,
C90, and (NH‘PO would still be bases as at present.                 The
formula (CaO, CO“) would represent calcic carbonate as a com
pound of a base and an oxyl.
   But if the application of the term base continue to be limited
to the class originally represented by          another term will be
                                                it,
needed to express the member of the salt which occupies the
position of calcium indicated      by the formula for calcic carbonate,
Ca, 003.      For this purpose the term basyl, suggested            Mr.by
Graham many years ago, and since extensively used in this sense,
i  well adapted.      Calcium is   then the basyl in calcic carbonate.
   We now want word to represent the other portion of the
                      a
salt which      electrically opposed to the basyl
                 is                                 and here we might
                                                      ;
probably adopt with advantage       a  term suggested         by
                                                            one used by
the late Professor Daniell.
   If the metal or electro-positive portion of salt, such as hy
                                                          a
drogen or ammonium, be termed its basyl, we might term the
electro-negative portion the anion of the salt, each oxion being,
when necessary, distinguished       by  a name derived from the acid
of the salt. Ca, CO3 would then be salt consisting of the basyl
                                            a
calcium and of the action C03, which might be termed car
bion; Fe”, SO4 would be       a  salt with the basyl ferrosum, and the
oxion, 80“, or sulphion Na2 SO8 would be
                          ;                         salt with the basyl
                                                      a
sodium, and the oxion, $03, which in this case would be sulphm
sion, indicative of its relation to sulphurous acid.      The nitrates,
upon    asimilar view of their constitution, would consist of me       a
tallic basyl with NO", nilrion; the nitrites would contain nitro
sion, NOQ the acetates acetion, C9 H9 O52 the oxalates owalion,

   In describing the decompositions of many salts, we are at pre
sent obliged to use much circuitous statement for want of terms
corresponding to those now suggested.      In so simple case as    a
the displacement of lead from      solution of plumbic diacetate
                                    a

its combination with acetion.      Again, when silver nitrate and
sodic chloride, each in solution, are mixed, the chlorine and the
nitrion change places, 62 of nitrion, N9 05, being equivalent in
saturating power to 35'?) of chlorine. Let any one try to explain
this decomposition in our ordinary chemical language, and he
will see the advantage gained by adopting the use of some such
terms as those now proposed.

From the information of my friends, and from my own experi
ence, I  am able to supply an account of some features of the
malady which appear to have escaped the notice of Dr.Wollaston
and Sir David Brewster.
   One of my friends attributes each ace-cs of the disease to men
tal anxiety or overcrowding of business.        In my own case,                 I
have never been able to refer        distinctly to any antecedent
                                         it
cause.    In   afew instances     have known

 increases in dimensions.

 is   slight appearance of scarlet colour on one edge, the external
      a
edge,     Ibelieve, of the zigzags.    As the arch enlarges, vision
becomes     distinct   in the centre  of the <U+FB01>eld.   The strongly
trembling extremity of the arch rises at the same time that                        it
passes to the left, and <U+FB01>nally passes from the visible <U+FB01>eld, and
the whole phenomenon disappears.
 I   have never been able to decide with certainty whether the
disease really affects both eyes. The <U+FB01>rst impression on the mind
is that only one eye      affected (in the instance depicted above,
                             is

                    Mr.   J.   H. Cotterill on Elliptic Ribs.              21
  the left eye).      There is general obscurity on one side; but the
  tremor and boiling are so oppressive, that, if produced only in
  one eye, they may nearly extinguish the corresponding vision in
  the other.
     The duration of this ocular derangement with me is usually
 from twenty to thirty minutes, but with one of my friends it
 sometimes lasts much longer.                          I
                                          In general, feel no further in
 convenience     from    it ;  but  with my friends, it is followed by op
 pressive head-ache.
     In one instance it was remarked that the mouth of the person
 a<U+FB02>licted was sensibly distorted on one side.            And in one attack
 on myself, which occurred while I was conversing with an ac
 quaintance in a railway-carriage,          I soon became painfully sen
 sible that    I   had not the usual command of speech, that my
 memory failed so much that I did not know what                I  had said or
 had attempted to say, and that          I  might be talking incoherently.
     I entertain no doubt that the seat of the disease is the brain ;
 that the disease is a species of paralysis; and that the ocular
 affection is only a secondary symptom.

      IV.  On Elliptic Ribs.          By James H. COTTERILL,        B.A.,
              Scholar of St. John’s College, Cambridge*.
 1.                 my last paper was written,       I have seen a memoir
      SINCE by Professor       W. Thomson (Phil. Trans. 1863), in the
appendix to which it is explicitly stated that the work done in
equilibrium of elasticity is a minimum. Had I been fortunate
                                                    I
enough to have seen this memoir earlier, should probably have
been able to avoid the dif<U+FB01>cult task of discussing the general prin
ciple, and have con<U+FB01>ned myself to its application to that class of
problems for which, as I have elsewhere said, I conceive it to be
peculiarly adapted. Enough has been said to enable an opinion to
be formed on this point,and I therefore should not have proceeded
further had       I  not, on application of the general method ex
plained    in  a  recent     paper to the case of arched ribs of elliptical
form, obtained       some     results which appear to me interesting when
compared with Mr. Fairbairn’s experiments on elliptical boiler
flues.    The present paper will therefore be devoted to calculating
the stress on any section of an elliptical rib; and the results
obtained may perhaps be of service in the theory of arches.
    In the paper referred to, it was shown that the stress on any
section of an arched rib may be expressed by the equations

no work   isdone in the mass of earth, that   that the spreading   is,

                      V. On the Velocity of Sound.
             By Dr. H. W. Scnao'naa van nan KOLK*.
                      the determination of the velocity of sound is
 ALTHOUGHin itself a problem of great interest, the exact knowledge
 of this constant has become doubly interesting since the obser
 vation that it was <U+FB01>tted to furnish one of the most accurate
 methods of determining the mechanical equivalent of heat.             The
 attentive examination of this problem is therefore a matter of the
 greatest interest.
     The methods that have been employed to measure the velocity
 of sound may be divided into direct and indirect.
    To the latter class belongs WVerthcim and Masson’s method
 by means of organ-pipes, which depends on the observation of
 the pitch and of the wave-length.       The latter, however, is very
 dif<U+FB01>cult to determine with precision ; and the dif<U+FB01>culty of obtain
 ing accurate numerical results is increased by the fact, that the
 quantity which is directly measured requires to be multiplied by
 a large number, in order to obtain the distance through which
 sound travels in a second, and hence the errors of observation,
increased in the same proportion, are contained in the result.
Accordingly this method has not yielded any accurate results.
    The second indirect method is that of Clément and Desormes,
subsequently put in practice also by Gay-Lussac and by Masson.
In this method, as is well known, the magnitude directly fur
nished by expcriment       is the value of     (where  c  and  c1 are the
                                           C:1
speci<U+FB01>c heats under constant pressure and constant volume), and
the velocity of sound is calculated from this by means of' the
well-known formula.        This method is susceptible of greater accu~
racy,   and  in the  hands  of Masson it appears actually to have led
to good results.       But even'these determinations are incapable
of yielding a perfectly exact value, inasmuch as, so far as          I  am
aware, the full details of the experiments have not been published.
    Hence there remain for us to consider only the direct methods.
    The method that has been most generally adopted consists in
determining the time in which sound traverses a given distance.
At one station a signal is given, usually by means of a cannon,
and at the other station the time is noted which elapses between
the flash of the powder and the arrival of the sound.
    Another method proposed by Dr. Bosscha'f is probably sus
ceptible of great, accuracy, but hitherto it has not been tried
upon a large scale.

       We need, therefore, examine closely only the second method.
       Of all the experiments made by this method, those instituted
    by Moll and Van Beck in Holland, in 1823, are unquestionably
   the most accurate.      The results obtained by the French Acade
   micians in the year 1822, between Monthléry and Villejuif, are
   not at all to be compared with them.          On the <U+FB01>rst night (that
   of the 21st of June, 1822) twelve shots were heard at Month~
   léry and only seven at Villejuif, and on the following night only
   one shot was heard at Villejuif, wherewith the experiments were
  ended.
      The signals moreover were not made simultaneously at the two
  stations, but every <U+FB01>ve minutes a shot was <U+FB01>red at one or other
  of the stations.    It was thus impossible to apply the proper cor
  rection for the in<U+FB02>uence of the wind ; this can only be done when
  the cannons are <U+FB01>red simultaneously at both stations.
      The velocity found was 331'2 metres per second, which does
  not differ much from the result of the later experiments.         Never
  theless this determination has much less weight than that of
  Moll and Van Beck.          Since this time no similar experiments
  have been carried out on so extended a scale.
      Parry and Ross in the north-polar regions, and Bravais and
  Martins on the Faulhorn in Switzerland, obtained tolerably con
  cordant results.      Those of the former, however, are not very
  accurate,   and  there  are at least some corrections which cannot be
                                                               ‘
  applied with perfect precision to the latter.
      Hence we may con<U+FB01>ne ourselves to the consideration of M011
  and Van Beck’s determinations.            Although their experiments
  were performed with the utmost care, the result which they
  arrived at cannot be accepted, in consequence of the coe<U+FB02>icient
  of reduction not having been accurately known at that time, and
  of their having, in addition, neglected some corrections in their
  calculations.     Considering, however, the accuracy of the experi
  ments, it appeared to me worth while to repeat the calculations
  with as much accuracy as possible.
      I was nevertheless convinced      beforehand     that the value of
                                                                         g,i
  and consequently that of the mechanical equivalent of heat, could
  not be accurately determined by means of the velocity of sound
'
  thus ascertained.      In support of this opinion, the following con
  sideration may be urged.          It is not improbable d priuri that
  these intense air-waves travel quicker than weaker waves; and
  the statement of Ross, that in high northern latitudes, in the
  experiments on the velocity of sound, the report of the gun
  was heard at the further station before the command to <U+FB01>re,
  appears to con<U+FB01>rm this supposition.           If this be the case, deter
  minations made by <U+FB01>ring a cannon would give a greater-velo

city than such as were made by means of less intense waves of
air, and hence for different intensities we should <U+FB01>nd different
values             , and the accurate determination                   of the mechanical
          for<U+FB01> |
equivalent of heat would be impossible.    Experimentally this has
not been made out; experiments upon this point have never been
instituted; for the observation that a melody can be recognized
equally well near or at a considerable distance only proves that
the effect in question is very slight, since in the <U+FB01>rst place the
distance, and secondly the difference of intensity of the various
tones, can never be very great.
   Accordingly, if I venture in the following pages to calculate
the amount of this effect with greater exactitude,    must at once         I
state that    I
             by no  means  undertake to give  a complete theory of
sound.    It may be true that the theory of elasticity leads to dif
ferent fundamental formula: ; but just as, in experimental inves
tigations which yield only approximate values of the magnitude
under examination, the in<U+FB02>uence of one factor may often be ac
curately ascertained by means of comparative experiments, so                           I
believe that the in<U+FB02>uence of intensity as calculated below would
be found to be the same, even if the fundamental formulae for
the propagation of a wave-motion in air were differently developed.
                             Theoretical Development.
     We have in general, for the velocity of propagation of longitu
dinal     waves, the   formula    s:           3,
                                                    where s is the velocity, ethe
force with which the molecules attract each other when the dis
tance between has been doubled, and d the density of the medium.
Hence if a particle is displaced in the direction of two molecules
by the amount 8, the force tending to bring it back is =e8.

shot has no perceptible effect on its velocity of transmission.
 I   had at <U+FB01>rst supposed that the formula would have afforded
an explanation     of the observation of Ross, spoken of above.
This, however,       not the case, for the difference of velocity
                            is                                                                                  is
much too slight.      On the contrary, this observation seems to be
as yet entirely unexplained;       and even Le Conte, in his Memoir
on Sound (Phil. Mag. S. 4. vol. xxvii. p.         treats     as only             1)               it            a

not in any way contradict Poisson’s theory.     It true that he                              is
found the velocity to be independent of the intensity; but in
his investigation he neglected the velocity of vibration, which                                                 is
precisely the point in question, in order to be able to integrate

  42       Dr. Schroder van der Kolk              on the Velocity of Sound.
      Since, therefore, the effect of the intensity upon the velocity
  is quite imperceptible in the case of a cannon-shot, a peculiar
  interest attaches to a recalculation of the most exact experiments
  that have been made by this means, which, as we have already
  said, are those of Moll and Van Beck, in order to deduce hence
  the value of 7, and from that the mechanical equivalent of heat.
             Calculation     of Moll and Van Beck’s Experiments.
     These experiments were made on the 27th and 28th of June,
  1823.       The two stations were two hills, Kooltjesberg and
  Zevenboomen, near Amersfoort, 5 [German] miles from Amster
 dam. Moll was at the former station, and Van Beck at the latter.
     The signals were made by discharging cannon simultaneously
 at both stations.          All the observations which were not simulta
 neous were excluded, so as to eliminate the in<U+FB02>uence of the wind.
     The data of the observations are—

     The barometer and thermometer were read continuously at
 both stations, and the above values are the means of all the
 readings.       The observations of the barometer are corrected for
 capillarity and temperature.
    The statement of the temperature for the 28th of June differs
by 0'21 from that employed in the previous reduction of the
results, in consequence of an error of calculation having been
made on that occasion.
    The velocity of sound in dry air, calculated from these results
for 0° and a pressure of 07 6 metre, was—

                                                         33205
    As   some corrections were neglected in calculating this result,
and    the   constants employed in the reductions have since been
determined with much greater accuracy by Regnault, we may
here repeat the whole calculation.                  Moll and Van Beck found
for the length of the basis 17669'28 metres, a value which was
arrived at by triangulation founded upon Krayenho<U+FB01>’s measure
ments. I am, however, informed by my highly esteemed teacher
Professor Van Rees of Utrecht, that by a recalculation, in which
he applied the various equations of condition which had not

previously been taken into account, he obtained the following
results from the four combinations of triangles previously calcu
lated by Moll :—

                      Mean              .     17669'509 metres.
   The direct determinations of time were made by means of
clocks with conical pendulums indicating thirds.     During the
observations these were constantly compared with two chrono
meters, one of which was at each station.
   Eighty-nine comparisons at the Zevenboomen station are
recorded, and hence the value of one minute of mean time is
calculated as =69'63 revolutions of the pointer of the thirds
clock.   The probable error of this mean was found to be 00036
or               _
            — —1——* of its value '
              23000
      69'63
     Twenty-one comparisons at the     Kooltjesberg station are
recorded, according to which one minute was equivalent to
69'433 revolutions, with a probable error of 0023 or 34166                                 1'.
   The rate of the chronometers was determined on the prece
ding days, but not during the observations.      The Zevenboomen
chronometer indicated   almost exactly  mean   time, but the other
lost about 14 seconds daily.    This retardation was not taken
into account in the former reduction    its in<U+FB02>uence, however,
                                                        ;                                        is
found to be quite imperceptible,     since       amounts to only  it
                               of   a       second per minute, which             is   about the

time required             by
                    the velocity of transmission.
   Hence we see also that          slight alteration in the daily rate
                                               a
would have   no  effect upon   the  result.
   The belief that the in<U+FB02>uence of wind eliminated           means of
                                                            is                     by
simultaneous discharges          erroneous.  isThis     the case even    is
when the direction of the wind coincides with that of the base
line, and    it  so  is   still greater degree when the directions
                               in   a

    Although the directions of the wind are given for this day
also,    it was not possible to apply the correction directly to each
observation as on the 27th of June, since the force of the wind
was not observed but calculated from the time-observations ;
hence the correction              becomes        altogether uncertain if the errors
of observation are at all considerable.                         On the 28th of June this
was the case, for on that day the observations were not so well
made as on the previous one.                       The Zevenboomen determinations
ought always         to   be   greater     than       those made on the Kooltjesberg,
in consequence of the direction of the wind, yet we often <U+FB01>nd the
contrary to be the case, a result which can be due only to errors
of observation.            I have for this reason applied the correction to
the mean, taking the mean direction of the wind.                                       This gives
5.208 seconds, whence for the velocity per second we have 33927
metres.
   These two determinations have now to be reduced to what they
would be for dry air at 0° C., and under 0760 metre pressure.

     In order to     be able to compare approximately the values of
  these  determination, the probable errors of each are calculated.
  For the 27th of June this calculation is made from the column s,
  and for the 28th of June from the last column.            The sum of the
 squares is thus found to be
                     27th June.               28th June.
                        2210,                  18715   ;
 whence    it follows that the probable error of one observation in
 seconds    is
                        0069,                  0-256 ;
 and for the mean values,
                        00147,                 00684.
     This is the probable amount of the errors in the determina
 tions of the velocity during 52 seconds; therefore upon one
 second they would be
                        000028,                0'0684*   ;
 and  in metres,
                        0-096,                 0442.
    In  consequence of this difference in the probable errors, we
must not take the arithmetical mean of the two determinations,
but must calculate the relative weight to be given to each.
These are to each other as
                         l       1

Hence we have
                                                 Probable error. Value.

and this gives for the velocity of sound in dry air at 0° C., and
under 0760 metre pressure,
                           332'77i0'093 metre.
    The result is accordingly 0'72 metre higher than was given
by the previous calculation.
    In one respect the probable error that has been found is still
a little too great.        During each day’s observations the tempera
ture and pressure were not.eonstant, but slightly variable.              If
we take the mean of all the readings, the <U+FB01>nal result remains the

same, but the probable error would be somewhat smaller    each                        if
observation had <U+FB01>rst been reduced to the same temperature and
pressure.    But, on the other hand, this statement of the proba
ble error does not include the errors of the constants employed
in the reduction, nor a possible error in the rate of the clocks.
The former, however, are taken from Regnault’s determinations,
and are known within much less than whmth of the truth, and
the latter cause could not well occasion any larger error than this.
   Still, though it is not quite certain that the true value lies
within the limits indicated by the probable error,       am of opi          I
nion that the value we have found is certainly accurate within
T0100,   and hence it can be asserted with con<U+FB01>dence that the
true value lies between 333'1 and 33244.
   There can be no question of controlling this value by theory,
for the value of           is not known with                    anything like the          same

           great amount of light produced by the combustion of
 rl‘HEmagnesium      would make it desirable, if there was no other
 reason, to know if a corresponding quantity of heat is evolved
 during the same process.    I however felt interested in this mat

 Metals with Oxygen,” and the occurrence of these amounts in
           proportions (see Phil. Mag. November 1852, and July

      As a matter of curiosity in the history of magnesium, I must
   mention that at the time I speak of (in 1856) I wrote to a <U+FB01>rm
. in London to know the cost of some of the rare metals       intended      I
  to experiment with, and the price <U+FB01>xed for magnesium was six
  teen shillings for three grains!
     The method       I
                     adopted to <U+FB01>nd the quantities of heat of oxida

  November 1852,           I

  that evolved by magnesium ; that                 is,

  rected the result        by
                         making the proper allowances for the heat

                the decomposition of the water, and that evolved                      by
  the combination of the magnesia with the acid.
     No description of the apparatus, or the several steps of the
  process, need be detailed, as examples are given in the papers
  referred to; and since then the same experiments (without ac
  knowledgment)     have been worked out                     by

    Magnesium, by the combustion of        It  grain, or 1 equivalent,
will raise the temperature of 1000 grains of water 19°'2 F.
   This is the greatest amount of heat produced by an equivalent
of any substance with which we are acquainted.
    Potassium and sodium, hitherto the largest heat-evolvers
known, produce only a rise of l7°'5 F. in 1000 grains of water
by the combustion of one equivalent, oxygen = 1.            Magnesium
produces 19°'2 F.
   The quantity of heat evolved by the combination of magne
sium with chlorine is also greater than that of any other sub
stance.    By dissolving a metal in hydrochloric acid, the chlorine
unites with the metal, and decomposition of the acid of course
takes place, the-hydrogen escaping.        Taking, therefore, the rise
of temperature caused by the dissolving, and adding the amount
of heat absorbed by the decomposition, we get the heat actually
generated by the combination of the chlorine with the metal.
    In this way ijind that when one equivalent of magnesium,
oxygen =1, combines with chlorine there is heat produced suf<U+FB01>
cient to raise the temperature of 1000 grains of water 25°‘2 F.
One equivalent of zinc, by combining with chlorine, will evolve
heat suf<U+FB01>cient to raise the same quantity of water 11°'25 F.,
and potassium 22°‘9 F.

CONSIDERto the eye and the   plane of the picture ; the apparent con
tour of the ellipsoid is an ellipse, the intersection of the plane of
the picture by the tangent cone having the eye for vertex; this
cone touches the ellipsoid along a plane curve (the intersection
of the ellipsoid by the polar plane of the eye), which may be
called the contour section; and the apparent contour is thus the
projection of the contour section.        Consider any other plane
section; the projection thereof has double contact (real or ima
ginary) with the projection of the contour section: the common
tangents are the intersections with the plane of the picture of
the tangent planes of the tangent cone which pass through the
pole of the section ; or, what is the same thing, they are the tan
gents to the projection of the contour section, or to the projec
tion of the section, from the point which is the projection of the
pole of the section.     The projection of the pole lies in the line
which is the projection of the diameter conjugate to the plane of

      VIII.    On Numerical Relations of Gravity and Magnetism.
              By PLINY EAKLE CHASE, 111.14., S.P.A.S.*
         the <U+FB01>fth century before the Christian era, Leucippus and.
 IN his      disciple Democritus taught that heat is the soul of the
 world, the principle of life and intelligence, and that space is an
 in<U+FB01>nite plenum, pervaded by material atoms too minute to be
 perceptible to the senses, which, by their constant motions,
 unions, and separations, form the beginnings and ends of things.
 In this theory, which is said to have been borrowed from the
 priests of Isis and Osiris, we may trace the origin of the modern
 belief in a universal kinetic tether, and of the attempts to resolve
 all forces into “modes of motion,” which were practically in
 augurated by our own countryman, Benjamin Thompson, Count
 Rumford, and which have been so successfully prosecuted by
 Carnot, Seguin, Mayer, Colding, Joule, Grove, and their col
 laborators.
     The mutual convertibility of Light, Heat, Electricity, Mag
 netism, Chemical Af<U+FB01>nity, and Vital Energy, may be now re
 garded as one of the most probable physical hypotheses.               Fara~
 day has endeavoured also to connect gravitation and magnetism,
 or electric action by experimental results, but in vain.               Still
  the conviction of such a connexion is almost irresistible, and
 various physicists have given us incidental pointings in that
  direction.      Ampere discovered the magnetic effect of electric
  currents circulating around iron bars; Arago, whose experi
 ments were repeated and extended by Babbage, Herschel, Bar
 low, Christie, and others, showed that simple rotation produces
  magnetic disturbances which are governed by <U+FB01>xed laws; the
  distribution of induced magnetism in masses of iron, as deter
  mined by Barlow and Lecount, is the same as would follow from
  the relative centrifugal motions of different portions of the
  earth, provided the magnetic axis corresponded with the axis of
  rotation-1'; Hansteen suspected, and Sabine practically demon

stratcd,   the in<U+FB02>uence of the sun upon terrestrial magnetism;
Secchi ascertained that     “the diurnal excursion of the needle is
the sum of two distinct      excursions, of which the <U+FB01>rst depends
 solely on a horary angle, and the second depends, besides, on
 the sun’s declination ”*, and that “ all the phenomena hitherto
 known of the diurnal magnetic variations may be explained by
 supposing that the sun acts upon the earth as a very powerful
 magnet at a great distance ”1‘.
    This hypothesis has been objected to, on the ground that it is
 dif<U+FB01>cult to understand how any conceivable intensity of solar
magnetism, by its simple induction, could produce so great a
disturbance as is daily observed.        Therefore it will probably
follow the fate of the earlier ones, which attributed terrestrial
magnetism to one or more powerful magnets lying nearly in
the line of the earth’s axis, while Barlow’s idea that the mag
netism is super<U+FB01>cial and in some manner inducedI, will still re
main in the ascendant.       Sccchi’s conclusions are, however, none
the less interesting, and from the fact that magnetism            like   is,
gravity,   a central force, varying inversely as the square of the
distance, they lend encouragement to those who are endeavouring
to find new evidences of the unity of force.
    My own experiments and researches have led me to the belief
that all magnetism        simple reaction against
                         isa                         force which dis
                                                          a
turbs molecular equilibrium, that the numerical equivalent of
the magnetic force       therefore equal and opposite to that of the
                         is
disturbing force,       (i-M: 1D), and that all the phenomena of
terrestrial magnetism result from tidal and thermal changes in
terrestrial gravitation.
    Sullivan§ and Reinsch       have pointed out the effect of musical
vibrations upon the magnetic needle; and         have shown the con

constant direction along the magnetic meridian, and the other
toward the momentarily shifting solar meridian.           From an in
vestigation of these currents and       comparison of various obser
                                           a
vations,   I have deduced the following theses :—
  I.   The daily magnetic variations, though subject to great dis
turbances at different hours, show an average approximation to
the differences of the gravitation-tidal currents.

        III.  There are lunar-monthly barometric and magnetic tides,
  which may be explained by differences of weight or niomentum*,
  occasioned by the combined in<U+FB02>uences of solar and lunar attrac
   tion, and terrestrial rotation.
    '
        IV. The solar-diurnal variations of magnetism between noon
  and midnight are nearly identical in amount with the variations
  of weight produced by solar attraction at the same hours.
        The ratio of the solar to the terrestrial attraction for any par
  ticle at the earth’s surface being directly as the mass, and in
 verselyas the square of the distance (M+RQ= 354,936+23,0002),
  is '00067.        The weight of any particle is therefore increased by
 this proportionate amount at midnight, and diminished in the
  same proportion at noon, making a total half-daily variation of
  '00134 in the atmospheric weight, and consequently, according
 to my theory, in the terrestrial magnetism.
       Theoretical variation '00] 34.              Observed variation “00138.
        V. The magnetic variations at intermediate hours, between
 noon and midnight, indicate the in<U+FB02>uences of an accelerating
 force, like that of gravity, modi<U+FB01>ed by <U+FB02>uctuations of tempera
 ture, and by atmospheric or aethereal currents.
       Every particle of air may be regarded as a planet revolving
 about the sun, in an orbit that is disturbed by terrestrial attrac
 tion and other causes.             In consequence of these disturbances,
there is an       alternate   half-daily fall toward the sun, and rise from
the sun.          By the laws of uniformly accelerated and retarded
 motions, the mean fall and the consequent mean magnetic dis
turbances should occur at 12h+ s/.‘2=8h 29' from midnight.
       Theoretical mean 8h 29’.           Observed mean 8'1 31'.
       VI. Some of the magnetic in<U+FB02>uences appear to be transmitted
instantaneously,          through the rapid pulsations of the kinetic
      *  I believe there can be no weight without some degree             of momentum,

(Prop. IV.) is slightly less, while the theoretical barometric varia
tion (Prop. VII.) is slightly greater, than the corresponding
observed variation. The excess in one case exactly counterbalances
the de<U+FB01>ciency in the other, the sum of the theoretical being pre
cisely equal to the sum of the observcd'variations.

can be resolved into a variety of special tides, which may be

attributable to solar gravitation, with changed signs—diminu

   The form of the tide in column B is evidently such as should
be determined      by solar action.          The magnitude of the tide is
estimated by comparing the relative amounts of motion down

The mean-tidal      difference [('00067—'00048)-I-2] is very nearly
equivalent to the average theoretical inertia-disturbance of weight.

    56        On Numerical Relations              of Gravity and Illagnctism.
    The atmospheric inertia at St. Helena (regarding the <U+FB02>uctua
    tions as uniform between successive hourly observations) pro
    duces retardations of 59', 85', 26', and 31', at 0", 6b, 121‘, and
    18h respectively.   The mean retardation is 50’, or       of a half
    day.   The theoretical daily gravity-variation being ‘00134, the
    average variation in 759 of a half-day is '00009§%,'_the mean-tidal
    difference being '00009%.
        The consideration of the moon’s disturbance of the atmo
    spheric gravitation is complicated by the magnitude of its differ
    ential attraction, the position of the centre of gravity of the ter
    restrial system, the varying centrifugal force, and other circum
    stances involved in the lunar theory.    Still there are indications,
    in the following synopsis, of the in<U+FB02>uence of gravity suf<U+FB01>ciently
    striking to encourage a hope that our knowledge of the moon’
   perturbations may be improved bya thorough comparative study

 IX.     0n Chemical Nomenclature.           By G. C. Fos'rna, B.A.,
     Lecturer on Natural Philosophy           in Anderson’s    University,
     Glasgow.
       To the Editors   of the Philosophical tllugazinc and Journal.
        GENTLEMEN,                                London, June 26, 1865.
       BEG to offer    a few remarks on some observations contained
        in a paper “ On Chemical Nomenclature,” by my respected
 friend and teacher Professor Williamson, published in the June
 Number of your Magazine (v01. xxix. p. 4-64). “’ith most of the
suggestions contained in this paper, and in the Professor’s pre
vious communication to the Chemical Society on the same sub
ject, I have already expressed complete agreement;           I will there
fore con<U+FB01>nc myself here to the only important point on which               I
have ventured to differ from him.
     This is as to the correct use of the word “acid.” Professor
Williamson contends for the application of this word to such
substances as those represented by the formulae
                      808, N2 05,     (C2 H3 O)2 O, &c.,
and alleges, in words which I have previously quoted (Phil. Mag.
S. 4. vol. xxix. p. 262), that this was clearly the original sense of
the term.        My own impression being that the word acid was
long     in general use before any meaning was attached to it which
it was possible to de<U+FB01>ne with accuracy, I pointed out (too. cit.) a
few facts relating to the former use of this word which seemed
to me inconsistent with the statement above alluded to ; and also
drew attention to its having been employed even by modern che
mists, down to the time of Gerhardt and Laurent, not only for
oxides such as 808, N9 Os, &c., but for hydrogen-salts such as

58          Mr. G. C. Foster          on Chemical Nomenclature.
I-lCl, H9 804, 810.    Hence I concluded that the original mean
ing of the term was anything but particularly clear, and that pre
viously to the time of Laurent and Gerhardt it could not be said
to have had a strictly scienti<U+FB01>c and logical sense at all.
   Professor \Villiamson pays me the unexpected compliment of
calling my discussion of what I conceive to be the original mean
ing of the word acid “an elaborate exposition”; and he so far
agrees with the conclusion arrived at as to admit that, instead of
that meaning having been particularly clear, I “ might safely
 have called it ‘particularly cloudy ’.”
    This admission and the paSsage which immediately follows                        it,
seem to indicate that, in speaking of the
                                              “ original
                                                         meaning,”
Professor Williamson did not intend to go further back than Ber
zelius.   He says :—'
    “
      Every chemist knows that the great Berzelius epitomized
 the prevailing de<U+FB01>nition            by
                                    saying that an acid           'an electro
                                                                     is
 negative     oxide,   and a  base      an  iselectro-positive oxide.      No
 de<U+FB01>nition  is   complete and perfect; but this de<U+FB01>nition            certainly
                                                                          is
 clear,” Ste.    I    have no desire to put upon the word “origins ”
a   different interpretation from that intended                 by
                                                           my distinguished
 friend when he employed             it,
                                    and am therefore willing to accept
it   as referring to Berzelius’s de<U+FB01>nition.               contend, however,
                                                            I
 that this de<U+FB01>nition does not completely express the sense in

     Professor Williamson further urges that Gerhardt’s de<U+FB01>nition
 of an acid as salt of hydrogen involves the fallacy of arguing
                 a
 in  a  circle.   In this, doubtless, there          some truth; but the
                                                       is
 objection does not lie to Gerhardt’s de<U+FB01>nition alone.                 All the
 de<U+FB01>nitions of acids, bases, and salts that            have ever examined
                                                        I
 have appeared to me to amount to more or less direct statements
                                                        by by
 that “acids are bodies which form salts              acting upon bases”;
 that “bases are bodies which form salts              acting upon acids”;
 and that “ salts are bodies formed by the mutual action of acids
 and bases.”       The fact    is,
                                 that a'cids, bases, and salts are so in_
 timately    related  that no  one  class can be de<U+FB01>ned without refer

                                     I

                          or “electro-positive ” instead of “ bases”;
 for how are we to de<U+FB01>ne eleclro-negative, except as the opposite
 of electro-positive, or electro-positire, except as the opposite of
 electro-negative?      Gerhardt’s de<U+FB01>nition of acids, taken alone,
 certainly does not tell us much more than most other de<U+FB01>nitions
 of chemical terms; but it seems to me to state accurately the
 relation in which acids stand to other salts.
    I will allude to only one other portion of Professor William
 son’s paper.     One of the_objections to the use of the term acid
in Gerhardt’s sense, which he brought forward in his communi
cation to the Chemical Society, was that the action of the com
pound HNO8 upon the compound HKO cannot be described as
a combination of nitric acid with potash, without concealing the
fact that what takes place is truly a double decomposition.               In
answer to this, I pointed out that, even with the de<U+FB01>nitions of
acids and bases which Professor Williamson advocates, the
action which takes place between these bodies must often be
described as a double decomposition, and I instanced the action

(C9 H“3  O)? S.     I   foresaw at the time the reply,          that double
decompositions, “in which the resulting molecules           are less various
than the original molecules,” are to be regarded as processes of
combination ; and it was precisely for this reason that           I  adduced
the second and third of the above instances, instead of being
content with the <U+FB01>rst only.

THE" On        the Rate of Passage of Crystalloids into and out of the
Vascular and Non-Vascular Textures of the Body." By Henry
Bence   Jones, A.M., M.D., F.R.S.
   The paper is divided into <U+FB01>ve sections—
   lst. On the method of analysis, and its delicacy.
   2nd. Experiments on animals to which salts of lithium were given,
upon the rate of their passage into the textures.

    1. Three methods of analysis were followed, according as much or
little lithium was present: <U+FB01>rst, simply touching the substance nith
a red-hot platinum-wire;      secondly, extracting the substance with
water; thirdly, incinerating the substance and treating it with sul
phuric acid, and exhausting with absolute alcohol. TWJU‘UIWO of a
grain of chloride of lithium in distilled  water could be detected, and

   2.    On Rate   of Passage into   the Textures through the Stomach.
   Even in a quarter of an hour three grains of chloride of lithium,
given on an empty stomach, may diffuse into all the vascular textures,
and into the cartilage of the hip-joint and the aqueous humour of the
eye. In very young and very small guinea-pigs which have received the
same quantity of lithium, in thirty or thirty-two minutes it may be
found even in the lens; but in an old pig in this time it will have got
no further than the aqueous humour.            Ifthe stomach be empty, in
an hour the lithium may be very evident in the outer part of the lens,
and very faintly traceable in the inner part; but if the stomach be
full of food, the lithium does not in an hour reach the lens. Even
in two hours and a half lithium may be more marked in the outer than
in the inner part of the lens.       In four hours the lithium may be in
every part  of the lens ; but less evidence ofits presence will be obtained
there than from the aqueous humour.         In eight hours, even, the cen
tre of the lens may show less than the outer part. In twenty-six hours
the diffusion had taken place equally throughout every part of the
lens.   Ifthe lithium is injected under the skill, in ten minutes it may
be found in the crystalline lens, and even in four minutes, after the
injection of three grains of chloride, the lithium may be in the bile,
urine, and aqueous humour of the eye.
            3. On the Rate of Passage out of the Teztures.
   After two grains of chloride of lithium, in six hours the lithium
was more distinct in the outer than in the inner part of the lens.  In
twenty-four hours no difference in the different parts of the lens was
detectable.    In forty-eight hours no difference was observed.     In
ninety-six hours no lithium was detectable in the lens or cartilage of
    hip-joint.   The urine showed lithium very distinctly even in one
 She
 rop.
  After   one grain of chloride of lithium, in <U+FB01>ve hours and  half thea
lithium   was more distinct in the outer than in the inner part of
the lens.    In twenty-four hours and half there was no difference
                                           a
throughout the lens.    In forty-eight hours the watery extract of the
lens showed faint traces of lithium.     In seventy-two hours and a
half (three days) the alcoholic extract of the lens showed no lithium.
The urine still showed lithium distinctly           in
                                                one drop, and      con    it
tinued to be found in the watery or alcoholic extract for twenty
one days.
   After halfa grain of chloride of lithium, in three hours and <U+FB01>fty
minutes traces of lithium could be found in the lens, and for thirty
seven or thirty-eight days traces of lithium could be found in the urine.

         Passage  of Crystalloik inlo and     out of the Tissues.     61
    After  a quarter of a grain of chloride of lithium, in <U+FB01>ve hours
and    a quarter the aqueous humour showed lithium, and all the
organs showed lithium, but none was in the lens.          In another pig,
in twenty-four hours all the organs showed less lithium, and none
was found in the aqueous humour.
    After a quarter of a grain, in <U+FB01>ve hours and thirty-<U+FB01>ve minutes
lithium was distinct in the aqueous humour, and very faintly traceable
in the lens; and after sixteen days the minutest traces of lithium
could be detected in the lens, the liver, the kidney; but no trace
could be found in the blood.
    After three grains of chloride of lithium, in four hours lithium was
in the hair of the belly, and for thirty-two days the urine showed
lithium very distinctly.     The thirty-third day after the lithium the
lens was found to contain minute traces of lithium, and even after
thirty-nine days the lithium was in the alcoholic extract of the urine.
    \Vith three grains of chloride of lithium, a young pig in half an
hour had lithium in the watery extract of the lens. In the same time
an old pig had no lithium in the lens.
    With two grains, a young pig in six hours had lithium distinctly
throughout the whole lens.      An old pig in the same time had lithium
in the outer part of the lens, but scarcely the minutest trace in the
 inner part of the lens.
    4. Experiments on     Healthy Persons and on Cases of Cataract.
    Ten grains of carbonate of lithia, taken three or four hours after
 food by a man,     require from <U+FB01>ve to ten minutes to pass from the
 stomach to the urine, and this quantity of lithia will continue to pro
 duce traces of lithium in the urine for from six to seven days.
    Two grains of chloride or carbonate of lithia, taken shortly after
 food by a boy, gives no appearance in the urine until from ten to
 twenty minutes; and this quantity continues to pass out for five,
 seven, or eight days.
    Experiments made by the ordinary mode of analysis showed that
 four grains of sulphate of protoxide of iron, taken by a man almost
 fasting, gave a trace in the urine in seven minutes.         Seven grains
 gave distinct appearance in ten minutes ; and in ten minutes and a half
 one grain of iodide of potassium, taken by the same man fasting,
  appeared in the urine in twelve minutes.
     When no lithia had been taken, seven cataracts were examined
 most carefully, and only one showed an exceedingly feeble trace of
 lithium.
     When twenty grains of carbonate of lithia were taken twenty-<U+FB01>ve
  minutes before the operation, the lens showed no lithium.
     When twenty grains of carbonate of lithia were taken two
  hours and a half before the operation, the lens showed lithium in
                                            ‘
  the watery cataract.
     When twenty grains of carbonate of lithia were taken between
  four and <U+FB01>ve hours before the operation, the lens showed lithium
  in each particle.
     \Vhen twenty grains of carbonate of lithia were taken seven hours
  before the operation, the lens showed lithium in each particle.

62                          Royal Society:  —
    When twenty grains of carbonate of lithia were taken seven days
before the operation, the lens showed not the slightest traceof lithium.
    T_wenty grains of carbonate of lithia, taken between six and thirty
six hours before death, showed the faintest indications of lithium in
the lens.    The cartilage showed lithium very distinctly.
    Ten grains of carbonate of lithia, taken <U+FB01>ve hours and a half
before death, gave only faint traces of lithium in the lens, but the
cartilage showed lithium very distinctly.
        5. On the Presence   of Lithium in Solid and Liquid Food.
    Potatoes showed traces of lithium once in <U+FB01>ve trials.
    Apples showed traces of lithium thrice in four trials.
    Carrots showed no lithium in two trials.
    Bread showed traces of lithium thrice in three trials.
    Cabbage         ,,        ,,      twice in two trials.

    Mutton, beef, and sheep’s kidney showed no lithium : one kidney
had a slight trace.
                              CONCLUSIONS.
       1.  On the Rate of Passage of Solutions     of Lithium into the
                           Textures of Animals.
    Chloride of lithium taken into the stomach in quantities varying
from one quarter of a grain to three grains, will pass into all the vas
cular parts of the body, and even into the non-vascular textures, in
from one quarter of an hour to <U+FB01>ve hours and a half.
        2. On the Rate quass-age out of the Textures of Animals.
     Chloride of lithium passes out by the skin as well asby the urine;
 and thus the animals can redose themselves with chloride of lithium
 from the hair and feet, and prevent accurate observations.         Hence
 probably chloride of lithium, in quantities varying from half a grain
 to three grains, will continue to pass out of the body for thirty-seven,
 thirty-eight, or thirty-nine days; and even after thirty-three days,
 traces may be found in the lens; but in three or four days no
lithium may be detectable in the non-vascular textures.
    3. In man, carbonate of lithia, when taken in <U+FB01>ve- or ten-grain doses,
 may appear in the urine in <U+FB01>ve to ten minutes if the stomach is
 empty, or twenty minutes if the stomach is full, and may continue to
 pass out for six, seven, or eight days.
     In two hours and a half, traces may be in the crystalline lens,
 and in <U+FB01>ve or seven hours it may be present in every particle of
 the lens and in the cartilages.       In thirty-six hours it may be very
 evident in the cartilages.      And in seven days not the slightest
 trace may be detectable in the crystalline lens.

      “On the Elasticity and Viscosity of Metals.”                 By Prof. W.
  Thomson,     LL.D., F.R.S., F.R.S.E.
      Among the experimental exercises performed by students in the
  physical laboratory of the University of Glasgow, observations on
  the elasticity of metals have been continued during many years.
  Numerous       questions of great interest,       requiring more thorough
 and accurate investigation, have been suggested by these observa
 tions; and recently they have brought to light some very unex
 pected properties of metallic wires.           The results stated in the pre
 sent communication are, however, with one or two exceptions, due to
 the careful experimenting of Mr. Donald Mact'arlane, of<U+FB01>cial assis
 tant to the Professor of Natural Philosophy, whose interested and
 skilful cooperation have been most valuable in almost everythingI
 have been able to attempt in the way of experimental            investigation.
      The subject has naturally fallen into two divisions, Viscosity,
 and Moduli of Elasticity.
      Viscosity—By induction from a great variety of observed phe
 nomena, we are compelled to conclude that no change of volume
 or of shape can be produced in any kind of matter without dissipa
 tion of energy.        Even in dealing with the absolutely perfect elas
 ticity    of volume     presented by every <U+FB02>uid, and possibly by some
 solids, as for instance homogeneous crystals, dissipation of energy
is an inevitable result of every change of volume, because of the
accompanying change of temperature, and consequent dissipation
 of heat by conduction or radiation.               The same cause gives rise
necessarily to some degree of dissipation in connexion with every
change of shape of an elastic solid.            But estimates founded on the
thermodynamic theory of elastic solids, which I have given else
where*, have sufficed to prove that the loss of energy due to this
cause is small in comparison with the whole loss of energy which I
have observed in many cases of vibration.                I have also found, by
vibrating     a  spring alternately     in air of ordinary pressure, and in the
exhausted receiver of an air-pump, that there is an internal resist
ance to its motions immensely greater than the resistance of the air.
The same conclusion is to be drawn from the observation made by
Kup<U+FB01>'er in his great work on the elasticity of metals, that his vibra
ting springs subsided much more rapidly in their vibrations than
rigid pendulums supported on knife-edges.                 The subsidence of vi
brations is.probably more rapid in glass than in some of the most
elastic metals, as copper, iron, silver, aluminiumf; but it is much

     t “'0 have   no evidence that the precious metals are more elastic than copper,
iron, or brass.     One of the new bronze pennies gives quite as clear a ring as a
two-shilling silver piece tested in the usual manner.

more     rapid than in glass, marvelloust rapid indeed, in some metals
 (as for instance zinc) *, and in india rubber, and even in homoge
 neous jellies.
     The frictional resistance against change of shape must in every
 solid be in<U+FB01>nitely small when the change of shape is made at an
 in<U+FB01>nitely slow rate, since, if it were <U+FB01>nite for an in<U+FB01>nitely slow change
 of shape, there would be in<U+FB01>nite rigidity, which we may be sure does
 not exist in nature‘i“.    Hence there is in elastic solids a molecular
friction   which  may    be properly called viscosity of solids, because, as
 being an internal resistance to change of shape depending on the
 rapidity of the change, it must be classed with <U+FB02>uid molecular
 friction, which by general consent is called viscosity of<U+FB02>uids. But,
 at the same time, it ought to be remarked that the word viscosity,
 as used hitherto by the best writers, when solids or heterogeneous
 semisolid-semitlnid masses are referred to, has not been distinctly ap
 plied to molecular friction, especially not to the molecular friction of a
 highly elastic solid within its limits of high elasticity, but has rather
 been employed to designate a property of slow continual yielding
 through very great, or altogether unlimited, extent of change of
 shape, under the action of continued stress. It is in this sense that
 Forbes, for instance, has used the word in stating that " Viscous
 Theory of Glacial Motion" which he demonstrated by his grand ob~
 servations on glaciers.     As, however, he, and many other writers after
 him, have used the words plasticity and plastic, both with reference to
 homogeneous solids (such as wax or pitch even though also brittle,
 soft metals, &c.), and to heterogeneous semisolid-semi<U+FB02>uid masses
 (as mud, moist earth, mortar, glacial ice, &c.), to designate the
property          I
              common to all those cases of experiencing, under continued
stress, either quite continued and unlimited change of shape, or
gradually very great change at a diminishing (asymptotic) rate
through in<U+FB01>nite time, and as the use of the term plasticity im
plies no more than does viscosity any physical theory or explana
 tion of the property, the word viscosity is without inconvenience
left available for the de<U+FB01>nition I propose.
    To investigate the viscosity of metals, I have in the <U+FB01>rst place
                                                                                           __-¢\____‘._4.‘

  plan when the wire is thick enough); and the other to a <U+FB01>xed rigid
  body, from which the wire hangs, bearing the vibrator at its lower
  end.      I arrangcd sets of observations to be made for the separate
  comparisons of the following classes :—
      ( a) The same wire with di<U+FB01>‘erent vibrators of equal weights (to give
  equal stretching-tractions), but different moments of inertia (to test
  the relation between viscous resistances against motions with different
  velocities through the same range and under the same stress).
      (6) The same wire with different vibrators of equal moments of
  inertia but unequal weights (to test the effect of different longitu
  dinal tractions on the viscous resistance to torsion under circum
 stances similar in all other respects).
     (0) The same wire and the same vibrator, but different initial
 ranges in successive experiments (to test an effect unexpectedl        dis
 covered, by which the subsidence of vibrations from any amp 'tude
 takes place at very different rates according to the immediately
 previous molecular condition, whether of quiescence or of recurring
 change of shape through a wider range).
     (d) Two equal and similar wires, with equal and similar vibra
 tors, one of them kept as continually as possible in a state of vibra
 tion, from day to day; the other kept at rest, except when vibrated
 in an ex eriment once a day (to test the effect of continued vibration
 on the viscosity of a metal).
                                    Results.
     (a)   It was found that the loss of energy in a vibration through
 one     range was greater the greater the velocity (within the limits of
 the experiments) ; but the difference between the losses at low and
 high speeds was much less than it would have been had the resist
 ance been, as Stokes has proved it to be in <U+FB02>uid friction, approx
 imately as the rapidity of the change of shape.            The irregulari
 ties in the results of the, experiments which up to this time       I have
 made, seem to prove that much smaller vibrations (producing less
 absolute amounts of distortion in the parts of the wires most stressed)
 must be observed before any simple law of relation between mole
 cular friction and velocity can be discovered.
     (b) When the weight was increased, the viscosity was always at
 <U+FB01>rst much increased; but then day after day it gradually diminished
and became as small in amount as it had been with the lighter
weight.        It has not yet been practicable to continue the experiments
long enough in any case to <U+FB01>nd the limit to this variation.
    (0) The vibration subsided in aluminium wires much more rapidly
from amplitude 20 to amplitude 10, when the initial amplitude was
40, than when it was 20. Thus, with a certain aluminium wire, and
vibrator No.1 (time of vibration one way 1-757 second), in three

    Measurements of Young’s modulus have been made for many bodies
by many experimenters; but hitherto there have been very few deter
minations of rigidity, notwithstanding the great ease with which this
can be done for wires by Coulomb’s method.                Accordingly, although
several accurate determinations of Young’s modulus have been made
upon wires of different substances hung in the College Tower of the
University of Glasgow (which, by giving 80 feet of clear protected
vertical space, affords great facilities for the investigation), I shall in
this paper only refer to some of the results as hearing on the question,

changes in its molecular condition? which was my starting-point for
all I have attempted to do experimentally regarding the elasticity of
 solids.
    To determine rigidities by torsional vibrations, taking advantage
of an obvious but most valuable suggestion made to me by Dr.J0ule,
   '  The one great advantageof the French metrical system is, that the mass of the
unit volume (I centimetre) of water at its temperature of maximum density (3°‘945
Cent.) is unity (1 gramme) to a su<U+FB02>icient degree of approximation for almost all
practical purposes.    Thus, according to this system, the density of a body and
its speci<U+FB01>c gravity mean one and the same thing; whereas on the British no
system the density is expressed by a number found by multiplying the speci<U+FB01>c
gravity by one number or another. according to the choice (of a cubic inch, cubic
foot, cubic yard,or cubic mile) that is made for the unit of volume, and the weight
of: grain, scruple, gun-maker's drachm, apothecary'a dracbm, ounce Troy, ounce
lvoirdupois, pound Troy, pound avoirdupois; stone (Imperial, Ayrshire, Lanark
shire, Dumbartonshire), stone for hay, stone for corn, quarter (of ahundred
weight),quarter (of corn), hundredweight, or ton, that is chosen for unit of force.
it is a remarkable phenomenon, belonging rather to moral and social than to phy
sical science, that a people tending naturally to be regulated by common sense
 should voluntarily condemn themselves, as the British have so long done, to
 unnecessary hard labour in ever action of common business or scienti<U+FB01>c work
 related to measurement, from which all the other nations of Europe have eman
 cipated themselves.    I have been informed, through the kindness of Professor
 W. H. Miller, of Cambridge, that he concludes, from a very trustworthy com
 parison of standards by Kup<U+FB02>‘er, of St. Petersburgh, that the weight of a cubic
 decimetre of water at temperature of maximum density is 1000013 grammes.

       Thus it appears that that speci<U+FB01>c rigidity which is concerned in
    torsion is very markedly diminished in copper, brass, and iron wire
    when the wire is elongated permanently by a simple longitudinal
    traction. When I <U+FB01>rst observed indications of this result, I sus
    pected that the diminution in the torsional rigidity on the whole
    length of the wire might be due to inequalities in its normal section
    produced by the stretching.          To test this, I cut the wire into several
    pieces after each series     of experiments, and weighed the pieces se
    parately.     The result   proved that in no case were there any such
    inequalities in the gauge of the wire in different parts as could possi
   bly account for the diminution in the torsional rigidity of the whole,
   which was thus proved to be due to a real diminution in the speci<U+FB01>c

   rigidity of the substance.        The following sets of weighings, for the
   cases of the wires of the two last series of experiments on copper, may

      By several determinations of observations on the elongations within
  the limits of elasticity produced by hanging weights on long wires
  (about 80 feet) suspended in the College tower, it seemed that
  Young’s modulus was not nearly so much (if at all sensibly) altered
  by the change of molecular condition so largely affecting the rigidity;
  but this question requires further investigation.          The amount of the

Young’s modulus thus found         was, in grammes weight per square cen
timetre, 1159 X 106 for one copper wire, and 1153 X 10“ for another
which had been very differently treated.
   The highest and lowest rigidities which I have found for copper
(extracted from the preceding Table) are as follows :—
   Highest rigidity, 473 X 10“, being that of a wire which had been
softened by heating it to redness and plunging it into water, and
which was found to be of density 8'91. Lowest rigidity 3934 x 10",
being that of a wire which had been rendered so brittle by heating
it to redness surrounded by powdered charcoal in a crucible and let
ting it cool very slowly, that it could scarcely be touched without
breaking        it,
                 and which had been found to be reduced in density by
this process to as low as 8'67 4. The wires used were all commercial
specimens—those of copper being all, or nearly all, cut from hanks
supplied        the Gutta Percha Company, having been selected as of
                by
high electric conductivity, and of good mechanical quality, for subma
rine cables.
   It ought to be remarked that the change of molecular condition
produced by permanently stretching wire or solid cylinder of metal

of the   sun S re<U+FB02>ected from the surface of the mirror.            This instru
ment has been constructed on three different principles. In Drum
mond’s (Philosophical Transactions for 1826, p. 324), by a simple
 mechanism,     a normal to the mirror is made to bisect the angle
 between the axes of two telescopes, one of which is pointed to T, and
 the other to S; consequently           will receive the light of

 directed by means of two sights attached to its support, which are
 brought into the line OT. The heliotrope employed in the Ordnance
 Survey (Ordnance '<U+FB01>igonometrical Survey of Great Britain and
 Ireland, Account of Observations and Calculations of the Principal

two sights.     In the two heliotropes invented by Gauss (Astrono
mische Nachrichten, vol. v. p. 329, and v. Zach’s Correspondance
Astronomique, vol. v. p. 374, and vol. vi. p. 65), in Steinheil’s
(Schumacher’s Jahrbuch f<U+FB01>r 1844, p. 12), and in Galton’s an
optical contrivance    is   connected with the mirror, so as to throw                     a.
cone of sunlight in direction opposite to the cone of sunlight re<U+FB02>ected
                     a
from the surface of the mirror, the axes of the two cones being
parallel, and either very nearly or absolutely coincident. Hence any
point T, from which       a  portion of the former cone of light appears
to proceed, will receive the light of the sun re<U+FB02>ected from the mirror.
    The heliotropes  I     am about to describe produce two cones of
sunlight thrown in opposite directions, like those of Gauss, Steinheil,
and Galton, but differ from them in having no moveable parts,
and from all but Galton’s, and the sextant-heliotrope                 of Gauss,
with  a  second moveable mirror, in requiring no support except the
hand of the operator.
    One of these consists of plane mirror, to an edge of which are

the face of the mirror.         Therefore,     two parallel rays fall, one on
                                                 if
the mirror, and one on either of the planes a, c, the direction of
the ray re<U+FB02>ected from the mirror will be parallel and opposite to
that of ray re<U+FB02>ected once at each of the planes a, c. When the
          a
small re<U+FB02>ectors are made of bits of unsilvered glass, the brightness
of the image of the sun       is so far reduced after the second re<U+FB02>exion,
as not to interfere with the direct vision of T, and the mirror can be
pointed without dif<U+FB01>culty.

 gent rays will make equal angles with the edge ac, and therefore with
 a normal to the faces 6, d.           Hence the portion of the incident ray
 which is re<U+FB02>ected from the mirror will proceed in a direction parallel
 and opposite     to that portion of the ray which, after internal re
 <U+FB02>exion at a and c, emerges through d.
    In order to ascertain that the construction of such an instrument
 presented no unforeseen di<U+FB02>iculties,           I  requested Mr. T. E. Butters,
 of 4, Crescent, Belvedere Road, the well-known maker of sextant
 mirrors and arti<U+FB01>cial horizons, to form the faces a, c on the edges of
 a piece of plate glass, and then had the face d coated with chemi
cally reduced silver.         Upon trial, the emergent light was found to
be too bright; but, after smoking the angle adc in the <U+FB02>ame of a
candle, in order to reduce the intensity of the light, it became per
fectly easy to make the centre of the image of the sun coincide with
the object T seen by direct vision.
    An image of the sun of suitable intensity for pointing might be
obtained by attaching to the edge of the mirror :1 piece of tinted
glass, of the form of the corner abcd, with the faces 6, d parallel to
the plane of the mirror.

          ON THE SPECTRAL RAYS OF THE PLANET SATURN.
     LETTER FROM FATHER SECCHI                 TO M. ELIE DE BEAUMONT.
   N   a communication addressed last year to the Academy, I an
     nounced that, in the spectrum of the planet Saturn, rays were ob
served di<U+FB01>'erent from those which are observed in the terrestrial
atmosphere,     and which are analogous to those of Jupiter.                This
year I have prosecuted these researches, and I have been able to con
<U+FB01>rm the accuracy of what I then stated, and to take more exact
                                    >
measurements.
    Saturn seen      through the spectroscope attached to Men’s tele
scope gives    in  the   red a. strong ray almost black, and which, when
the air is  calm,   is  perfectly    so.   This ray is the most easy to recog
nize.    On   the    side   of  the   extreme     red the spectrum is weak and
badly   limited,    but    it  permits    a  trace   of another my to be seen.
Between the red and the yellow there is a pretty well de<U+FB01>ned band,
which by its constitution suggests the band D of the telluro-atmo
spheric spectrum, but whose edges are better de<U+FB01>ned on the side of
the yellow than on the side of the red.                Beyond the yellow a trace
is seen of the region 3 of Brewster, which is nebulous in our atmo
sphere.    Lastly, bands of the rays E, b, and F of Fraunhofer are
distinguished; but they are more di<U+FB02>icult to measure, and their
position has not yet been su<U+FB01>iciently studied.
    The most interesting part was the red zone.                 T o assure myself
of its position relatively       to the   terrestrial   atmospheric bands, inde

74                  Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
pendently of the measurements of which I shall afterwards speak, I
<U+FB01>xed in the evening the slit of the micrometer which I used in
measuring Saturn's rays, and I left the instrument until morning;
I then observed our atmosphere at the horiZon.           I constantly saw
that the slit did not coincide with any of the telluric bands.        The
nearest was the atmospheric             band marked C“ by Brewster; but
generally the band of Saturn remained near the middle, between C'
and C.
   To compare Saturn with Jupiter, I used the same method.
Having <U+FB01>xed the micrometric slit on Saturn’s ray, I waited until
Jupiter rose as much as Saturn, and I then saw that the slit coin
cided sensibly with the black band of Jupiter which corresponds to
the same part of the red.         Yet Jupiter shows a brighter and more
extended red, and he has towards the extreme red a pretty feeble
band, at a distance of 1"85 of my micrometer.          In Saturn the band
is really not seen sharply in this place; but very near it the light of
the spectrum diminishes pretty perceptibly, and it appeared sepa
rated at 2"17 ; beyond that there is only a very feeble light.          Yet
spite of the dif<U+FB01>culty of taking these measures we can say that the
bands are identical.
   \Ve have, then, here a new analogy common to the two largest
stars of our planetary system, that is, an identity in their atmo
spheres.
   To give an idea of the precision which we can hope to obtain in
measurements taken with my instruments, and then to give starting
points for calculating the position of the planetary as compared with
the solar rays, I shall adduce here the measures of the principal
solar rays seen in our atmosphere at two different points in the
horizon, between which the zero of the screw of the micrometer had
been completely changed.

    From these Tables, compared together (the morning of the 24th
 must be compared with the evening of the 23rd for Saturn, and the
 morning of the 22nd with the evening of the 21st), we <U+FB01>nd for
 the sun

 and   for-Saturn
                                             5—y=1"93.
      Supposing D to be identical with 5, which cannot be far from
 the truth, we get a difference of 0"72, which exceeds all possible
errors of observation.                The mean of several measures between )1 and
C'1 is 0"51.         We are thus authorized to establish that this ray 7 of
Saturn does not coincide with any of the telluro-atmospheric bands
which we know.
    If We compare the differences between the results obtained for
the sun and for Saturn relatively to other rays, we <U+FB01>nd a systematic
difference of about 0"‘22, which, singularly enough, also obtains in
the case of Jupiter.              I do not know to what this is to be attributed,
as the difference much: exceeds probable errors.                             I had conjectured
that it might be due to the manner of observing during the night;
but this interpretation I greatly doubt.                           Hence new observations
are needed to discover the reason, which doubtless is not in the in
strument, as I at <U+FB01>rst suspected.                       But even allowing this uncertainty
to subsist, we <U+FB01>nd that the numbers for the differences and the data
of direct observation are too evident to be attributed to some error
of diversity established by the ray 7.
    Among the numerous coloured stars which [have examined, there
is one which is remarkable: it is the red star placed after Struve’s
star No. 928 in right ascension =6h'27, and in declination +38'32.
Its colour is of a reddish violet.                       In the spectrometer it exhibits
three luminous          bands—one              red,   one   yellow, and a sharply-de<U+FB01>ned
green;     and   which       are  separated by           dark  divisions.       The rest of the
spectrum      is   scarcely      visible,     and   is  suspected     rather   than   seen. This
 spectrum,      so   to   speak,      is   an  ordinary     one   cut     in the    middle.      The
 analogy     of  its  colour      with      that   of  the  electric   light  in   some   of   Geiss
 ler’s tubes led me to examine in the spectroscope one of these tubes
 which gave a, similar colour.                    I found that its spectrum also showed

76               Intelligence and JlIiscellaneoua Articles.
red,yellow, and green bands; but the blue and violet part was divided
into a great number of equal and narrow bands.      Leaving out these
bands (which might be invisible in the star), the spectrum of the
star strongly resembles that of the gas in the tube.   I do not know
what the tube contained ; but I observed that the negative pole gave
the sharp spectrum of carbon, and that there was a black powder
near the electrodes.
   These phenomena favour the opinion of those who think that part
of the luminous and obscure bands of the celestial atmosphere is not
an eli'ect of absorption, but a real radiation, as in the planetary
nebulae.
   The two coloured stars w of Bootes have given me almost conti
nuous spectra, but in which the proportion of colours was different,
the red predominating in the red, and the blue in the blue.       This
proves that these colours are not the effect of an optical contrast, as
many astronomers have supposed.-C'0mptes Rendus, June 5, 1865.
         ON THE WAVE-LENGTH                    or THE BLUE INDIUM-LINE.
                                     BY.      J. MiiLLsIt.
    MM. F. Reich and Th. Richter of Freiberg having introduced
 into the colourless <U+FB02>ame of a Bunsen’s lamp impure chloride of zinc
prepared from zinc-blende, and having examined the coloured <U+FB02>ame
thus produced by means of a prism, observed a blue line which had
not previously been noticed. A closer examination showed that this
blue line belonged toa hitherto unknown metal,to which its discoverers
gave the name Indium, and concerning which they published further
details in Erdmann and Werther’s Journal/Ur praktisclze Chemie.
    Professor Reich has been kind enough to give me a small piece
of metallic indium, as well as a small quantity of sulphide qf indium
 (which exhibits the spectral line of this metal in the most lasting
manner), in order that I might determine the wave-length of this
line.
    I have made this determination by the method and by means of
the grating which were <U+FB01>rst described in the <U+FB01>rst Part of the third

shows two blue lines, one of which, very intense, is situated close to the
blue strontium-line, but a little further towards the violet end of
the spectrum ; the other line is still more refrangible, but so much
 fainter that it cannot be perceived at all in the spectrum produced

 ON SOME THERMO-ELEMENTS                    OF GREAT ELECTROMOTIVE                  FORCE.
                                     BY.   J. STEFAN.
    lu investigating the thermo-piles constructed by Marcus, some
 minerals which werejust at hand were investigated as to their thermo
 electric deportment at high temperatures.                The method was as fol
 lows :-—-The mineral to be investigated was laid upon one end of a
 copper strip, the end of a wire laid on the mineral, and the whole
pressed by means of a clamp. This wire. and one from the free end of
 the copper strip, lead to a galvanometer with great resistance.                         The
 copper strip is heated by a spirit‘lamp <U+FB02>ame.                  In order to join any
 two minerals to a theme-element, a copper strip was laid between
them, wires laid on their most distant sides, and the whole pressed
by a wooden clamp.            The free end of the copper strip was introduced
into the <U+FB02>ame, and served therefore only as conductor of heat to the
place of contact.
    In the following recapitulation of the elements, the electropositive
body is always placed <U+FB01>rst. The number given signi<U+FB01>es how many
of the elements joined together furnish an electromotive force equal

        ON THE TERRESTRIAL              RAYS OF THE SOLAR. SPECTRUM.
                                 NOTE BY M. JANSSEN
  The memoir which I now submit to the judgment of the Aca
demy contains an exposition and discussion of observations made
during a recent journey to the Alps, of which the following is a
summary.
   On the Faulhorn I observed a general diminution of all the groups
of telluric rays of the solar spectrum, a result arising from the alti
tude of the place, and which shows the telluric origin of these lines.
On the contrary, I noticed that the lines of solar origin retained
their intensity and even gained in sharpness.       The observation of
Mr. Glaisher, who after a recent ascent stated that he saw the
rays of the solar spectrum diminish with the ascent of the balloon,
appears to me to be in opposition to facts.
   * On this occasion it may be allowed to call to recollection the remark
able but also never yet completely published observations, of which Mar
bach, in the car 1857, has given a short notice in the Comptes Rendus,
vol. xcv. p. 7 7. According to these, crystals both of iron pyrites (FeS’) and
of arsenical cobalt (CoSY-i-CoAsz) fall into two classes, not as regards their
chemical composition or crystalline form, but as regards their thermo
electric deportment.      Denoting them by a and B, Marbach gives the
following series, counting from negative to positive z—Glance-eobalt and
bismuth u; argeutine, platinum, lead, copper, brass, silver, cadmium, iron,
antimony, glance-cobalt B.
   Becquerel has recently found that snlphuret of copper (Cu2 S), formed

      On high mountains, the rays of the solar spectrum which originate
  in our atmosphere experience, during the course of the day, varia
  tions of intensity far more marked than in the plain; on the Faul
  hom I could recognize the telluric origin of important groups, the
  discrimination of which hitherto was dubious. These groups, which
  belong to the red end of the spectrum, are as follows :
      l. A portion at least of Fraunhofer's ray B, which is the least
 refrangible; the intensity of the ray forming the other portion of
 the spectrum does not enable one to state positively.
     2. The groups between B and a consist almost exclusively of tel
 luric rays.
     3. The group a is telluric; that is, the red end of the spectrum
 from B to A is ruled by rays which almost all originate in the ter
 restrial atmosphere.       The importance of the telluric phenomenon
 there is almost tenfold that of the solar phenomenon.
     I may remark here that M. Kirchhoff’s maps for the entire region
 from A to B exhibit no coincidence between the rays of the solar
 spectrum and those of metals studied by this eminent physicist.
The discovery of the telluric origin of the groups of this region
 explains this circumstance, and con<U+FB01>rms its exactitude.
     If we cast a glance at the general distribution of the telluric
 groups in the solar spectrum, we see that these groups are so much
 more important and numerous as we consider the least refrangible
portion of the solar spectrum ; the exact opposite is the case for the
rays of solar origin.
     The memoir contains an account of an experiment made on the
lake of Geneva, between Lyons and Geneva, and in which I could
con<U+FB01>rm the production of telluric groups in the spectrum of a <U+FB02>ame
which at a small distance presented none.        This experiment shows
directly the action of the elective absorption of our atmosphere.
     In reference to my former communication on this subject, Father
Secchi announced that he had observed an increased intensity in the
telluric bands on cloudy days, or when the atmosphere is whitish
and vapoury, or also, when the moon is viewed, veiled by the e<U+FB01>'ect
of vapours.      Secchi concluded from this observation, referred to that
of the spectra of the planets, the very probable existence of aqueous
vapour in the atmosphere of these stars.
     I observed on this occasion, that the results given by the analysis
of the light of clouds were in general too complicated       to elucidate
a question of this kind.       " When the atmosphere is slightly veiled
by white clouds, a given point of the heavens sends to the eye a
larger quantity of light than when the heavens are clear ; and this
light arises from multiple re<U+FB01>cxions from the aqueous particles.
Under these conditions the spectrum obtained is more luminous;
moreover it consists of rays which, in consequence of their numerous
re<U+FB02>exions, have traversed great thicknesses of the atmosphere. These
two conditions perfectly explain the easier and more marked vision
of the telluric bands which then take place.      In this case the vapour
 of the cloud has only served us re<U+FB02>ector to send to the instrument
 the rays which have traversed great thicknesses of the atmosphere;

   8O                Intellzlgerwe and Miscellaneous   Articles.
   but it would not be justi<U+FB01>able to attribute to this vapour itself the
   presence of telluric bands."
       Hence it follows from all this, that aqueous vapour in that parti
   cular physical condition in which it constitutes clouds and atmo
   spheric vapours, cannot be invoked as the cause of the telluric rays
   of the solar spectrum ; and hence the conclusion which Secchi draws
   regarding the constitution of the planetary atmosphere cannot be con
   sidered to be well founded.
       Later, in a communication on the spectrum of Jupiter, Secchi
   maintains his primary conclusion and says, “ On this occasionI have
   con<U+FB01>rmed anew the in<U+FB02>uence of fogs on the terrestrial atmospheric
   re. s.”
      yI have continued along series of observations under the most diverse
   atmOspherical circumstances,        but taking care only to use the direct
'
   light of the sun, so as not to complicate the question by these cir
   cumstances of foreign re<U+FB02>exions,         dif<U+FB01>cult to estimate, and which
   have thrown such a regrettable confusion into the observations
   of Father Sccchi.
       The whole of these observations have shown me that the vapour
   of water in the state of cloud or of atmospheric vapour did not
   appear to act*, but that it is aqueous vapour in the state of elastic
   <U+FB02>uid which has an important part in the production of the telluric
   rays of the solar spectrum.                                      I,
       For instance, on the 5th of July 1864, the weather being clear,
  pure, and hot, a telluric group measured on our scale had the inten
   sity 15, the sun being 4°‘30 above the horizon; while on the 27th of
   December, 1864, for the same height of the sun, the weather equally
   clear but so dry that the dew-point was 8° below zero, the same
  group had no more than the intensity 4 on the same scale.
      An experiment to verify this important point has recently been
  made at the central government establishment           for the construction
  of lighthouses; it has given a con<U+FB01>rmatory result; I expect to make
  it on a still more considerable scale, where the phenomenon can
  be studied as     it  deserves.
      Two    years ago, when publishing my <U+FB01>rst spectral studies on the
  earth's atmosphere, I expressed the opinion that this study would
  lead later to the knowledge of the atmospheres of planets.            I have
  at present the pleasure of seeing that this expectation is being more
  and more realized; for apart from the above facts, the recent results
  obtained by Messrs. Huggins and Miller, who have seen new rays
  in the spectra of the planets, are a con<U+FB01>rmation of these ideas.—
   Comples Rendus, January 1865.
      ’  Solar light which had traversed a fog or a mist gave me telluric rays
  no more intense than when the sky was clear, with adew-point just as high
  (other circumstances being the same).      The dew-point was determined by
  means of Regnault’s condensation hygrometer.

 XII.     On the dzferent Properties of the Heat radiated by Rough
       and by Bright Surfaces.        By Professor G. Maorws’l‘.
                                [With a Plate.]
               Sir John Leslie’s researches upon heat, it has been
 SINCE  known that metals radiate more heat when their surface
is rough than when it is bright; but this remarkable pheno
menon has not, upon the whole, been much studied, and many
questions connected with it remain still unanswered.                Melloni
and his successors have examined the heat given out by various
bodies at different temperatures; but the differences in the
radiation of one and the same body at a constant temperature,
but with different surfaces, have hitherto been very little inves
tigated.      The <U+FB01>rst question to be answered in relation to these
differences, was whether the points which a rough surface pre
sents are the cause of the increased radiation.              Melloni'l' and
Knoblauchi have shown that this is not the case, but that in
crease of radiation depends rather upon the diminution of den
sity which the surface undergoes when it is roughened in a cer
                         I
tain manner; and have myself §, as well as others before me,
pointed out that the increased radiation is to be attributed to
the state of greater subdivision of the roughened surface, as well
as to its diminished density.         Beyond this, scarcely anything is
known about the differences of radiation.

82         Prof. Magnus    on the di<U+FB02>'erent Properties  of the
rough surfaces depend upon the fact that in them the points
from which heat is radiated are more numerous? or is the inten
sity of the individual rays greater?          In other words, are the
amplitudes    of the oscillating particles  of  rough surfaces greater?
Are the rays which are given out by the two kinds of surfaces
of the same, or of di<U+FB02>'erent heat-colours?          These are questions
that have not hitherto been proposed, doubtless because their
solution presented dif<U+FB01>culties which, for the time being, it was
impossible to overcome.
    The observation which I communicated to the Academy of
 Sciences at Berlin in August last, according to which a platinum
wire, heated in the <U+FB02>ame of a Bunsen’s burner, radiates nearly
twice as much heat when it is covered with spongy platinum as
it does when the surface is bright, indicated the possibility of
answering some of these questions.           The following considera
tions served as the starting-point for this investigation.
 Transmission through various Media      of the Heat radiated  by bright
                      and by roughened     Plah'num.
    If the rays given out by the two surfaces, the roughened and
the bright platinum, were of the same wave-length and of equal
intensity, the greater heating-effect produced by the rough sur
face could be caused only by there being in it more particles by
which heat was given out.       In this case, if the rays were trans
mitted through various media the quantity absorbed would
remain always in the same proportion.            On the other hand, if
the rough surface sent out rays of a di<U+FB02>'erent wave-length from
those emitted by the bright one, we might assume that among
the different media through which the rays were caused to pass,
some would be found which would absorb these new rays in greater
proportion than the others.       The question thus came to be, to
examine and compare together the phenomena attending the
transmission through various media of the rays emitted by the
two kinds of surfaces.
   It was necessary for these experiments that the two surfaces
employed should be of exactly the same extent.              In order to
ensure this, two circular plates of 10 millims. diameter were cut,
by means of a hollow punch, from the same piece of platinum
foil, the thickness of which was 0'3 millim. Each of these
plates was fastened by three very <U+FB01>ne platinum wires to a sup
port, constructed expressly for the purpose, by means of which
they could be brought, one after the other, exactly into the same
part of the <U+FB02>ame of a Bunsen’s gas-burner.            The <U+FB02>ame of this
burner, which was supplied with gas through a regulator, was
vcry constant.      The platinum disk heated by it was placed
parallel to the front surface of the thermo-pile, and so that its

                 Heat radiated by Rough and              by   Briyht Surfaces.         83
    centre was exactly in a straight line with the axis of the pile.
    The distance of the platinum plate from the pile was 280 mil
    lims. Between them was placed a large screen with a diaphragm,
    through which the rays arrived at the thermo-pile.           The open
     ing in the screen had the same size as the radiating disk.            In
     order that none but perpendicular rays might fall upon the pile,
     a second screen was placed at a short distance from             with an     it,
    opening of the same size as the surface of the pile.          With this
    arrangement, the conical re<U+FB02>ector with which thermo-piles are
    usually provided, would not have caused any increase in the
    effect.    Indeed this was not necessary, in consequence of the
    extraordinary sensitiveness of the galvanometer employed.             The
    pile itself was placed in        large cardboard box, which had no
                                      a
    opening except that of the diaphragm just mentioned.            Its front
    surface formed      a square,  the  side  of which,  13  millims.   long,
    was but little greater than the diameter of the disk.          The back
    surface of the pile remained covered with its brass cap           and in     ;

    produced, did not then exist on the following morning.

    mirrors which      I  have previously described*,       have employed
                                                                   I

        In the <U+FB01>rst place, the two platinum disks were tried with
    bright unplatinized surfaces, in order to ascertain whether under
    these conditions they radiated equal quantities of heat to the
    pile.    When this was the case,         was certain that one occupied
                                                it
    exactly the same position as        the  other, and consequently that
    they were properly attached, as well as that the <U+FB02>ame remained
    constant.      A uniform coating of spongy platinum was then ap
    plied  to one  disk, and the radiating powers of both were afterwards
    comparedi.        The  sponge, as has been already stated, raises the

        When, however, a plate of alum was interposed, the propor
    tion of rays transmitted from the two sources became quite sur
    prisingly different—so much so, indeed, that the absolute quantity
    of heat transmitted from the platinized plate scarcely exceeded
    the quantity transmitted from the bright plate.
       It is scarcely needful to mention that the experiments were
    extended to more than one plate of alum. This appeared so much
    the more necessary, since the total quantity of heat which passes
    through alum amounts only to a few per cent.      The same result
    was always obtained with six perfectly different plates, varying
    in thickness from 1'5 millim. to 9'5 millims. With all of them

and not only is heat of new colours emitted, but also the inten
sity of some of the rays given out by the bright plate is increased
by platinizing, to a greater extent than that of others.
    \Vhich of these effects is the one really produced cannot be
decided by experiments upon absorption..                Supposing that no
rays    of different  wave-length     from   those  previously   existing are
produced,      we  might    conclude    from   the  fact  that  alum    trans
mits nearly equal quantities           of  heat  from    both  sources,   that
the intensity of those rays which are capable of travering
alum is either not increased at all, or only to a small extent,
 and therefore that this increase takes place principally in the
 other colours.
                           Prismatic Observations.
    It   seemed worth while to      try whether any further information
 could be     obtained   by means of prismatic analysis.             Such an
 analysis is best made by means of a rock'salt prism               and   rock
 salt lenses.      But inasmuch as rock-salt always absorbs some
 heat, and as it was possible that it might act upon just those
 rays with which we were here particularly concerned, the expe
 riment was performed without as well as (in order to obtain a
 better separation of the several rays) with the aid of rock-salt
 lenses.
                     Prismatic Analysis without Lenses.
    In order to make the rays fall upon the prism parallel to each
 other, several diaphragms were employed one behind another.
     Instead of the circular disks mentioned above, two strips of
 platinum, 3 millims. wide and 33 millims. long, were used as
 radiating surfaces.       Like the platinum disks, they were fastened
 vertically by    <U+FB01>ne   platinum wires in the apparatus which served
 to place them successively exactly in the same part of the <U+FB02>ame
 of a Bunsen’ s lamp. The <U+FB01>rst diaphragm was placed, at a distance
  of 60 millims. from the glowing strip, in the side of a large box,
  about 1 metre long and 0'5 metre in height, and the same in
  width.     The length of this diaphragm was the same as, and its
  width a little less than, that of the strip.         A second diaphragm
  of exactly   the  same   size was  placed   inside  the  box, at a distance
  of 100 millims. from the <U+FB01>rst, and immediately behind it was
  the rock-salt prism.        A linear thermo-pile, provided with a slit
  only 0'5 millim. wide, served to examine the various parts of the
  spectrum thus produced.
      In order to prevent the <U+FB01>rst diaphragm, the one nearest to
  the glowing strip, or more correctly its edges, getting heated, a
  double metallic screen was placed between it and the strip.
  This screen was pushed aside during the observations, and since,
  in consequence of its nearness to the <U+FB02>ame, there was danger of

           Heat Radiated by Rough and by Bright Surfaces.            87
  the hinder side as well as the front becoming heated, it was every
  now and then changed for another one.
     To begin with, the prism was removed and the rays of light
  from the glowing strip which passed through the diaphragms
  were received on a white screen.       It could thus be proved that
  the strip in the <U+FB02>ame and two diaphragms covered each other ,
  and by using both strips one after another, it was ascertained
  that one of them took exactly the same position as the other.
  The prism was then put in its place and the heating effect at the
  various parts of the spectrum determined by means of the thermo
 pile, which, by means of a contrivance passing through the side
 of the box, could be moved into different positions.         In order
 to ascertain that the effect of each strip was the same when
 their surfaces were alike, they were both tried at <U+FB01>rst with a
 bright surface.     After having found that the thermo-pile gave
 always the same de<U+FB02>ection at the same part of the spectrum,
 whichever strip was used as the radiant source, one of the strips
 was covered with platinum-sponge, and the heating effects which
 it produced at the different parts of the spectrum were deter
 mined, the thermo-pile being kept in the same position while one
 strip acted upon it after the other.
    For the sake of more convenient comparison, the results ob
tained are combined graphically, as in <U+FB01>g. 1, Plate 1.            The
 graphic representation    of the results  is got by raising perpendi
 culars from the horizontal line AB, which represent the <U+FB01>rst
 swings read off in millimetres on the scale of the galvanometer.
The distance which separates these perpendiculars is equal to
twice the amount by which the thermo-pile was displaced between
each two observations.        The curve formed by these ordinates
and abscissa: consequently represents the distribution of heat in
the spectrum.       The longer ordinates belong to the platinized
plate.    In the drawings, the observed values are connected
together by straight lines only.
    Before beginning the experiment, the pile was placed at the
limit of the visible red. The application of the name of this
colour to the ordinate whereby the de<U+FB02>ection of the galvano
meter is represented for this part, is consequently justi<U+FB01>ed by
observation.     The same is true of the yellow; the other colours
of the spectrum could not be distinctly observed.
    Afterwards, in order to get a better separation of the several
colours, lenses of rock-salt were employed.
                   Prismatic Analysis with Lenses.
    The rays given out by the glowing strip fell <U+FB01>rst upon a slit
1 millim. in width, which was applied          to the side of the box
above mentioned.       Behind this there was placed, inside the box,

88           Prof. Magnus   on the di<U+FB02>m'mt Properties           of the
a  rock-salt lens at the distance of its focal length, so that the
rays fell parallel upon the prism placed a short distance behind
it. Behind the prism was another lens, in the focus of which
the spectrum was formed.      The spectrum was narrow, its visible
coloured portion having a width of only 4 or 5 millims. In order
to examine its various parts, the linear pile with a slit of 0'5
millim. was used. In other respects the same precautions were
adopted as in the experiments without lenses—the strips being
<U+FB01>rst compared before being platinized, one of them being plati
nized after they had been found to be equal, and the effect of
both being then observed.
   The results that were obtained are represented graphically in
the same manner as the preceding ones.      Figs. 2 to 5 show some
of the curves obtained.    In constructing them, the de<U+FB02>ections of
the galvanometer read off in millimetres, reduced to two~thirds
of their length, are laid down as ordinates.      The abScissa: are
four times as great as the distances between the several positions
of the pile in the spectrum*.
   In consequence of the <U+FB02>ame radiating heat, as well as the
strips, the effect which it alone produced was determined a few
times, the bright and the platinized platinum and the <U+FB02>ame alone
being successively allowed to act.     In <U+FB01>g. 2 the smallest ordi
nates represent the action of the <U+FB02>ame alone.       If these are de
ducted from the ordinates which denote the effect of the <U+FB02>ame
and the bright platinum, and of the <U+FB02>ame and platinized plati
num, the difference in the action of the two platinum surfaces
is seen to be still greater.     Fig. 6 represents the curves of
these differences as they result from the values given in <U+FB01>e. 2.
                                 Conclusions.
     All   these curves show that the maximum              heating e<U+FB02>'ect falls
in the dark part of the spectrum, that          is,
                                            beyond the red, and
all of them                                      This maximum                  is in
                 itnearly at the same point.
                      is

                                                           it   is
one.   In all cases the increase of radiation shown       the plati  by
nized plate takes place principally   in the non-luminous part of
the spectrum; so far as the coloured portion of the spectrum
extends, the heating caused          by

      we calculate the quantity of heat in the coloured portion
of the two spectra, as far as the limit of the red, as given in
<U+FB01>g. 6, we <U+FB01>nd that for the bright plate it amounts to 0'1 of
the total quantity; but for the platiuized plate it amounts to
only 0'068.
   The heat-spectra of both the strips are probably continuous.
It is nevertheless possible that they are broken at particular
points, and that the missing portions, on account of their small
width, elude detection by the thermo-pile.            If, however, we pro
ceed on the assumption that they are continuous                (that     is,
                                                                         that
throughout    the    whole   space   within   whicha    rise of  temperature
can be detected, rays of all wave-lengths are present without
any breaks),   it   follows that the heat emitted            by
                                                              the platinized
platinum contains no rays of different wave-lengths from those
contained in the heat radiated          by   the bright platinum; for          if
it were  otherwise,     the  distance  to  which   the spectra of the two
sources extend would be different; and this             is not the case.
   Since the absolute quantities of heat from both sources, which
a plate of alum allows to pass, are very nearly the same,              seems
                                                                        it
probable   that    the   wave-lengths    transmitted         by
                                                              this substance
are those which lie towards the blue side of the spectrum, since
these are given out in nearly equal quantities               by
                                                             the bright and
by  the platinized platinum.
   Hitherto I    have not succeeded in directly proving that this              is
the case—namely, that       it    isthe rays belonging to the coloured
portion  of the   spectrum,    or  those   lying nearest to       it,
                                                                   which are
transmitted    in    the  greatest proportion      by  alum;     for when      a
plate of alum was interposed in         the   experiments with the rock
salt prism, the de<U+FB02>ections were so slight, in consequence of the
small quantity of heat which passed through, that no certain
conclusion could be drawn.
   It is, however, rendered probable,         by   Jamin and Masson’s*
investigations    into   the distribution   of heat in the solar spectrum,
that the rays from incandescent platinum, which would                     by

ference be transmitted       by  a plate of alum, belong to the coloured
portion of the spectrum, just as in the case of solar heat. These
 gentlemen in fact caused the rays of the solar spectrum to tra
Versc plates of rock-salt, glass, and alum, each of the same thick
ness, and found that the rays belonging to the dark part of the
 spectrum passed through glass in much smaller proportion than
 they do through rock-salt, and that the quantity which passes

    90        Prof. Magnus    on the di<U+FB01>‘erent Properties  of the
   through alum is still smaller than that which traverses glass;
   but, on the other hand, they found that all three substances
   transmitted the heat-rays of the coloured portion of the spec
   trum almost equally well.
       Thus much at any rate results from the experiments that
   have been mentioned :—
       That the increased radiation which a plate prlotinum shows at
   the same temperature when its surface is roughened does not result
  from a uniform increase in the intensity of all the rays which it emits,
   but that the rays whose intensity is increased to the greatest extent
   lie in the red part of the spectrum and near to it on the dark side.
      Only the amplitudes of the oscillations are altered, not their
  rate; for, were this to be changed, new wave-lengths would be
  produced.      But so far as the above-mentioned prismatic investi
  gations extend, this does not take place ; for the heat-spectra of
  both the bright and the platinized platinum have the same extent.
      In consequence of the toughening of the surface, the ampli
  tudes of the oscillations are altered, but not the times in which they
  take place.
     Diminished [ntmsity    of Light with  increased radiation  of Heat.
      It  surprises one that the platinized plate, which gives out
  nearly twice as much heat as the bright plate, is not more lumi
 nous than the latter.       On the contrary, the intensity of the light
 which it radiated seemed always less than that of the light from
 the bright plate; and in like manner the spectrum of the pla
 tinized platinum was much less luminous than that of the
 bright platinum. It is true that the mass of the platinum strip
 is increased by platinizing, and that its bulk likewise is enlarged,
 so that it might be supposed it would be less heated; but this
 cannot be the case ; for when the thickness of the bright strip is
 increased throughout, or when thicker pieces of platinum are
 stuck on particular parts, the light which these give is no less
than that from the thinner portions.           The radiation of heat by
a thick piece of the platinum is also the same as that of a thinner
piece.      If a plate of platinum is platinized on one side only, as
was the case in almost all the experiments mentioned above, not
onl the platinized side, but the bright side also appears darker ;
and, if platinum-sponge is deposited upon certain parts only of a
bright strip, these parts can be detected on the other side as
darker patches when the platinum is made incandescent, just as
though it were thereby rendered transparent.            But bright pla
tinum attached to various parts of a bright strip cannot be de
tected upon the other side.
     If a thin strip of platinum, bright on both sides, is coated on
one side with platinum-sponge,        the side which remains bright

               Heat radiated         by Rough and by    Bright Swfaces.            91
now radiates less heat than before.    And if a strip, already pla
tiuized on one side is platinized on the other side also, the radia
tion of the <U+FB01>rst side is diminished.   This can only be explained
by supposing that the strip, notwithstanding that it is entirely
surrounded by the <U+FB02>ame, has, in consequence of its increased
radiation, a somewhat lower temperature at its outer surface.
There thus occurs a transformation of light into heat, in so far
as, in consequence of the greater radiation, the temperature of
the radiating surface falls, and thereby the intensity of the light
is   diminished.
   If we fasten to a thin strip of platinum, which is bright on
both sides and heated to redness in a <U+FB02>ame, a second thin strip
platinized on one side, in such a manner that the platinized side
is outwards,    the double strip appears darker than before: the
change is chie<U+FB02>y apparent on the platinized side of the second
strip, but it is perceptible also on the outer bright surface of the
<U+FB01>rst strip.   But if the second strip is now turned round with its
platinized  side   inwards, both sides of the double strip appear
luminous again.
Comparison         of the Spectra of Luminous and Non-luminous Flames.
   The great illuminating power which a non-luminous <U+FB02>ame
acquires when a little soda or some other salt is put into        sug        it,
gested the supposition that, in proportion as the intensity of the
light increases, so might also the heat be augmented.        It true          is
that  I  have already mentioned on        previous occasion*, that
                                                    a                               a
<U+FB02>ame rendered luminous                       by
                                   soda does not radiate more heat
than when          not luminous. This, however, might be caused
                  it   is
 by the intensity of the heat-rays being diminished in the same
proportion as that of the luminous rays          increased.
                                                          is Whether
it    the case that-the heat augments uniformly with the light,
     is
must be ascertained                 by
                            examining the heat-spectra of the same
<U+FB02>ame in its luminous and non-luminous conditions.
   The <U+FB02>ame of Bunsen’ burner radiates, however, in any case
                            a            s
not     large quantity of heat, and of this only small proportion
         a                                                       a
is contained in the coloured part of the spectrum; so that the
heating effect in the luminous portion further than the red was
so small that      could not be perceived.
                       it                      This, however, does not
 prevent the soda-<U+FB02>ame being compared with the non-lumi
nous <U+FB02>ame for    ;    the radiation of heat increases at the same rate
                            if
as the radiation of light, or at anything near the same rate, the
 heating effect of the soda-<U+FB02>ame must increase to such an extent
 in the yellow as to become perceptible.         But, as have found, I
 this     not the case. In order further to ascertain the relation

92              Prof. Magnus   on the di<U+FB01>‘erent Properties   of the
  in which the other rays, especially the non-luminous rays, of the
  two <U+FB02>ames stand to each other, I have compared together their
  spectra, and found them alike throughout their whole extent. If
  there do exist any differences, they lie within the limits of the
 errors of observation.     It is of course understood that the proper
  precautions must be taken in these experiments to prevent rays
 falling upon the thermo-pile from the solid or liquid soda, or
 from the platinum wire on which it is supported.            Care must
 likewise be taken that the extent of radiating surface is the
 same in the luminous and non-luminous <U+FB02>ames; for the intro
 duction of the soda alters the size and form of the <U+FB02>ame; and
 hence, if we were to compare the entire <U+FB02>ames by letting them
 radiate into the conical re<U+FB02>ector of the thermo-pile, the radiating
 surface of the luminous <U+FB02>ame being greater than that of the
 non-luminous one, more rays will fall into the cone, although no
 more heat is produced.
    The same thing applies to the comparison of a <U+FB02>ame rendered
 luminous by the presence of carbon, with the non-luminous <U+FB02>ame
 of a Bunsen’s burner.      In consequence of the gas being already
 mixed with atmospheric air when it issues from the opening of
 the burner, the <U+FB02>ame is smaller than when the lower holes of the
 burner are closed so that the air has access only to the outside
of the <U+FB02>ame, and consequently the carbon which is separated at
 the inside cannot burn till it gets to the edges of the <U+FB02>ame.
If,  however, the heat-spectra of equal-sized portions of the lumi
nous and non-luminous <U+FB02>ames are compared, the two are found
                                            -
to be exactly alike.
    The greater part of the heat which the <U+FB02>ames give out lies
beyond the red      and
                    ;     it   not surprising that in this dark portion
                               is
of the spectrum the intensity should be the same for both <U+FB02>ames;
but   it   astonishing that, with such
           is                              great difference
                                           a                   the illu

 minating power, the heating effect should remain the same.
    At the <U+FB01>rst glance this result may seem surprising; for           it   is
Well known that the solid particles of soda or carbon, which im
part luminosity to the <U+FB02>ame, radiate more heat than the gaseous
particles.    But when we consider the small amount of these par
ticles, the smallest trace of which suf<U+FB01>ces to give the greatest bril
liancy to the <U+FB02>ame—when we also consider that these particles
are ever being renewed, and that their heat must be imparted to
them       by
           the <U+FB02>ame itself,      no longer appears strange that the

                                               the two <U+FB02>ames should
be so small as to escape observation.      The extraordinary increase
in the radiation of light, which this small amount of solid parti
cles occasions, remains, however, on this account only so much
the more remarkable.

                           Concluding Remarks.
    It is well known that Melloni, at the beginning of his inves
tigations, concluded from the fact which he was the <U+FB01>rst to ob
serve, namely that light and heat are transmitted in quite unequal
proportions by one and the same substance, that these two agents
were not identical.      Later on, this view was abandoned by him ;
nevertheless I am not of opinion that M ellcni regarded heat and
light as identical, for he speaks only of the
                                                  “ lien le plus puissant
qui réunisse ensemble ces deum grands agents de la nature *.
                                                                 ”
    If it is desired to raise the question of the identity of heat and
light, it appears to me that the points of difference between heat
and light must <U+FB01>rst of all be distinctly stated.
    It is well known that, in order to account for the propagation
of heat across empty space, it is necessary to assume, as in the
ease of light, the existence of an tether which pervades all space,
and by the motions of which this propagation takes place; and
the simplest assumption is that both light and heat are propa
gated by means of the same tether.            When the heat-motions
have arrived at a distant body, they set the :ether which this con
tains in corresponding movement, provided it is capable of assu
ming it.     The questions as to what is the nature of these move
ments, and how they differ from those which constitute light,
must for the present remain unanswered. The heat-movements,
however, have the effect of altering the position of the parts of
the body to which they are communicated.           For every body upon
which rays of heat fall is thereby caused to expand, and thus the
relative position of its parts is changed.      The only casein which
the rays would occasion no elevation of temperature, and conse
quently no change in the position of the parts, would be if the rays
fell upon a perfectly diathermanous substance.           But a perfectly
diathermanous body does not exist ; for even atmospheric air does
not allow all the rays of heat to pass through it perfectly.            If
we compare herewith the motions which constitute light, we <U+FB01>nd
that their effects are quite di<U+FB02>'erent. It is true that there is no such
thing as a perfectly transparent substance, and it would hence
appear possible for light to act on the particles of bodies; but
no such action has hitherto been observed, except in so far as light
can occasion chemical combination, and can produce <U+FB02>uorescence
and phosphorescence.         In these phenomena, the motions of the
material particles, although there can be no doubt of their exist
 ence, have as yet entirely eluded direct observation.          The cha
racteristic distinction between the movements which constitute
 light and those which constitute heat may accordingly be stated

thus :—the latter cause perceptible alterations in the relative
 positions of the parts of bodies upon which they act, while the
former do not produce this effect.
    The longer the rays of heat act upon a body, the more it ex
 pands.    The change in the position of its particles is accordingly
 a function of the time.       But for a given value of the motion im
 parted to a body, that     is,  for
                                   a    given intensity of the radiating
 body, the position of the parts of the body on which the radia
 tion falls can only be altered up to certain limit. For the body
                                         a
 which receives the radiation can never become hotter than that
 from which        receives its heat.
                  it                     In most cases, indeed,       itonly
 acquires   alower    temperature  than   the latter, sinceit   is
                                                                constantly
 radiating off into the surrounding space some of the heat                 it
 receives.    It only in the case where this heat given out ex
                   is                                    is
 clusively towards the radiating body—when, for instance, the
 latter as  it were completely surrounds the body towards which            it
 radiates—that this acquires the same temperature as the radiating
 body, since in' this case it   gives out no more heat than      itreceives.
    A portion of the motion which        is    imparted   to
                                                           a  heated   body
is  then constantly being given off to the surrounding space, or,
 more correctly, to the surrounding tether; and its temperature
 can only remain constant when the circumstances are such that
a  body loses exactly the same quantity of motion as             receives.
                                                                it
    We are not acquainted with any similar communication of
motion in the case of light.          The illuminated body may re<U+FB02>ect
light,  or  it may    absorbit,  but
                                   it    does not thereby become self
luminous,     with   the exception   of such bodies as become phospho
rescent or <U+FB02>uorescent     by   insolation.
    The motion of the parts of body, which the rays of heat fall
                                   a
ing upon     it produce, consequently always reproduces motion of
material parts; for the heated body,          by  giving out heat again to
other bodies, warms them and occasions motion of their parts.
It    isprecisely in consequence of this communication of motion
to the material parts of bodies that heat can transform itself into
work, and can conversely be reproduced from work.
    In this communication of motion,         it   isremarkable that, how
ever various may be the heat-colour of the rays which fall upon
a  body,   italways gives out, when thus heated, the heat-colours
which are peculiar to itself.        In the case of light, we <U+FB01>nd some
thing analogous in relation to <U+FB02>uorescence; for body <U+FB01>uorcsces
                                                       a
with the colour peculiar to its own substance, and therefore dif
ferent from the colour which falls upon it.
    Hence, in discussing the identity of heat and light, we must
<U+FB01>rst of all keep in mind that heat depends upon motions of ma
terial particles, or of the aether which intervenes between them,
thus causing      a separation of the material particles of bodies 0

 take place;     while the motions which constitute light are not
 capable   of producing such changes. If it does act upon the
 material   particles of bodies, its action is at any rate essentially
 different from that of heat ; for light does not cause such a sepa
 ration of the material particles as to produce expansion.
    As the temperature of a body rises, the number of heat-colours
which it gives out increases, and at a certain temperature it
 begins to radiate light, at <U+FB01>rst red light, which has the greatest
 wave-length; and as the temperature becomes still higher, new
 waves are added until the body appears white-hot.           The appear
 ance of new wave-lengths appears to depend upon the fact that,
with the increased expansion of the body, or, what is the same
thing, with the increased distances between its material particles,
the particles    of aether which     intervene between these, and per
haps also the material         particles themselves, are able to make ‘
continually new and more rapid movements.
    Notwithstanding the difference between heat and light, the
 question may be raised whether both e<U+FB01>'ects are not produced by
one and the same source, something in the same way as electri
city and magnetism result from a common force—or, to express
it in another way, whether the same movements are capable of
rendering themselves perceptible both as light and as heat.
    In the case of light, we know that it consists of transverse vi
brations ; and the polarization of heat necessitates the conclusion
that in it also transverse oscillations are present.        It is likewise
quite possible that our eye, in consequence of its peculiar nature,
may perceive, as extremely great, alterations of these transverse
oscillations which are not capable of producing perceptible ther_
mal changes, so that the intensity of light of the same wave
length may become very great, without our being able to detect
a change of heating-effect.         But whether the same movement is
in reality perceived by us both as light and as heat, is a point
which requires further investigation.

 that these ideas are in accordance with the conception of the constitution

    We have thus far had no occasion to introduce arbitrary hypo
 theses, but have in fact discarded those hitherto in vogue, as
 that of the permanent polarity of atoms, and various hypotheses
 as to  the mode by which such polarity is constituted and main
 tained.   It will be seen that in the wide <U+FB01>eld we are now enter

of its origin, and the grand simplicity of its evolution.       From
the point of view now taken, this truth, which has long been
discerned with more or less distinctness, stands forth in its full
proportions.     In the discussion of speci<U+FB01>c properties of different

   Preparatory to the discussion of this topic, it is important to
inquire more minutely than has hitherto been done into the
electric condition of molecules, both simple and compound.

 upon the same by the entire atmosphere.        The centres of repul
 sion and attraction will also be coincident, and the law of varia
 tion of the two forces will be the same; hence beyond the limits
 of the atmosphere there will be no effective action exerted
 by the molecule upon any electric aether that may be posited
 there.     But the notion that there is no interception of force
 does not accord with the fundamental idea of the propagation
 of force by the universal aether (p. 96). It is impossible that a
 propagated force of repulsion should take effect upon an ato
 mette of electric tether, unless the universal tether, which is the
 medium of propagation, be in some degree condensed upon the
 surface upon which the wave-force falls. Such condensation must
 give rise to a re<U+FB02>ex wave, and the dispersion of a certain amount
 of force into the surrounding aether.. Upon the principle of the
 conservation of force the amount of force thus dispersed must be
 abstracted from the original wave-force.      Now, if the atomettes
 of the electric atmosphere intercept a certain portion of the re
 pulsion propagated from other atomettes, it follows that the
 centre of repulsion of the whole atmosphere cannot be coinci
 dent with the centre of attraction, or centre of the atom of mat
 ter.    It would seem also that the repulsive pulses propagated
 from the atomettes should be more or less intercepted by the
 central atom of the molecule, which should tend to displace the
 centre of repulsion still more.     For each side of the molecule
 this centre must lie somewhere between the centre of the atom
 and the surface of the atmosphere, as at       <U+FB01>g. 4.

 the sameseuse    hereafter, unless the exception is distinctly speci<U+FB01>ed.
    The outer electric envelopes of molecules serve to establish
 an electric communication between them, and play an important
 part in all electric phenomena. By their pressure upon the inner
 envelopes, or the atmospheres so called, of the molecules, they
 develope a force of electric repulsion exerted outward at the sur
 face of each atmosphere.         This is the force already recognized
 as one of the molecular forces (p.
                                            196).    It has its immediate
 origin in the compression of the atmosphere at or near its sur~
 face, by the outer envelope, which increases the repulsive action
 of the upper portion of the atmosphere, and so brings into ope
 ration an effective repulsion at this surface, where otherwise the
 effective force would be zero.         It is to be borne in mind that
 the attraction of the central atom is dynamical in its effects, and
that attendant upon its exertion the outer envelopes will have
 an inward and outward movement;               but such alternate move
 ments will, when propagated outward, neutralize each other’s
effects, unless a secondary force is developed in the process.
 Now it is precisely such a force that is developed in the manner
just explained ; and this must be propagated by the electric aether
of the outer envelope, or the interstitial electric azther of bpdies,
as a wave-force*.
    We have seen that the attraction exerted by the atom upon
its atmosphere proper, by forcing outward a portion of the uni
versal aether near the surface of the atom, developes at the same
time an effective molecular attractive force, and what we have
called the force of heat-repulsion.         From the difference that ob
tains in the circumstances under which these forces and the
above-mentioned force of electric repulsion originate, it is highly
probable that their constants (n and m, p. 200) would be different.

brium by their mutual actions, and let us inquire
into the condition of the electric aether on the
line crossing perpendicularly the line of their
centres, at its middle point m. At m the attrac
tions of the two molecules for an atom of electric
aether there will neutralize each other ; but at all
other points of this line the resultant of the

Accordingly the value of the                                 (p. 199) depends
not only upon the attractive force, size, and perhaps other peculiarities of
the central atom, but also upon the amount of heat received from all ex
traneous sources.     External forces of compression or extension, applied to
a body, also tend to augment or diminish the value of m.

attractions will have a <U+FB01>nite value, and be directed inward to
ward the line of the centres.             This resultant will increase in
value as the distance from the line of the centres increases,
to a certain point n, beyond which it will decrease.                 The sum
of all these resultants will act as a compressing            force   upon the
electric nether about m, and determine its density at that point.
At other points, as e, r, s, variously situated in the vicinity of
the molecules, the joint attraction of the two will generally exceed
the attraction of either molecule alone.              It follows, therefore,
that the two united molecules will be surrounded by an electric
atmosphere of their own, spherical or spheroidal in form, and at
the same time that the two individual atmospheres will be
materially modi<U+FB01>ed.         This atmosphere will have an outer enve
lope, as in the case of a simple molecule.
    If we suppose several molecules thus united, the entire group
will have its own proper atmosphere. The extent of this atmo
sphere will depend upon the normal attraction at the surface of
the group ; and this will also determine the density of the elec
tric aether in the interstices between the molecules*.
    Let us next inquire into the true nature of the electric polari
zation of molecules.
   A molecule becomes polarized whenever, from any cause, a
portion of its electric atmosphere is urged around from one side
to the opposite side,—where there is an excess the polarity
being positive, and where there is a de<U+FB01>ciency, negative.                But it
is especially important to observe that the act of polarization is
distinct from the result.         The one is dynamical, the other stati
cal.    The act of polarization, too, does not consist simply in a
<U+FB02>ow of a certain amount of electric aether from the one side to
the other of the atom ; in addition to this, a certain quantity of
   ' In treating brie<U+FB02>y of solidi<U+FB01>cation (p. 383 seqq.), our attention was con
<U+FB01>ned chie<U+FB02>y to the union of simple molecules in one homogeneous mass;
but there is good reason to believe that in most cases of solidi<U+FB01>cation, with
the exception     erha s of that of perfect crystallization, compound mole
cules are <U+FB01>rst orme , and that these combine in various modes to form the
solid.   In every such instance the formation of such groups of molecules
should be attended with the evolution of heat.       This will be the inevitable
result of the compression of                wther  between  the combining mo
                               the electric
lecules (<U+FB01>g. 5), whether the indmdual atmospheres be compressed or not.
   The heatof combustion and of chemical union generally, has in all pro
bability a similar origin—that is, in a compression of the electric mthcr
between the molecules, or in such a compression combined with a contrac
tion of the individual atmos heres.      This topic, and the probable cause of
the different effects observe   in different instances of combination, will be
brie<U+FB02>y considered under the head of chemical union.
   The varied forms of crystallization assumed by different substances,
under similar circumstances, are probably due in a great degree to the di
versity that obtains in the number and grouping of the individual molecules
of which the ultimate compound molecules consist.

the aather is detached or expelled from the atmosphere on the
positive side, and a corresponding amount absorbed into it on the
negative side. Accordingly, when a molecule is being polarized or
when   its polarization is increasing, there is a <U+FB02>ow of electric tPfht-‘T
toward its negative side, and away from its positive side.       On the
other hand, when a polarization once acquired is falling <U+FB02>,   0  there  is
a <U+FB02>ow, or an electric current, in the opposite direction. To make this
more evident, let S (<U+FB01>g. 6) be a                   Fig 6_
surface receiving a charge of po
sitive electricity, and a, b, c, &c.
a series of particles of a dielectric
medium.       The repulsion of the
positive charge on S will polarize
the nearer side of a negatively,
and the further side positively ; but the same force will urge the
interstitial aather toward a, and the augmented attraction of the
negative side of a will add a certain portion of it to the atmo
sphere of a.      At the same time the excess of electric 33tth accu
mulated on the further side of a will act repulsiver upon the
upper portion of its atmosphere and expel a certain portion of
it. It will also urge toward b the interstitial electric aether
 between a and b, and polarize b just as S has polarized a. The
chain of particles will therefore become polarized in succession;
and at the same time there will be an electric movement, a dis
charge from one to another.           To take a more complete view of
the matter, the molecular polarization resulting from the elec
tricity received by any single point S will not be con<U+FB01>ned to
the normal line a, b, c, but will extend, though with diminished
intensity, along lines radiating outward from S. A similar
remark may be made of the <U+FB02>ow of electricity that accompanies
the polarization.
    If we take account of the entire spherical surface S, and sup
pose it to be surrounded by a dielectric medium, as the air, ex
 tending to an inde<U+FB01>nite distance, each new addition to its positive
charge will develope a wave of increasing molecular polarization,
which will be propagated in all directions outward through the
surrounding medium. This wave, if it may be so termed, will be
accompanied by a spherical electric
                                           “ wave of translation ” that
will spread inde<U+FB01>nitely through the same medium. This latter
wave will consist of a series of discharges from one spherical
layer of particles to the next, while the former will consist of
propagated movements con<U+FB01>ned to the atmospheres of the parti
cles—these movements being produced by the repulsive action
of the electric acther accumulating on the further sides of the
particles, transmitted primarily through the universal aether. The
quantity of electricity that moves forward from one layer of par

ticles to the next should be equal to the quantity received by
the surface; for the determining cause of the electric wave of
translation lies in the fact that the force of tension of the propa
gated electricity urges this quantity between the surface and the
<U+FB01>rst layer of the medium.
    The tension of the electricity received results from the com
pression produced by the expansive action of the charge, which
is ultimately in equilibrium with the force by which the dis
turbed atmospheres of the medium tend to return to their ori
ginal condition. The tendency of the free electricity to escape
between and around the polarized molecules of the medium is
counteracted, as will soon be seen, by a resistance developed by
the polarization.
    This we conceive to be the true process of induction.      It will
be readily perceived that it is in entire conformity with the expe
rimental results obtained by Faraday, and in accordance with
his theoretical ideas of the general nature of the process.
    We have supposed the clectrized surface to be surrounded by
a single dielectric medium extending inde<U+FB01>nitely; but the result
would be essentially the same if the waves were propagated
through several such media, as air, glasa, See. If we suppose the
<U+FB01>rst medium to be replaced by another, while the entire quan
tity of electricity propagated by      it,
                                         as the polarization of the
 medium goes on, should remain the same, as Faraday has shown
that  it actually does,   does not follow that the <U+FB01>nal degree of
                         it
polarization received will be the same as before.     In this respect
substances may differ, or they may have different “speci<U+FB01>c in
ductive capacities,” as maintained      by
                                         Faraday.    It in fact just
                                                            is
this difference of property that constitutes the difference between
conduction and non-conduction, or between the different degrees
of conduction or of non-conduction.
    So long as the charge of electricity on the surface          S,
                                                               <U+FB01>g.    6,
 remains the same, the degree of polarization of the surrounding
 medium or media will continue the same; but           the charge be
                                                       if
 drawn off, waves of decreasing polarization will be propagated
outward from    S, which will be accompanied      byelectric waves of
translation <U+FB02>owing inward toward S.         The entire process that
went on within the medium while the body was receiving its
charge will now be exactly reversed.
    If we suppose body to receive charge. of negative electri
                     a                 a
city, the process will also be reversed, as when    a charge of posi
tive electricityis withdrawn.     The <U+FB01>nal result will be that the
particles of the surrounding dielectric medium will be positively
polarized on the side toward the electrized surface, and there
will be de<U+FB01>ciency of electric acther betwcen the surface and the
           a

   Conduction.—\Ve have seen that the act of polarization com
prises two different processes—a movement of a certain portion
of the wther of the atmosphere of a molecule from one side to
another, and contemporaneously with this a discharge of tether
from the one side, and an absorption of a corresponding quan
tity upon the other side.   Now the electric constitution of two
different bodies may be such that with the one the same amount
of electric movement from particle to particle may be accom
panied by a feeble degree of polarization, and with the other
by a much greeter degree.     The polarization is a change deter
mined originally by the forces propagated by the universal
aather, while the outward <U+FB02>ow of the electricity is partly the
result of the mutual repulsion between contiguous atoms of the
electric     aether.
    Let us suppose two extreme cases compatible with our gene
ral theory.     (1) Let there be an inde<U+FB01>nite line of molecules,
such that the density of the aather between them is the same as
at the surface of the molecular atmospheres, and suppose a
quantity of free electricity to arrive at one end of this line.      It
is plain that the repulsive energy of this electricity will urge
before it a certain quantity of electricity throughout the whole
length of the line, and that if the <U+FB02>ow be unchecked it can exert
little or no disturbing action upon the molecular atmospheres
except very near their surface, and cannot polarize them. To do
this, the moving electricity must have a certain decided tension—
that   is,be present in    certain suf<U+FB01>cient quantity at each point
                             a
of the line.    This would be the case of perfect, or nearly perfect
conduction, and there would be little or no polarization of the
molecules.     (2) Let us suppose that the density of the electric
tether     very feeble between the molecules; there being now no
           is
continuous mass of tether to give way before the electricity re
ceived at the end, the latter will, as    <U+FB01>rst effect, exert its repul
                                                a
sive action through the universal aether upon the atmospheres of
the nearer molecules and polarize them, and this will extend
through the line, and the polarization will determine the dis
charge in the manner already explained.           This would be the
case of    anon-conducting dielectric medium.        In all actual    in
stances of good conduction the case lies between these two ex
tremes: the greater part of the electric movement              con<U+FB01>ned
                                                                is
to the outer envelope of the atmosphere, and the outer portion
of the inner envelope; and the polarization resulting from the
disturbance of the lower envelope, or the atmosphere proper,           is
slight. With non-conductors, or poor conductors, the <U+FB02>ow near
the surface of the lower envelope, around the molecule, resulting
from the direct repulsive action (or elastic tension) of the electric
aether,     comparatively slight and the polarization of the lower
           is                          ;

envelope, with the attendant discharge on the further side and
absorption on the nearer side, is much greater*.
    To obtain a more distinct idea of the entire process of imper
fect conduction, we must take account of
a certain resistance which a polarized m0
lecule offers to the <U+FB02>ow of aether around it
from the negative to the positive side-1'.
Let a, <U+FB01>g. 7, be a polarized molecule. The
centre of repulsion of its electric atmo
sphere will fall at some point 0 on the
plus side of the centre. If we inquire into
the effective action of the molecule upon a
mass of electric aether posited at s, mid
way between 12 and n, if the atmosphere
were not disturbed the centre of effective repulsion would fall at
r; in its supposed polarized condition, therefore, it will lie at
some point m intermediate between r and 0.                     The two forces
exerted upon 3 would therefore act in the direction shown in the
<U+FB01>gure, and their resultant would act from s toward 1.                  It will be
readily    seen   that   at  all points    between   1;  and   n, the  resultant
will have a tangential component directed toward n, and a nor
mal component acting outward on the positive side, and inward
on the negative side of the molecule.               The density of the elec
tric aether at 11 should therefore be greater than at p; and while
by its elastic tension it is urged around toward p. it is resisted
by the tangential force just spoken of.                And so if the electric
aether above 11 is urged by the repulsion of free electricity on
that side of the molecule around toward p, it has to overcome
this resistance.       It is to be observed that the attractive or com
    * In the comparison made on p. 426, between the propagation of heat
and the propagation of electricity, it is intimated that each is promoted by
a polarization of the molecules.      This is true only in a limited sense.   The
circumstances most favourable in general to a conduction of either electri
 city or heat are a uniformly dense condition of the interstitial electric
 aethcr, which may serve as a medium for the direct propagation of the waves
or pulses, and such a condition of the electric atmospheres of the molecules
that the resistance developed by any polarization that may ensue shall be
comparatively feeble (see next page). When, however, the direct conduc
tive action, by the intervention of the interstitial electric mther, is feeble, a
 greater facility of polarization on the part of the individual molecules would
promote the discharge from molecule to molecule.
    1- The terms negative and positive, as here used, have reference to the
 polarization simply, which is a change in the distribution of the electric
 asther in the lower portion of the atmosphere.      It willbe seen in the sequel,
that in the upper portions through which the free electricity moves, when
 a conducting dischar e occurs, there will be an excess of electric tether. or
 a positive state, on t is side of the molecule which is negatively polarized,
 and a de<U+FB01>ciency or a negative state on the opposite side.

pressing action about a is but the result of the repulsive energy
of the free electricity which has determined the polarization.
    The outer circle in the <U+FB01>gure represents the surface of the
undisturbed atmosphere (inner envelope). When the molecule
becomes polarized, the surface of its atmosphere takes, or tends
to take, the spheroidal form, with the centre of <U+FB01>gure lying on
the side negatively polarized.         At points near this surface, about
midway     between    pand    n,   and  inde<U+FB01>nitely beyond the surface,
there will be a resultant force,       as  shown in the <U+FB01>gure, tending
to check the <U+FB02>ow of free electricity around or past the molecule,
in the direction of n toward )1.
    It does not follow, because the lines of direction of the attrac
tion and repulsion meet at 8 under a small angle, that the result~
ant s t may not be equal to, or greater than, the force of tension
of the free electricity that may reach the molecule, since the
 absolute intensities of these forces must be very great. Besides,
 whatever may be the intensity of this resultant, it must be of a
 corresponding order of magnitude with the tension of free' elec
 tricity, since it is precisely the resistance exerted by the polarized
 molecules of air contiguous to an electrized surface that deter
 mines the tension of the statical electricity collected upon it.
     \Vhen a discharge takes place through an imperfect conductor,
 as rare<U+FB01>ed air, the contiguous particles of air are <U+FB01>rst polarized
 by the repulsion of the electrized surface propagated by the uni
 versal aether.    This determines the escaping electricity to fall
 upon    their nearer   negative sides; the molecular resistance con
 sidered above then comes into play ; and if the elastic tension of               '
 the electricity is suf<U+FB01>cient to overcome this resistance, a conduct_
 ing discharge takes place; otherwise the electric movement can
 only be after the manner explained on p. lOl—that               is, as in the
  process   of  induction.     According      to  these   views,  the  greater
  resistance offered   by  dense than rare<U+FB01>ed air    is    to be explained  b
  the smaller number of resisting particles encountered         in  the latter,
  togetherwith the diminished resistanceof each particle. For will     it
  be evident, on referring to <U+FB01>g.    7,  that
                                            if   the molecular atm0sphere
  expands,   as  itwillif  the   air be   rare<U+FB01>ed,   the resistance at s   will
  be diminished.      Thus air rare<U+FB01>ed to        a    certain degree should
  become     aconductor of electricity.        For similar reason the sur

  faces of solid or liquid bodies      should    conduct electricity better
  than the internal portions, since the molecular atmospheres are
  more expanded there*.           It will also be observed,   in   view of the
  results obtained, that imperfect conduction and non-conduction
  depend upon certain e<U+FB02>’ects resulting from the polarization of

 molecules, and that non-conductors may become imperfect con
 ductors if the tension of the charge presented to them be suf<U+FB01>
 cient.    But it should not be overlooked that the amount of
 polarization induced, and therefore of the resistance resulting
 from   it, must depend upon the condition of the interstitial elec
 tric tether (p. 101) and the distance between the molecules,
 since the interval of time in which the repulsive impulses propa
 gated   by  the universal aether may come into action before the
electric mther impelled from the one molecule to the next shall
begin to take decided effect must depend upon these two parti
culars.     The quality of conduction or non-conduction of sub       a
stance should therefore depend to          certain degree upon the mode
                                                a
 of aggregation of the particles, more especially as different
groups of particles, or compound molecules (p. 99), may offer
different degrees of resistance.
   If   an insulated metallic ball, a, be placed in good conducting
communication with the ground and afterward with the charged
prime conductor of an electrical machine, the electricity will <U+FB02>ow
freely along the route thus opened, and, the tension of the acther
 passing over        being very feeble, there will be no percep

give rise to electric waves proceeding outward from             it(p. 101),
and at the same time polarize the particles of the surrounding
air.    As consequence,

react upon the air-particles between the two balls, increasing
their polarization, and upon the nearer parts of a, drawing more
electricity to them.      All these changes will be attended with in
creasing    wave   movements and increasing discharges from one
particle of air to another along the line between the nearest
points of the balls.     The electric nether in transitu between the
air-particles on this line may thus come to have suf<U+FB01>cient density
to establish certain degree of conducting communication between
                  a
the two bodies, and so to convey          sudden conductive discharge

along this line.      This result will be partially due to the lateral
expansion which the free electricity received by the air-particles
0n the line will occasion in their electric atmospheres.            There
will be two causes in operation to produce this effect—the pres
sure of the stream of aether passing from one particle to the neXt,
against the atmosphere upon which it falls, and the mutual repul
sion of the particles that will thus become momentarily over
charged.     We have seen (p. 105) that such lateral expansion
would give rise to a diminution in the resisting force of the pola
rized molecules.
   As the positive electricity which thus passes over to b spreads
over its surface, it partially neutralizes its negative state, and
thus tends to check the <U+FB02>ow and interrupt the passage of the
spark.    There is also a sudden diminution in the tension of the
electricity received bya from the prime c0nduct0r,which is another
cause of this interruption.          Apparently another cause conspi
ring  with  these   two  is  a reaction  to the sudden lateral expansion
above mentioned.          If a were previously charged and insulated
and b brought continually nearer to            it, the mutual inductive
action of the two balls upon each other would initiate the elec
tric movement above alluded to through the intervening                air,
which would <U+FB01>nally result in the passage of          a spark.
   The light of the spark results in part from the vibratory
movements    in    the atmospheres of the air-molecules attendant
upon the discharge. (See p. 430.) Experiments              by Riess, Mas;
son, and other physicists have conclusively established that the
electric light is   partially due to the passage of highly luminous
metallic particles from the positive to the negative surface. The
detachment of such particles, as one result of the discharge, may
be explained      by the discharges, or <U+FB02>ow, of electricity that must
take place directly through the ball       a   when the conductive dis
charge from   a   to   6 occurs.    This follows from the fact that the
electricity within the ball    is    no longer in equilibrium under the
action of the electrical shell that surrounds        it, and the impulses
conveyed by     the   electric  current  should  tend  to detach the par
ticles at the end of the metallic line through the ball.              The
luminosity of the detached particles           is  to be ascribed to the
vibratory movements imparted          by    the discharge to the electric
atmospheres     of  the  particles.
    Excitation    of Electricity—There are various special modes of
exciting electricity   ;  but they are all only so many different modes
of polarizing contiguous molecules, or, more comprehensively,
of effecting certain disturbances in the equilibrium of electric
 atmospheres.        The different special causes of disturbance in
 these cases may all be traced to some action of the molecular

108               Prof. Norton        on iWIolecular    Physics.
forces or of heat; and, as we have seen (p. 196), heat is also,in
its primary origin, one of the molecular forces.
    Frictional Electricity—The surface of one body should not in
its natural condition exercise any sensible direct electric action
upon that of another, unless they are brought into close proxi
mity—certainly much nearer than in any ordinary case of mere
contact (see p. 98 and Table 1.).              \thn, however, two dis
similar surfaces are pressed together, especially if they are brought
within the limits at which a force of adhesion would come into
operation, the unequal molecular forces of the dissimilar parti
cles might, as will be seen in another connexion (p. 109), give
rise to a polarization of the particles.        The development of such
polarization should establish a wave movement entirely through
the two bodies (p. 101) ; and, as the result, the surface tmvard
which the <U+FB02>ow occurred might have an excess of free electricity,
while it would be negatively polarized (p. 105) ; that                    is,
                                                                  the outer
envelopes    would   on   the outer side of the molecules have an ex
cess of electricity, and on the inner          ade<U+FB01>ciency.    The reverse
would be true of the other surface. This            the probable explana
                                                       is
tion of the electrical excitement which may be obtained in feeble               a
degree by simple pressure, as in the experiment by Haiiy, of
pressing the smooth surfaces of fragments of calcareous spar,
quartz, &c. between the <U+FB01>ngers.            But the process of excitation
 by  friction seems to be different.        The most notable distinction
to be perceived between the act of rubbing and that of pressure
is,  that in the former alone the protuberant parts of the two
surfaces are pressed against each other laterally. The probabi
lity, then, is  that this lateral pressure of the surface-particles                      is
the immediate cause of the development of electricity                   the         by
rubbing of one surface over another.            Now        easy to see that
                                                            it   is
this pressure should tend to compress the electric atmospheres
of the particles laterally, and so to produce an accumulation of
electric tether on their outer sides, and         discharge from thence
                                                   a
toward the other surface.        If the surfaces be dissimilar in nature
or condition, the effects of this sort of action should be unequal;
and the result should be that upon the one surface there would
be an excess of electricity,         and upon the other         de<U+FB01>ciency.
                                                                      a
The particles of each body,    if    non-conductors, should also become
polarized after the same manner essentially as already explained
(p. 100), and     in  this condition would serve to retain the sur
faces in their disturbed           state (p. 104).      The explanation

roughness of surface may be explained in a similar manner.
    The tension of the electricity obtained should depend upon
the degree of polarization which the surface-molecules are ena
bled to retain ; for upon this will depend the limit of the resist—
ance which they are capable of offering to the free <U+FB02>ow of the
electricity from molecule to molecule (p. 105). It should there
fore be independent of the velocity, the pressure, and the extent
of the rubbing surfaces, as established by Peclet. The electrical
state of the surface, whether positive or negative, must depend
upon the mutual relations of the surfaces, and the comparative
energy of the disturbing force in operation upon each (p. 108).
    Voltaic Electricity.—In entering upon this topic, we must <U+FB01>rst
endeavour to obtain, from our present point of view, an insight
into the nature of chemical union.       When two dissimilar mole
cules, a and b, are brought into close proximity, the effective
action of a upon the atmosphere of b may be quite di<U+FB02>'erent in                 '
amount from that exerted by b upon the atmosphere of a*. As a
consequence, the relative condition of these atmospheres may be
disturbed ; in other words, they may become polarized.            As the
 act of polarization proceeds, an electric current, or series of
 waves (p. 101), will pass through the two molecules, and at the
 same time they will approach each other.         As this approxima
tion continues the density of the electric aether between them
 will increase   (p. 99, <U+FB01>g. 5), and     atrue electric or conducting
 union may thus be established between them.               Under these
 circumstances,  it   would seem that <U+FB01>nally the non-conducting
 resistance offered    bythe polarized molecules (p. 104) should be
in   a great degree   overcome,   a comparative equilibrium of ten
 sion be established   between  the  outer envelopes of the two atmo
 spheres, and, as  a   consequence, the polarization materially de
 crease  ifnot ultimately disappear.     In this event the <U+FB01>nal union
 would be due chie<U+FB02>y, or entirely, to the molecular attraction
 proper, as in the case of similar molecules.            It in this <U+FB01>nal
                                                              is
 condition essentially   that we  suppose    particle
                                             a        of water  to exist.
 The two constituent molecules, oxygen and hydrogen, are not
 polarized, or but feebly so; and they are to        acertain degree in
 conducting communication with each other'l'.
        disturbing action from the molecular attraction may even come into
  *    A
operation when the molecules are beyond the range of effective attraction
—that is, beyond 00, <U+FB01>g.    1. For     to be observed that, in the action of
                                  it
                                  is
each molecule upon the atmosphere of the next, the attractive impulses
prevail over the repulsive beyond Oc as well as between 0a and 00.
  1' It not absolutely essential to the explanation of the voltaic current
           is
that the two molecules, when combined, should be regarded as devoid of
polarization.                                      ‘
  According to the received theory of the constitution of      amolecule of

110                Prof. Norton      on Molecular Physics.
    In  developing the theory of the voltaic current, let us con<U+FB01>ne
our attention to the case of a single cell, consisting of water, or
acidulated water, between a plate of zinc and a plate of copper.
We must suppose that the <U+FB01>rst effect is a mutual polarizing
action between a molecule of zinc and one of oxygen, the former
being brought into the positive state, and the latter into the
negative state, upon the contiguous surfaces.                The attraction
thus developed will arrange the oxygen, with its associate hy
drogen-molecule, on a line normal to the surface of the zinc plate.
The further surface of the molecule of hydrogen will be brought
to the same positively polarized state as the zinc plate, and will
act in a similar manner upon the next particle of water; and so
on from one particle to another until a complete chain of polar
ized molecules extends to the copper plate.
     In this chain, as <U+FB01>rst established, we regard each particle of
oxygen as in the negative state on the side nearest to the zinc,
and each associate particle of hydrogen as in the positive state on
its further side, or at least that they are brought essentially into
this condition, and that the true polarization of the contiguous
sides is comparatively feeble, by reason of the conducting com
munication between them, resulting from the condensed state of
the electric tether by which they are electrically connected (p. 99).
 Not only does the positive repulsion that originates at the zinc
plate establish, by induction, a chain of polarized water-particles,
 in which the further or hydrogen side is in the same positive
 state as the zinc, but it also tends to increase the density of the
electric tether posited between the oxygen and hydrogen of the
individual water-particles of this chain, and so to urge them
 asunder*.       Before the closing of the circuit, while the mutual
 polarizing    action   between the zinc and oxygen is in continual
operation,     waves  of   positive electricity spread in an inde<U+FB01>nite
water, we must regard the molecule of hydrogen that combines with a
 molecule of oxygen as compound, and composed of two simple molecules
 (p. 99, <U+FB01>g. 5); but this in no degree affects the explanation to be given;
 for the compound molecule, as it is not decomposed, comports itself
throughout essentially as a simple molecule would under like circumstances.
It is to be observed that the process of polarization above considered does
not occasion an excess of electric azther upon the entire molecule of the one
substance, and a de<U+FB01>ciency on the entire molecule of the other, since, when
a molecule becomes polarized, it absorbs upon the one side the same amount
of electric rather that it gives o<U+FB01>‘ from the other side (p. 100).
    In all these remarks the term molecule is used in the same sense as
 heretofore.
    * If the constituent molecules of each water-particle were not in
                                                                         con
ducting communication, then the action transmitted along the line would
serve to polarize these molecules, and thus to bind them more closely rather
than to separate them. This objection seems to hold against Sehiinbein’s
theory.

on that side   of the plate (p. 101).     A corresponding series of
negative  waves   spread  in every direction   through the zinc plate
and the media lying without             it,
                                    the electric movement in these
being toward the zinc plate.        When the two plates are pro
vided with wires leading aWay from them, we have evidence of
this wave movement, and of the polarization that has attended                  it,
in the positive and negative states of the ends of the wires. Now
if the ends of these two wires be brought together, the entire
series of waves which pass through the copper and zinc plates are
condensed, so to speak, upon the wires, and pass through the
circuit.   The entire quantity of electricity that would be dissi
pated from the copper plates        thus brought round to the zinc
                                        is
plate again.    The arrival of this electricity intensi<U+FB01>es the polari
zing action going on at the zinc plate, and hastens the union of
the zinc and oxygen molecules.           also determines,
                                              It             not before

established, the completion of the line of polarized water-parti
cles traversing the cell.    As soon as this takes place, the waves
that before spread through the cell are converted into linear
currents.    At the same time, the electricity discharged from the
zinc to the oxygen passes over                by
                                          conduction to its associate
hydrogen-molecule, and             by
                                its impulsive and repulsive action
urges the latter over to the next particle of oxygen in the
chain.    This particle of hydrogen, with its charge of positive
electricity thus received, acts upon the second particle of oxygen
in the same manner that the zinc acted upon the <U+FB01>rst, and so on
throughout the chain.        As the detached hydrogen-particle                 is
made,    by the same force which detached             it,
                                                   to attract the next
oxygen-particle more energetically, there may be no material
movement of the common centre of gravity of any of the pairs
of particles that are separating or uniting.
   The explanation     of the voltaic current that has now been
given seems to accord with the established laws and phenomena
of the current.    The prima      electromotive force must consist in
the energy of the natural pdlhrizing or chemical action* exerted
between the zinc and the oxygen-molecule, diminished               any   by
Opposing action of the same nature that may be in operation at
the copper plate.     It follows from the principles of induction
laid down on      101, that the quantity of electricity in circula
                 p.
tion, or the intensity of the current, must be the same at all
points of the circuit.    The period of time which the zinc and
Oxygen-particles occupy in combining should be proportional to
the length of the entire circuit, supposing          to be of the same

                    “ reduced” length of the circuit. During this
portional to the
period all the electricity set in motion by the union of the two
particles should pass through the circuit, or, more strictly, be
                                                                   “ waves
urged forward past each point of the circuit, in electric
of translation.” The quantity of electricity that moves forward
in a given time should then be inversely proportional to the
length of the circuit, other things being the same.            The reason
that the quantity of electricity, or the intensity of the current,
is proportional to the area of the cross section of the wire      is,  pro
bably, that the number of points of the zinc plate which are con
temporaneously in action, with the same degree of energy, would
be proportional to this cross section.           The tension of the elec
tricity circulating   in  the  current    should   be the greatest where
the velocity of the individual particles of the aether      is   the least.
Possible retardations result from the electric relations of conti
guous molecules in the line being such that they become more or
less polarized, and so offer      a  resistance to the free <U+FB02>ow of the
electricity (p. 104),     besides  that    the process of polarization  is
attended with    a   retardation.      The    degree of polarization that
exists at any point of the current serves as         a    measure of the
“resistance” experienced        by  the current there.
    If an electrolyte be disposed between the ends of the wires, the
theory of its electrolysis   is   similar to that of the decomposition
of the water   in  the  cell.  The    only difference is  that the ends of
the wires are brought      by  the electromotive force into the same
positive and negative states which the natural chemical action
in the cell determines upon the zinc and copper plates.
    When two or more cells are employed, the natural polarizing
action at each zinc plate should be enhanced, and the tension of
the free electricity at the ends of the wires of the broken cir
cuit should be augmented.          Hence there should be more ener
                                                            a
getic force to polarize and decompose an electrolyte interposed
between the ends of the wires. But          it  does not follow that when
only good   conducting     wires are   employed    to complete the circuit
the intensity    of  the   current   will   be  augmented   by  increasing
the number of cells; since the principal retardation of the <U+FB02>ow
occurs in the cells, and this increases in the same proportion
with the number of cells. (See Pouillet, Eléments de Physique,

   The heat developed in the voltaic current         to be ascribed to

of the molecular absorption     and subsequent radiation of the
:ethereal pulses of radiant heat, already given (p. 426).     \Vhen
 the condition of things is such that the particles in the circuit
 become polarized, a greater amount of heat should be developed,
because a part of the electric movement within the molecular
atmospheres, which was before con<U+FB01>ned to their upper portions,
now occurs at greater depths, where the universal aether is more
dense.    Thus, when the resistance to the passage of the current
becomes greater, more heat is developed.         Heat may also be
evolved, under special circumstances, as a consequence of a com
pression of the molecular atmospheres produced by the current.
    We shall see, in the remaining portion of this memoir, that it
is to these same impulses of the moving' electric upon the universal
other that are to be ascribed all the external actions of the cur
rent—as attracting or repelling wires conveying currents in the
same direction with the given current or in the opposite direc
tion, giving motion to the magnetic needle, developing mag
netic or diamagnetic currents in the compound molecules of
adjacent    masses,  and inducing currents in wires or metallic
bodies in the vicinity.

XIV. Demonstration of Newton’s Rule for determining the num

  formerly      Professor of Mathematics in Betfast College*.
      REQUEST     permission to submit the following investigation
1      to the examination of the readers of this Journal for the
following reasons.
                    ’
   In ‘ The Times of June 28 there appeared an article, in large
t pe, headed “A Mathematical Discovery,” which announced
that Professor Sylvester had succeeded in demonstrating what
everybody else had failed in their attempts to prove, namely,
Newton’s Rule for Imaginary Roots, and that he would expound
his views in a Lecture to be delivered that evening at King’s
College.
    I was present at the Lecture, and felt it to be due to myself
to draw Professor Sylvester’ s attention to the fact that a demon
stration of the Rule in question was published, so long ago as
the year 1843, in a tract of mine entitled
                                             “ Researches respect
ing the Imaginary-Roots of Numerical Equations.”         He stated,
in reply, that my investigation was, like all that had preceded
it,  a failure:   was no proof at all.

      Now    if any ofthese limiting cubics indicate imaginary roots
when tested      by the  criteria in the margin above, we may be sure
  that imaginary roots exist also in the primitive equation.            But
  since only one pair of imaginary roots can enter a cubic equation,
  it follows, that whether the criterion of imaginary roots be satis
 <U+FB01>ed by the <U+FB01>rst three terms of any of the above cubics, or by the
  last three, or by both sets of three, one pair of imaginary roots,
 and one pair only, is necessarily implied.          Upon examining the
 coef<U+FB01>cients of these cubics, we see that the <U+FB01>rst three terms of
 each have a common factor; so that in applying the criterion to
 these three this common factor may be suppressed.                 Let the
 common factor, namely (Tl—3) in the second cubic, be sup
 pressed; then the product of the <U+FB01>rst and third coef<U+FB01>cients will
 be 2 .3*(n-—l)(n—2)A|As,          and the square of the middle coef<U+FB01>
 cient will be 2*. 3’(n—2)’A9’.         But these are the same results
 as we should get by employing,            in like manner, but without
 suppressing    the  common     factor, the  last three coef<U+FB01>cients of the
 preceding cubic; and we see the same to be true of the cubics
 following; that           is,
                           the criterion of imaginary roots be satis<U+FB01>ed
                             if
 by   the last three terms of one cubic,          must be satis<U+FB01>ed
                                                 it                      the         by

the condition         by
                      any two consecutive sets of three terms implies,
of necessity, but one pair of imaginary roots in the primitive.
     We thus arrive at the following conclusions, namely :—
   1.    If the <U+FB01>rst three terms in the <U+FB01>rst cubic (or indeed in any
cubic) satisfy the criterion, we may infer the existence of one
pair of imaginary roots in the primitive equation.
     2. If the next set, the last three terms of the same cubic, also
satisfy the criterion, the circumstance supplies no additional in
formation;       it   is
                      merely      repetition of what had already been
                                     a
indicated, inasmuch as more than                 single pair of imagina

the following set of three (the leading terms of the next cubic)
must    of necessity satisfy the criterion      and so on, till we arrive at

116     Prof. Young                on the Demonstration          of Newton’s Rule for
a set   of three terms for which the condition fails, thus putting
a stop to the series  of concurring indications, and preparing the
 way for new, distinct, and independent indications.
    [Now it is to be specially noticed that the last set of three
terms in any of the cubics is not in the slightest degree in<U+FB02>u
enced, as to their satisfying the criterion or not, by the <U+FB01>rst set
in that cubic: the two sets, as to this criterion, are wholly inde
pendent; if both sets satisfy                it,
                                     they do so quite independently
of each other. But the case            very different as respects the
                                               is
last set in one cubic and the <U+FB01>rst in the cubic next following.
The condition       satis<U+FB01>ed or not,
                    is                   this set, accordingly as
                                                      in                                   it    is
satis<U+FB01>ed or not in the preceding set.       This distinction between
the two cases      it  of importance to observe and attend to: the
                            is
last set     any cubic, as to satisfying or not the condition of
             in
 imaginary roots, has nothing whatever to do with any preceding
 set;   it  totally independent of and unintluenced
             is                                               all ante            by
 cedent results    and
                   ;       the last set in any cubic
                                   if                 should   indicate
imaginary roots as well as the <U+FB01>rst set in that cubic, eVerybody
knows that, in the process of developing the real root, the indi
cation would disappear from the <U+FB01>nal terms, but would still be
retained in the leading terms.       Yet       the <U+FB01>nal set, and that
                                                           it   is
<U+FB01>nal set alone, that determines the character of the leading set
in the cubic next following; so that whatever this character may
be, no feature of      can possibly have been transmitted to                               it,
                           by it
                                                                      as
from an origin,       any antecedent leading set whatever.      Having
interpolated these remarks,         now proceed to the third con
                                           I
clusion.]
   3. So soon as the criterion        again satis<U+FB01>ed, the condition
                                                 is
being entirely independent     of and  non-concurring with the for
mer,  must  imply another and distinct pair of imaginary roots in
the primitive equation, and so on, to the end of the series of cubics.
   The criterion which     here supposed to be applied to the terms,
                                      is
taken three at    time, of the successive cubics, supplies, one after
                   a
another, the entire series of conditions given in the margin above,
as Will be seen presently.     But as the last three terms of any
cubic always transfer their character, as respects the ful<U+FB01>lment
or non-ful<U+FB01>lment of the condition, to the three leading terms of
the cubic next following, the repetitions may be omitted. Attend
ing to this, and applying the proper criterion to each of the fore
gomg cubics in succession, we have the following conditions for
imaginary roots :—namely,

and so on.     And if from these inequalities the factors common
to each side be expunged, the conditions will be the same as those
already given previously in the margin.
    It follows from what has now been shown—(l) That com
mencing with the second coef<U+FB01>cient of an equation, as the mid
dle one of the leading three, and applying to those three the
proper test given in the margin above, then, with the third
coef<U+FB01>cient taken as middle term, applying in like manner the
suitable test, and so on till we arrive at a case of failure, we
may conclude that, up to this point, the existence of one pair of
imaginary roots, but not of more than one pair, has been detected.
(2) That the case of failure thus arrived at is entirely independent
of the preceding conclusion; that it is wholly unin<U+FB02>uenced by,
and distinct from, every antecedent condition; the indications
of the imaginary pair, previously detected, have ceased to be
                                                 it if,
 transmitted; and that therefore       after passing this stage, an
other indication present itself,       must imply another pair of
 imaginary   roots.      would[Ihere  refer to the remarks interpo
 lated above, and direct attention to the fact that the failure
 here adverted to would, in the limiting cubics, necessarily origi
 nate in the <U+FB01>nal terms, and not in the leading terms of       cubic.     a
 By altering the last term of cubic we could make the condi
                                           a
 tion of imaginary roots to either hold or fail, in reference to the
 <U+FB01>nal set of three, as we please, without at all disturbing ante
 cedent conditions—a clear proof that the condition implied in‘
 that <U+FB01>nal three      quite independent of the antecedent condi
                         is
 tions; but we could not alter as we please any term of leading           a
  set without disturbing (that             is,
                                   without absolutely reversing) the
immediately preceding condition.]
   Such, then,    my demonstration of Newton’s Rule for detect.
                        is
ing Imaginary   Roots  in an equation with numerical coef<U+FB01>cients.

XV.    Observations on the Polarization of the Atmosphere, made
    at St. Andrews in 1841, 1842, 184-3, 184-4, and 1845.            By
 7  Sir DAVID Basws'rsa,        K.H., D.C.L., F.R.S.,    Q'c<U+FB01>‘
                               [was  a rim. 1
      URING      the last half century observations on the polariza
         tion of the atmosphere were made by several eminent
observers—by Arago, Delezenne, Babinet, and Zantedeschi; but
no result of special importance was obtained till Arago made the
great discovery that there existed in the atmosphere a point or
spot in which there is no polarization.         At sunrise or sunset he
found that this neutral point was 20° or 30° above the point
opposite to the sun, or what we may call the Antisolar point.
The name of Arago’s neutral point has been given to this spot
without polarization.       It is best seen after sunset. At St. An
drews it is above the horizon all the day, between the middle of
Nowmber and the end of January.
    In the year 1840 M. Babinet made the next important disco
very respecting the polarization of the atmosphere.          When on a
visit to the sea-coast, he discovered that there'was a neutral point
as far above the sun as Arago’s neutral point was above the
antisolar point-1'.    To this spot the name of Babinet’s neutral
point   has  been  given.     It is most distinctly seen immediately
after sunset, but is much fainter than the other, on account of
the discoloration of the sky by the yellow light of the setting sun.
    Upon hearing of this discovery, I saw that we had now the
elements for determining         the laws of the polarization of the
atmosphere;     and   being   ambitions   of succeeding in such an in
quiry,   I devoted  four  years  to the  study of the subject.
    My observations commenced on the 28th of April, 1841 ; and
I  made many hundred on the position of the two neutral points
--on their change of place under di<U+FB02>'erent states of the weather,
di<U+FB02>'erent degrees of transparency in the atmosphere, different
degrees of light in the sky, and different altitudes of the sun.
I  measured also the maximum polarization of the atmosphere in
different azimuths betWeen that which passed through the sun
and the zenith and that which at sunset passed through the
sun and the boriZon.        These observations were not dif<U+FB01>cult to
make when the sky was clear and blue; but in studying the
part of the atmosphere between the sun and the horizdn,            I was
perplexed beyond measure with the feeble and uncertain indica

                 On the Polarization            of the   Atmosphere.               119
tions of the polariscope.   The sky between the sun and the
horizon is always the most impure portion of it; and the <U+FB02>ood
of light streaming from the sun unfits the eye for detecting faint
traces of colour.     Theoretical considerations     had led me to
believe that a neutral point should be found between the sun
and the horizon, and certain indications of the polariscope, at
places around it probable locality, entitled me to infer that it
did exist; but as an inference was not satisfactory, I watched
every favourable state of the sky in the hope of obtaining a more
direct result.
   An opportunity of doing this at last presented itself to me on
the 28th of February, 184-2, when the sun was in the meridian
with an altitude of 22°.    The spot beneath the sun was fortu
nately visible from the end of a long dark passage running
north and south, and having concealed the sun himself, and
every part around him except the probable position of the spot,
Iobtained‘a most distinct view of the new neutral point, situated
about l5° or 16° below the sun.          After communicating this
discovery to M. Babiuet early in 1845, he made several ineffec

tral point.    Following the  usual  practice, the French have given
to this spot the name of Brewster’s neutral point (p. 128).

           ANTISOLAR
                POINT
  With    these  three elements of atmospherical polarization,
shown   in <U+FB01>g.    1,
                   Ishall now proceed to determine their position
in relation to the sun and the antisolar point, and ascertain the
changes which they undergo from variations in the optical and
meteorological state of the atmosphere.
              Observations on Arago’s Neutral Point.
  In  observing the different neutral points,   employed chie<U+FB02>y
                                                             I
Savart’s band polariscope, which  was kindly presented to me                        by

120                   Sir David Brewster          on the    Polarization
 M. Babinet.    It consists of two plates of           Fig
rock crystal   which  give a system of rec
tilineal polarized bands*, attached to an
analyzing plate of tourmaline.      In very
feeble lights I used another instrument,
in which the analyzer was a Nicol’s prism.
 When the polariscope is directed to a
                                                               '
neutral point, the system of fringes is in-
terrnpted, as shown in <U+FB01>g. 2 at N P. The
bands on one side of the interruption are                   t                 i
oppositely polarized to those on the other,
the central band in the one being black, and in the other while.
    In order to measure the altitude of the neutral point thus ob
 served, I used a common quadrant with a plumbline, which gave
within half a degree the altitude of the centre of the neutral point.
 In order to obtain the heightof the neutral point above the sun,
or the antisolar point, it was necessary to have the sun’s altitude,
or his depression beneath the horizon.      Having asked Professor
Henderson for the easiest method of obtaining these with a
moderate degree of accuracy, he recommended to me to use
Margett’s Longitude Tables, from which they were accordingly
taken.
    The following observations are a selection of some of the most
important out of a very great number recorded in my journal T.
In order not to crowd the page with <U+FB01>gures, I have given only the
hour of observation, and the altitude of the neutral point above
the antisolar point, and occasionally the maximum polarizationI.

    When the        sea horizon  was terminated by a dark purple belt
about 115° above        it,I observed   that the Vertical bands of the
polariscopc became brighter over that belt.
    The same phenomenon was seen, but less distinctly, over the
land horizon.         It was dif<U+FB01>cult to measure the amount of this
new polarizing in<U+FB02>uence, but               was obvious that we should

belt.    111 this case      would eclipse, as

was obvious also that when the negative or oppositely polarized
bands came over the belt, the new polarizing _intluence would
extinguish them where they had the same polarizing force, and
form  a  secondary neutral point, the primary one being then out
of the belt.
    On the 8th of June, 1841, at 5h 50m P.M., when the polarized
bands were strongest, both on the land and sea horizon,            watched

weaker than in the horizon.           We had now the singular pheno
menon of neutral point with positive polarization on each side
              a
of it. When this phenomenon was more fully developed under
a  favourable state of the horizon, the positive polarization was
overcome       bythe advancing negative polarization.        The negative
polarization was then immediately below the ascending neutral
point; but at certain distance

negative polarization was compensated

   1842, February 22.—Both on this day and on the 13th, the
neutral point was above the horizon, though not visible, being
eclipsed or masked by the cause which produces the secondary
neutral point.     Over a space of 3§° above the sea, the positive
bands almost wholly disappear before the negative bands are
perceptible, and the neutral point is 5° high when the secon
dary neutral point is distinct in the sea horizon.
   Although        I
                  have observed the secondary neutral point more
than twenty-two times, it has generally appeared under slightly
different forms, varying with the intensity of the new polarizing
cause which produces               it,
                              and with the point of the horizon where
the neutral point    rises.

        is                                                          shall        I
mention only an observation made on the 21st of April, 1849,
under very favourable circumstances.             At 611 22‘“, when the
primary   neutral  point  was   about  150  high,  the secondary neutral
point  was  2° 50'  high,   the  negativs  bands  covering    space of 8°   a
or 9° between them, the positive bands being above the sea-line.
A  fog prevailed to some extent, and above the sea-line there was
the dark purplish belt previously mentioned, over which the
positive bands were stronger than on the part of the sky above it.

  It  is not until more than <U+FB01>fty years later that we <U+FB01>nd the
proposal made to revive the use of mercury for the purpose of
exhausting, by the construction of a special instrument.
                                                              This
proposal proceeded from the celebrated theosophist Emmanuel
SwedenbOrg, who has described it in his Miscellanea observata
circa res naturales et pnesertim circa mineralia, ignem el montium
strata, published at Leipsic in 1722.                         _
                                                             With
   SWedenborg’s pump consisted essentially of a little table
three long legs, which carried the glass bell-jar that was to be
exhausted, and was connected below with an iron vessel, from
which descended perpendicularly an iron tube which was joined
by a <U+FB02>exible tube of leather with a second iron tube. By placing
this moveable tube upright or laying it down, the mercury which
<U+FB01>lled both tubes was made to rise and fall, and thus the iron
Vessel, which was provided with the needl'ul valves, was alters
nately <U+FB01>lled with the liquid metal and emptied.
   This is the same principle as that employed by Joseph Baader
in his second mercurial pump ; be, however, improved the con
struction by substituting a metal elbow-joint for Swedenborg’s
leather tube, but does not appear to have had any knowledge of
the ides of the latteri‘. In his <U+FB01>rst pump, which he had de‘
 scribed in 1784 in Hiibner’s Physikalisches Taschenbuck,    the
 descending  and ascending  tubes were connected together immo
veably', and the lowering of the mercury in the exhausting-resa
sel was caused by letting the proper quantity of the metal run
out through a cock placed at the lower part of the bend of the
tubes.   By pouring into the upright tube, after shutting the
cock, the mercury that had run out, and opening the exhaust;
ing vessel so that the air which had been drawn in might escape,
the original   state   of things
                             was reproduced.
   These pumps, however, which, so far as appears, were never com
structed by their originators, have not met with the acceptance
of physicists; and the     same remark applies to all the pumps
which have been successively either proposed or actually com
structed by Hintenburg, Michel, Cazalet, Kemp, Edelcrants, Pat~
ten, Oeehsle, Romershausen, Uthe, Mile, Kravogl, and others,
in most of which the mercury was moved by means of a piston.
    It is only recently that the mercurial air-pump has attained a
 better reputation, since the skilful glass-worker, Geissler of
'Bonn, has employed it in the preparation of the exhausted tubes
 with which his name is connected, and has by means of it ob
 tained a more perfect vacuum than could be produced by the
 best piston-pump.

                       the    Mercurial Air-pump.                       131
    Geissler’s pump, which <U+FB01>rst became known to the general
public through Dr. Theodore Meyer’s pamphlet on the strati<U+FB01>ed
electriclight, published here [in Berlin] in 1858, does not differ
in principle from Swedenborg’s, but its form is better adapted
to its special purpose.        With the exception of the caoutchonc
tube, which is substituted for Swedenborg’s leather joint, it is
made entirely of glass ; and in all that relates to the connexion
with the pump of the tubes to be exhausted, and the introduc
tion and drying of different kinds of gas, its construction dis
plays great neatness and sklll.          The contrivance for raising and
lowering the moveable tube, however, is but rough and liable to
be easily put out of order.            This operation was at <U+FB01>rst per
formed entirely by hand;          but   the use of a glass tube and a
charge of from 30 to 40 pounds of quicksilver being found too
troublesome and dangerous to be managed in this way, it was
afterwards done by help of a Windlass.
    Quite recently Geissler of Berlin has constructed pumps of a'
smaller pattern, containing only 15 pounds of mercury, in which
the two glass tubes are replaced by a long and strong tube of
caoutchouc, which connects the oval exhausting-vessel with a
glass globe of the same capacity.           The operation of exhaustion
is performed by hand, by alternately placing the glass globe upon
the foot-board and upon a stand                   near the pump.      This
arrangement      is  certainly simple,    placed
                                            at must  excite  some   appre
hension as to how long the caoutchouc tube will last; besides,
working the pump requires the exertion of a not inconsiderable
amount of force, and may easily expose the apparatus to danger.
    A mercurial pump, however constructed,            is,  on account of
its slow working, only adapted to exhaust vessels of small ca
pacity; and although for these        it    may afford a   better vacuum,
it   will  never    displace   the  common      air-pump from physical
cabinets.
    This conviction, together with the circumstance that now-a
days every physicist     is   already provided with an air-pump, in
duced me in the course of last summer to consider whether                it
was not possible so to modify the mercurial pump as to make
it  an appendage to the common pump, which might, according
to circumstances, be either used in conjunction with           it or sepa
rated from it.
    The execution of this idea presents no practical dif<U+FB01>culty,
 does not increase the price of the instrument, allows       it to be con-'
 structed   of any required size,   and    makes the  operation of exhaus
 tion perfectly easy and free from danger.
    In order to be able to speak upon the subject from experi
 ence,
     I    have had such an auxiliary instrument made as             a trial,
 and, as was to be foreseen,     it   has completely ful<U+FB01>lled my expec

some service to physicists.                   _
   The body of the instrument consists essentially of two parts,
namely: (1) A glass bottle A, with a rather wide neck and a
tubulus at the side. In my instrument this bottle is about
12 inches high and 6 inches in diameter.    (2) An ega-shaped
glass vessel B, with a short neck above and a long one below,
which is ground so as to <U+FB01>t into the neck of the bottle A, and

     This apparatus is connected with the air-pump by means of a
 caoutchouc tube, provided at both ends with a hollow conical
metallic plug.
     One of these plugs is put into the hole which the main-cock,
 h, of every air-pump is already provided with, for the purpose of
either shutting off exhausted vessels from the pump, or of <U+FB01>lling
them again with air; and the other plug is put alternately into
one of the nozzles i and        1:.
    When the apparatus           to be worked,

all to <U+FB01>ll the bottle   A with quicksilver nearly up to the tubulus:
in  my instrument forty pounds are required for this purpose.
The main-cock       hof the air-pump must then be turned so that

                                           as     needful to ensure the
complete displacement of all air.
    When this has been done, the cock                 turned through 45°

    In order to employ this vacuum for the required purpose, the
handle of the upper cock        g    placed horizontal with the end
                                      is                                             p

                                      are put into communication with
the exhausted Vessel B.
    The bottle     may for the sake of safety be previously closed

                                      is
nexion with the pump          maintained.
                               is               When the exhaustion                  is
completed,    the vessel  B must   likewise   be  closed again     turning by
the cock 9.
   This  is     general the course of the exhaustion, which must of
               in
course be repeated as often as needful.
ncss, as placed at right angles to the cock 9; it     better, however, to place

itin a  line with the axis of the cone of the cock, and to give this    double  a
boring like that of the cock   hof the air-pump.    In this way the quicksilver
is prevented from getting into the passage           1.

1844            Prof: Poggendor<U+FB02>'    on a new form of
   It requres, as is easily seen, no great expenditure of strength,
and is moreover not      attended with any danger; besides which,
the apparatus is placed in a strong wooden vessel, large enough
to hold the whole quantity of quicksilver in the scarcely con
ceivable case of an accident.
   Every repetition of the operation is begun by separating the
bottle A from the pump, and, by carefully turning the cockf,
allowing the quicksilver to mount slowly up into the vessel B.
In consequence of the usually small capacity of the pieces to be
exhausted, this vessel <U+FB01>lls again almost completely of itself, so
that, after opening the cock 9, only a small quantity of air has to
be removed from below the upper nozzle.
   It is obvious that this apparatus, when carefully constructed, is
capable of performing the same services as Geissler’s pump, and
that in fact it differs from this only in the way in which the
emptying of the mercury is effected.
   1 will here mention only one of the preliminary       experiments
which   I  have made with it,—an experiment which is calculated
to refute the common opinion that an absolute vacuum is to be
attained by means of the mercurial pump.           This consisted in
trying   whether  the  vessel B, after  being emptied of quicksilver,
would   allow  a current of electricity to pass.  ThisI found to be
really the case.    If the iron caps of the apparatus are connected
with the poles of an induction-coil, an iron wire being put
through the cockfinto the quicksilver in the bottle A, the well
known luminous phenomena are obtained most beautifully de
veloped.
   As already remarked, the apparatus that has been described is
specially applicable for exhausting small vessels which can be
directly connected with the lateral opening I.         It can, how
ever, be employed also for pumping out larger vessels, such as
bell-jars which require to be placed upon a plate.
   This is e<U+FB02>‘ected by putting the side opening I, by means of a
<U+FB02>exible metallic tube, into connexion with the air-pump through
the cock which, in Pistor’s air—pumps, leads to the Hawksbee’s
barometer-gauge, and is provided for this purpose with a second
perforation, similar to that in the main-cock h.
   By <U+FB01>rst of all placing the cock It so as to establish a commu
nication from the pump-barrels to the bell-jar standing upon the
plate, this can be exhausted as far as the pump allows; and by
then turning the main-cock through a right angle, and connecting
it by the caoutchouc tube with the mercurial apparatus, the ex
haustion can be continued by means of the operations previously
described, so as to produce a more perfect vacuum.
   This, however, of course requires that all the joints should be
perfectly air-tight ; and even in that case it becomes a tedious

                       the Mercurial Air-pump.                     185
matter if the capacity of the bell-jar to be pumped out is at all
considerable in comparison with that of the exhausting-vessel B
of the mercurial pump.
   The ideaof the arrangement that hasjust been describedoccurred
to me last autumn at the      Meeting of Men of Science [the annual
Naturforscherversammlung] at Giessen, where       I  had an opportu
nity of being present at some of the experiments made by Geiss
ler of Bonn with his pump, but witnessed also how easily the
instrument can be destroyed by unskilled hands.
    On my return to Berlin I determined to have my idea carried
out, at least in the way of an experiment.         Ihsd already en
trusted it to a mechanician to execute, when, to my not altogether
agreeable surprise, 1 saw, from the September Number of the
Philosophical Magazine, which had in the meantime arrived, that
the Rev. T. R. Robinson, the same to whom we are indebted for
a valuable investigation concerning the lines of the spectrum, had
already had a mercurial pump constructed upon similar principles.
    Only one half of his plan, however, is coincident with mine.
Like me, he uses a common air-pump to remove the mercury
from the exhausting-vessel;      but in order to fill it he requires,
besides, a separate apparatus, consisting of an upright cylinder
of cast iron, 13 inches high and 3'2 inches wide, whence the
quicksilver is driven by means of a wooden plunger into the ex
blasting-vessel.
    In consequence of this and other parts of the arrangement,
the  instrument, which holds only ten pounds of mercury, becomes
so complicated    and clumsy in form, that it is dif<U+FB01>cult to believe
it will meet with a very favourable reception at the hands of phy'
sicists.   Consequently I did not consider that    I  need hesitate to
proceed   with  the practical  execution and publication of my idea.
    I will in conclusion also remark that, when all that is wanted
is to exhaust simple tubes with platinum or aluminium wires
melted into them, a regular mercurial pump is not at all needntI
even in order to attain as high or even a higher degree of ex
haustion than can be reached by means of it.
    For this purpose nothing more is needed than a small tubu
 lated gas-generating bottle about halftilled with quicksilver, and
 the neck and tubulus 01 which are closed by good corks. Through
 the cork of the tubulus is inserted an iron tube which can be
 closed bya stopcock, and ends externaliyin a nozzle ; and through
 the cork in the neck of the bottle is inserted a glass tube about
 8 or 10 inches long, which must be melted on to about the

136                M. P. Desains     on the Emission   of
middle of the tube that is to be exhausted, and at right angles
to it.
   At <U+FB01>rst this adapting tube is only pushed far enough down
to dip a little way into the quicksilver.        The bottle is then in
verted so as to <U+FB01>ll with mercury the tube that is to be exhausted,
and this, if it be thought proper, is boiled out, the bottle being
afterwards slowly set upright again, while the adapting tube is
pushed further and further in, at last nearly to the bottom.
The nozzle of the cock inserted into the tubulus is new con
nected with the air-pump by means of a caoutchouc tube, in the
manner already indicated.          Scarcely half a stroke of the piston
will be needed to empty the tube, which can now, after shutting
the cock and removing the caoutchouc tube, be either melted off
or left connected with the bottle.
   Although only a very low degree of rarefaction of the air in
the bottle is needed in order to empty the tube completely, it is
neVertheless advisable, especially when the tube is not to be
melted o<U+FB02>' immediately, to give both corks a good coat of seal
ing-wax before pumping out.

           at a red  heat
                               and I, a dozen years ago, proved that
                           different  substances may have very di<U+FB02>‘er
ent powers of emission      for light. And we have also given some
indications as to the relative values of light emitted at this red
heat by the same extent of surface of oxide of copper, platinum,
and gold.      In our experiments oxide of copper had about ten
times the emissive power of gold.           Platinum was between the
two, but nearer the second.
                                I
   In the researches which now submit to the Academy, pro        I
posed to myself to extend to a larger number of bodies the study
of the luminous emission at a red heat; the results I have ob
tained may be summarized in the following manner :—
   At a red heat, and in a perpendicular direction, oxide of cop
per, oxide of cobalt, green oxide of chromium, brown oxide of man
 ganese, and red oxide of iron have for light emissive powers which
are virtually equal. Under these circumstances a coating formed
of splphate of lead and a little borax also emits luminous rays
very easily.    It is a little less brilliant than the preceding sub
stances, but more so than platinum.          Platinum is more so than
gold, and this metal, lastly, more so thana layer of oxide of zinc
rendered adherent by borax.

   To be more de<U+FB01>nite, we might, I think, assume that repre
senting by 100 the normal emissive power of oxide of iron and
of the bodies we have classed with      that of platinum would
                                             it,
be about 32, that of gold 10, while that of oxide of zinc would
not exceed    5,   if   indeed   it   amounted    to this number.         I   ma
<U+FB01>nally add that     acoating obtained            by
                                           mixing together chalk,
a little borax, and water, appeared in one experiment to approach
oxide of zinc in the feebleness of its emissive power.
   In the researches the results of which we published in 1854,
we heated      to redness the coatings wh0se emissive power we
desired to study,       by
                         applying them on small plate of gold or
                                                   a
of platinum, which could be traversed                  by
                                                   an electric current.
In my new experiments, without abandoning this mode of heat
ing, I  usually preferred to apply the oxides submitted to my ob
servations on plates of gold or platinum which were heated                         by
eolipyles.     These plates, which were tolerably thick, were not
appreciably altered in shape during the experiments.
   When, without attempting to make any measurements,                         it   is
simply desired to show the difference of emissive power for light,
a plate of this kind      taken of about 25 or 30 square centims.,
                         is
and on one of its faces two lines are traced at right angles passing
through: its middle, and thus dividing           into four contiguous

portions; on one of these the metallic lustre          left, the second

is covered   with  oxide  of zinc, the  third  with  oxide   of iron, the
fourth with oxide of copper.       When the coatings are dry, the
plate is   placed in     dark chamber and heated with
                         a                                       <U+FB02>ame of
                                                                      a
alcohol or of gas, which strikes against that face which has no
coating.     As soon as the temperature had reached red heat, alla
the effects which we have indicated were observed.
   If photometric observations are to be made,             important to
                                                            it   is
take precautions for preventing rays emitted from the source of
heat from being mixed with those which come from the surfaces
investigated.     In this case the plate may be <U+FB01>xed at the end of
an earthen tube whose internal surface has been blackened or
covered with oxide of iron.       The external face of the plate                   is
heated, and the other           observed
                                 is              by
                                              placing the photometer
near the open end of the tube.
   The extreme smallness of the luminous emissive power of oxide
of zinc has surprised me; but although             have greatly varied
                                                      I
my experiments on this point, they have all led to the same
result.  I    shall not detail them;       Iwill merely mention one
which appears to prove that the small emissive power of this
oxide is  not at all due to the fact that, from want of conducti
bility,  it  only attains at its external surface           temperature
                                                                 a
             lower than that of other coatings applied on the same
Lnaterially

138      On the Emission         of Luminous Radiation at a Red Heat.
     I took platinum plate, and having completely covered it with
              a
zinc-white, I covered half the plate thus whitened with a layer
of oxide of iron above that of oxide of zinc ; lastly I heated                                    it,
and even in this case    found the oxide of iron twenty times as
                            I
luminous as the other.
   Oxide of zinc     one of those bodies which at about 100° have
                      is
virtually the same calori<U+FB01>c cmissive power as oxide of iron or
lampblack.     Seeing how little light     emits at    red heat, it                 a             I
compared at this temperature its calori<U+FB01>c emissive power with
that of oxide of iron, and     found that1   was about six-tenthl   it
of that of the latter.
    Hence at      red heat the ratio of the emissive powers of these
                  a
two substances        far greater for heat than for light.
                      is                                             This dif
ference, however,         but natural, seeing that of the total sum of

produced in the following manner.                A porcalain tube        taken          is
about 0'06 metre in diameter;                  bevelled at one of its ends;

 end of the tube      isopen, and projects from the furnace.              It                      is
 heated; the plate becomes red <U+FB01>rst, and the oxide appears far
 more brilliant than the platinum; but when the sides of the
 tube- are incandescent, the difference in lustre of the metal and
 of the oxide diminishes or disappears; and then in order to
 change the function, that                is is,
                                      to make the platinum appear more

                                 previously mentioned, this mineral
CASSITERITE.—As
   occurs in considerable          quantity in the sands of the River
of Tipuani in Bolivia, where, from its greater speci<U+FB01>c gravity, it
accumulates in the washing-apparatus           (Lavaderos) during the
          for extracting the gold: this was particularly found to
process
   e the case at Playa Gritada, at the establishment of Don llde
fonso Villamil, and at this place a considerable quantity was
collected for examination.
     The Cassiterite was gcnerally in small semi-rounded nodules,
frequently, however, showing one or more crystalline faces, and
varying in size from a mustard-seed up to that of a hazel-nut.
It was generally pure, that        is,without attached rock-substance;
but occasionally pieces were found with adherent quartz.            The
associated minerals found along with the Cassiterite were, besides
gold and metallic tin, black tourmaline, garnet, haematite, chias—
tolite, quartz, and small fragments of minerals much resembling
 ruby and topaz, but as yet not examined.
     The colour of the Cassiterite itself was most generally          a
 dirty brownish white or dark black, but fragments were occa
sionally met with of       a <U+FB01>ne wine-yellow colour, or even colourless
 and transparent.          A chemical examination of these different
 varieties yielded the following results :—
     Cassiterite, colourless.—Upon examination this was found to
 be nearly pure binoxide of tin.          The speci<U+FB01>c gravity, taken at
 60° Fahr. upon 97'38 grs., in fragments, was found to be
 68432.       In order to see whether any change in this speci<U+FB01>c
 gravity could be effected         by heating, the above quantity was
 ignited to a    full red heat for half an hour; after cooling, it   was
  found to have lost 0'06 gr. in weight, and           second determi
                                                         a
  nation of its speci<U+FB01>c gravity gave the number 68439; so that
it    may safely be considered as having remained constant.           In
  external appearance the only observable change was in colour,
  which had now    a    slight reddish-yellow tint, and in lustre, which
  was more waxy.

140              Mr. D. Forbes’s    Researches   on the
   Before the blowpipe it a<U+FB01>‘orded only the reactions due to pure
oxide of tin.
   Cassiterite, brownish—In addition to the blowpipe reactions
for oxide of tin, the yellow colour of the borax globule, whilst
warm, indicated the presence of iron, whilst the insoluble white
matter in the phosphate-of-soda bead showed silica to be present.
A trace of manganese was also indicated on treating the mineral
with nitrate of potash on platinum~foil.
   The chemical examination was conducted as follows :—
   20'52 grs. in impalpable powder were intimately mixed with
130 grs. of a mixture of anhydrous carbonate of soda and sul
phur in equal parts, and fused in a Berlin porcelain crucible for
some time; on cooling, the mass was dissolved out in water,
to which a little sulphide of ammonium was added. An insoluble
residue remained amounting to 3'70 grs., which was fused as be
fore, with 24 grs. of the same mixture of sulphur with carbonate of
soda, and dissolved in water; every small quantity still remained
insoluble, from which sulphuric acid with a few drops of nitric
acid extracted some alumina and oxide of iron, which were sepa
rated by potash and determined as usual.            The oxide of iron
contained a little manganese, which, however, was not separately
determined.
   From the solution of the sulphide of tin in sulphide of sodium,
the former was precipitated by hydrochloric acid, and after being
collected on a <U+FB01>lter, washed, and dried with the usual precau
tions, was converted by prolonged ignition into binoxide of tin.
The results thus obtained will, when tabulated, stand as fol
lows :—

   Cassilerite, black—The speci<U+FB01>c gravity of the deep-black
variety of Cassiterite, taken on 187'40 grs. at temperature of 60°
Fahr., proved to be 7021. Before the blowpipe, the only differ~
ence in behaviour from the last-mentioned         specimen was in the
much stronger reaction of iron and manganese.
   In the examination of this specimen 20'11 grs. in impalpable
powder were added by degrees to 300 grs. caustic potash, already
in fusion in a gold crucible, and kept in the liquid state for
some time.      On digestion with water, a residue, apparently of
undecomposed mineral, was left, amounting on determination to
1'89 gr., which was again treated as before with potash in fusion.
An insoluble residue (1'11 gr.), apparently only undecomposed

   Cassiterite from Oruro.—The deposits of tin-ores at Oruro are
probably the largest in South America.         The ore there occurs
both as stream-tin (and is the object of extensive explorations),
and also in veins in the Silurian rocks of that district.
    A specimen sent me from that locality was an aggregate
of small crystals (pyramidal), of a dirty honey-yellow colour.
Blowpipe reactions and chemical examination showed the crystals
to be nearly pure binoxide of tin.     A determination of their spe
ci<U+FB01>c gravity at 60° Fahr. gave 6'704.
   Not having visited this district, it is impossible to state whether
the Cassiteritcs are commonly so pure in this locality as the above
specimen.
   Cassiterite, Carabuco, Bolivia.—Tin-ores occur extensively in
the province of Laricaja in Northern Bolivia, on the west slope
of the High Andes range close to the eastern shore of the Lake
of Titicaca at Carabuco.   They occur here associated with seve
ral minerals containing silver, and in the time of the Spaniards
Were worked exclusively for the nobler metal: of late years,
however, the deeds of these mines have been and still are worked
for tin.   The gossan of these veins, or, as called in the Aymara
Indian language,      “paco” *, chie<U+FB02>y composed of sesquioxide of
iron, is frequently very rich in silver        stated, occasionally up
                                                 (it     is
to8   per  cent.), probably  in the state of chlorides.
   The tin ore  is  in greatest part Cassiterite, which occurs crys
tallized in prisms, having      speci<U+FB01>c gravity of 6'4.

142              Mr. D. Forbes’s            Researches           on the
   Native Tim—The above analyses of Cassiterite were made in
hopes that some light might be thrown upon the occurrence of
the metallic tin previously described as occurring in the gold
sands of the river Tipuani.     It must, however, be admitted that
theydo  not much  tend to dispel the mystery connected with its oc
currence, further than  that, as the metallic tin contained so much
lead alloyed with     it,
                      the idea that     could have originated from
                                                 it
the reduction of the Cnssiterite     the sands of the river Tipuani
                                            in
 must seem very improbable.                                               .
 I     must, however, add       postscript to this notice, inasmuch as
                                   a
a  late post from Bolivia has brought me from Tipuani, enclosed
                              “ two                            ” from the
in letter from
    a             a  friend,          crystals of native tin
 sands of that river; these so-called crystals are small and distinct
 six-sided prisms of undoubted metallic tin, the one            little over
 and the other slightly under one quarter of an inch             diameter,   in a
 and respectively about three-sixteenths and <U+FB01>ve-sixteenths of an
inch in length. The planes bounding the sides are well de<U+FB01>ned,
 but oxidized, so as to have no lustre, or permit any very satis
 factory measurement of their angles being made.               There were
 no terminal planes on     the  ends   of either   of the  two  specimens
 here referred to, and the prisms appeared abruptly terminated.
    Summing up the evidence deduced from the facts here pro
 duced relative to the occurrence of native tin,          suppose that its
                                                                  I
 existence must be admitted, at least until further evidence                               is
 brought forward to prove the contrary.           Yet cannot but retain
                                                                  I
 the impression on my        mind   that  the  tin  in question does not
 owe its origin to purely natural causes, howeVer much the balance
of evidence goes against me.
    Gold, Carabaya, Perm-This gold occurs in quartz-veins tra
 versing the Silurian slates of the High Andes of the south of
 Peru on to the con<U+FB01>nes of Bolivia.         The specimen examined was
 procured   from a  vein  situated      theinMontanas de Monte Nello
 in the Carabaya range.       The quartz was colourless or white, and
 along with the gold contained iron pyrites and                  greenish    a
 coloured silicate of undetermined character.          The gold was of                     a

     Gold <U+FB01>om the River Chuquiaguillo.——This river, which <U+FB02>ows
into the river of La Pay immediately below that city, had been
worked before the Spanish conquest from time immemorial by
the Aymara Indians, and the gold obtained has been entirely
 due to the operations carried on for washing the bed of the river,
as described in the Report to the Geological Society of London *.
 The gold obtained from these washings varies greatly in quality,
but in general is of very inferior quality.                  The proprietor of the
 most extensive workings,            Don       Pedro    Saientz,  kindly presented
 me with the largest nugget which he had obtained, and which
 weighed 432 grs.
     lts speci<U+FB01>c gravity at 60° Fahr. was found to be 16-693, and
  a chemical examination gave its composition as consisting of—

  BoX ivia, and on the late map of that country by Omlorza and Mujica very
  many localities of platinum are marked, I never succeeded whilst there
  in procuring any reliable evidence of its existing, or even ever having been

 employéy, as they also commonlyusel +zcos 2Lfor1-I-(1—zcos 2L).
 The values    assigned to 2 by different writers vary considerably.       La
 place makes z=~002837, and M. Mathieu (Annuaire, 1.0.) gives
:='00265. I have thought it, therefore, advisable <U+FB01>rst to consult
 the authorities who have calculated 7 directly from pendulum expe
 riments, next to calculate y from the compression deduced from
measurements of arcs *, and then, having determined z for each of
these values of y, to take the mean result to <U+FB01>ve places of decimals.
The pendulum reductions are taken from Baily (Mem. of Astron.
Soc. 1834, vol. vii. p. 94) ; the four <U+FB01>rst reductions are cited on the
authority of the Enyl. Cyclop. A. &' S. vol. iv. col. 362, and the
<U+FB01>fth from the Proceedings of the Royal Society, vol. xiii. p. 270.
The following are the results.

             Mean values         -y= '0052651            2: '0026256
    Hence I adopt the value :='00263.             This differs from Laplace’s
value by '000207, and from that of M. Mathieu by'00002.                Viewed
in relation to the possible errors which may arise from other sources
this correction is slight, but it should be made on the principle advo
cated by Laplace, that it is assignable (<U+FB02>Iéc. Cél. vol. iv. p. 292).
Adopting this value of z and reducing the formula (0) to English feet
and Fahrenheit degrees, I have constructed Tables I. and 11., which
give formulae and <U+FB01>gures for calculating heights with every correc‘
tion of Laplace, more readily than any other that I have seen. As
thereis no necessity to interpolate, the Tables are even simpler to use
than M. Mathieu’s (Annuaire, l. c.) or Loomis’s (Astronomy, p. 390),
and they are not only simpler but more complete than Baily’s
 (Astronomical Tables, 1827, p. 111), which do not g've the cor
rection for the variation of gravity on the vertical. They have the
further advantage of being applicable to both English and conti
nental measures.        The unavoidable uncertainties of the theory make
it useless to consider more minute quantities than a foot, or the hun
dredth of a metre or of a toise.           Hence only <U+FB01>ve-<U+FB01>gure logarithms
are required.      The following examples will show the use of these
Tables.

of trigonometrical with barometrical measurements (bléc. Cel. iv.
 290). Bessel's theory, with the numbers corrected by Plantamour
 (Ann. Météor. dc F. 1852), makes it 36'809.              If this coef<U+FB01>cient
were adopted the values of log G in Table II. would have to be
increased by '00053.        This would increase the results in the fore
going examples by 4 feet, 2'8 metres, and 1'3 toise respectively.

    The only course that appears open to pursue is to con<U+FB01>ne the
limits of the integration to those small amounts which Laplace con
templated in the passage cited, and calculate the height by sections.
For it also appears from Mr. Glaisher’s curve, that for small altera—

as the alteration of height, that           that the curve does not deviate

have      a rough notion of when this occurs, an aneroid barometer
and common thermometer should be watched on the ascent.                       Mr.

and about 4°‘5 per inch from the 14th to the 16th inch'l'. This may
therefore be considered as the normal alteration of temperature.       In
order to secure simultaneous observations at both stations for      each
section,    would be necessary to have two ascending parties, one for
              it
each variable station, each of which should be able to signal to the
other.. A stationary observer at the lowest station would serve as
a check on the other two.      This method introduces many practical

 "   In the Ann. M61. dc F. (1.0.) M. Plantamour calculates the height of St.

 logigue de France, 1853, p. 249, M. Plantamour gives the height of the basin
 of the barometer at the hospice of St. Bernard as 2493 metres, but does
 not there state how this result was obtained. These heights being respective]
 10 and 30 metres greater than that calculated        by Laplace’s formula, wouldy,
if  adopted as the height of the lower station in the second calculation,            give

                        is
the height assumed for St. Bernard must be that due to that formula.                 But
 di<U+FB01>'erent dnta give different results for this height.   Geneva and St. Bernard
 are too widely separated horimntally, and have generally toov great              differ            a

 with any degree of con<U+FB01>dence, as there are probably many abnormal intermediate
 changes of temperature which, as will be seen, tend to vitiate the result.          Nor
 can any reliance be placed on adopting       the mean barometric pressures and
 temperatures.     Ifany mean be taken,        must be the mean of many heights

been able to introduce them into the calculation.       The results after

suspicion, not only from the great length of the interval, but the
imperfect manner in which the observations were unavoidablv made.
Supposing the observations to be correct, the total method makes
the interval vw greater than the gradual           no less than 610 feet,    by
owing to its distributing the warm temperatures over so large an in
terval of extreme cold.               If

 359 feet for the sum of all the cases in which the total method was
in excess of the gradual, and 201 feet for the cases of defect, leaving
a. total excess of 158 fcet in 26450 or 26292 feet, which             thus                      is

 heights, whereas the gradual methods cannot admit any variation of
 height without a variation of pressure.                 The rapid fall of the ther
 mometer from u to w causes the total method to give very much
 smaller intervals than the gradual, but the nearly stationary tempe
 ratures of 1,31,: turn the balance the other way.                        On the whole,
 the total method gives 686 feet in excess, and 335 feet in defect of
 the gradual method, remaining 351 feet in excess. The temperature
varied so abnormally in this ascent that little con<U+FB01>dence can be re
posed in either result after station h, when the total method is onl
32 feet out of 94H or 9379 in advance of the gradual, which is still
a large amount.
      It may be objected to the gradual method that, by multiplying
 stations, it multiplies errors of observation.                But even when the sta
tions are so unnecessarily multiplied as in Tables III. and IV. (in
which nearly every recorded case of a simultaneous observation of
barometer and thermometer has been admitted), the error is not likely
to approach that arising from the total method.                     We may, however,
calculate the ascent of Table 111. as far as r, beyond which, as already
remarked, the variation of temperatures renders the results uncer
tain, in six instead of sixteen stations, as follows.

         " On the AZoic and Palaeozoic Rocks of Southern New Bruns
.wick." By G. F. Matthew, Esq.
    After brie<U+FB02>y narrating the History of the Geology of the Region,
 the author described each of the formations successively in detail;
 namely, the Laurentiun (Portland series). Huronian (Coldbrook
 group), Lower Silurian (St. John group), Upper Silurian, Middle
 and Upper Devonian (including the Bloomsbury group, Little River
 group, and Mispeck group), Lower Carboniferous, and Carboni
 ferous.      The only important hiatus. therefore, is that wherein the
 Trenton limestones and Hudson River shales should fall; and
 those formations probably form part of the Lower Silurian rocks
 already known.       Mr. Matthew then stated that it is now a well
 estahlished fact that throughout Palzeozoic time the centre of the
 North American continent was comparatively stable, the whole series
 of formations being found in continuous and conformable succession,
 from the base of the Silurian to the summit of the Permian.
    The stratigraphical peculiarities of the several formations, in
 regard to their mutual relations, were next described ; and the author
 inferred the existence of at least three breaks, and possibly a fourth
 (between the two sections of the Carboniferous system), in the
 Palwozoic series of Acadia—namely, between the Huronian and
 the Silurian, between the Lower and Upper Silurian, and between
 the
       “ Middle and Upper Devonian” and the " Lower Devonian and
 Upper Silurian."

         " Results of Geological Observations in Baden      and Francouia."
 By Dr. F. Sandberger, For. Corr. G.S.
    In this paper Dr. Sandberger communicated          the results be has ar
 rived at by the study of the Palaeozoic, Triassic, and Jurassic Beds of
 Baden and Francouia. The so-called
                                             " transition formation" of the
 Black Forest he had previously ascertained to be Lower Carboni
 ferous; it is immediately succeeded by the strata of Berghaupten
 near O<U+FB02>'enberg, which also occur in Alsace. Near Oppenau occurs
 a species of Prerophyllum 3 feet long, which affords a new proof of
 the close connexion between the Triassic and Palaeozoic <U+FB02>ora; and
 to this fact may be added the discovery of a true Srbizopleris in the
 Letten-coal near Wiirzhurg.          This connexion Dr. Sandberger also
 considers    more perceptible   in the fauna than has hitherto been sup
   oscd.
    The Welleukalk. Muschelkalk, and Letten-coal appear better
 developed in Franconia than elsewhere in Germany, and the clear
 ness of the stratification leaves no doubt about the order of succes

  sion.   Amongst the results of a comparison of the Thiiringian and
  Swabian types with those near Wiirzburg is the discovery of the
  fauna of Recoaro and Mickelschiitz in the Middle Wellenkalk;          and
                                                                             '
 the author remarks that as the rocks of the Alpine so-called Mus—
  chelkalk entirely agree with the Wellenkalk of his district, that
  rock ought henceforth to be called Welleukalk; for no representa
 tive of the true      (Upper) Muschelkalk       has hitherto been observed
 in the Alps.
     The Jurassic rocks occurring in Baden he refers to the Cornbrash
 and the Inferior Oolite.
     3. “ On   the Changes rendered necessary in the Geological Map
 of South Africa, by recent discoveries         of fossils.”  By Dr. R. N.
  Rubidge, F.G.S.
     Dr. ltubidge <U+FB01>rst called attention to a former paper, in which he
 pointed out the occurrence of horizontal beds of sandstone resting
 on the upturned edges of gneiss, and continuous with inclined sand
 stone of like kind interstratified with gnciss.       He therefore conjec
 tured that the Clay-slate and Bokkeveldt schist, which Bain con
 sidered distinct, belonged to one formation, that they are of the
 same age as the gneiss, and that the
                                            “ Carboniferous rocks ” of
                                                                         the
 Eastern province were not separable from the Clay-slate which Mr.
 Bain had called Primitive clay-slate.         It follows from this, that if
 the clay-slate proved Devonian, as Dr. Rubidge believed it would,
the horizontal quartzite must be much newer, and probably an out
lying mass of the Dicynodon-rocks.          He explained these phenomena
by supposing that rocks of widely different ages had been metamor
 phosed into masses having the same mineralogical characters.
    The discovery of certain f0ssils has lately veri<U+FB01>ed the conjecture
respecting the Devonian age of the clay-slates and Bokkeveldt rocks ;
and Dr. Rubidge therefore infers that the rest of the old rocks are of
the same age.         Finally, the discovery of a Calamite in the sand
stone, not unlike some specimens belonging to the same genus
found in the Dicynodon-rocks. renders the probability of the truth
of the second conjecture very great.

               ON AN ELECTRICAL        INDUCTION MACHINE.
                                 BY M. HOLTZ.
           object  of this  apparatus is to excite by means of induction a
THE   greater quantity of electricity   than that which exercises the indu
cing action.      In its simplest form it consists ofa <U+FB01>xed glass disk, on
one side ofwhich an even number of tinfoil sectors are pasted, which
receive from a small electrical machine alternately positive and nega
tive electricity.     In front of this disk, on the glass side, is a second
glass disk provided with the same number of tinfoil sectors, which is

160                Intelligence and [Miscellaneous Ariicles.
put in rapid rotation.     As these sectors, one of which is connected
with another by means of two tinfoil rings, pass in front of the <U+FB01>xed
one, positive and negative electricity are alternately driven out and
taken up by two suckers, by means of which it can be further used.
The concentrating effect of this apparatus, which has not as yet been
brought to its greatest perfection, is unmistakeably seen in the spark
which can be obtained with        it,
                                 in its power of charging batteries and
jars, and in the development of luminous phenomena in mean, in
which action       resembles the induction-coil machine.

 chemical actions, too, but obviously only feeble ones, like the appa
ratus which twenty years ago (and unknown to M. Holtz) was con
structed solely for this purpose by Mr. Goodman, but without suc
cess.   This was essentially constructed on the same principle, but
with     different and very disadvantageous

ON THE OPTICAL PROPERTIES     DEVELOPED IN DIFFERENT KINDS
     OF    GLASSBY THE PASSAGE OF AN ELECTRIC DISCHARGE.
     BY M. A. DE LA RIVE.
    In continuation of several experiments on the modi<U+FB01>cations which
 the passage of an electric current, either continuous or discontinuous,
 might produce in the rotatory magnetic power of various liquid con
 ductors,     was led to submit to experiment a. specimen of crown
               I
glass which had been perforated by the discharge of        large Ruhm
                                                             a
korlf's coil.     found that this specimen had almost entirely lost
                   I
rotatory magnetic power, and, on the contrary, had acquired the
properties of crystallized body and of annealed glass.
                   a
   Since then, thanks. to M. Ruhmkor<U+FB02>“, who has kindly placed his
large apparatus at my disposal,     have made similar trials on another
                                    I
specimen   of  crown  glass, on one  of <U+FB02>int glass, and on one of Fara
day’s heavy glass.
   All have given the same result as the <U+FB01>rst specimen which tried,
                                                                 I
as
 I   ascertained by comparing them with similar specimens which
had not been submitted to the action of the discharge.
   Hence the passage of     strong electric discharge through trans
                             a
parent insulating bodics imports to these bodies a permanent mole
cular modi<U+FB01>cation of the same kind as that which        produced, but
                                                        is
only momentarily, by heat and pressure.          The curious circum
stance     is,
          that this modi<U+FB01>cation    not limited merely to the parts tra
                                    is
versed by the discharge, but extends to the entire mass, provided this
mass do not exceed certain limits; its texture undergoes thus a per
manent change resembling that produced by tempering, and for this
the simple shock imparted to the glass by the passage of the discharge
is su<U+FB01>icient.—Comptes Rendus, May 15, 1865.

        the year 1840, when M. Babinet had occasion to visit the
 IN sea     coast, he proposed to observe if the neutral point of
Arago varied in its height as the sun rose or set, and to observe
it also when the sun was beneath the horizon; but he was
allured from these observations by a circumstance which he had
never even suspected, namely, the existence of a second neutral
point above the setting sun, and nearly as high in the atmo
sphere as the neutral point of Arago.             “l    afterwards ”*, he
says, “determined a great number of times the position of this
new neutral point, which appeared in the west even when the
sun was just on the horizon before setting, and in the cast when
he had risen only a few degrees.            A very imperfect estimate
made me sometimes believe that thi new neutral point was a
little less high than that of Arago.”
               Observations on Babinet’s Neutral Point.

   These remarkable results were doubtless owing to the causes
which produced the following phenomenon                1h 4"“, when :-At
the neutral point started away from the sun,      white halo of 45°a
appeared round the sun and continued till 2h 31‘".              was                  it
slightly brown on its inner rim. At 1'1 23'“ the altitude of the
halo was 32° 10', and the sun’s altitude 8° 30', so that the
radius of its outer rim was 23° 40'.
   When the vertical bands of the polariscope passed over the
apex of the halo their inlem-ity was increased, and when they
passed over the halo in    direction parallel to its horiznntal dia

   The polarization of the sky was greatly reduced by the crys
tals of ice <U+FB02>oating in the air which produced the halo.

166             Sir David Brewster    on the   Polarization
   In a normal state of the sky, when the sun is rising or setting
in a <U+FB01>ne day without clouds, the neutral point of Babinet is
situated about 18° 30' above the sun.         Owing to the great
quantity   of light in  the  neighbourhood of the  sun, this neutral
point  is not   so easily seen as that of Arago, and escaped the
scrutiny of that distinguished observer. In high latitudes it is
above the horizon the greater part of the year, and, being above
the sun, it is of course always visible in a clear sky, when he is
above the horizon.       When the sun is in the zenith this neutral
point  coincides   with  the sun’s centre—its distance from the sun
gradually increasing till it becomes 18° 30' at sunrise or sunset,
when the sun’s altitude is nothing.
   Like that of Arago, the neutral point of Babinet must be
accompanied, in certain states of the horizontal sky, with a
 secondary neutral point, but I have never had an opportunity of
observing it.
             Observations on Brewster’s Neutral Point.
   This neutral point, which I discovered in 1842, is much more
dif<U+FB01>cult to be seen than that of Babinet. In November, Decem
ber, and January it cannot be seen in our latitude, unless when,
early in November and late in January, a high degree of polari
zation in the sky brings it above the horizon at noon.
   The following interesting remarks of M. Babinet on his suc
cessful attempt to con<U+FB01>rm the existence of this neutral point,
explain in the clearest manner the causes of the dif<U+FB01>culties which
he experienced (and which every future observer will experi
ence)   in observing this remarkable spot with its surrounding
polarizations :—
   “On the 23rd July,” says M. Babinet, “after having ob
served from half-hour to half-hour the polarization of the sky
below the sun, the regularity of this polarization appeared to
change after 4-“,- and from 4}” to 5*“ I observed, in placing the
bands horizontally—
     “1st. A space without polarization below the sun;
     “2nd. Below this space a second space, where the bands were
                                -
certainly seen.
     3rd. Lower still   a   neutral space, where no hands were seen   ;
an   ,(‘1‘          -
   “4th. In approaching to the horizon,      fourth space, where
                                                a
the bands were very visible.   The phenomenon         therefore no
                                                       is
longer doubtful; but the immense brightness of the sun in             a
clear day, the intense illumination of the
                                              atmosphere in the
region immediately below him, and the re<U+FB01>exion from the
strongly illuminated earth, all concur in rendering this obser
vation dif<U+FB01>cult to make, and very painful to the               if
                                                  eyes, even    we

take the precaution of shielding the head and the polariscope
from the direct rays of the sun, and the re<U+FB02>exion from the earth.
. . . . . M. Brewster was doubtless guided in his research by
theoretical views; otherwise it appears to me very improbable
that, by merely observing the atmospherical polarization, he
could have made the remarkable discovery of this neutral point,
so di<U+FB01>cult to see, and which, after him, I have several times
tried in vain to rediscover . . . . . . The small quantity of polar
ized light which is observed between the neutral point of Brew
ster and the sun, seems to me to reach the limit which it is pos
sible to observe, and perhaps to exceed the limit which it is pos
sible to measure ” *.

    When the sky is clear the neutral point under the sun ap
 proaches to the sun as his altitude increases, and coincides with
 the sun’s centre when he is in the zenith.
    As the neutral points of Arago and Babinet may be seen
before the sun has risen, and after he has set, they are compa
ratively distinct and limited in their area; but as the neutral
point below the sun never can be seen unless when the sun is
shining, it has a less de<U+FB01>ned boundary and a wider area, owing
to the <U+FB02>ood of light in which it is generally enveloped.    Hence
arises the great dif<U+FB01>culty of seeing    and of detecting the form

of the lines of equal polarization which surround it. For the
same reason, we can hardly expect to see the secondary neutral
point, which must accompany          when   rises or sets on

complex to be used from hour to hour during transient condi

great facility and quickness.        was therefore obliged to use the

following instruments.

placed in  a    trough several (six to twelve) well annealed thin
glass plates with their surfaces inclined to the axis of the tube
at such an angle as to equal or compensate the average maximum
polarization to be measured.        This compensation was effected
more simply        by
                    adding  or  removing one or more plates when
those in the trough had been previously placed at          <U+FB01>xed angle        a
to the axis of the tube.      It obvious that,
                                      is                            by
                                                      giving the pile
of plates motion in one plane so as to vary the angle of refrac
         a

 sure of the maximum          degree of
 polarization   at the time  of observa
 tion. After some practice I had
 no dif<U+FB01>culty in estimating by the
 eye when the neutral line was at 1 or 1%, or 2 or 21;, without
 placing marks at 1, 2, 3, &c. on a plate of glass at the end of
 the tube.
     Having found that S0, S1, S2, &0. corresponded with degrees
 of polarization, measured by the rotation of the plane of polari
 zation, I thus had a measure of the maximum polarization of the
 atmosphere at the time of observation *.
     2. When it was necessary to measure very small degrees of pola
 rization, I preferred using a polarinieter with a single plate to one
 with a pile of plates receiving the light at very small angles of inci
 dence.     This instrument, shown in the annexed <U+FB01>gure, consists
 of two tubes of the same length, one of which, E F H G, moves

 within the other, A B D C.          One plate of glass, E L, longer than
  AB,    moves round     ajoint   at  E the end of the tube EFHG,
  resting upon C (the end of the tubeA BD C), so that when the
  tube E F H G is pushed iii, the plate E L, forms a greater angle
  with the axis of the tube, and when it is pulled out a smaller
  angle.
     Now, if AB=EF, BF will be =AE, the tangent of the
  angle A C E, A C being radius, or of the angle of incidence of
  rays that fall upon EL parallel to the axis of the tube.              The

   Omitting the three extreme values of D, viz. 79° 15', 99°
and 120°, the mean of all the other values is 89°; but consider
ing that <U+FB01>ve of the values of D are marked as more than 90°,
we may conclude that 90°                       is,
                                in the normal state of the atmo
sphere, the distance from the sun of the place of maximum
polarization, and 45° the corresponding angle of incidence.
   This determination of the place and angle of maximum polari
zation affords    highly probable explanation of the azure colour
                     a
of the sky. Sir Isaac Newton considers this colour to be “Blue                               a
of  the <U+FB01>rst order, though very faint and little; .    . . . for all                 .

 174               Sir David Brewater      on the   Polarization
parcels, become <U+FB01>rst of that bigness whereby such an azure must
be re<U+FB02>ected
                ” *.
    Professor Clausius considers the vapours to be vesicles or <U+FB02>at
 tened bladders, and ascribes the blue colour of the <U+FB01>rst order to re
 <U+FB02>exion from the thin pellicle of water.                In reference to these
 opinions the following facts are important :—
     (1) The azure colour of the sky, though resembling the blue of
 the <U+FB01>rst order, when the sky is viewed from the earth’s surface,
 becomes, as observed by Mr. Glaisher in his balloon ascents, an
 “                                       ” as we ascend to the
   exceedingly deep Prussian blue                                      height of
 <U+FB01>ve or six miles, which is a blue of the second or third order.
    (2) The maximum polarizing angle of the atmosphere being
 45°, is that of air, and not that of water, which is 53°.
     (3) At the greatest height to which Mr. Glaisher ascended,
namely, at the height of <U+FB01>ve, six, or seven miles, where the blue
is the brightest, “the air is almost deprived of moisture.”
    Hence it follows that the “exceedingly deep Prussian blue ”
cannot be produced by vesicles of water, but 'must be caused
                                                                              by
re<U+FB02>exion from the molecules of air, whose polarizing angle is 45 .
The faint blue which the sky exhibits at the earth’s surface is
therefore not the blue of the <U+FB01>rst order, and is merely the blue
of the second or third order rendered paler by the light re<U+FB02>ected
from the aqueous vapour in the lower regions of the atmo
sphere.
    Immediately after the values of D, I have placed the values of
R, or the degree of maximum polarization, in order to show the
relation between these two quantities; but as the values ofD
were taken only when it was convenient, the numbers R do not
show the maximum intensity of the polarization of the atmosphere.
I  have therefore selected the following from several hundreds of
observations recorded in my journal.

       The great rotation,             amounting to 321;0 on the 13th of April,
   1842, at 7h 32‘“, the greatest ever observed, was occasioned
   by an unusually favourable state of the sky.                          I  consider 30°
   to be the maximum rotation in a normal state of the sky.
       Having, in a normal state of the atmosphere, <U+FB01>xed the locality
   of the three neutral points, and determined the place and degree
   of maximum polarization, we have the means of ascertaining
   approximately the form of the lines of equal polarization, and
   of constructing a map of them when the sun is in the horizon.
        In a paper published in Johnston’s ‘ Physical Atlas,’ in 1848*,
    I  have shown how this may be done, and have given two projec
    tions of these lines—one on a plane passing through the zenith of
    the observer and perpendicular to the line joining the observer
    and the sun, and the other on the plane of the horizon.                          These
   two projections on a reduced scale, and without any of the numbers
    upon the larger ones, are given in Piate II.                          It will be seen
    from these projections, that the lines of equal polarization ap
    proximate to lemniscates, like the isochromatic lines in biaxal
    crystals.

  176                Sir David Brewster   on the Polarization
     0n the 29th of June, 1850, at about 8h 30m r..u., several red
 dish-white clouds appeared in the south-west sky at different
 heights, and in the zone of maximum polarization.      They were
 illuminated by the setting sun, and the sky around and, of
 course, behind them was of a deep blue.     Upon looking at one
                                                  I
 of these clouds through a Nicol’s prism, found that its reddish
 whitc light was polarized in a plane at right angles to that in
 which the light of the sky was polarized.     When the sky was
 dark by the disappearance of the blue polarized light in one posi
 tion of the prism, the cloud was bright; but when the sky was
 brightest in a rectangular position of the prism, the cloud was
 of a dark blue colour.
      July  15, 1850, 9h 12m P.M.—All the clouds to the east of
  the plane passing through the sun and moon, between the south
  west and south, are black seen against the sky; but when we
  view them with a Nicol’s prism, so as to extinguish as much as
  possible the polarized light of the sky, the clouds are white seen
  against a dark sky.       When the Nicol's prism is turned round
  90°, they again become black.
     July 1, 1850, 8h 30m PAL—A <U+FB01>ne rainbow, with the secon
 dary and supernumerary          bows, appeared in the south-east.
 When the bands of the polariscope crossed either of the two
 bows at right angles, the bands at the intersection were very
 brilliant.   When the rainbows were invisible from the great
 faintness of their light, they became visible (that       the invisible
                                                          is,
 portion became visible) when crossed with the bands of the po
 lariscope.    This effect did not seem to be produced when the
 bands crossed the supernumerary bows.
    “’hen the sun shines upon        alight transparent vapour inter
 posed between the observer and terrestrial objects, these objects
 are indistinctly seen, through the light re<U+FB02>ected         the vapour.

are then seen with great distinctness.       This mode of obtaining
improved vision of objects imperfectly visible, or of seeing objects
not otherwise visible, may occasionally be of great use at sea.
             On the Theory   of   Atmospherical Polarization.

                             is               the sun, his rays fall
upon the aérial particles which compose       at all angles of inci
dence.
          In the immediate vicinity of the sun, where the angle
of  incidence   180°, there
               is              no polarization.
                               is                  The polarization
increases With the angle of incidence, and becomes
                                                         maximum,

as we have seen, at about 90° from the sun.      It then diminishes

                                            of the Atmosphere.                                 177

           point opposite to the sun.
              At all these points the polarization  said to be vertical, being
                                                                is
           in the vertical plane passing through the sun and the observer.
             In   addition to the vertical polarization produced                   by   the direct
           illumination of the aerial particles, there must                    be an opposite
           polarization       by   which the neutral points are produced.          MM.
           Arago and Babinet, and,          we believe, every other writer on the
           subject, have sought for this countei-polarization “in the secon
           dary illumination which the same aerial particles receive from

           ized by re<U+FB02>exion, the one vertical, arising from the direct illumi

           the atmosphere.
                This theory of atmospherical polarization, omitting all con
            sideration of the light polarized             by
                                                        refraction, never appeared to

            and as the polarization by direct re<U+FB02>exion must be visible when
            the secondar re<U+FB02>exion ceases to be visible, this cessation ought
            to be marke       by   areturn of the neutral point to the antisolar

             antisolar point was changed when the rest of the atmosphere was
             Obscured    by clouds.
                On these grounds        Iwas led to the opinion that the neutral

that it increases gradually as the sun descends from the meridian,
and reaches its maximum when the sun is very near the horizon,
the amplitude of this variation being about 0'09”*.
   This interesting result was obtained by adopting my measure
of the maximum polarization, namely, that when the sun’s alti
tude was 20°, the intensity of the point of maximum polarization
900 from the sun was equivalent to that which would be pro
duced by re<U+FB01>exion from the surface of glass whose index of
refraction was 1'486 at an angle of 65° 30'1'.               From these data
the formula; of Fresnel give 0'64 as the measure of the intensity.
hi. Bernard, taking the mean of two observations, found the
intensity to be 065523, differing only 0012 from the measure
which    I had obtained.                                                     -
   In 1858, M. Liais, in crossing from France to Brazil, observed
the polarization of the atmosphere at the commencement of the
dawn (l’aurore) and at the end of twilight, in order to obtain a
measure of the height of the atmosphere.                  From observations
                                                          J
made at St. Domingo, and in the Bay of Rio anciro on the 1st,
2nd, and 3rd of December 1858, he found the height of the
atmosphere to be 340 kilometresI.                  During the same voyage,
M. Liais made the important observation that the 'zodiacal light
was not polarized§.                                         V
   In 1860, some interesting experiments on the polarization of
a beam of light diffused or dispersed by the smoke of different
substances were made by Professor M. G. Govi                      From their
relation to atmospheric polarization, they were repeated by Dr.
Rubenson, who extended them to the vapour of water. Professor
Govi found, as Dr. Rubenson did, that the di<U+FB01>'used light was
polarized by re<U+FB02>exion or refraction, according as we viewed the
luminous cylinder perpendicular to its axis or in a direction
slightly inclined to it. The vapour of water, according to Dr.
Rubenson, produces the opposite effect. In 1846 I made ana.
logous experiments on the beam of light dispersed in passing
through certain <U+FB02>uids and solids<U+FB02>l.
   In 1859, Dr. R. Rubenson, of the University of Upsal, under?
took a series of observations on the polarization of the .atmo
sphere.     With the exception of a few made at Upsal in 1859,
they were carried on at Rome between the 6th of June and the

5th of August, 1861 ; at Segni* between the 5th and the 27th
of August, 1861 ; and at Rome from the 5th of October, 1861,
to the 27th of July, 1862, with the <U+FB01>nest instruments and with
a degree of accuracy which had not been attempted by previous
observers.    In his elaborate work, occupying 238 pages'l', he has
treated the subject in twelve sections, with copious tables of his
observations, and illustrated with four plates.
   In his <U+FB01>rst section, on the history and literature of the subject,
he has done ample justice to his predecessors in this inquiry.
   In his section on the Cause of Atmospherical Polarization,
Dr. Rubenson is led to the same conclusion as that contained
in the preceding pages, namely, that the light is polarized by
re<U+FB02>exion from the particles of air, and not from vesicles of water
with parallel faces, as supposed by Clausius, nor, as others have
supposed, from extremely small and transparent drops of water,
nor from molecules of aqueous vapour in an intermediate state
between that of gas and that of vesicles.
   The place of maximum polarization, according to Arago, was
89°     6',
         the mean of six observations.           found 89° to be the
                                                    I
mean of great number of observations, but, like Arago,
              a                                                   con I
sider 90° to be the nearest approximation to the place of maximum
polarization.    Dr. Rubenson found       to undergo, as
                                               it           did, great
                                                                  I
variations, chie<U+FB02>y from 88° to 92°, the general mean of which
was 90° 2'.
   In observing the daily :variation of the polarization of the
maximum point, Dr. Rubenson found that               was subject to
                                                        it                 a
diminution during the morning, and an augmentation during the
evening, without being able to assign with certainty the precise
hour of minimum polarization—a result which doubtless arises
from the greater quantity of aqueous vapour in the air in the
morning than in the evening.
   In treating of the causes which disturb the polarization of the
atmosphere, Dr. Rubenson found, as          did, that clouds and fogs
                                               I
and smoke were the most important.          He found also, as had     I
doneI, that the halo formed             by
                                   crystals of ice reduces the inten
sity of polarization.
   Dr. Rubenson has not observed the secondary neutral point
which   I found to accompany sometimes that of Arago.        He once
observed, however,     neutral point accompanying that of Babinet,
                       a
but arising apparently from different cause from that which pro
                                    a

   The observations published by Dr. Rubenson were made with
a very <U+FB01>ne polarimetcr executed by M. Duboscq.          It was com

Savart’s polariscope, and was <U+FB01>tted up with graduated circles and
other accessories, so as to give at once and very accurately with
out any calculation of the sun’s motion, the position of the plane
of polarization, the distance between the sun and the point ob
served, the altitude and the azimuth of this point, and, <U+FB01>nally,
the relative value of the polarization.
   At Home the observations were made upon a terrace on the
top of the house No. 101 of the Via Sistina on Monte Vincio,
one of the highest points of the city, and commanding an exten

     T   well known that bodies are divided, as to their behaviour
          is
      in relation to electricity, into two classes—conductors and
insulators.    While the former have been the subject of frequent
and searching investigations, the latter have of late attracted
but little attention, notwithstanding that        was in them that
                                                           it
electrical phenomena were <U+FB01>rst observed, and that consequently
they were long called precmiuently electric, and the conductors
non-electric bodies.       They have been regarded as almost per
fectly  indifferent  in their  relations to electricity, and were studied
only   so far  as the  practical requirements of the experimentalist
demanded.        A single phenomenon seemed continually to indi
cate that this indifference was nevertheless not so complete as

   These facts have called forth several investigations,     portion           a

Poggendor<U+FB02>’s Annalen, vol. cxiv. p. 404!- This       communication
was intended to serve as introduction to the researches of which
he now takes leave to record brie<U+FB02>y the principal results.
    It was mentioned on the former occasion that Kohlrausch
was the <U+FB01>rst, as well as the only person who had formed any
precise conception as to the behaviour of insulators in the case
in question.     He assumed that the force with which the electri
cities distributed upon the coatings tend to separate the natural
electricities of any portion of the insulator, either produced such
separation in the smallest particles, or caused the particles which
already contained the separate electricities to rotate so as to
come into such      position as to exert an electrostatic moment
                             a
upon the coatings, and so to affect the phenomena of tension.
    It was shown in the paper referred to, that two consequences
necessarily follow from this conception.       If Kohlrausch’s view
is   correct,      it   follows——
     (1) That     small intervening layer, the connecting medium,
                        a
 for example, can exert no effect upon the disappearance of the
 charge—that        to say, upon the formation of residual charge.
                            is                                        a
    (2) That, provided the coatings are large enough in propor
_tion to the distance between them, this phenomenon must re
 main'prccisely the same whether thick or thin. plates are used
 as insulators, so long as they are all of the same material.
    The author had ascertained on previous occasion that the
                                                       a
 <U+FB01>rst. of these consequences       not borne out
                                         is                          by
                                                       experiment, and
 he has more recently found the observation con<U+FB01>rmed.
    Having subsequently,        the kind intervention of Dr. Quincke,
                                        by
 obtained eight very <U+FB01>ne glass plates of various thicknesses, but
 each pair of equal thickness, all blown from the same pot and
 cooled     the same manner, he was in position to investigate the
           in                                            a
 second point also.
    The experiments showed that the alterations of the charge
 took place at rates which were essentially different with different
 plates, in such wise that the times which elapsed until the charge
 had sunk          by
               the same proportion      its original amount were nearly

conductors.     As soon as current   a     established, no more free

electricity exists     the interior of the conductor, but only
                       in                                          its                    at
surface, and at the points of contact of heterogeneous metals,
These free electricities act at    distance upon the interior of the
                                         a
conductor so as to cause continual decompositions and recombi-l
nations of the electricities in each smallest particle, and thus
produce     movement of one electricity in one direction, and of
             a
the other in the opposite direction.                                  _
   Nowean this conception be transferred to insulators also?
can they be regarded simply as bad conductors, which di<U+FB01>'er from
good ones only         by
                      the forces which are required to produce the
 separation of equal quantities of electricity being extraordinarily
much greater?
    In other words,,Is the action of the electricities distributed
                                it
upon the coatings which occasions decompositions in the smallest
particles, consequently setting the two electricities in motion
towards the two sides, and thus giving rise to the phenomena of
the residual charge?                                                _
    'A theoretical investigation shoWs that in this case also the

 and this does not agree with that actually observed.            We are
 thus brought to conclude that          certainly not merely the action
                                             it   is
 at a  distance of the electricities on the coatings which brings
 about the movements of the electricities in the interior of insu

                                                  it              experi         by

 Thus   if an uncoated glass plate      introduced between the plates

184        On the Electrical Behaviour     of Solid Insulators.
manifests itself in the opposite ways in which changes of tempe
rature affect the electrical behaviour of each.
   W hereas a rise of temperature diminishes the conductivity of
solid conductors, electrical movements take place in insulators
much more quickly at high temperatures than at low ones, and
indeed very small variations of temperature exert a most marked
in<U+FB02>uence on the formation of the residual charge.
    It had been previously observed that glass became capable of
transmitting the galvanic current at 200° 0.; but that changes
of temperature, such as occur in our rooms, could affect in an
important degree the formation of the residual charge is a. thing
which, so far as I am aware, no one had suspected.
   Experiment has, however, demonstrated that an elevation of
temperature from l0° to 20° C. lessens the time in which the
same diminution of the charge takes place to one-half in the case
of a glass plate, and to one-tenth in the case of wax.
    As to the practical execution of these experiments, they were
all made in the Physical Institute of the University of Munich,
and by means of a Kohlrausch’s sine-electrometer.            Since, how
ever, the alterations frequently took place so quickly* that it
would have been impossible to make an observation according
to Kohlrausch’s method, it was needful to employ a slight (but,
as the author thinks, not unimportant) modi<U+FB01>cation of the instru
ment.
    This consisted in a divided paper scale suspended in the in
side of the case.    By reducing the values of the scale-divisions
by empirical comparison to the direct indications of the electro
meter, it was possible to make observations without touching
the instrument.      This arrangement enabled me, under favour
able circumstances, to make ten observations in a minute, while
by the original method it_was not possible, even in the most
                   to make more than four readings in the same
favourable case,
time.
    The results obtained may be brie<U+FB02>y stated thus :—
    (1) Electrical movements can take place in the interior of
insulators.
    (2) These movements are occasioned in part only by the
action at a distance of the electricities collected upon external
conductors.
    (3) They take place much more quickly at high temperatures
than at low ones.
   * With the thinnest
                       plate (1'6 millim. thick) the charge sank in twenty
seconds from 100 to 15, and in sixty seconds to 0'92.

      XXIII.    In<U+FB02>uence of Gravity on Magnetic Declination.
           By PLINY EARLE Cruse, M.A., S.P.A.S.*
       my <U+FB01>rst communication        on the diurnal variation of the
IN barometer       (Proceedings Amer. Phil. Soc. vol. ix. p. 284),     I

expressed the belief that a careful investigation would
mutual connexion through which all the secondary [disturbing]
causes may be referred to a single force.”        In my various sub
sequent papers,     and especially  in the one  to which the Magel
lanic Premium was awarded (Phil. Mag. July 1865),             I pointed
out various reasons for supposing that the primal unitary force
is the same that controls the motions of the several stellar sys
tems—in other words, the force of gravitation, or perhaps of
simple undulation, which is manifested as heat in one of its sub
ordinate forms, and as attraction in another. The numerical rela
tions which   I  demonstrated between the disturbances of weight
and of total magnetic force were certainly noteworthy, and, to
my own mind, extremely satisfactory; and as further investi
gations have afforded additional con<U+FB01>rmation of my views,              I
desire to put upon record a brief notice of the general har
mony which mutually characterizes the gravitation-currents          and
the variations of magnetic declination.
   Preliminary investigations showed, as might have been rea
sonably anticipated, that the best quantitative results can be
obtained from the observations at stations near the equator, and
Itherefore based my reasoning in great measure upon the St.
Helena records and Major General Sabine’s discussions, con<U+FB01>rm
ing it by such incidental references to other observations as
seemed available for the purpose. At the same time allusion was
made to researches now in progress, which may probably enable
us to discover numerical relations that will be equally satisfac
tory from an examination of the observations in higher latitudes.
While patiently and con<U+FB01>dently awaiting the completion of those
researches, it may be well to present some considerations which
will serve both as a corroboration of my own views and as a
guide to the investigations of others.
   The discussions of the magnetic and meteorological observa
tions at Girard College (Coast Survey Reports, and Smithsonian
Contributions) should be specially interesting to all Americans,
 and they are also among the most recent and valuable publica
tions on terrestrial physics.      From them   I quote the following
references to the most important and best-established normal
disturbances of declination.
   I. “ The annual variation depends on the earth’s position in
            ' From Silliman’s American Journal for July 1865.

 186              Mr. P. E. Chase    an tlie In<U+FB02>uence   of
   its orbit, the diurnal variation being subject to an inequality
   depending on the sun’s declination.           The diurnal range is
   greater  when   the  sun  has north  declination,  and smaller when
   south declination, the phenomenon passing from one state to
   the other about the time of the equinoxes.” (Part 2. p. 10. See
  also Toronto Observations, 2. xvii; St. Helena Obs. 2. cxviii.),
      II. “At the hour of 6 or 7 in the morning the annual varia
  tion is a maximum, disappearing at a quarter before 10 ML,
  and reaching a second (secondary) maximum value at 1 Hi.
  It almost disappears soon after 5 P.M., and a third still smaller
  maximum is reached after 9 P.M.          Half an hour before mid
  night, the annual variation again disappears. At (and before
  and after) the principal maximum between 6 and 7 in the morn
  ing, the annual variation causes the north end of the magnet to
  be de<U+FB02>ected to the east in summer and to the west in winter; at
  1 RM. the de<U+FB02>ections are to the west in summer and to the east
  in winter.    The range of the diurnal motion is thus increased in
  summer and diminished in winter—the magnet being de<U+FB02>ected
  in summer more to the east in the morning hours, and more to
  the west in the afternoon hours, or having greater elongations
 than it would have if the sun moved in the equator.          In winter
 the converse is the case.” (Ibid. p. 12. Compare St. Helena
 Obs. 2. cxviii. ; Toronto Obs. 1. xiv. and 2. xvi.)
   III.    “According to the same authority [General Sabine], the
 annual variation is the same in both hemispheres, the north end
 of the magnet being de<U+FB02>ected to the east in the forenoon, the
 sun having north declination ; while in the diurnal variation the
 north end of the magnet at that time of the day is de<U+FB02>ected to
 the east in the northern hemisphere, and t6 the west in the
 southern hemisphere; in other words, in regard to the direction
 the law
            of the annual variation is the same, and that of the
diurnal    variation   the opposite in passing from the northern to
the southern magnetic hemisphere.”
                                              (lhid. p. 13. Compare
 St. Helena Obs. 2. lxxx. cxviii.)                                    :
     IV. “ The regular progression of the monthly values is a feature
of the annual variation deserving particular notice. There is no
sudden transition from the positive to the negative side, or rice
versa', at or near the time of the equinoxes (certainly not at the
vernal equinox) ; on the contrary, the annual variation seems to
be regular in
                 its progressive changes.    The method here pursued
is entirely different from that employed by General
                                                             Sabine for
the same end, but the results are, nevertheless, in close accord
ance.”     It_  has been found that thegtransition takes place ,“
                                                                    ten
days after either equinox, and also that the turning-points occur
ten days after the solstices.”

     V. “The general character of the diurnal motion . . . . . is
nearly the same throughout the year ; the most eastern de<U+FB02>ec
tion is reached a quarter before 8 o’clock in the morning (about
a quarter of an hour earlier in summer, and half an hour later
in winter) ; . . . . . the north end of the magnet then begins to
move westward, and reaches its western elongation about a,
quarter after one o’ clock in the afternoon (a few minutes earlier
in summer). . . . . . The diurnal curve presents but a single
wave, slightly interrupted       by a deviation occurring during the
hours near midnight (from about 10 PM. to 1 A.n.), when the
 magnet has a direct or westerly motion; shortly after 1 A.M.
 the magnet again assumes a retrograde motion, and completes the
 cycle   by arriving at its eastern elongation shortly before 8 o’clock
in    the morning. This nocturnal de<U+FB02>ection is well marked in
 winter,‘vanishes in the summer months, and is hardly percep
 tible in the annual curve.        According to the investigations of
 General Sabine, it is probable that if we had the means of en
 tirely obliterating the effect of disturbances, this small oscillation
 would almost disappear.        In summer, when it has no existence,
 the magnet remains nearly stationary between the hours of 8
  ms. and 3 A.M., a feature which is also shown by the annual
 type curve.” (Ibid. p. 20.        Comp. llobarton Obs. 2. vi.; St.
  Helena Obs. 2. cxi. cxix. cxx.      Toronto Obs. l. xiv. 2. xvi.)
      VI. “ The critical hours which vary least during the year are
 those of the western elongation and those of the morning mean
  declination.    The extreme ditfercnce between the value for any
  month and the mean annual value, is 31 minutes in the former
  and 28 minutes in the latter.”       (Ibid. p. 21.)
      VII. The curves of lunar-diurnal variation “show two east
  and two west de<U+FB02>ections in a lunar day,” the westerly maxi ma
  “
     occurring about the upper and lower culminations,” and the
 .easterly maxima “at the intermediate six hours.             The total
  range hardly    reaches  0"5. These     results agree generally with
  those obtained for Toronto and Prague.”              (Part. III. p. 8.
  Compare St. Helena Obs. 2. xxiii. lxxxii. cxliv.        Toronto Obs.
 3. lxxxv.).                                 '
      VIII. “In comparing the easterly and westerly curves, the
  constant in Besscl’s formula comes out zero, and hence it is in
  ferred that the moon has no speci<U+FB01>c action in de<U+FB02>ecting the
  magnet by a constant quantity.”         (Ibid. p. 10.)
       IX. “ If we take the four phases into account, the lunar action
   seems to be retarded ten minutes, which quantity may be termed
  the lunar-magnetic interval for the Philadelphia Station.           At
  Toronto the intervals are not so regular.”        (Ibid. p. 11.)
       X. “ The characteristic feature of the annual inequality in the
   lunar-diurnal variation is a much smaller amplitude in winter

   188               Mr. P. E. Chase     on the In<U+FB02>uence   of
   than in summer. Kreil, indeed, inferred from the ten-year series
   of the Prague observations, that in winter the lunar-diurnal va
   riation either disappears, or is entirely concealed by irregular
   <U+FB02>uctuations, requiring a long series for their diminution.           The
   method of reduction which he employed was, however, less per
  fect than that now used.         The second characteristic of the in
   equality consists in the earlier occurrence of the maxima and
   minima in winter than in summer.           The winter curve precedes
  the summer curve by about one and three-quarter hours.” (lbid.
  pp. 12 8t 13.)
      XI. The curves of semiannual variation at all points where
  continuous observations have been made, present astriking sum
  larity, the amount of de<U+FB02>ection being nearly equal in all parts
  of the globe. (See diagram, Part II. p. 12. Compare St. Helena
  Obs. 2. cxix.; Toronto Obs. 2. xvi. xvii.)
      Now it is evident that the mechanically-polarizing currents
  (Proc. Amer. Phil. Soc. vol. ix. p. 367 et seq.) must be variously
  de<U+FB02>ected at different periods of the day, in consequence of gravi
 tation-disturbances arising both from the varying distance of the
 sun and from solar heat.        Although it may sometimes be desi
 rable to consider the so-called thermal currents apart from those
 which would be produced independently of any change of tem
 perature, such a distinction is unnecessary in a preliminary quali
 tative investigation like the present, because the periods both of
 maxima and of niinima are precisely coincident in the two cur
 rents (except as they may be slightly modi<U+FB01>ed by the earth’s
 radiant heat), and because even the thermal currents are occasioned
          and solely by the varying gravitation of <U+FB02>uids of varying
flimply
    ensity.
     Regarding, therefore, the air and tether over any given mag
netic meridian, during the day-hours the intertropical and during
the night the extratropical portions will be most drawn toward
the sun, and the following de<U+FB02>ections will be thus produced in
 the portions nearest the equator :—
                   6 to 12 A.M.   12 to 6 PM.    6to 12  RM.    12 to 6.A.M.
    Northern zones.     S.E          S.W.           S.E.           S.W.
   Southern zones.      N.E          N.VV.         N.E.            N .W'.
The night disturbances, whether from variations of temperature
or from simple fall toward the sun
                                           (the distance fallen varying
as the square of the time from midnight), will be
                                                               very slight.
The earth’s      rotation,   centrifugal   force,  and   the  atmospheric
inertia        to throw each of the phases forward and to
          tend                                                     increase
the magnitude of the westerly, while they diminish the

de<U+FB02>ections.     If  these modi<U+FB01>cations were suf<U+FB01>cient to override the
slight easterly tendency at 6 to 12 r.M., and to advance the

   phases one hour, the disturbances would assume the following
   forms, the change between 7 P.M. and 1 A.M. being scarcely, if
   at all, perceptible :—
                                                   7       AM. to l     P.M.        1     mr. to 7       A.M.
                  Northern zones              .        .     S.E.                          S.W.
                  Southern zones              .        .        N.E.                          NJV.
   At the equinoxes the amounts of de<U+FB02>ection in the northern and
    southern magnetic hemispheres should be equal ; at other seasons
    the shortest lines would suffer the greatest displacement, the
    de<U+FB02>ections being greatest in the northern zones from April to
    September, when the sun is in the northern signs, and in the
    southern zones from October to March, when the sun is in the
    southern signs.     My experiments have shown that the compass
    needle sympathizes with, and is to some extent controlled by,
    purely mechanical vibrations ; and if in obedience to such con
    trol it should tend to parallelism with the wthereal currents, a
    westerly disturbance of declination (the declination being always
    conventionally referred to the north pole of the needle) would
    correspond either to an equatorial south-easterly de<U+FB02>ection of the
     southern, or a north-westerly de<U+FB02>ection of the northern extremity
     of a half meridian ; and an easterly disturbance to a south-west
     erly de<U+FB02>ection of the southern, or a north-easterly de<U+FB02>ection of
    the northern extremity.
       Substituting these declination-values for the current-devia
    tions to which they correspond, the almost precise accordance
    of theory and observation in the prominent features of the normal
    variations of declination may be seen by a reference to the fol
    lowing Table :—

          General Sabine, in speaking                           of the opposition of the annual
     and semiannual curves (St. Helena Obs. 2. cxix.), says, “These
     remarkable systematic dissimilarities maybe regarded as suf<U+FB01>cient
     indications of difference in the mode

   a uniform law.      I believe that I have now given the needed ex
   planation;   and  since  I have shown experimentally that the phe
   nomena are such as should be produced by gravitation, it is rea
   sonable to assume that they probably are so produced.             The
   probability is increased by the disappearance of the night oscil
  lation in summer (V.), the probability that when it is observed
  it results from thermal disturbances, and the greater stability of
  those critical hours which are nearest to the hours of maximum
  sunward gravitation        (VI.). The precise coincidence both in
  time and direction of the lunar-diurnal declination and tidal
  curves (VII.), the unavoidable inference that the moon has no

  constant or speci<U+FB01>c magnetic action (VIII.), the establishment”
  of ten minutes at the Philadelphia station (IX), the correspon
  dence of the lunar and solar curves in the diminished winter
  amplitude (X.), and the uniformity at all stations of the semi
  annual variation-eurvcs (XL), are all necessary corollaries of my
  hypotheses.
     The demonstration of a connexion between the daily and annual
  variations of magnetism and gravitation would be incomplete if
 our theory could not be so extended as to explain the decennial
 and secular changes.        For such an extension we are compelled
 to wait until further study and observation have more pre
 cisely de<U+FB01>ned the character and value of these changes, and
 suggested all the important gravitation-disturbanees            of long
 period to which they may be plausibly referred.          We may <U+FB01>nd,
 however, in the attraction of Jupiter, one of the possible causes
 of the 10 to 11 year period, while mutation, precession, geological
 upheaval and depression, change of seasons, accumulation or
 diminution of polar ice, and the shifting position of the centre
 of gravity of our planetary system, must all necessarily con
 tribute to the production of gradual changes in the terrestrial
gravitation currents.      The belief does not, therefore, seem unrea
 sonable that the feeble vibrations of the tremulous needle may
not only furnish us with a delicate scale for weighing (as we
have already approximately done) the huge mass of the sun,
but may also aid us in the discovery and veri<U+FB01>cation of other
important cosmical phenomena, and the assignment of their
appropriate laws.
    Although it is probable that terrestrial magnetism is mainly
owing to currents circulating above the surface, it is well known
that. there are also earth-currents which exert an appreciable
modifying in<U+FB02>uence.         I  am con<U+FB01>dent that they will be found
equally obedient to the laws of gravitation, which affect every
particle of_the earth’s body, modifying the crystalline

      The inclination presents some anomalies that are dif<U+FB01>cult to

                                            striking and perplexing as
they did to Hudson and Herschel in their examination of the
influence of heat on the barometer (Proc. Amer. Phil. Soc. vol. ix.
p. 283), and to Sabine in his discussions of the semiannual de
clination curves (St. Helena Obs. 2. cxix.).         But the disappear
ance, in the progress of our investigations, of these once seem
ingly insurmountable dif<U+FB01>culties—the wonderful coincidence in
the general features of the gravitation and magnetic currents—
and the it priori probability that all disturbing forces, of whatever
character or variety, will tend constantly to a mutual equilibrium
—encourage the belief that this apparent paradox may be like
wise susceptible of a simple interpretation which will drive it
from its latest lurking-place.
      I  can think at this moment of no more probable causes of the
Want of symmetry here spoken of, than the different distribution
of land and water in the two hemispheres, and the in<U+FB02>uence of
powerful alternating land and sea breezes.             A long series of
Connected observations at a number of new stations may perhaps
be required before it can be satisfactorily ascertained whether the
disturbances thus occasioned are suf<U+FB01>cient to account for all the
phenomena; but meanwhile it is interesting to observe the degree
of accordance that exists at northern inland stations like Phila
 delphia and Toronto, between the curves of vertical force and
force of wind, on the one hand, and those of horizontal force and
 barometric pressure on the other, as well as the agreement that
has been pointed out by Dr. Lloyd and Mr. Homer between the
annual curves of declination and of temperature.
XXIV.         On the Thermal Action in the lVire of a Voltaic Circuit
      as indicating that the current-force operates on the surface of a
      metallic conductor only, and not through its substance.        By
  .   JOHN JAMES \VATI-ms'ron, Esq.
        To the Editors  of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
          GENTLEMEN,
                   engaged on the subject of electric conduction,       I
 WHILE
    ‘         have  endeavoured in vain to discover if there is any
experimental       evidence on record of what seems generally taken

192            Mr.  J. J . Waterston on the Thermal  Action
for granted—viz. that in the voltaic circle electricity circulates
in the mass of the wire through every part of its transverse sec
tion, and is not con<U+FB01>ned, as with common electricity, to the sur
face only.      Professor Ohm’s formula, however excellent as a
guide   in   practice, is only empirical; and although one of the
terms    is the  transverse section of the wire, the accuracy with
which   it  applies to the various conditions of a circuit is no proof
of the electric current acting directly upon the interior of the
wire.     Heat simply is produced in the wire, which may or may
not be <U+FB01>rst wholly engendered upon its surface.         If on the sur
face alone, conduction would immediately convey it into the
interior; so that there is absolutely nothing to indicate the
exact locale of the primary thermal action, whether it takes
place on the surface alone, or whether in the interior alone, or
in both.
   Barlow and Harris have proved that the power of magnets
resides on their surface, and, of course, inductively in the space
exterior to that surface.       What if this should also be the case
with  the   current-force in a submarine cable ? would it not lead
to the adoption of <U+FB02>at conductors? would not a strip of silver
leaf or copper-foil 116th of an inch in breadth conduct as well
as the wires of the Atlantic cable?        Theoretical considerations
lead me to believe that it would, and that with a strip half an
inch in breadth we should have a conductor equal to a wire of
nearly half an inch diameter.         Ample surface of conduction
with corresponding low electromotive force (or, as it may other
wise be expressed, low electric pressure) seem to be essential to
the permanent success of long submarine cables; and as strength
of core is not required, it seems to me that the riband form of
conductor might well deserve a trial by those practically inter
ested in the question.
   The calori<U+FB01>c effects of discharges of static electricity and of
dynamic or voltaic electricity through wires of various gauges
have both been fully examined experimentally.           It will not be
disputed that in the former the primary thermal action takes
place only on the surface of the metal.         Now the law of this
with reference to wires of different diameters has been deduced
from Professor Riess’ s experiments, and is thus stated at page 224:
of the second volume of Dela Rive’s Treatise :—“ We may there
fore consider the following law as being well established:       then
the same quantity of electricity completely discharged in the same
interval of time traverses wires of the same nature but of di<U+FB02>'erent
diameters, each wire experiences an elevation of temperature inde
pendent of its length, and inversely proportional to the fourth power
of its radius.”
   The quantity of material in an inch of the thicker wire is

                            in the Wire                 of a Voltaic Circuit.                            193
greater   than that of an inch in length of the thinner in the
 ratio of the square of radius; so that if the rise of temperature
 is inversely proportional to the fourth power of diameter or
 radius, the heat-force engendered in an inch length of the wire
 is inversely proportional to the square of the diameter; and if
 the elimination takes place on the surface of the wire, the force
 engendered on a square inch of that surface is inversely propor
 tional to the cube of the diameter.
    Assuming that the heat evolved in the wire of a voltaic cir
enit is also produced on its surface only, we may compute from
Ohm’s formula the ratio between the diameter of the wires
and the heat evolved on a square inch of their surfaces respec_
tively.       I
             have made this calculation (see the appended note),
and <U+FB01>nd that the ratio is precisely the same as the above.
    It seems dif<U+FB01>cult after this to believe that there can be any
difference in the modus operandi : if it is the surface alone that
is primarily a<U+FB02>'ected in one case, it must be the same in the
other.

adequate explanation of the low position of the limit of elasticity.
The permanent elongations observed, Merin thinks, need not
necessarily depend on- an actual elongation of the <U+FB01>bres, but
might rather arise from an alteration of the connecting joint, or
from     stretching of the bars themselves.

                     the Limit of Elasticity in Metals.                  195
to enable the reader to       judge of the trustworthiness" of my oh
serVations, I will describe the apparatus and the mode of obser—
vation which I adopted, limiting myself to what is most essential.
                         § 2. Mode of Observation.
    The kinds of     steel and iron which I used were prepared <U+FB01>'om
Swedish      ores, in the form of rolled, partly round and-partly
rectangular bars 6 feet in length 3 the round ones were half an
inch in diameter, and the square ones half an inch in the side.
     The stretching-experiments          were made with the Fuller’s
machine* used by Lagerhjelm in the year 1828, in which
the bars were fastened between an hydraulic press on the one
hand, and a lever with unequal arms on the other; the latter
increased the load on the scale twcntyfold.             To measure the
lengthening of the bars tested, a couple of small <U+FB01>nely graduated
scales were used, the “Index” scale and the “ Measuring
                                                                           ”
scale, which were screwed on the bars at a distance from each
other of 5 Swedish feet. Above, on each scale, a powerful micro
scope was <U+FB01>xed on a large pair of wooden beam compasses,
which by means of a fork was <U+FB01>rmly <U+FB01>xed with its ends against
the scales, and therefore against the bars under examination.
Its weight was almost entirely got rid of by suitably adjusted
compensatory Weights.           There' was also an arrangement by
which the compass was compelled to follow the index-scale, so
 that a small deviation was suf<U+FB01>cient to place the index-micro
 scope on the zero-point: the real measuring was effected by
 means of the micrometer-screw on the microscope above _the
 measuring-scale.
    A division of the measuring-scale was almost exactly 02 mil
lim. ; a turn of the micrometer-screw almost a quarter of a divi
 sion, or 0'05 millim.         The direct reading of the milled head
 Went to hundredths ofa turn, or 00005 millim.              It is thus seen
 that the accuracy of the apparatus is far greater than what is
required.
     As far as the excellence of the arrangement is concerned, it
 may be mentioned that the distance of the parallel hairs in
 each microscrope is about 0'7 of a turn of the screw, or 0'04
 millim.; according to which, the sum of the errors made in
    '  These experiments were instituted in the summer of 1862, on behalf
 of the committee which had for its object to ascertain the applicability of
 Swedish iron and steel as material for railways.
    The <U+FB01>tting up of this machine, and the essential arrangement ofo the
 measuring-instruments used, were e<U+FB02>'ected by the care of M. C. A.Ang
 Btriim, who also be an the breaking-experiments which I afterwards con
 tinued.   The experiments on elasticity proper were mostly made by myself,
 but in part by Engineer K. W.

 <U+FB01>xing the microscope could not exceed 0'02 millim., or 0'1 of
 a division as a maximum.  Notwithstanding the observations in
 the commonest case exhibited an agreement to                     of a

 taken, and for the following reasons.                            _
    As will subsequently be shown, the permanent elongations
 increase considerably with greater loads, and the bars become
 then extremely susceptible of the stretching forces.       Provided
 now that in using Fuller’s machine the tension of the bar                          has
 already been so increased that         able to raise the lever With
                                              it   is

occurs, however carefully the pumping (that                      is,

                             is

various experiments, however,         will be found that the scale

                                    a

tion of great loads       cannot be of interest to investigate the
                             it
course of the elongations otherwise than approximately, and an
extreme <U+FB01>neness in the measurement would be here merely spe
cious and therefore unnecessary.
                          §   3.    Limit      of  Elasticity.
   In the question of stretching, the theoretically correct de
<U+FB01>nition of the limit of elasticity would be this—the highest
load for the unit of surface which the bar investigated can bear
without its undergoing the slightest permanent elongation after
removing the load.     But       clear that the determination of
                                    it   is
this highest load depends greatly on the goodness of the instru
ments used for measuring lengths, and can be lowered in the
same degree as the accuracy and sharpness of the said measuring
apparatus     increased; for this reason
              is                            has been thought ne

                   a

of length*.                                                                               '

                   the Limit of Elasticity in Metals.                    197
determining experimentally the limit of elasticity thus defined,
there are in certain cases exceptionally great dif<U+FB01>culties.
    In his <U+FB01>rst paper on the elasticity of bodies, Wertheim* says
that before beginning the actual observations a stretching of
the bar must take place; but the stretching is never complete,
he adds, for even in the <U+FB01>rst loads small permanent clongations
are observed, which, as he then maintains, depend on the stretch
ing.     He therefore loaded the wire with a weight suf<U+FB01>ciently
great for the stretching, which he now allowed to serve as start
ing-point for the subsequent measurements, whereby the pre
sent length of the wire was considered the original length.
    This method, applicable perhaps in wires, is inadmissible, it
seems to me, in bars of greater section.             A rolled bar is never
completely straight, but      has   a   number of bendings.      If by load
ing the bar it is to be stretched straight, this cannot be done
without the bar undergoing at the same time a permanent elon
gation ; for it is evident that it is only when the bar is so eon
sidcrably stretched that a permanent elongation results, and the
particles assume a new position of equilibrium, that a return of
 the crooked part of the bar to its old form is no longer possible.
But the elongation observed consists of the straightening of the
 bendings, as well as of the permanent elongation necessary for
 this stretching; and these cannot be separated. It is therefore
 impossible with perfect accuracy to determine the original posi
 tion of the bars, and therefore also to <U+FB01>nd accurately the limit
 of elasticity.   The error in the determination becomes greater
 in proportion as the load for stretching the bar is great; for
 then, as I shall show, the limit of elasticity can by stretching be
 raised not merely beyond its original value, but, in short, to any
extent.
          § 4. Raising the   Limit of Elasticity by Stretching.
     The subsequently adduced observations show that a succes
 sive stretching of a bar can actually raise the limit of elasticity.

      § 5. On the Diminution         of the Limit of Elasticity by Heat.
     By heating and by subsequent cooling, the limit of elasticity
of metals can be very considerably diminished.                       This has been
shown by Wertheim in his experiments on elasticity.                        For when
he investigated the drawn wire without any previous heating,
and at another time after heating, he found the limit of elasticity
so changed that, after heating, it was

     Although Wertheim’s experiments show completely the power
of heat to lower the limit of elasticity, I may be allowed to ad
duce an example from my experiments which                           also a<U+FB01>'ords' an

      A bar of hard steel was placed in a Fuller’s machine and sur
rounded by a thick cast-iron tube (internal diameter =2'25
inches, length     :4     t'eet) in which three thermometers were in
 serted, in order to indicate the temperature of the air in the
tube which surrounded the bar. The cast-iron tube, suitably
supported, was closed at its ends by covers provided with a sut
<U+FB01>ciently wide hole for the bar to move freely. Above the cast
iron tube was a gas-tube which served as heating-apparatus.
      By carefully    reading       the thermometer            and corresponding
 regulation of the gas-tap, the temperature could be kept tole
rably constant.        That the mean temperature of the mass of air,
as indicated by the thermometers, was suf<U+FB01>ciently near the tem
 perature of the bar, is shown by the fact that, from the observa
 tions, the coef<U+FB01>cient of expansion of steel was obtained as fol
 lows

    Hence both from Wertheim’s and the above experiments, the
following rule can      be derived :—Tliat the limit of elasticity of a
metal can be lowered by heating*.
    § 6. Explanation of the Discrepancy between Hodgkinson’s
                            and Morin’s results.
    With the aid of the two principles, that the limit of elasticity
can be raised by stretching and lowered by heating, it may be
explained how it is that Morin’s results differ so materially from
those of Hodgkiuson, if it is considered that the former worked
with wires of 2'5 to 0'2 millim. in diameter, and the latter with
bars.
    It is obvious that if the wire has gone through the screw
plate, it must be considerably stretched, and the limit of elasti
city lie too high.      If the wire had passed several times through
the screw-plate, its limit of elasticity could easily be determined
with accuracy. To illustrate this assertion, I will in the following
consider the case more closely where the stretching took place
several times successively with the same load.
    Whether the bars used by Hodgkinson were rolled or forged
   '  The truth of this follows also from the well-known] fact, that the
metals in a warm state can be forged more easily than when cold, and are
also easier to work after they have once been heated.                    '

                    the Limit 0f Elasticity in Metals.              201
is not stated.     But doubtless neither rolling nor forging could
produce in these bars a stretching at all comparable with that
produced by drawing the wire.          The limit of elasticity is there
fore here quickly attained.          As already remarked, it is not
necessary with Morin to dispute entirely the permanent elonga
tions observed by Hodgkinson.
     Far from favouring one view, and rejecting the other, we
may assume that both Morin and Hodgkinson have reason for
their views—the former as regards the high position of the
limit of elasticity in wires, the latter as regards its low position
in the case of bars.      The di<U+FB01>‘erence in the results, it must there
fore be assumed, lies in the different treatment which the ma
 terial of the two observers had previously undergone.
    § 7. On the Permanent Elongations        on repeated stretching with
                              the same  Load.
     In the foregoing it has been shown that the permanent elon
 gations continually increase with increasing loads.           But even
 when the load is several times successively the same, each time
 an increased permanent elongation is produced.             The law for
 the relation between these elongations is certainly dependent on
 the position of the point of the curve at which the experiment
 is made; yet the following data, which are the means of a num
 ber of such cases observed, may render evident the phenomenon
 in question.     If  the following increments of the elongation be
 compared with that which the bar underwent when it was
 stretched for the <U+FB01>rst time with the given load, the following
 values are obtained :—
                                 TABLE   IV.

     In <U+FB01>g. 4, Plate III., the ordinates represent the order of the
 numbers of the stretchings, and the abscissa: the corresponding
 total elongations, thus 1'00, 1'55, 1'92, &c.
     It is true the new permanent elongation which is here each
  time obtained is always smaller and smaller, and it would con
  sequently be supposed that after a great number of loads no new
  permanent elongation would be observed.            But even if such a
  limit could be attained, it is probable that after the lapse of a
  long time a new permanent elongation would arise notwith

202               M. R. Thalén       on the Determination       of
standing that the load was not increased.              For it may in general
be noticed that     in this kind of investigation, time, as Wertheim
has already showed*, exercises an important in<U+FB02>uence, which
Hodgkinson, indeed, endeavoured to determine quantitatively. In
my experiments l have continually noted the in<U+FB02>uence of time,
although the apparatus, on account of a leak in the hydraulic
press, did not allow any measurements.
   If the load be taken smaller than that which the bar has
already borne, no permanent elongation is perceived before the
load in magnitude is nearest the greatest which has already been
applied.     If the latter load is exceeded, increments occur in the
permanent elongations, and increase in the same measure the
more rapidly the more the bar had been previously stretched.
 (See Table I. and <U+FB01>g. 1.)
   If this be applied to a metal wire which has been conside
rably stretched in drawing, the permanent clongations, accord
ing to the above, must at <U+FB01>rst be but slightly perceptible.                    But
when the magnitude of the load approaches that at which it was
drawn, permanent elongations must arise, which with greater
loads are very perceptiblcf. It is thus easy to see that the limit
of elasticity in wires must be capable of sharp de<U+FB01>nition.
   If now the loads are taken several times successively just as
large as or less than those which the bar has already borne,
and the are then gradually increased, a peculiar phenomenon is
observed; which deserves a closer attention.               It is illustrated by
<U+FB01>g. 5, to which the Table below} belongs, and by <U+FB01>g. 1 with

place with 980 pounds in all.       The load was now increased to
1040 pounds and upwards.         The curve for the permanent elon
gations (<U+FB01>g. 5) has now the same direction which it had before
using the equal loads of 980 pounds.            Fig. 1 shows quite
the same phenomenon with the loads 850 and 966 pounds.
Before the curve again assumes its old direction the bar appears
to give up as much to the permanent elongations as it had
previously been stretched.      Hence an increase of 50 pounds on
the square dec. line in the load, immediately after repeated stretch
ing-experiments with equally great or smaller loads, did not
produce the same elongation as before.         Thus it is seen that
the form of the curve is ultimately quite independent of the

 2044                       M. R. Thalén     on the Determination     of
  manent elongations are in general small, passes then through
 the point at which the curvature attains its maximum, and here
  upon is almost horizontal.       At this latter part of the curve the
  bar is most susceptible of loads.       The previous tolerably stable
 position of equilibrium of the particles appears now to be quite
 displaced.    If the bar has been so much lengthened that the
 curve is convex as regards the abscissa axis, the new positions
 of equilibrium are certainly more stable than they were before;
 but the smallest increase of load, even the same load, can dis
 turb anew the relative position of the particles, and therefore
 produce permanent clongations.            The curve which was <U+FB01>rst
 convex is again concave ; it more and more endeavours to become
 horizontal, and thus indicates that the permanent elongations
 increase more and more until fracture ensues.
    To this description, in its general features, of what takes place
 in stretching might be added, that                   if,
                                             after the bar has been torn,
 the stretching-experiments       be continued with the pieces, the
 curve continues in the old direction, provided blisters in the bars
 did not cause the break*. If the curve on <U+FB01>rst breaking was as
 good as horizontal, the new tearing cannot be specially greater
 than that just observed, but the permanent elongation may of
course increase so much the more; for            has been seen that
                                                            it           a      if
bar has been torn twice successively, and both times with the same
load, the addition in the permanent elongation can amount in
the hardest steel to 1'5 decimal line for          Swedish foot, and in

the curve has a more ascending direction than in the other kinds.
See, for instance, <U+FB01>gs. 1 and 4.    In general it may be said that
the radius of curvature is smaller the softer the material ; hence
it is least in iron.
        § 9. On the Point      of the Maximum of Curvature.
   It is perhaps super<U+FB02>uous to remark that the quality of a ma_
terial may be judged, not merely by the position of the two points
of the curve which indicate the limit of elasticity and the tear,
but that the curve must be considered in its totality. But since
the form of the curve is very complicated, and its equation can
not probably be determined without much trouble, it is only
possible in each case to reproduce it graphically.
   Yet if in comparative experiments of this kind, for ascertain
ing the greater or less applicability of di<U+FB02>'erent ores for a given
purpose, it is necessary to choose a determinate point of the
curve as point of comparison, I do not hesitate to propose that
at which the greatest curvature takes place.     In my experiments
with rolled bars, those of the same kind have exhibited a special
agreement precisely in reference to the position of this point,
which cannot be said of the limit of elasticity.
   To determine practically the position ot' greatest curvature
from the <U+FB01>gure is extremely easy, the more so since the curve
has the remarkable property, that in the neighbourhood and on
both sides of the said point it is symmetrical.        On the axis
about which symmetry takes place is the least radius of cur
vature.
   The point in question has, too, over the so-called limit of elas
ticity, the advantage that it is indicated by the curve itself, and
has, we may say, a physical signi<U+FB01>cance, which is not the case
with the point of the limit of elasticity.     From what has been
said, it is obvious that just after passing through the point of
greatest curvature the permanent elongations are of real signi<U+FB01>
cance ; and, it may be added, these elongations are so marked
that, at any rate with bars 5 feet in length, they may be observed
with the greatest ease with the naked eye; from which it is clcar
that at a time when the permanent elongation was indeed known,
but the measuring-instruments had only a small degree of pre
cision, the point in question at which the curvature is a maxi
mum must have been designated as the point at which the per
manent elongations begin—that        is,
                                      as the limit of elasticity.
    From the important signi<U+FB01>cance which have sought to attach
                                               I
to the point of maximum curvature, and from the preference
which would give to
     I                     above that of the limit of elasticity, the
                          it
conclusion must not be drawn that          consider this point free
                                           I
from all the errors which are incidental to the limit of elasticity.

206      On the Determination                           of the Limit of Elasticity in Metals.
It has above been shown that the limit of elasticity can be dis
placed; that this is also the case with the point of maximum
curvature is clear from <U+FB01>g. 1. Hence it cannot well be considered
an absolute measure for the quality of the material; but it may
be regarded as a relatively good one, provided the bars inves
tigated have undergone exactly the same treatment.

     For the      sake     of its simplicity,                         a remarkable relation           may here
be adduced which is observed between the loads at the                                                      point of

    On the basis of the preceding mean values we can therefore
  ive as a practical rule,—
    “A rolled bar (of Swedish ores), whose curve has its greatest
curvature under aload =M Swedish pounds on the square deci
mal line, tears when this load is increased 60 per cent. in the
case of iron, and in the case of steel when it is doubled.”
    This practical rule is still more appropriate (provided that only
 approximate determinations are concerned) if we remember
that the scales with which every rolled bar is coated just fall of
at the load which the bar bears in its passage through the point
of greatest curvature.           Taking notice, then, of the load at which
scales fall off in quantity, we know that this load in the case of
iron must be multiplied by 1'6, and in the case of steel by 2'0
to obtain the load at which it would break.                         Hence in such a
case a direct measure of the permanent elongation is unnecessary.
    This practical rule obtains in the case of the kinds of iron and
steel of the most ordinary Swedish ores, and                         I   have reason to
think that it may be extended to some kinds, at any rate, of
English iron.
  XXVI.    Supplementary Researches in Hydrodynamics.—Part                            I.
         By Professor CHALLIS, IlI.A., F.R.S., F.R.A.S.*
      three articles contained in the Numbers of the Philosophi
 IN  cal  Magazine for June, August, and October 1862—0ne
on the general differential equations of Hydrodynamics, and the
two others on the mathematical theory of the vibrations of an
elastic <U+FB02>uid—I have gone through a revision of the proofs of
the principal hydrodynamical theorems which                            I  had given in
previous   communications.                  The      theorems     were     reconsidered
with  reference   more      especially       to    their   application in the Undu
latory Theory of Light.               Such application is made of them in
the December Number of the same year, in an Article entitled
“Explanations of phenomena of Light on the hypothesis of
undulations.”       The phenomena there explained are restricted to

those which depend only on properties of the aetherial medium
in which the undulations are supposed to be generated and pro
pagated. In three subsequent articles, contained in the Numbers
for December 1863, June 1864, and the Supplementary Num
ber of December 1864,      I  have employed the same theorems in
investigations relating to double refraction and dispersion.  The
theories of phenomena of this class require hypotheses to be
made respecting the forms and properties of the ultimate con
stituents of visible and tangible substances, and are in that
respect distinguished from those which refer exclusively to pro
perties of the aether.     Finally, in the Philosophical Magazine
for May of the present year, I have discussed several points
which, on a review of the arguments employed in the explana
tions of phenomena of both classes, appeared to require correc
tion or con<U+FB01>rmation.      There was no occasion to indicate parti
cularly  the  application of the hydrodynamical theorems to cases
of diifraction, because the usual theoretical treatment of these
phenomena accords well with the characteristics, as determined
by my analysis, of the undulations of a continuous elastic fluid.
I  consider, therefore, that I have now suf<U+FB01>ciently exhibited the
principles of the application of hydrodynamics     in the Undula
tory Theory of Light.
   But the propositions of hydrodynamics are, I maintain, re
quired for ascertaining the laws of the other physical forces, as
well as those of light. 1 have, in fact, applied them to some extent
in theoretical investigations relative to heat, electricity, galvanism,
magnetism, and gravity.       With the view of carrying on these re
searches further, I recently submitted to another revision the prin
ciples on which the hydrodynamical propositions rest, and the
processes of reasoning employed in proving them ; and the object
of the present communication is to give the results of this new
inquiry. In treating of the dynamics of undulations, so far as
relates to phenomena of light, it is only necessary to consider
by what action they cause vibrations of the atoms of sensible
bodies, or, conversely, the undulations which the vibrations of the
atoms produce in the aether.       But in order, on the same prin
ciples, to account for the other physical forces, it is required to
investigate the dynamical action of the aether in producing not
only vibrations, but also permanent motions of translation, of
atoms.     My previous researches pointed to two different modes
in which the latter kind of motion might be impressed on
spherical atoms.      In the one the motions result from pressures
of the nether accompanying its vibrations; in' the other, from
pressures accompanying        its steady motions—that     is,
                                                           motions
which   are functions   of space  but   not of time.  The forces of
heat and of aggregation, and the force of gravity, are, accord

ing to these views, referable to :ethcrial action of the <U+FB01>rst kind,
and the forces of electricity, galvanism, magnetism, and dia
magnetism to aetherial action of the second kind.        I propose in
this communication to treat only of motions of translation of
a spherical solid produced by the vibrations of an elastic <U+FB02>uid.
     Here it may be remarked that the hydrodynamical questions
about to be discussed are such as can be answered by ma
thematical reasoning alone.       I assume that there will be no dis
pute about the fundamental properties of the fluids ; so that to
answer the proposed questions it is only required to discover the
appropriate mathematical processes.        The same remark applies
to the questions discussed in the Numbers of the Philosophical
Magazine for June, August, and October 1862.            What I have
now to say will consist in great measure of a revision of the
arguments contained in those communications,            reference to
which will be made by citing the numbers of the articles (from
1 to
       48) into which their contents are divided.    Ibeg, therefore,
that the processes of reasoning employed in the present commu
nication, as well as in the three just mentioned, may be regarded
quite apart from the physical applications which I have speci<U+FB01>ed
above.     It is very evident that the laws of the physical forces
cannot be referred to the motions and pressures of an elastic
medium, unless the principles and the methods of mathematically
investigating such motions and pressures be well ascertained
previously.
     On reviewing the contents of the article in the Number for
June 1862,     I  found nothing requiring notice before coming to
art. 10.     Towards the end of that article the assertion is made,
as a consequence of antecedent reasoning, that “ the propaga
tion of a solitary wave is not possible.”         This conclusion is
drawn from a method of solving the problem of motion propa
gated from a centre, to which objection cannot be taken by
 those, at least, who maintain that there are not more than two
 general hydrodynamical       equations.   Further, I have asserted
 that “ this conclusion involves another, that the variation of
 the condensation from point to point at a given time cannot be
 eXpressed by a discontinuous function; for if that were the case,
 the possibility of the uniform propagation of a solitary wave
 would necessarily follow.”       And yet such discontinuity appears
 to be matter of fact, judging from what is known by experience
  to take place in air.    The articulation of consonants and words
  is evidence that we can impress on the air forms of condensation
  not necessarily expressible by continuous functions.      Moreover,
  the principle I have employed in proving the law of equal pres
  sure, viz. that the parts of a perfect <U+FB02>uid are divisible without
  assignable force by an in<U+FB01>nitely thin partition, leads to the same

inference.      For if such a partition be made to separate parts of
the <U+FB02>uid in a state of condensation or rarefaction, and at the
 same time to partake of the motion of the <U+FB02>uid in contact with
it,  since no assignable force        thus introduced,
                                       is                       evident that
                                                                       it   is
 the condensation       is
                         only  required  to satisfy the  condition  of being
 equal   on the   opposite   sides  of  the  partition.           not   It
                                                                      neces  is
sary that the changes       of  condensation    from   point   to point at                       a
 given instant on the one side and on the other should be ex
pressed   by  the same function.      Consequently, the partition being
 conceived to be removed, ordinates drawn to represent the con
 densation will have consecutive values, but the directions of the
tangents to the line joining their extremities may change per
saltum.     Hence the motion of          given element
                                            a                 not generally

expressible    by   a single function, but              by
                                                   different functions, in
such manner, however, that the velocity always changes gradatim.

               by is

acted upon          a central force, which from time to time changes
abruptly both as to law and amount.              The path of the particle
would in that case consist of portions of different curves so
joined together as to have common tangents at the points of
junction.      From the above considerations              will be seen that
                                                                  it

It  will not be necessary to repeat the process         which this          by
equation was obtained, as suf<U+FB01>cient details on this head are given
in arts. 14—22.    The <U+FB01>rst term and the factor b2 are due entirely
to the use that was made in that process of the third general
equation, which      the equation (3) obtained in art. 7.

As the above expressions for w and a- have been obtained ante
cedently to an arbitrary conditions of the motion, the inferences
drawn from      em must relate exclusively to circumstances
                  t                                               of

equal to z—xat-H,        follows that both the velocity and the
                                it

uniform propagation        independent of the magnitude of the

This result informs us that the condensation corresponding to                                                    a
positive value of w   greater than the rarefaction corresponding

to an equal negative value                  by   (Kg—1)          2);.     The reason for this
law   will be apparent          by
                         considering that, as the motion      wholly                              is
vibratory, the forward  excursion  of each particle must be equal
to its excursion backward, and that this will be the case        at                                    if        a
given instant the variation of a- for        given variation of 2 be
                                                            a
greater at    apoint of condensation than at the corresponding
point of rarefaction in the proportion in which' the density                                                     is
greater at the former point than at the latter.
   In the third place we may conclude that as the forms of the
expressions for w and a were obtained antecedently to the sup
position of any arbitrary disturbance, they must be applicable
generally to cases of disturbance producing vibratory motions.
Also since the equation (a)     exact, and no limitation was made
                                            is
as to the magnitude of the motion in obtaining the particular
solution now under consideration,       follows that that solution
                                                      it                                                      is
applicable to motions of all magnitudes.  But in proportionas
the motions are larger,  greater number

for w and 0' will have to be taken into account.   For the vibra
tions of a very elastic medium it is usually required to take
account only of the <U+FB01>rst term of each series.
   Another remark relating to the particular solution of (a) may
be suitably added here.   When the approximations to the values
of w and o' are restricted to the second order, the value of al is

uniformity of propagation, and the law of vibration expressed                              by
a  circular function, but also show that the principal vibrations

though the mathematical theories of sound and light usually take
account only of the <U+FB01>rst terms of the values of w and 0-, the
movements which the other terms represent coexist with those
that are principal, and in the case of sound have been actually

note.     Also the proof that the rate of propagation              exactly
uniform depends on the possibility of expressing w and a-            these          by
series.
    After the foregoing preliminaries, we may next consider in
what manner the values of w and o' are applicable in given cases
of motion.       The reasoning will at <U+FB01>rst be con<U+FB01>ned to approxi
mations of the <U+FB01>rst order; and the problem of rectilinear motion

such axes, both which, as well as the equation itself, are inde
pendent of arbitrary circumstances of the motion.        From the
<U+FB01>rst law we may infer that dr=dr', the time being given.       The
other, after supposing the motion to be composite in the manner
stated in art. 34, gives rise to a certain relation between V and

Theorems,” in the Philosophical Magazine for November 1853,
and also less completely in the October Number of 1862 (art.
35).    The latter investigation only takes account of changes of
velocity accompanied by changes of density, while the other in
cludes changes of velocity due to divergencics of the lines of
motion, and on that account is proper for our present purpose.
The reasoning is brie<U+FB02>y as follows.       Conceive a slender four
sided tube to be formed by four planes, two passing through one
of the focal lines and two through the other; and at the time
t let V and p be the velocity and density of the <U+FB02>uid, and m the
transverse section of the tube, at the distance 2 measured along
its axis from an arbitrary origin ; and let at the same time V',                               p',
m' be corresponding quantities at the distance 2+82. Then the
increment of <U+FB02>uid in the space between the sections in the small
      St
time  is    ultimately
                                    (Vprn—V'p'm')5[.
Also the difference between the condensations in two adjacent
spaces, each of length 5:, terminated towards the same parts                                   by
the sections m and m',    ultimately
                                   is

 The last equation shows that if            V  be supposed to consist      of parts
 V1 and    V,  such that    Vl=xaa         and   V9:   g),     these two motions
  may coexist, and that the former is propagated with the velocity
  Ka and varies inversely as the square of the distance, while the
  latter, not being accompanied by condensation, obeys the law of
  the central motion of an incompressible <U+FB02>uid.
      The laws of central motion that are independent of arbitrary
  circumstances having been thus obtained, we may now revert
  to the equations that apply to given arbitrary disturbances pro
  ducing central motion.         These equations for propagation from
  the centre are

   The dif<U+FB01>culty that previously occurred in the application of these

   foregoing argument that they are not proper for determining

   <U+FB02>uid which, both as regards time and space, are immediately
   acted upon by the arbitrary disturbance.                 For example, if the

    that portion of the impressed velocity which, not being accom
    panied by condensation, at least so far as the <U+FB01>rst approxima
    tion indicates, takes effect as if the <U+FB02>uid were incompressible,
    and then the amount which, being accompanied by the conden
    sation which the law of propagation requires, is propagated
    together with the condensation into space.       [I have given in
    stances of the determination of these two velocities for given
    disturbances in the Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical
    Society, vol. vii. part iii. pp. 310—346.]        The motion and
    condensation of all the elements not immediately impressed are
    to be inferred from the laws governing the mutual action of
    the parts of the <U+FB02>uid, which were demonstrated independently
    of arbitrary conditions.     From this argument it follows that
    the condensation propagated from a centre does not vary in
    versely as the distance, as is inferred from hydrodynami
    cal principles   which     Ihavc proved to be defective, but in
    versely as  the square of  the  distance.   (To this point I shall
    have to refer again.)      Also the argument by which it was
    shown that a solitary wave, either of condensation or i'arefaction,
    may be propagated without undergoing change when the motion
    is perpendicular to a plane, equally applies to the condensation
    accompanying central propagated motion.
       If, as a second example of central motion, we suppose a
    portion of the <U+FB02>uid, contained within certain limits of dis
    tance from the centre, to be condensed at a given instant in an
    arbitrary manner without initial velocity, it would be found on
    the same principles that two equal waves of condensation would
    be generated, and that one would be propagated towards, and
    the other from, the centre, the condensation and velocity in both
    varying inversely as the square of the distance.           I

       It will probably be noticed that no dif<U+FB01>culty like that which
    the foregoing argument is intended to meet, presented itself in
    the problem of the central motion of an incompressible <U+FB02>uid.
    The explanation of this difference may be readily given.         For
    an incompressible <U+FB02>uid the equation        becomes

velocity as that which is obtained when the arbitrary disturbance
is supposed to be a function of the distance from a centre.          On
account of this identity of the expression applicable to speci<U+FB01>c
disturbances producing central motion, with that which, being
derived from general antecedent considerations, gives the law of
the variation of the velocity in such motion, no dif<U+FB01>culty occurs
like that met with in the application of analysis to problems
relating to compressible <U+FB02>uids.
     The foregoing arguments have been adduced on account of
their havinga direct bearing upon the principles to be applied in
 the solution of the problem which was stated at the beginning of
 this communication to be its ultimate object, viz. to investigate
 the motions of a spherical solid submitted to the action of the
 vibrations of an elastic <U+FB02>uid for the purpose of ascertaining
 whether a permanent motion of translation results from such
 action.     The second Part of these researches will be devoted to
 the consideration of this problem.

       HE fourth    volume of the Annach dc Z’Observatoire Impérial
          de Paris came into my hands a few days ago; and in look
  ing through it I found in the appendix a paper by M. Lefort,
  giving an account of the great Cadastral Tables, constructed
  under the superintendence of Prony, and a copy of which is
  preserved in manuscript in the library of the observatory. After
   describing in minute detail the contents of the seventeen volumes,
   he proceeds to remark that “Delambrc, whose competence to
  form an opinion is unquestionable, has written, ‘ The great
   Cadastral Tables are not useful in common cases, but solely in
   extraordinary eases ; like th0se of Briggs, they will be the source
   whence will be derived whatever extension will be gchn to
   the Tables in common use. They will likewise serve as a basis
   of comparison for everything that has been done or will be done.’ ”

222                    Mr. R. Templeton               on a   Method of
M. Lefort continues, “Under this double relation it would                               be
undoubtedl    of much interest to have these Tables published;
but it won] appear still more desirable to make them first serve
for an edition to eight places of decimals, which would be of
commodious form and not necessitate the employment of second
differences.  Such Tables would be of extreme value in certain
calculations in geodesy, astronomy, and compound interest.”
M. Lefort would like to see more extensive tables of logarithms
published, but is reasonably enough frightened at columns of
ditferences.  There are, no doubt, many persons who will sym
pathize in M. Lefort’s desire to have the facilities which loga
rithms a<U+FB01>'ord for verifying complex formula: with a greater
amount of accuracy than the common tables permit, or who
may require logarithms to ten or twelve places for application
to geodetic or other computations, a preference being given
at the present day to exact operations rather than to the ap
proximative which were so much in vogue at the earl part of
the century.    It will be presently shown that these facilities are
accessible without adopting the suggestion of M. Lefort.           A
very compact   table of  not greater  bulk than would   add    three
tenths of an inch to the thickness of Hutton’s volume would
put it in the power of anyone accustomed to logarithmic cal
culations to <U+FB01>nd these numbers very readily, if only they would
consent to use logarithms also for <U+FB01>nding the corrections to be
applied to the tabular numbers.
    Let the common logarithmic formula be thus transformed:

   Here, adding to 6'140 &c. (which is found in the Tables) the
logarithm of n, we obtain the logarithm 5'9135173, which being
sought for in Hutton’s Tables (p. 149), the <U+FB01>rst few <U+FB01>gures are
8195, one-half to the nearest digit (the index 5 indicating its posi
tion) being subtracted leaves 59134763, which is the logarithm
of '00008 19363; this added to log 3141 gives the exact loga
rithm required*
   This is very simple and easy, the only puzzle being the index
and proper position of the <U+FB01>gures to those who are not much in
the habit of using these large numbers ; but two examples at the
bottom of each page of the Tables causes this dif<U+FB01>culty to be soon

half is to be added, not subtracted.

   In applying this formula, it is only necessary to replace what
ever be the index proper to the given number by the temporary
index 3, and to add in the constant log

given to seconds of arch in Hutton’s Tables, that       of 2° and                        is,
upwards.    Here we have the following rule*2—To the constant

   It will be obvious from the examples given, that we can for any
number, whose signi<U+FB01>cant <U+FB01>gures do not exceed seven more than
the tabular number, <U+FB01>nd the quantity required to complete its
logarithm.        It hence follows that if we can by any particular
process   <U+FB01>nd   a  larger number of preceding <U+FB01>gures, or larger value
for x, we shall always have it in our power to extend the value
so found to seven additional places, thereby advancing beyond
the ten places to which we have hitherto limited ourselves. This
may be done by determining                    factors whose product shall be
nearly   identical    with    the   <U+FB01>rst   eight digits of the given number.

greater complete square number, and <U+FB01>nd the remainder; to
this remainder add double the root of the square, increasing this
double by a single unit ; afterwards add continuously the series
of odd numbers which next follow that double root so increased,
until a succession of sums be obtained to such extent as may be
desirable.

 XXVIII.         On the Action of Nitric and Nitrous Acids on the Sul
     phocyanides.        By EDMUND WILLIAM DAVY, A.B., M.B..
     M.R.I.A., Professor of Agricultural Chemistry to the Royal
     Dublin Society, it‘c.*
       OME time since, having had occasion to test                 a sample of
          carbonate of potash (which        I  believed to be very pure), to
 ascertain if it was perfectly free from iron, and suitable for the
 purpose required, I was surprised, on dissolving a little of it in
 water and supersaturating the solution with some carefully
 puri<U+FB01>ed nitric acid, to <U+FB01>nd that the mixture, on the addition of a
 few drops of a solution of sulphoeyanidc of potassium, became of
 a reddish colour, indicating apparently the existence of a small
 quantity of iron in the mixture.           Conceiving that the coloration
 observed was caused by the presence of that metal, proceeded toI
 ascertain whether it existed in the acid or in the carbonate.                A
 few experiments        showed     me  that the   effect was  due  to the acid;
       I
 for found, on testing a diluted portion ofit with sulphocyanide
 of potassium, that it soon acquired the same reddish tint;
 whereas some of the carbonate of potash, after supersaturation
 with pure hydrochloric acid, did not acquire the reddish tinge
 on the addition of the sulphocyanide, or give the slightest indi
 cation of iron when tested with either the ferrocyanide or ferrid
 cyanide of potassium, clearly proving that the effect observed
 was alone attributable to the acid.               This I thought was rather
  singular, as the nitric acid I employed was very carefully pre
 pared by myself, and I believed that it was chemically pure.                 A
  considerable portion, however, of this acid being evaporated

 pure hydrochloric acid added to the minute residue which
 remained, and the evaporation repeated to destroy any nitric acid
 existing in       it,
                   found that this residue, being dissolved in water,
                       I
 gave,  both with the sulphocyanide and ferrocyanide of potassium,
 indications of the presence of      very minute quantity of iron,

 whichI    conceived was not at all su<U+FB02>icient to account for the
former very decided effects       had observed in treating the acid
                                           I
with sulphocyanide of potassium.
    It thus remaining doubtful whether the effect observed was
due to the action of the acid itself on the sulphocyanide or, at
least in part, to the trace of iron which was found to exist in                   it,
I  very carefully redistilled some of this nitric acid and having     ;
satis<U+FB01>ed myself that        was then perfectly free from iron (by
                                 it
testing in the manner just described),        tried its action on the

sulphocyanide,           when  I   found that the same reddening effect as
in the former case was produced, clearly showing that its pro
duction was independent of the presence of iron, and was caused
by the action of the acid on this salt.

the particular circumstances which      have just described,

sulphocyanide of potassium the red coloration developed itself,

point,    it gradually disappeared, leaving the mixture perfectly
transparent and colourless, the change being generally attended
with the evolution of very minute globules of gas.               The appli

becoming, as in the former cases, perfectly colourless.                  as   I
certained also, where the solution of sulphocyanide had been
heated with the nitric acid, and after developing the red colora
tion had become colourless, that,
     it                                      the mixture was then cooled

the same intense red colour        without    the  assistance of any heat;
and the same       Iafterwards found to be the case where these sub
 stances had more slowly reacted on each other at the ordinary
temperature.       These observations led me to infer that the colo

230            Prof. Davy   on the Action of Nitric and
ration was immediately due to the action of nitrous acid, or at
least to some lower oxide of nitrogen than nitric acid, produced
by the deoxidation of that acid, from its giving oxygen to the
constituents of a part of the sulphocyanide, whilst the reduced
portion of the acid, reacting on the rest, gave rise to the formation
of the red compound.       That this inference was correct, appeared
to be shown by the immediate and much more striking effect
which was produced by a portion of the same pure and colour
less nitric acid after it had suffered reduction to some extent by
its being made to act on a little alcohol, sugar, or starch, or
even by exposure to strong sunlight for a short time before the
addition of the sulphocyanide.        But what appeared to be still
more conclusive as to nitrous acid being the chief agent in the
formation of this peculiar red Combination were the following
facts z—Having prepared nitrite 0f potash by strongly heating
some pure nitrc, I found that a little of the salt so obtained,
being dissolved in water and mixed with some sulphocyanide of
potassium, developed instantly, and without the assistance of
heat, an intense blood-red coloration, after the addition of a few
drops of pure diluted hydrochloric or sulphuric acid had been
added to the mixture to set free the nitrous acid combined with
the potash.
    That the production of this red compound, under the circum
 stances described, is not con<U+FB01>ned to the combination of sulpho
 cyanogen with potassium, was shown by my obtaining it where          I
employed other sulphocyanidcs, as those of sodium, ammonium,
and silver, as well as with the hydrosulphocyanic acid itself; so
 that it is probable that it belongs to all the sulphocyanides,
which are either soluble, or the sulphocyanogen of which is
capable of liberation when acted on in the manner described.
    As to the reaction which takes place, or the exact nature of
this red compound which is formed when nitrous acid thus acts
on the sulphocyanides, it is very dif<U+FB01>cult to determine, owing
 chie<U+FB02>y to the great instability of this peculiar compound ; for it
is no sooner formed than it begins to decompose and disappear,
 evolving, amongst other gaseous products, the binoxide of nitro
 gen, which can be easily recognized by the usual tests for that
 substance; whilst the presence of sulphuric acid can be readily
 detected in the mixture.     But though this part of the subject is
 surrounded with many dif<U+FB01>culties,      I purpose continuing its in
vestigation in the hope of throwing some additional light on
 the nature of this interesting reaction.    In the meantime, how
ever, the observations I have made appear to me of su<U+FB02>icient
interest and importance to be placed on record as having some
practical hearings in an analytical point of view; for many cases
 may occur in different chemical researches where the production

 Saturn and its System.      By RICHARD A. Paoc-roa, B.A., late Scholar
     of St. John's College, Cambridge, and King's College. 8vo. pp. 252.
    London : Longman and Co.           1865.
             work contains a popular account of all the points of inter
 THISest       to be met with in the course of a detailed study of the
 motions and appearances of the planet Saturn.             Of course, when
 any astronomical work is termed popular, no more is intended than
 that it can be understood by persons acquainted with the elements
 of geometry and mechanics.        In this sense a work is called popular
 when it expounds methods and states results, but does not aim at
 applying the methods to the determination of the results. To read
 such a work requires a considerable expenditure of thought and
 attention, but not a special scienti<U+FB01>c training, it is therefore addressed
 to that large and intelligent class which has been not inaptly termed
 the " scienti<U+FB01>c laity.” Perhaps the best example of such a popular
 work is Sir J. Herschel’s ‘ Outlines of Astronomy ’—a work which,
 as is well known, makes serious demands on the reader's attention,
though it can be read by any ordinary well-educated man who will take
 the necessary trouble. To the same class belongs the work before us,
 and a very favourable specimen of the class it is.       Mr. Proctor <U+FB01>rst
 considers the simpler elements of Saturn’s orbit, and explains how,
 from its observed motions, these could be determined by astrono
 mers furnished with imperfect instruments, but acquainted with the
 fact that the Sun is the centre of the planetary world.           He then
proceeds to consider the determination of Saturn’s orbit considered
 as an ellipse, and to trace historically the course of the discovery of
the ring, the satellites, and the other phenomena disclosed by tele
scopic inspection. He next investigates with considerable minuteness
the changes in the planet's appearance as it describes its orbit, in
consequence of the inclination of the plane of its rings to that of the
ecliptic.     These form the subject of the <U+FB01>rst four of the seven chap
ncver to argue (in the hope of convincing them of their error) with those
suffering under any of these forms of mental hallucination, for I know it
would be labour thrown away; nor do I see reason to follow a different
course on the present occasion.      I shall be happy to forward a copy of
the syllabus of the lecture which has drawn forth Prof. Young’s ire to any
one taking an interest in the subject.

2341                  Notices respecting New Books.
ters into which the book is divided.       The last three chapters are
taken up with discussions as to the physical constitution of the rings
(which Mr. Proctor uncompromisineg regards as a congeries of
 minute satellites), of the great inequality, and of the habitability of
Saturn.
    It is plain, from the above brief summary, that a great many things
contained in the book would apply with slight variation to other
planets; but even in these respects there is a considerable gain in
 the way of distinctness when properties common to several planets
 are discussed with reference to one.       Saturn, however, possesses
 numerous striking peculiarities which render it well worthy of sepa
 rate treatment.     These are enumerated by Sir W. Herschel in an
 admirable passage quoted by Mr. Proctor (pp. 60 8t 61) :—“ There
is not another object in the heavens that presents us with such a
variety of extraordinary phenomena as the planet Saturn ; a magni
<U+FB01>cent globe encompassed by a stupendous double ring; attended by
 seven satellites; ornamented with equatorial belts; compressed at
the poles; turning on its axis; mutually eclipsing its rings and sa
tellites, and eclipsed by them; the most distant of the rings also
turning on its axis, and the same taking place with the furthest of
its satellites; all the parts of the system of Saturn occasionally re
<U+FB02>ecting light to each other—the rings and moons illuminating the
nights of the Saturnian, the globe and moons illuminating the dark
parts of the rings, and the planet and rings throwing back the sun's
beams upon the moons when they are deprived of them at the time
of their conjunctions."
    We venture to think that the seventh chapter has been unfortu
nately named.        When a chapter is headed the “Habitability of
Saturn," we are led to expect a discussion of the question whether
the conditions requisite for the support of life exist in Saturn; but
instead we are presented with an account of what would be more
<U+FB01>ttingly termed the physical aspects presented to an imaginary inha
bitant of Saturn—such as the variations of the force of gravity, the
amount of heat and light received from the sun, the lengths of the
Saturnian day and year, the appearance of the satellites and rings,
8:0. : these and kindred topics form a very proper conclusion to the
work. but it is not quite fair to give them as a discussion of the
habitability of Saturn.     The fact is, that the data for such a discus
sion do not really exist; e. g. nothing, we believe, is known as to
the composition of Saturn’s atmosphere.          It might, for alight we
know, consist of nitrogen saturated with aqueous vapour; and if by
any chance it did so, this, we suppose, would be conclusive as to the
question of Saturn's habitability.
    What sort of positive argument can-be alleged to justify the pre
valent belief in “ Saturnians "? Mr. Proctor answers, "when we
consider the analogy of our own planet, it seems impossible to doubt
that Saturn is inhabited by living creatures of some sort.” We think,
on the contrary, that it is very possible to entertain doubts on the
subject, and, to tell the truth, we are inclined to regard the preva
lent belief as little better than a prejudice, But putting that on one

                      Notices respecling New Books.                  235
side, let us    consider “ the analogy of our own planet."     There are
two heavenly bodies in regard to the habitahility of which we can
speak with tolerable certainty; the one is the Earth, the other is the
Moon.        If we knew the Earth alone, the argument of analogy would
lead to the conclusion that all the planets are inhabited; if we knew
the Moon alone, the same argument would lead to the conclusion
that none are inhabited: two considerations which show that the
argument of analogy, when thus employed, proves nothing.
     When we descend to details, the negative argument becomes
lamentably strong. Let us put the case thus :—Suppose the Earth,
peopled as at present, to have the conditions of life on its surface
brought into conformity with those known to exist on the surface of
 Saturn; viz., suppose the length of the day to be reduced by more
 than one-half, the length of the year increased thirtyfold, the heat
 and light of the sun reduced to one-ninetieth of its present amount,
 and extensive tracts of the regions on either side of the equator to
 be exposed to eclipses lasting for several years (as men count years)
 -suppose this to be done, and we may be pretty certain that all the
 higher forms of life would be destroyed by the change, and this
 irrespectiver of any of the numerous adverse possibilities of which
 we gaVe a specimen above.         Of course it is possible that the laws
 of the variability of species, and of natural selection (supposing such
 laws to have any real existence) acting on the remaining lower forms,
 might in time give rise to races of highly organized beings, totally
 different from anything which we have seen or can conceive; but
 though this is possible, there is nothing to show that it would be so
 in   fact.
     Above we took it for granted that there is conclusive evidence
 that the Moon is uninhabitable.        Mr. Proctor has an elaborate note
 of six closely printed pages on the Habitability of the Moon, which
 in its way is really very curious. He very properly regards the
 question as involved in the secondary question whether the Moon
 has an atmosphere.        To all appearance he would answer this ques
 tion in the negative, were his judgment not oppressed by " the ana
  logy of our planet.”       Accordingly, as the evidence will not allow
  him to believe that there exists a gaseous atmosphere, he suggests
  that it may have become solid. His notion is that the Moon has
  become intensely cold, and that her surface is covered with glaciers—
  not glaciers here and there, but that what we see on her surface is a
  frozen ocean, hemmed in by frozen continents covered with glaciers—
  ice everywhere—all her pleasant seas and rivers fast bound in iron
  misery.       And as though this were not enough, he goes on to
   tell us that “it is conceivable that the Moon’s mass may have be-'
   come so intensely cold that the atmospheric envelope, once clothing
  it, has been condensed into the liquid, and thence into the solid
         "              We have tried, but cannot conceive it. When we
   form     (p. 212).
   remember that the temperature of the Earth’s surface is determined
   by the solar radiation, and not by the interior heat or cold, we can
   not help thinking that the same must be true of the Moon, and
   therefore - cannot conceive     how the gases can ever have become

  liquid.     And when we further consider that her surface undergoes
  for a fortnight at a time the uninterrupted blaze of the sun unmodi
  <U+FB01>ed by air or vapour, we feel pretty certain that if her surface were
  covered with ice, 0. large portion of it would be turned into vapour
  long before the fortnight was over.         What would become of a lump
  of solid oxygen under the same treatment we do not know.
      It is much to be regretted that Mr. Proctor should have dis<U+FB01>gured
  a. very meritorious book by these crude speculations.        \Ve trust that
  a second edition will be soon called for, and that he will take that
  opportunity of correcting his errors by means of a little judicious
  omission.

  RESULTS OF BLASTING-EXPERIMENTS                MADE WITH NITROGLYCE—
       RINE AT VIEILLE-MONTAGNE MINE. NOTE BY M. NABEL.
       HE   greatest  advantage of nitroglycerine consists in the fact that
          when it is used   a force can be introduced into the blast-hole of a
  mine ten times as great as when powder is used. Hence arises a great
  economy in manual labour, the importance of which is understood
  when it is remembered that the labour of the miner represents,
  according to the hardness of the rock, from <U+FB01>ve to twenty times the
 value of the powder required—a saving therefore which will often
  amount to 50 per cent.
     The use of this substance is very simple. If the blast-hole of the
 mine is <U+FB01>ssured, it must be lined with clay in order to render it
 tight. Nitroglycerine is then poured in, and the upper part of the
 hole is <U+FB01>lled with water; in the nitroglycerine is then introduced a
 safety-match of suitable length, at the end of which is pressed a
 strong percussion-cap. The operation is <U+FB01>nished, and it is only
 necessary to put <U+FB01>re to the match.          Sand may also be used to close
 the hole of the mine above the charge; but the operation is then a
 little more complicated. In all cases ramming is useless.
     The following are the results of three experiments made with
 nitroglycerinc in the open works at the mine of Altenbcrg in the pre
 sence of M. von Deckcn, M. Noeggerath, and several German and
 Belgian mining engineers.
     The rock in which the blast-holes were placed is strati<U+FB01>ed do
lomite, a stratum internally hard and sound, but traversed by nume
rous <U+FB01>ssures, and merely super<U+FB01>cially decomposed at the points of
contact with the strati<U+FB01>cation.
     First experimenl.—A blast-hole of iths of an inch (34 millimetres)
was bored perpendicularly in a dolomite rock, forming one of the
sides (60 feet in length) of an excavation (crater-shaped) of 17 feet
in depth.      The hole was placed at a distance of 14 feet from the edge
of the almost vertical side of the rock. At 8 feet deep it would have
traversed a fault <U+FB01>lled with clay about 1% feet deep.        To prevent the
injurious effect of this fault, the hole was only bored to 7 feet in

                 Intelligence and [Miscellaneous Articles.            237
depth, then charged with 1} litre of nitroglycerine, corresponding
to about 5 feet of the hole; after placing the patent plug and the
fuse, the mine was <U+FB01>lled with sand and then <U+FB01>red.          The mass to be
removed was not thrown out, but simply cracked; for on the one
hand the volume was too great, and on the other the hole was
not deep enough, and, lastly, the quantity of nitroglycerine was
insuf<U+FB01>cient.     Yet the effect was enormous.       A crater of an elliptic
section was formed around the mine, <U+FB01>lled by little fragments.
After having cleared them away, it was found that the rock was
strongly cracked, and, so to say, powdered even below the bottom of
the hole; a crack 50 feet in length on the surface divided the rock
in the direction of the major axis of the crater; another 20 feet in
length in that of the minor axis.
     The total effect can only be judged of when all the mass has been
 cleared away little by little by small mines.
     Second experiment.——The mine was sunk at an angle of 50 degrees
 in a dolomite rock exposed on three sides; it was 34 millims. in
 diameter and 7 feet in depth ; at 5 feet a fault 6 inches thick was
 traversed. The aperture of the hole was 15 feet above the upper
 level of the quarry; the distance to the sides was 10 feet, to the top
 of the rock 10 feet also.
      The charge consisted of 52 of a litre of nitroglycerine, correspond—
  ing to about 2 feet of hole. After inserting the plug and <U+FB01>lling the
  hole with sand, the match was lit. The sound was dead, and the
  effect complete and immense.       If powder had been used, the gases
  would doubtless have been lost in the <U+FB01>ssures, and only a very feeble
   effect would have been obtained even with a maximum charge.
      The explosion produced its effect on all sides; at more than 10
  feet distance the rock was <U+FB01>ssured and split; a quarter of the mass
   was thrown out, and all the rest so smashed that, by means ofvcrow
  bars and three small mines, a total volume of 100 cubic metres
  were removed.
      The cost of this second trial was 94'10 francs.
      For this cost 100 cubic metres of rubble stone were obtained, for
   which labourers are paid at the rate of l franc 30 cent. per cubic
   metre; so that besides their day's wages, at the rate of 2 francs 50
   per diem, they would still have earned 85 francs 90 cent. if they had
   had to pay for the nitroglycerine.     If the same amount had been
   blasted by powder, at least twenty ordinary mines of 20 to 36 inches
   in depth must have been used, and the cost would have been in this
   case 125 francs.
       Third eaperimenL—T he third trial was made with a block of cast
   iron 40 inches long, 20 inches broad, and     ll  inches thick, weighing
    1000 kilogrammes; a hole 8 inches deep by chs of an inch in dia
   meter was bored in the middle of one of its two largest faces; at a
   depth of 6 inches the borer had traversed a bar of iron which was
   placed in the iron at the time of casting: hence the hole was not
   water- tight.   After having lost about 2 cubic inches of nitroglycerine
   in these <U+FB01>ssures, the hole was lined with clay to make it tight, and

was then charged with nitroglycerine to a height of 4% inches.         It
was then closed for a distance of l% inch by means of an iron
screw plug, having in its axis a tube, which received on the one side
the powder, on the other the fuse.     The effect was complete, the
block broke into four large and ten to twelve small pieces, and the
carriage on which it rested was brokeu.--Comptes Rendus, July 17,

   ON THE NATURE OF THE        INVISIBLE PHOTOGRAPch IMAGE.
                  BY M. CAREY LEA, PHILADELPHIA.
   Some experiments in which I have lately been engaged seem to
me to <U+FB01>nally settle the long-contested question as to the nature
of the invisible photographic image, and I hasten to send a very
brief description of them, hoping it will be in time for your July
number.
   The view that the change which takes place in an iodo-bromized
plate in the camera is a purely physical one, that no chemical de
composition takes place, and neither liberation of iodine nor reduc
tion of silver, has obtained a pretty general acceptance.      But lat
terly it has been opposed by twu distinguished photographers, Dr.
Vogel and Major Russel. The former af<U+FB01>rms that iodide of silver
is never sensitive unless there is a body present capable of taking
iodine from it under the in<U+FB02>uence of light.     And Russel believes
that the developed image is chie<U+FB02>y produced at the expense of the
silver haloid in the <U+FB01>lm.
   The following experiments seem to me to decisively close this con
troversy infavour of the physical theory.
   Experiment l.—If the iodide or bromide of silver in the <U+FB01>lm
undergoes decomposition in the camera, and still more, if the deve
loped image is formed at its expense, the <U+FB01>lm of iodo-bromide must
necessarily be greatly consumed in the development under the dense
portions of the negative which it has contributed to form.
   To settle this point, 1 exposed and developed an iodo-bromized
plate in the ordinary manner. Then, instead of rem0ving the un
changed iodide and bromide by <U+FB01>xing in the ordinary manner, I
took measures to remove the developed image without a<U+FB01>'ccling the iodide
and bromide.    This I succeeded in doing with the aid of a very weak
solution of acid pernitrate of mercury.    Now if the. iodide, or bro
mide, or both had been in any way decomposed, to form, or aid in
forming the developed negative image, when this came to be removed
there should have been left a more or less distinct positive image,
depending upon varying thicknesses of iodide and bromide in the <U+FB01>lm,
much like a <U+FB01>xed negative that has been completely iodized. Nothing
ofthis sort was visible, the <U+FB01>lm was perfectly uniform, just as dense
where an intense sky had been as in those parts which had scarcely
received any actinic impression, and looking exactly as it did
when it <U+FB01>rst left the camera and before any developer had been
applied.

               Inlelligerwe and Miscellaneous Articles.               239
   This experiment seems su<U+FB02>iciently decisive.      But the following is
far stronger.
   Experiment 2.--A plate was treated in all respects as in No. 1,
except that the application of the nitrate of mercury for removing
the developed image was made by yellow light.            The plate, now
showing nothing but a uniform yellow <U+FB01>lm, was carefully washed,
and an iron developer, to which nitrate of silver and citric acid had
been added, was applied.      In this way the original imayc was repro
duced, and came out quite clearly with all its details.
    Now as every trace of a picture and all reduced silver had been
removed by the nitrate of mercury, it is by this experiment abso
lutely demonstrated that the image is a purely physical one, and
that, after having served to produce one picture, that picture may be
dissolved o<U+FB02>’, and the same physical impression may be made to
produce a second picture by a simple application of a developing
agent.
    P.S.-—Since the above was written, Ihave repeated the experi
ment with a pyrogallic development, with similar results.         Both the
<U+FB01>rst and second developments may be made with an iron developer.
or both with a pyrogallic.     The experiment succeeds without the
least dif<U+FB01>culty in either way.;-Silliman's American Journal for July

or joints, originally <U+FB01>at, are transformed by the process, as with other
substances, into tubes concentric and perfectly distinct from one
another, thus indicating the movement of each point of the mass in
the course of the transformation.       The cylinders- of ice are longitu
dinally furrowed ; and the furrows appeared to proceed from fractures
produced at the moment when a portion of the cylindrical block
leaves the ori<U+FB01>ce, and when, as a consequence, it ceases to be sub
jected to pressure at the outer extremity. The porcelain paste
afforded the author delicate furrows or fractures of a similar kind,
and in some cases the material was divided into small separate
lamellaa.   The evenly-bedded structure of the cylinder of ice shows
that the origin of these fractures is subsequent to the <U+FB01>rst formation
of the cylinder.

pressure required for the <U+FB02>ow of the ice is 10,000 kilogs., while for
lead it is 50,000 kilogs.    These pressures correspond, for the square
centimetre,    to 126 and 630 kilogs.      This pressure of I26 kilogs.
corresponds to a column of water 1300 metres in height.         It is evi
dent that if the ori<U+FB01>ce were smaller in proportion to the diameter
of the mass under pressure, the force requisite would be notably
less.
    M. Fresca observes that the circumstances attending the forma
 tion of these jets of ice appear to throw light on the controverted
question as to the movement of glaciers.      The relative displacement
of the layers of ice in the process, the change of form in the faces
originally <U+FB02>at, the curved form of the layers at the extremity of each
partial tube, the large cavities formed toward these extremities, and
even the <U+FB01>ssures or fractures at the moment of escape from the pres
sure, are so many points of resemblance to the phenomena of glaciers.
There is not the mass of material constituting moraines; but the traces
 of colouring-matter which are deposited in parallel threads, and
which are reunited towards the axis, complete to a degree the
analogy.
    Tyndall had before shown that ice could be moulded to-any shape
by pressure in a mould.       M. Fresea observes that his trials prove,
in addition, that it may be pushed into a thread, in accordance with
 the geometrical law of this kind of <U+FB02>ow.       The facts help to bring
the explanations of Tyndall and Forbes into accord, since they indi
cate that the viscosity, more or less great, of the material does not
necessarily play any important part in the phenomenon.         They ex
hibit the material conditions of the <U+FB02>ow : and the transparency of the
jet after its escape from the ori<U+FB01>ce shows besides, that, under a com
parativelyfeeble pressure, ice may be changed in form without ceasing
 to be glassy in texture or aspect.—Les Mondes, February 23 (Silli

explosion of the electric spark may be re<U+FB02>ected by the vesicular

   XXXII.      On the Second    Law of Thennodynamies.        By   WV. J.
       Mscquoms RANKINE, C.E., LL.D., F.R.SS.L.            6; E. 8;c.*
   I.      T has long been established that all the known relations
             between heat and mechanical energy are summed up in
   two laws, called respectively the <U+FB01>rst law and the second law of
   thermodynamics:       viz.,
       Fias'r Lam—Quantities of heat and of mechanical energy are
   convertible at the rate very nearly of 7 72 foot-pounds to the
   British (or Fahrenheit-avoirdupois)    unit, or 424 kilogrammetres
   to the French (or Centigrade-metrical)     unit of heat.
       Sncoun Lam—The quantity of energy which is converted
   from one of those forms to the other during a given change of
   dimensions and condition in a given body, is the product of the
   absolute temperature into a function of that change, and of the
   kind and condition of the matter of the body.                  ~
       By absolute temperature is here to be understood temperature
   measured according to a scale so graduated that the tempera
   ture of a homogeneous body shall vary in the simple proportion
   of the quantity of energy it possesses in the form of sensible or
   thermometric heat.
       2. The laws of thermodynamics, as here stated, are simply
   the condensed expression of the facts of experiment.        But they
   are also capable of being viewed as the consequence of the sup
   position that the condition of bodies which accompanies the
   phenomena of sensible heat consists in some kind of motion
   amongst their particles.
       3. The <U+FB01>rst law would obviously follow from the supposition

 242                   Dr. Rankine   on the Second       Law
 of   ankind of molecular motion whatsoever, and it therefore
        of itself no reason for preferring one supposition as to
 a<U+FB01>'ord’s
 the kind of molecular motion which constitutes sensible heat to
  another.
     4. But if there be molecular motions in bodies, it is certain
 that, although all such motions are capable of conversion into
  that which constitutes sensible heat, some of them are not ac
  companied by sensible heat.        For example, the motion (supposed
 to be vibratory and wave-like) which constitutes radiance, whether
 visible or invisible, is not accompanied by sensible heat, and
  only produces sensible heat by its absorption; that                   is,
                                                                        in the
  language  of hypothesis, by     its  conversion    into  some    other  kind
  of motion    while, on the other hand, in the production
               ;                                                       of radi
 ance, sensible heat disappears.
     5. The object of the present paper            to give an elementary
                                                   is
 proof of the proposition, that the second law               of
                                                            thermodynamics
 follows <U+FB01>om    the  supposition  that   sensible heat  consists  inany kind
 of  steady molecular motion within limited spaces.
      6.The term “ steady motion ”         ishere used in the same sense
 as in hydrodynamics, to denote motion, whether of                continuous
                                                                  a
 <U+FB02>uid or of system of detached molecules, in which
               a                                                 the   velocity
 and direction of motion of particle depend on its position only;
                                a
 so that each particle of the series of particles Which successively
 pass through      agiven position, assumes in its turn the velocity
 and direction proper to that position.           In other words, steady
 motion may be de<U+FB01>ned as motion in             set of streams of invariable
                                               a
 <U+FB01>gure.
    When steady motion takes place in matter that                   iscon<U+FB01>ned
 within limited space, the streams in which the articles move
           a
 must necessarily return into themselves, and                     Ibe
                                                                   circulating
streams,   being  in  that  respect  of  the  nature  of  whirls,   eddies, or
vortlces.
    7. Steady motion keeps unaltered the distribution of the den
 sity of the moving matter; and            therefore keeps unaltered the
                                          it
forces depending on such distribution, whether of the nature of
pressure or of attraction.      In that respect differs from unsteady
                                                    it
motion, such as vibratory and wave-like motion.
      8.Conceive   a   limited space of any <U+FB01>gure whatsoever to be
<U+FB01>lled with matterin state of steady motion.
                         a                               The actual energy
of any particle of that matter       is the product of its mass into the
half-square of its velocity; and the actual energy of the whole
mass of matter     is the sum of all those products; and because of
the steadiness of the motion, the actual energy of the particle
which at any instant whatsoever occupies                 given position
                                                         a                    is
some de<U+FB01>nite fraction of the whole actual energy, depending upon
that position, and upon the distribution of matter within the

                                       of Thermodynamics.                                  243
   space; but the scale of absolute temperature is de<U+FB01>ned as being
   so graduated that the whole actual energy of the matter within
   the space is the product of the absolute temperature, the mass of
   matter, and some function of the sort and distribution of the
   matter; therefore the half~square of the velocity of the particle
   which at any instant occupies a given position in the space consi
   dered is equal to the absolute temperature multiplied by some func
   tion of that position, and of the sort and dislribution of the matter.
       9. Suppose now that the dimensions of the limited space in
   which the moving matter is enclosed, and the distribution of
   that matter, undergo an inde<U+FB01>nitely small change by the appli
   cation of suitable forces, and that after that process the motion
   becomes steady as it was before.             Then the dimensions and
   position  of   each  circulating   stream   will  have been altered; and
   the work done in effecting that alteration will consist of energy
  converted between the forms of potential energy of the applied
  forces, and actual energy of the molecular motions—that                                   is,
  between the forms of mechanical energy and of heat.                 Consider
  now a    point in one of the circulating streams before the change,
  and let fall from       it  perpendicular upon the same stream after
                              a
  the change.       The work done in shifting the path of the particle
  which at any instant occupies that point,               the product of the
                                                                  is
  perpendicular displacement of the stream into the force exerted
  along that perpendicular.          But the perpendicular displacement
  of the stream      is   function of the position of the point shifted,
                          a
 the distribution of matter in the space, and the change of dimen
 sions and distribution         and the force
                                ;                  equal and opposite either
                                                          is
 to the centrifugal force of the particle or to one of its components,
 and  is   therefore proportional to the square of the velocity of the
 particle, and to some function of its position and of the sort and
 distribution of matter in the body. Therefore the energy trans
formed in shifting the path                 of
                                       any particle      proportional to the
                                                                  is
 square    of its             and                          its position,     the
                                                                                of of of
                   velocity,       to some   function              of
 sort and distribution         matter in the space considered, and           the
 change in dimensions          of of
                               that space and in the distribution            the
matter.
      10. But the square of the velocity of the particle which at
 any instant occupies           given position has already been shown
                                a
to be proportional to the absolute temperature, and to some
function of that position and of the sort and distribution of the
matter; therefore,           sensible heat consists in any kind
                                                                        of of
                                                                         sleady

2-14                Dr. Rankine on the Second Law
  1 1 .   In a paper “ On the Mechanical Action of Heat,” published
in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh for 1850,
the author deduced the Second Law of Thermodynamics, in the
form above stated, from the hypothesis of a particular sort of
steady molecular motion, viz. revolution in circular streams or
vortices.    In a paper “ On the Centrifugal Theory of Elasticity,”
published in the same Transactions for 1851, he deduced the
same law from the hypothesis of steady molecular motion in
circulating streams of any <U+FB01>gure whatsoever, being a proposition
 substantially identical with that set forth in the present paper;
but as the demonstration in the paper of 1851 involved tedious
and intricate symbolical processes, he has written the present
paper in order to show that the demonstration can be effected
very simply.
   12. It is obvious that the steadiness of the supposed molecular
motions is the essential condition which makes the Second Law
of Thermodynamics      deducible from a mechanical hypothesis;
and that no kind of unsteady motion, such as vibratory or wave
like motion, would lead to the same results. If, then, it be
admitted as probable that the phenomena of heat are due to
unseen molecular motions, it must also be admitted, that while
the motions which constitute radiance may be vibratory and wave
like, the motions which constitute sensible or thermometric heat
must be steady and like those of circulating streams.
   13. The function by which the absolute temperature is mul
tiplied in calculating the conversion of energy between the me
chanical and the thermic forms, is the variation of what the
author has called the metamorphic function*, being one term of
the thermodynamic function-l- which corresponds to what Professor
Clausius calls entropic};

            XXXIII.       On the Mechanical Equivalent of Light.
            By Professor JULIUS THOMSEN of Copenhagen*.
        HAT     the luminous ray exerts a mechanical action cannot
          be doubted;      but as to its magnitude, there are at present
 no determinations.         I have proposed to myself to determine this,
 at all events approximately.          Since light can change into heat
 when it is absorbed by a black and non-luminous surface, we
 may, from the heating-effect of luminous rays freed from thermal
 rays, draw conclusions as to the mechanical activity of light. The
 production of heat by luminous rays was detected by Melloni’s
 apparatus ; but as this apparatus has only been used for relative
 measurements, it was necessary to reduce the results to absolute
 measurement.
      Hence the indications of the thermo-multiplier were compared
 with the absolute radiation of a known source of heat. As
 source of heat, a glass bulb was used <U+FB01>lled with warm water,
 and placed at various distances from the thermo-pile.               The bulb
contained (including the reduced value in water of the glass)
 1351 grins. water; at a temperature of 50° C. the cooling of the
bulb was 0°‘185 a minute, and the bulb experienced therefore a
loss of 1351 gr. x 0°‘l85=2500 (c=caloric or thermal unit) in
a minute.
     But this loss arises partly from radiation, and partly from
 cooling by contact with the air.            If by Dulong’s formula that
 part be calculated which is due to radiation, it is found to be
 1020 for one minute, the temperature of the air being 17°.
     This source of heat was placed at a distance of 0'8 metre from
the thermo-pile ; and the multiplier indicated then a constant de
<U+FB02>ection of 17°'8.         From this it may be inferred that a source 'of
light    or of  heat  which,  placed at a distance of 0'8 metre from the
thermo-pile, produces         a de<U+FB02>ection of 17°‘8, radiates in a minute
 102    thermal    units.   But as the indications of the multiplier are,
within certain limits, proportional to the radiation, under these
circumstances a de<U+FB02>ection of 1° corresponds to a radiation of
5760 in a minute.
     By placing the bulb successively at different distances from
the pile, andobserving the position of the needle when the tem
perature was only 50°, similar factors were determined for a few
other distances, in which the different sources of light should
subsequently be placed.
     I then placed a candle at a distance of 0'8 metre from the
pile, and obtained a constant de<U+FB02>ection of the needle of 36°61.
    ‘  From Poggenilor<U+FB01>‘s Annalm, June 1865.
    1' In this, as in other cases in which the de<U+FB02>ection was large, the expe
riment was made so that the needle before the experiment was de<U+FB02>ected
  o the opposrte side, and that the actual de<U+FB02>ection from 0°_didnot exceed 30’.

  Prof.   J. Thomsen       on the Mechanical Equivalent               of Light.       247
 Hence     the entire radiation        of the candle, which burnt 8'2 grms.
wermaeeti      in  an   hour,    was    5'75c .36°'5=2100 in each minute.
As the corresponding quantity of spermaceti discngages about
 14000 in a minute, it follows from this observation that only
one-seventh of the entire heat disengaged leaves the <U+FB02>ame as
radiant heat and light, while six~sevenths of the entire quantity
are carried away by the heated air.
   Experiments were then made with more powerful <U+FB02>ames.                                 A
moderator lamp, whose luminous intensity was 8'6, and a gas
<U+FB02>ame of 7'7 luminous intensity, were placed at a distance of 2
metres, and the results referred to the spermaceti candle as unit.
The results were as follows :—

                                                                 L‘

   It   follows   from these results           that the radiation          of a <U+FB02>ame is
proportional to the intensity of light, and that for the unit of light,
8'2 grms. of spermaceti in an hour, it is about 2000 in a minute.
   But this is the action of the entire radiation; in order to                         de
termine that part which is due to the luminous rays, the thermal
rays had to be eliminated.               Probably it is not possible entirely
to separate the thermal from the luminous rays; but it may be
done approximately... It seemed best to effect the absorption of
the thermal rays by water; and by various experiments                             I  eon
vinced myself      that   the'invisible rays          cannot   traverse       a layer of
water 0'2 metre in thickness, or at all              events traverse      it to so  small
an extent that they exercise no appreciable in<U+FB02>uence on the result.
The <U+FB02>ame of a Bunsen’s lamp emits, as is well known, a very feeble
quantity of light ; its thermal radiation is nevertheless very great.
I observed, for example, that a Bunsen's lamp which, without
access of air, had a luminous intensity of 1'2 unit of light and
radiated 255 thermal units, when air was admitted and the
<U+FB02>ame was non-luminous exhibited a radiation of 196c in a
minute.       Of these non-luminous rays not a trace passed through
0'2 metre water; but as soon as the access of air ceased and the
<U+FB02>ame became luminous, the needle was de<U+FB02>ected, and indicated
that 4'30 were transmitted.                 Whereas the needle of the mul
tiplier   remained      unchanged         at 0° so long as the radiation of
the non-luminou          <U+FB02>ame    took     place through water, ade<U+FB02>ection of

248    Prof.   J.       Thomsen on the Mechanical Equivalent                              of Light.
 the needle was immediately exhibited as soon as the <U+FB02>ame was
 made luminous, for instance, by chloride of sodium, or other v0
latile compounds, or by a platinum wire.
    It was further seen that the re s which had passed from a
 non-luminous <U+FB02>ame through the hiyer of water, were absorbed
 in very various degrees by coloured glasses, while this was only
 to a small extent the case with the rays before they had been
 separated by the water.
    From these various investigations the conclusion may be
 drawn that a layer of water of 20 centims. completely absorbs the
heat-rays and only transmits light-rays, or that the absorption of
thermal rays is so complete that the error is imperceptible.     By
experiment,   the loss in luminous  intensity experienced by  radia
tion through such a layer in water which was enclosed between
parallel glass sides, was determined, and the result reduced to
the luminous intensity of the light which had so traversed the
water.    The absorption was found to be 0'13.
    Hence between the <U+FB02>ame and the thermo-pile was placed a
box with parallel sides of plate glass enclosing a layer of water
0'2 metre in thickness, and the <U+FB02>ame was then brought to the
same distance as in the <U+FB01>rst experiment.      All the circumstances
were the same, except that now the radiation had to traverse the
water, so that the de<U+FB02>ection of the multiplier would only depend
on the heating-effect which the light-rays produced.            The
results were as follows :—

   But the entire radiation of the <U+FB02>ame, inclusive*0f the heat

luminous rays; and the entire development of heat in the che—

            numerous investigations on nitride of iron,         would                  it
FROM
  appear     that iron    capable of
                                  is uniting with nitrogen  in nume
rous proportions, and thus can alloy itself with    nitride of iron of  a
de<U+FB01>nite composition.      Stahlsehmidt* has recently investigated
the preparation and properties of nitride of iron, and <U+FB01>nds that
nitrogen unites with iron in     perfectly de<U+FB01>nite proportion, and
                                                a
that all the different nitrides of iron, the existence of which has
been assumed, must be regarded as mixtures of this de<U+FB01>nite
nitride with pure iron.
   The mode of preparation he adopted was that of chnault and
Fremy, which consists in passing ammonia over pure protochlo
ride of iron. The temperature at which the action takes place
 may be very low—far under the red heat; and that chloride
which     exposed in
         is               thin layer passes almost immediately into
                                 a
nitride, while thicker masses require         longer time.a  Nitride of
iron prepared at different temperatures contains different pro
portions of nitrogen; and the proportion            in general smaller
                                                                   is

   250          M. Stahlschmidt   on   Nitride of Iran.
     If nitride of iron i heated to a high temperature in hydrogen,
  or even in ammonia, it loses nitrogen.     The percentage of one
  specimen thus heated in ammonia was reduced from 9'3 to 4'9
  per cent.    The discordant results which various experimenters
  have arrived at as regards the composition of nitride of iron are
  explained by the remarkable property it has, that its decom
  position takes place at a temperature close to that at which it
  is formed.
     In its formation ammonia is <U+FB01>rst decomposed,
                          NHa = N + ll”,
  while the hydrogen decomposes    protochloride   of iron,
                      3FeCl+3H =3Fe+ 3HC1.
  The hydrochloric    acid unites with a corresponding quantity of
  ammonia   to form    sal-ammoniac, while the porous iron unites
 with free nitrogen to form nitride of iron.
     Nitride of iron was also prepared by heating iron in amnio
 niacal gas at just that temperature at which the gas is decom
 posed ,' the iron used was some which had been prepared from
 nitride of iron by heating in hydrogen.
    According to Fremy, nitrogen gas unites directly with iron,
 though with dif<U+FB01>culty; more readily when nitrogen is passed
 over a mixture of oxide of iron and charcoal.         The results of
 Stahlschmidt’s experiments lead him to the conclusion that free
 nitrogen does not unite
                      '     directly with iron.
    Nitride of iron, according to the mode of its preparation,
appears either as a grey powder, or as a more or less compact
silver-white mass; it is extremely brittle, and easily pulverizable.
When projected into a gas- or spirit-<U+FB02>ame, it burns with brilliant
sparks.     When heated, it gives off its nitrogen ; iron which still
contained 0'9 per cent. of nitrogen was not in the least brittle,
but had the properties of iron free from nitrogen.
    Nitride of iron dissolves in hydrochloric and in sulphuric acids
with liberation of hydrogen and formation of ammoniacal salts.
Iodine placed in contact with nitride of iron in the presence of
water does not combine with it.          The same is the case with
bromine; but when heat is applied, bromine combines with          it,
disengaging hydrogen, while the nitrogen can be detected in
the solution as ammonia.        Chlorine acts in similar manner.

    The iron prepared    by  heating nitride of iron in hydrogen  is
of silver-white colour, lustrous, and so soft that in thick pieces
        a
   can be cut with an ordinary knife without much trouble.         It
is it
    soluble in acids without any residue, and is probably the purest
iron which has yet been obtained.

steel, with especial reference to the properties of nitride of iron.

               He draws the conclusion that proofs are wanting of the presence
               of nitrogen in steel, and still more so of the necessity of nitrogen
               asa  steel-forming body.    It follows from various investigations,
               that iron can pass into steel when placed in contact at        high      a
               temperature with bodies free from nitrogen, but that, on the

252     M. Fleitmann        on a new    Mode of preparing Oxygen.
   Fleitmann describes* a method of preparing oxygen gas, to
 which he was led by the observation that a concentrated solution
of bleaching-powder in contact with a trace of freshly precipitated
moist peroxide of cobalt is completely decomposed into chloride
of calcium and oxygen.      It is known that there are several oxides
of cobalt; and the explanation of the above process is doubtless
that the lower oxide continually takes oxygen from the hypo
chlorite of lime, passes into a higher oxide, and then is resolved
into oxygen and a lower oxide.        The action of the peroxide is
thus quite analogous to that of binoxide of nitrogen in the
sulphuric acid manufacture.
   The same quantity of peroxide serves for the decomposition of
fresh quantities of hypochlorite of lime ; and the quantity required
is extremely small, one-half to one-tenth per cent. of the chlo
ride is suf<U+FB01>cient.   It is not even necessary to have freshly preci
pitated peroxide; a few drops of any soluble cobalt-salt added to
a solution of hypochlorite     of lime produces at once a corre
sponding quantity of hydrated peroxide.
   Unfortunately it is essential to have a clear solution of hypo
chlorite ; for otherwise it froths up.    The clear solution is best
 obtained by deeantation, the liquid used for exhausting a <U+FB01>rst
portion being applied to a second, and so on. The vessels used
may be <U+FB01>lled with the liquid to the extent of % of their capacity.
   Ste-Claire Deville has given the name of dissociation to the
phenomenon which many bodies exhibit of partially decompo
sing into their constituents when heated at a considerably lower
                                                                        A
temperature than that at which they are completely decomposed,
or at which their constituents unite'f. In two recent commu
nicationsI he has furnished additional instances of this pheno
menon.
   The electric spark decomposes many substances, doubtless
in consequence of the great heat which it disengagcs ; and if a
reunion of the separated constituents does not ensue, this is
probably due to the circumstance that on their decomposition
they come into contact with a relatively cold atmosphere; for
the path of the spark is very short as compared with the mass
of the gas, whose temperature is scarcely changed.
   Deville has devised a plan by which the same conditions are
attained without the aid of electricity.   A porcelain tube is laid
through  a furnace in  which a  very high temperature can be pro
duced; its ends are provided with corks in which are two perfora~
tions. In each cork is <U+FB01>tted a small tube, serving at the one end to

      of the tube separate those parts which are to be heated from
      those which, projecting from the furnace, remain quite cold.
         A    current of pure and dry carbonic oxide was admitted into
      the tube, and the issuing gas passed into baryta-water.                When
      the temperature attained       a bright  redness,  the  baryta-water indi
       cated that some carbonic acid was formed.            The carbonic oxide
      had thus been decomposed into carbonic oxide and carbon; the
       latter was found deposited as <U+FB01>ne lampblack in the brass tube,
       whose temperature even in the hottest part of the apparatus
       never exceeds 10°.      The mass of the water was so great that its
       temperature was not perceptibly raised            by
                                                          passing through the

       this current meets the cold and rough side of the brass tube, and
       the carbon particles are deposited on        itmechanically, and, being
       kept cold, escape the in<U+FB02>uence of the oxygen.                  In all cases

     Hydrochloric acid has hitherto resisted all attempts to decom
 pose   it ; and the reason is not dif<U+FB01>cult to explain; the tension
 of dissociation at high temperatures is very small, and the ten
 dency to unite so powerful that it is not easy to see how the
 momentarily separated substances cannot but reunite.                  But by
 the following device Deville        has succeeded    in showing    that there
 is a slight dissociation.      The silver tube in the above experiment
 is amalgamated with a very thin coating of mercury, which is
 not attacked by hydrochloric acid gas at a temperature of 300°.
 Pure hydrochloric acid gas was admitted into the above appa
 ratus, a difference in temperature of about 15000 being main
 tained between the porcelain tube and the amalgamated silver.
 At the close of the experiment, on moistening the tube with am
 monia, some of it was blackened, and a small portion of chloride
 of silver dissolved. The gas, carefully collected, was found to
 contain a distinct quantity of hydrogen.
    In arcpetition of the carbonic oxide experiment, Deville found
 that when some puri<U+FB01>ed lampblack was placed in the apparatus
 and heated to nearly the fusing-point of silver, and carbonic oxide
 passed through, a considerable proportion of carbonic acid was
 even then formed.
    By passing the electrical spark of a Ruhmkor<U+FB01>’s coil through
 carbonic oxide placed in a eudiometer containing some caustic
 potash, it was completely decomposed into carbon and carbonic
 acid, which Was absorbed by the potash. For complete decom
position, however, <U+FB01>ve or six days were required.
    Carbonic acid is decomposed by the electric spark into car
 bonic oxide and oxygen ; and if some phosphorus be placed in
the eudiometer so as to absorb the latter, the decomposition is

    Laspeyres* gives a complete account of the various substances
in which, up to the present time, the new alkaline metals caesium
and rubidium have been found, whether separately or together.
He also describes the occurrence of these two metals in a plu
tonic silicate in the Rhine province.            According to his ana
lyses,    the  rock  appears   to   contain about    000038 per cent. of
caesia and about 00003 per cent. of rubidia.             He is still engaged
on the investigation of the occurrence of these minerals in rocks
of this origin.
    Engelbach has examined-t a basalt from Upper Hesse, and
has found that it contains rubidium, apparently in larger quan
tity than was found by Laspcyres.               The rock contained no
caesium,    but  traces of  the   other  comparatively rare substances,
titanium, chromium, and vanadium.

               M. Debray       on the Cblorides   of Tungsten.             255
  '
     In the Giessen laboratory, in which this investigation was
made, chloride of rubidium was prepared from a large quantity
of ashes from beech wood which had grown on a basaltic soil.
     Debray has investigated the chlorides of tungsten*.                When
pure and dry chlorine is passed over tungsten heated to dull
redness in a tube of hard glass, intensely red vapours are pro
 duced which condense to a liquid of a deep grey colour.                  This
is a mixture of perchloride of tungsten, WCla, and of subchlo
ride, W2 C15(W=92, Cl=35‘5).                To obtain the perchloride as
pure   as  possible,  it  must   be  repeatedly distilled in a current of
chlorine; and though it can never be obtained quite free from
subchloride, the quantity of the latter is made so small as to
have no appreciable effect on the composition.
     There are also two oxychlorides of tungsten; one, which is
red, has the formula W0 GP, and the other, which is of a yel
lowish white, the formula W0'2 Cl. They are obtained mixed
 with tungstic acid by passing chlorine over dry oxide of tung
sten, W0“, and are separated by their varying volatility, the red
being most volatile.
     They may also be obtained by distilling perchloride of tung
sten with oxalic acid in suitable proportions.               The red is pure;
but however      the    yellow  chloride  is procured     it  is always mixed
with red oxychloride or with tungstic acid, for when distilled
it decomposes into these two substances :
                        2W02 Cl= WOCP + W03.
     When perchloride of tungsten is mixed with anhydrous tung
stic acid, the two combine with disengagement of heat, forming
the red oxychloride:
                         2WCl3 +    W03=3WO          C12.
     This reaction is analogous to that observed by Persoz in dis
tilling perchloride of phosphorus            and    anhydrous       ph0sphoric
 acid.
     Debray was only able to determine with certainty the vapour
 density of the yellow oxyehloride and of the red chloride.               The
 theoretical density of the chloride, WCl'“, corresponding to two
volumes, is 1375, and 6'875 if it correspond to four volumes; and
in like manner the density of the oxychloride, W0 Cl”, for a two
volume vapour is 11'86, and for a four-volume 5'93.                   Now the
mean number for the density of WCl"3 is 11-72, and for the oxy
chloride, “'0 C19, is 1058; which are therefore materially dif
ferent from the numbers required by theory.
    But if the equivalent of tungsten be altered, audit be supposed
that the perchloride has the formula WCls, this would require

observation.     The formula     of the oxychloride must then be
written    WO157 CE,     according to which its vapour-density       is
9871 on the four-volume hypothesis; but if the fractions are
made to disappear and its formula be called W:3 05 Cl“), weImust
assume that its vapour-density           then corresponds to twelve
volumes.
    Streeker describes the preparation of several salts of peroxide
of thallium*.      Crude chloride of thallium is easily puri<U+FB01>ed by
crystallization from solution of carbonate of soda or of caustic
soda. The chloride is added to solution of soda, which is raised
to boiling as long as any dissolves; on cooling, it crystallizes out
in white feathery crystals.      If the solvent contained any organic
matter, the chloride of thallium is somewhat grey in colour,
owing to a partial reduction.        In fact if an alkaline solution of
chloride of thallium is heated with grape-sugar or with proto
chloride of tin, thallium is deposited in a grey powder, though
it is impossible in this way to precipitate it entirely.
    Peroxide of thallium is prepared by adding to a boiling satu
rated solution of chloride of thallium in carbonate of soda hypo
chlorite of soda, on which a dark brown precipitate resembling
peroxide of lead separates.         This peroxide dissolves in warm
dilute sulphuric acid; on concentration, colourless thin laminae
separate, which are the sulphate of peroxide of thallium,
                           T1033Soa+ 7H0;
on drying they lose 6 atoms of water.           The double salts, sul
phate of peroxide of thallium and soda, T1033803+Na0 SO“,
and sulphate of peroxide of thallium and potash,
                         TlO3 3 $03 + KO SOS,
 are also crystallized  salts.  Besides these, several other salts were
 examined.
    As not only the ordinary oxide TlO, but also the so-called
peroxide T109 have decidedly basic properties, Strecker suggests
that to the former the name thallous oxirle (thalliumoa'ydul),
and to the latter the name thallic oxide (thalliumowyd) might
be assigned.      And he points out that in its combinations with
 oxygen and the halogens, thallium agrees with gold, inasmuch
as in both cases the quantities of oxygen or chlorine united with
the same weight of metal are as 1:3.               But seeing, on the
other hand, its analogies with, yet divergencies from lead, and
also with the alkaline metals, it must be confessed that as yet it
can be included in none of the families assumed.

     Hebberliug has also made a communication* on thallium.
 Besides a careful determination of the atomic weight of the
 metal, in which he obtained numbers not at all materially differ
 ing from those obtained by Lamy and by Werther, he examined
the action of the most ordinary chemical reagents on the salts of
 thallium, and has also made careful determinations of the solu
 bility of the chloride, the iodide, and the platinochloride.
     Troost has communicated the results of an investigation-f on
metallic zirconium.        He obtained it crystallized by heating, in a
crucible of gas-graphite at the fusing-point of iron, one part of
double <U+FB02>uoride of potassium and zirconium with one and a half
part of aluminium.         \Vhen the crucible was cold, the surface of
the aluminium was found coated with crystalline laminae pressed
against each other like the leaves of a book.            On treating the
regulus with dilute hydrochloric acid,         at <U+FB01>rst laminae of zirco
nium were separated; and when all the aluminium was dissolved,
an alloy was left of aluminium and zirconium ; which two metals,
from the analogy in their properties, appear to dissolve each
other in all proportions.
     The above reaction takes place at a lower temperature ; but
then the alloy of zirconium and aluminium is almost exclusively
obtained.
   . The zirconium,    obtained as above, contained 1'28 per cent. of
aluminium and 0'55 per cent. of silicon.
     Besides the above method, Troost also obtained zirconium in
small microscopic crystals by passing vapour of chloride of zirco
nium over aluminium heated to redness in a porcelain tube tra
versed by a current of hydrogen.         It was also obtained in small
crystalline plates on decomposing, by the battery, fused double
<U+FB02>uoride of zirconium and potassium.           These crystals decompose
water in the cold.
     Graphitoidal zirconium does not appear to exist, or if so, only
under special conditions.       Amorphous zirconium, with all the
properties described by Berzelius, was prepared by passing chlo-'
ride of zirconium in vapour over sodium heated to redness in a
porcelain tube.
     Crystallized zirconium is a very hard lustrous substance, rc
sembling antimony in its colour, brilliancy, and brittleness.           It
is obtained in very thin plates, about half an inch in length and ap
parently forming an oblique prism.         Its density is 4'15, differing
little from that of zircon.      It is certainly less fusible than sili
con, and is so dif<U+FB01>cult of fusion that no certain opinion can be
expressed regarding its fusing-heat.

I     Crystallized zirconium      resists the action of oxygen at a red
    heat; at a white heat it   becomes     covered with a thin iridescent
    layer which    protects the rest of  the  metal; it only burns in the
    <U+FB02>ame of the oxyhydrogen blowpipe.            In chlorine, combustion
    takes place at a red heat with ineandescence, forming chloride of
    zirconium.     Hydrate of potash in fusion is decomposed by zir
    conium, with liberation of hydrogen, which ceases when the
    potash is quite dehydrated.       Heated to redness with silica it is
    reduced, forming amorphous silicon and zirconia.
       Nitric and sulphuric acids have no action on zirconium in the
    cold, and scarcely any when they are hot and concentrated.
    Gaseous hydrochloric acid is decomposed by zirconium at a red
    heat, forming chloride of zirconium but no snbchloride.
        Hydrochloric acid in the cold does not dissolve zirconium, by
    which this body is distinguished from aluminium. The true
    solvent is hydro<U+FB02>uoric acid, in which, whether strong or not, zir~
    conium dissolves—a deportment in which it differs from silicon.
       Troost says in conclusion, zirconium plays, in the carbon
    family, a part analogous to that of antimony in the nitrogen
    family.    It forms a passage between metallic silicon and metallic

            tions preliminary to the investigation of the motions of   a.
    spherical solid submitted to the action of the vibrations of an
    elastic <U+FB02>uid. I   proceed now to give   a solution of this important
    problem in accordance with the principles there advocated.       The
    conditions of the problem will be assumed to be such that both
    the motion and the condensation of the <U+FB02>uid are symmetrical
    with respect to an axis passing through the centre of the sphere,
    and parallel to the direction of the incidence of the waves.     The
    equation (6), obtained in the Supplementary Number of the
    Philosophical Magazine for December 1864: (p. 493),         is appli
    cable to such motion, and will be employed in the present inves
    tigation.    For greater distinctness in carrying on the subsequent
    argument, the reasoning     by  which that equation was arrived at
    will be here reproduced.

 than it would be if the effect of the transverse vibrations were

This differential equation takes account of the composite charac
ter of the motion, and, as far as regards the <U+FB01>rst order of approxi
mation, is of perfectly general application.           For although the
axes of the component motions were supposed in the investiga
tion to be rectilinear and parallel, since this is a di<U+FB01>'erenlial
equation, by a well-known principle of analytical reasoning, it is
ultimately applicable to curvilinear and inclined lines of motion,
provided they are everywhere inclined to each other by inde<U+FB01>
nitely small angles.       Hence dz may be assumed to be the same
as ds, the increment of a line of motion, and the equation will
thus agree in form with the general dynamical equation of the
<U+FB01>rst order applicable to uncompoundcd motion, only having K902
in the place of a9.

This equation gives the condensation at any point of the surface
of the sphere due to the condensation of the waves, and there
fore additional to that which was before found to be due to the
incidence of waves without condensation.     It    evident that,                                   is
since the investigation has been restricted to quantities of the

<U+FB01>rst order, and a, is consequently expressed by a circular func
tion having as many plus as minus values, the pressure accom
panying the condensation a has no tendency to produce a perma
nent motion of translation of the sphere.  Let us next inquire
whether such motion is indicated when terms of the second order
are taken into account.
   As we have hitherto employed only the <U+FB01>rst terms of the
values of ao" and w', the differential equations we have been
concerned with are linear with constant coef<U+FB01>cients, and from
such equations the coexistence of small vibrations has been in
ferred.    But it is particularly to be observed that the general
composite character of the vibrations of an elastic <U+FB02>uid is not de
monstrated by means of these approximate equations, inasmuch
as the proper proof consists in <U+FB01>nding antecedently, and without
reference to arbitrary conditions, expressions giving the laws of
simple vibrations.      On this account it is allowable to assert
generally that the motion is compounded of motions de<U+FB01>ned by
any number of terms of the series for 00' and 20'.          Since m is
supposed to be very small compared with a, the convergence of
each series is very rapid, and the terms following the <U+FB01>rst are
collectively very small compared with the <U+FB01>rst.          Also, as has
been already urged, the vibrations, whether great or small, of a
given particle through a mean position necessarily require that
the condensations should be greater than the rarct'actions, which
accords with what is indicated by the equations (a) and (,8). For
these reasons   I   conclude that the motions and condensations
represented by the additional terms always accompany those ex
pressed by the <U+FB01>rst,’ and that in composite motion each compo
nent is in strictncss de<U+FB01>ned by all the terms of. the series for 00'
and w', excepting so far as modi<U+FB01>cations are produced by the
transvsrse vibrations.
   It is, however, true that after advancing beyond terms of the
<U+FB01>rst order, the reasoning no longer rests exclusively on inferences
drawn from linear differential equations with constant coef<U+FB01>cients.
Yet, as now proceed to show, certain results, suf<U+FB01>cient for the
      I
present purpose, may be obtained when terms of the second
order are included in the reasoning.      First,    it  to be noticed
                                                         is
that w' is  periodic in such manner as to have as many plus as
minus values, whatever number of terms be taken, although this
is not the case with respect to the corresponding value of 0".
Also as the composite velocity      is   by
                                       supposition wholly periodic,
it,like the components, must have equal amounts of plus and
minus values.      To satisfy this condition,      clearly su<U+FB01>ices to
                                                   it
suppose that the composite velocity        the sum, or proportional
                                              is
to the sum, of the individual velocities.    Let, therefore, the total
motion be composed of an unlimited number of separate vibra

tions, direct and transverse, having their axes perpendicular to a
plane; and let the direct vibrations be expressed by two terms
of the series for w', and their phases be such that the transverse
vibrations destroy each other.     The total motion is consequently
in parallel straight lines ,- and the rate of propagation being no,
the composite velocity (V) and density (p) are related to each
other by the general formula Vp=1ca(p—1), obtained in Part I.
(p. 218), which must now be used to terms of the second order.

   Reverting now to our problem of waves impinging on sphere                        a

which is independent of the magnitude of the sphere.   Now since it
has been shown that the function S contains, together with pe
riodic terms, others which are always positive, it follows that the
sphere, if free to move, would not only vibrate, but also perma
nently change position by the action of an aecclerative force. If
the unknown factor ml be positive, the acceleration would be
towards the origin of the waves, and the movement would resemble
that produced by an atlraclivefo'rce.    Supposing that the axes
of the component vibrations all pass through a central point, the
magnitude of the force due to the same composite waves would,
at different distances from the centre, be proportional to the
number of the axes included within a given transverse area, and
consequently would Leary inversely as the square                           of     the distance
from   the centre.

 By the considerations already applied to the condensation 3, it
 follows that in this case also the waves tend to produce a perma
 nent motion of translation of the sphere, and that the acceleration
 from a centre varies inversely as the square of the distance. Since
 the above expression contains c,the acceleration is not independent
 of the magnitude of the sphere. Also the direction of the motion
 of translation is from the origin of the waves if m'I be a positive
 quantity, and the movement is like that produced by a repulsive
force.
     I have now      reached the point to which            I  proposed   to carry
 these researches in the present communication.                  It was required
 to ascertain whether or not the undulations of an elastic medium
 are capable of causing permanent motions of translation of a
 small sphere ; and the question has been answered af<U+FB01>rmatively.
 The investigation has shown that the effect is due to the circum
 stance that, on expressing to terms of the second order the rela
 tion between the condensation and velocity of a wave, the amount
 of condensation is found to be greater than that of rarefaction,
 and that, while the excess of condensation causes the excursions
 backwards and forwards of a given particle of the <U+FB02>uid to be
 exactly equal, the excursions of a spherical solid submitted to
 the action of the waves are by that very excess made unequal.~
 Although the mathematical process by which this conclusion
 has been arrived at is intricate, the rationale of the result may be
 understood from common mechanical principles—it being evident
 that as the solid does not change its density like the <U+FB02>uid, the
 action upon it of the greater condensation cannot be counteracted
 by that of the smaller rarcfaction.
    The foregoing mathematical reasoning is incomplete, inasmuch
 as it does not determine the composition of the constants ml and
 1d,, and the relation of the one to the other in a given case of
 motion.      For the present       I  reserve the consideration of these
 points.     In the meanwhile the reasoning, as far as it has gone,

          Mr. A. Claudet     on  bloving Photographic Figures.       271
points to the inference that large waves act on a small sphere
in the manner of an attractive force by the accumulation of
pressure on the further side of the sphere, and that small waves
act in the manner of a repulsive force by reason of a defect of
pressure on that side.           The abstract demonstration of these
effects of the vibrations of an elastic <U+FB02>uid, besides being inter
esting as a matter of pure reasoning, appears to have an exten~
sive physical bearing, as suggesting that the :ethereal medium
in which the waves of light are known to be generated and
transmitted, may be the source from which all attractions and
repulsions derive their energy.         I consider that in this commu
nication a more secure basis is laid for a hydrodynamical theory
of the physical forces than in any previous attempt that          I have
made.      The former researches are vitiated by the adoption of
the commonly received law, that the condensation in central
motion varies inversely as the distance, which I now consider to
be an error.      This is more especially the case with respect to
the Theory of Gravity proposed in the Philosophical Magazine
for December 1859, for which the present researches supply a
substitute.

XXXVI.       On <U+FB02>Ioving Photographic Fiyures, illustrating some Phe

              the beginning of photography it must have struck
 FROM    many   of those who were acquainted with the phenomenon
 illustrated by the phcnakistoscope invented by Plateau, that
 photography could produce with advantage the series of pictures
 used in that instrument, on account of their possessing a greater
 degree of accuracy than when made by hand.             Ata later period,
 when the stereoscope had become popular from its application to
 photography, there must have been a still stronger incitement
 to make use of that process to produce binocular pictures for the
 phenakistoscope, in order to combine the stereoscopic effect with
 the illusion of moving <U+FB01>gures elicited in the phenakistoscope.
 For example, if a number of binocular photographic pictures
 were taken of a machine in various consecutive stages of its
 motion, these pictures, applied to a phenakistoscope, would give
 a complete illusion of the machine in perfect relief and in its full
 action.
     “ Communicated by the Author, having been read, the 7th of Septem
 ber, 1865, before the British Association at Birmingham.

  272      Mr. A. Claudct    on Moving Photographic Figures.
     Binocular pictures of persons dancing, fencing, or boxing, of
  acrobats at their wonderful feats, of boys playing at different
  games, all in the various stages of the action of each sport, repre
  senting   consecutively   the  whole   performance—such      pictures
  might have been supposed to be invaluable as calculated to ex
  hibit the stereoscopic illusion of persons in the real action of life.
  Therefore the solution of such an interesting problem was capable
 of exciting the emulation and the ambition of many ingenious and
  scienti<U+FB01>c minds.
     Among those who undertook the task, M. Duboscq, the emi
 nent optician of Paris, was the one who attained the greatest
 success.    He had <U+FB01>xed the two series of binocular photographs
 on two zones of the revolving disk of the phenakistoscope, one
 above the other ; and by means of two small mirrors placed each
 respectively at the inclination capable of re<U+FB02>ecting the two zones
 on the same horizontal line, from thence the images could each
 separately meet the axis of each of the two prismatic lenses of
 the stereoscope.    In this manner, during the revolution of the
 disk each eye had separately the perception of one of the series
 of photographs, each showing the perspective of one eye, and the
 stereoscopic effect of <U+FB01>gures in motion was consequent.
     M. Duboscq gave another form to the phenakistoscope.
 Instead of the vertical original revolving disk of Plateau, he
 employed a cylinder revolving on its vertical axis; and he placed
 on two inside zones of that cylinder, one above the other, the
 two series of photographic pictures, between the slits through
which the eyes can see the pictures; and by means of two mir
rors, as in the other apparatus, each series was re<U+FB02>ected on its
respective lens through the cylinder, and the stereoscopic effect
was produced in combination with the phenakistoscopic effect.
    However, these two attempts of M. Duboscq present a few
imperfections, which we are going to explain.        In the revolving
disk the two series of pictures do not move with the same velo
city, on account of their being placed on two zones of different
peripheries; and this produces a sort of confusion and distortion
in the representation of the object during its movement.           The
same defect exists in Plateau’s phenakistoscope in     the perception
of its single series; for the top and bottom parts of the <U+FB01>gures,
owing to the cause explained, revolving with different velocities,
are not impressed on the retinas during the same time; and the
blank spaces between the pictures, being larger for the top than
for the bottom part, give a stronger sensation of void during the
visual perception of the pictures.
    In the revolving cylinder this defect does not occur; but the
pictures being considerably curved, like the cylinder, is a most
unfavourable disposition for examining them in the stereoscope ;

          Mr. A. Claudet   on Moving Photographic Figures.         273
and if it were <U+FB02>at, it would not have its various parts revolving in
the same peripheries.     However, M. Duboscq’s contrivances are
 very ingenious, and   in his attempt he has succeeded at all events
in proving the possibility of solving the problem.
     About that time I had also turned my attention to the sub
ject, and found some dif<U+FB01>culty, in obtaining at once the phena
kistoseopic and the stereoscopic effects, in avoiding the defects
I   have alluded to.   However, as I am far from considering the
case to be quite desperate, I intend to resume my researches as
soon as I have leisure to do so.      \Vhat gives me some hopes of
success, is the attempt I made years ago. The result has been
                                      I
incomplete and imperfect; but if have not succeeded in obtain
 ing at once the motion and relief, I have gone so far as to show
<U+FB01>gures which appear really to be in motion, and preserving all
the correctness and distinctness of the photographs.
     My ambition to obtain the stereoscopic effect with the move
 ment of the <U+FB01>gures having (I hoped only momentarily) been
foiled, and not being satis<U+FB01>ed with partial success, I did not like
to publish an incomplete attempt, and for this reason, till now,
 kept it only for the curiosity of a few intimate scienti<U+FB01>c friends.
                                                  I
But years are passing away swiftly; and as do not feel at my
 period of life that I can reckon upon endless time and inexhaus
 tible activity to complete many labours, I did not like to let
another Meeting of the British Association pass without availing
myself of the opportunity of bringing before this annual scien
ti<U+FB01>c congress a very simple contrivance which, if I do not later
 succeed in solving the whole problem, will at all events, perhaps,
call the attention of others to the subject, and induce them to
try their hands and brains at its solution.
    This is one of the many instances of the advantages of the
British Association.     Once a year all the branches of science of
the world are brought together to show the progress made, and
point out the progress to be made.       All the devoted followers of
those sciences consider that they are obliged to contribute their
mite, however small it may be, to increase the general interest
of the Meeting, and to awaken the desire for further improve
ments and new discoveries.         In this way very often questions
are brought forward which otherwise would have been neglected
or forgotten.
     As will be seen by the instrument I submit to the Meeting,
 it is very easy to obtain the illusion of moving <U+FB01>gures, but with
out stereoscopic elfect. In this instrument, my <U+FB01>rst object
having been only to try the principle, I have constructed it in
the simplest form capable of showing the motion of the <U+FB01>gure;
and    I have found that only two pictures are suf<U+FB01>cient to elicit the
phenomenon, although the illusion of reality suffers from the

abruptness of two extreme movements, and from ' the de<U+FB01>ciency

    But nothing is so easy as to employ eight different pictures
 in as many different stages of the action, and with this number
 of pictures the effect will be suf<U+FB01>ciently complete.         For this,
 having placed in the stereoscope         two separate cubic frames,
 revolving independently on the same horizontal axis, I have only
 to <U+FB01>x on their four sides at right angles two sets of four pic
 tures, making eight pictures, which are made to pass in conse
 cutive order one after the other before the lenses of the instru
 ment, and the <U+FB01>gure will appear to assume consecutively eight
 different stages of the whole action.        The cubic frames are
 made to revolve by the motion applied to the slide which, as
 is to be explained, transfers the sight alternately from one eye
 to the other.    The instrument in its simple state, with only two
 pictures,  will suf<U+FB01>ce to illustrate the principle, and at the same
 time to elicit some curious phenomena of the perCeption of vision.
    It is known that the retina has the power of retaining for a
 short time the impression or the sensation of the image which
 has struck it.     Now, availing myself of this property, I have
 constructed the instrument in such a manner that, by means of
 a slide with one hole, I can, by moving it rapidly in a recipro
cating horizontal direction, shut one lens while the other remains
open; and in continuing that motion, while one eye sees one of
 the two pictures, the second eye cannot see the other picture.
    Now, if before the sensation of one eye is exhausted the slide
shuts the lens and opens the other, a new impression is pro
duced on the retina, and we have an uninterrupted sensation of
vision, as if the object had moved before us; and if a suf<U+FB01>cient
number of pictures represent that object in the various consecu
tive positions it has assumed during several stages of its motion,
 we experience on the retina the same sensation we have when
 we see the object itself while it is moving.      For it must be ob
served that although the pictures in their limited number do not,
and cannot, show all the intermediate positions of all the stages
of a continuing action, still the mind has the power of <U+FB01>lling
up the de<U+FB01>ciency, as it does     if, when looking at a   real object in
motion, We accidentally wink the eyes, or an obstacle happens
to pass between us and the object. Although during that short
interval we have l0st the perception of certain progress of the
                                          a
action, the mind has, as  it   were, guessed and represented to itself
what ought to have taken place during the winking of the eyes,
or during the intervention of the passing obstacle, and        by  that
power  of  the mind there has been no interruption in the whole
perception.
   This is  exempli<U+FB01>ed in the most forcible manner when we have

         Mr. A. Claudet     on   Moving Photographic Figures.           275
only    two pictures to look at alternately, one with the right
and    the other with the left eye, as with the instrument I have
 constructed for my experiment.          One of the pictures represents
 the beginning of an action, and the other the end of the same
 action.   By moving the slide one way the right eye can see the
 picture representing the <U+FB01>gure in one position, and the picture
 showing the other position is invisible to the left eye.              Now
 by moving    the   slide the  other  way  the  left eye  sees  the   <U+FB01>gure
in the second position, and the <U+FB01>rst position is invisible to the
right eye.      Now, although we have only seen the <U+FB01>gure in two
extreme positions, one showing the beginning of the action and
the other its end, still we have had the illusion of having seen
the intermediate positions.
    This is fully illustrated by the pictures representing two
boxers.    In one picture the arms and <U+FB01>sts of one of the pugilists
are near his body, as if he were preparing to hit his opponent;
and in the other picture they are extended in the act of striking
the blow.     We have not seen the intermediate positions which
the boxer ought to have gradually assumed during the whole
act, but we know that they must have taken place, and our
mind completes the action.           This mental perception is due to
the sensation which we expect from habit and judgment, and we
feel it as if it had been truly realized.
    Another curious phenomenon is elicited by the alternate vision
of the two eyes consecutively.         We see the object without any
difference   or   interruption,   whether  it is by the right or by the
left eye.   The ultimate sensation on the mind is the same from
whatever eye it has been carried to the sensorium of vision.
Whether the object be seen by the right or by the left eye, the
sensation is exactly the same, and we cannot even distinguish                    _
which is the eye that has had the perception; so that            if,  while
we have both eyes open, an object             is
                                             passing   before  us, or  ifwe
move the hand before the eyes in such               manner that
                                                     a           it   hides
alternately the vision of one and of the other eye, we do not
feel that the vision  is    passing from one eye to the other, and          it
is impossible    to  know  by   which eye we have had the perception.
   This explains the reason why in the instrument          I    have con
structed, which alternately shows apicture         in one position to one
eye, and     different picture in another position to the other eye,
         a a
we have     single perception of an object in motion without being
conscious that the two actions have been consecutively and sepa
rately perceived only      by  one eye at     time, and in turn    by   one
           by                  The  result    is a
and then        the   other.                  an  uninterrupted percep
tion of an object in motion.
   Our sensation of vision       is not in the eyes, but only in the
single sensorium of vision, to which both eyes convey their sepa

rate perceptions. We have an example of a similar physiological
fact in the sense of hearing.      Although we receive the sound
from two organs in opposite directions, only one perception is
felt by the mind; the two sensations, like two drops of water the
moment they reach each other, are resolVed into one.
    If, for such a tri<U+FB02>ing subject, I have encroached so much on
the time of the Meeting, I have to offer an excuse which,     I

one principle of science irresistibly leads us to another ?'and
how can we stop when we begin to unfold the marvellous and

                                              key to thermo-electric
THERMO-ELECTRICITYr—The
          should be found in the              effect produced by heat
        phenomena
 on the electric condition of molecules. Now when heat is applied
 to a surface, the molecules at the surface <U+FB01>rst receive the ethereal
 pulses of which the force of heat consists.     These pulses passing
 on  to the central atom of each molecule, or the condensed uni
 versal aether at the centre of the molecule, are there partially ex
 pended in expanding its electric atmosphere on the other side, and
 are partially propagated on. Upon reaching the inner side of the
 atom they will again be partially consumed in expanding the
 atmosphere on that side, while a certain portion will be trans
 mitted to the next atom. It is eas to see that this second expan
 sion should be less than the <U+FB01>rst.      nder these circumstances two
important electrical effects will be produced. (1) By reason of the
 greater expansion of the atmosphere on the cuter than on the inner
 side, its density will be diminished on the outer side, and hence
 electric azther will <U+FB02>ow around to that side. The molecular atmo
 sphere will therefore become polarized positively on the outer side.
 (2) As a consequence of this polarization,the molecular atmosphere
will urge away from it a portion of the electric ether posited near its
surface, and tend to develope a negative polarization in the particles
 of contiguous surfaces. The surface receiving the heat will then
 become positively polarized, and there will be at the same time an
electric movement outward from the surface.          Cold, or the abs
 traction of heat, will have precisely the opposite tendency; that
is,
  a   surface in the act of cooling will become negatively polarized,
 and this change will be attended with     a <U+FB02>ow of electricity toward
 the surface.    Such movements of the electric tether will be in

 combined, according to the conducting-power                    of the medium
 exterior to the surface (p. 111).            Substances may differ in the
 e<U+FB02>'ects thus produced under similar circumstances,                      from two
 causes—a difference in their conducting-power for heat, and a
 diti'erence in the degree of expansion, or in the effect of the ex—
 pansion produced by the same amount of heat.
     Now let a plate of bismuth be placed in contact with a plate
 of antimony, and let the junction be heated and the other ends
 be brought into good conducting communication.                     If the above
 mentioned effects of heat be di<U+FB02>'erent from these two metals, a
 current should set, at the junction, from the one which experi
 ences the greatest effect to that which experiences the least, and
 pass through the circuit. Bismuth is a poorer conductor of heat
 than antimony, and in fact than most other metals; and hence
 its surface-molecules should imbibe and retain more heat than
 those of the antimony.           The diamagnetic properties of bismuth
 also indicate, as will be seen hereafter, that its molecular atmo
 spheres are remarkably expansible.              If these peculiarities of bis
 muth be admitted, we have an explanation of the fact that his
 muth is positive* to other metals in its thermo-electric relations.
 The bismuth and antimony in the thermo-electric pair, it will be
 observed, hold the same relation to each other as the zinc and
 copper in the galvanic pair, and the heat does the same electrical
 duty in the one that the oxygen does in the other.
     If the other ends of the two metals be brought together and
 cooled, the current will be reinforced, since the molecular atmo
 spheres of the bismuth will contract more than those of the anti
 mony. (See effect of cold, p. 276.)
     It has been ascertained as the result of numerous experiments,
 that “increasing the temperature of the negative metal gene
 rally increases the amount of de<U+FB02>ection of the galvanometer
 needle produced by heating the junction; while if the higher
 heat is applied to the metal which is positive at moderate tem
 peratures, a current in the opposite direction is established.” To
 get at the explanation of these curious effects, we must observe
 that the “ higher heat ” spoken of is applied at a certain distance
 from the junction, and hence it is the inner sides of the surface
 molecules which <U+FB01>rst receive the heat from this second source,
 and become positively polarized.            Accordingly the current should
 be strengthened       in  the   <U+FB01>rst   case  above meutioned, and wealt
 ened in the second.          It has also been observed that “ a current
    ‘  By the positive metal is here meant that which imparts, at the heated
junction, positive electricity to the other metal. ‘ This 1s‘often termed the
negative metal.      Its polarization is positive, but its electrical state is negrh
tive (p. 104).

may be excited with two wires of the same metal, by heating
the end of one and bringing it in contact with the other; and
that the direction of the current at the junction is from the cold
to the hot wire.”       In this case it is to be remarked that the hot
wire is in the act of cooling; and hence there should be an elec
 tric movement toward its surface (p. 276), or from the cold to
 the hot wire through the junction.
      Pym-electric CrystaLs.—Tourmaline is the most conspicuous
 crystal belonging to this class.      “A prism of tourmaline has dif
 ferent secondary planes at its two extremities, or, as it is ex
 pressed, is hemihedrally modi<U+FB01>ed.”           This peculiarity of crystal
 lization, which also obtains in the other pyro-electric crystals,
 indicates that in the direction of the axis the molecules of the
 crystal have different mechanical properties on opposite sides.
  In this condition of things we may reasonably suppose that the
  molecular atmospheres would expand unequally on opposite
  sides, under the in<U+FB02>uence of the same amount of heat.               Ifthis
  be admitted, we have a complete explanation of the electric phe
  nomena exhibited by the tourmaline when heated, in accordance
  with the principles already laid down.           Thus let a tourmaline
  be heated regularly—that     is,  so that all points of its surface shall
  receive equal increments of heat     ;   at all points of the surface the
  unequal expansive action of the heat upon the two sides of the
  molecular atmospheres in the axial direction will determine
  their polarization and an attendant electric movement from the
  positively polarized side of one molecule to the negatively polar
   ized side of the next.       There should accordingly be opposite
   electrical states manifested at the ends of the crystal.       This state
   of things should continue so long as the temperature          is  rising.
   Butit   is to be observed that the effective polarization determined
   in each molecule    by  the heat   isweakened    by  the discharge that
   takes place   from  one   molecule   to  the next, and that from this
   cause the signs of electrical excitement at the ends of the crystal
   will be much feebler when the temperature becomes uniform
   than they would otherwise be.         Now  if    the heated tourmaline
   be cooled regularly, the process that attended upon the heating
   will be reversed, and the electrical states, or effective poles, will
   be reversed.     This reversal of the poles may occur soon after the
    temperature begins to fall, because of the above-mentioned weak
    ening of the effective polarization, since this remaining polari
    zation, when the temperature becomes uniform, which            is  really
    e<U+FB02>ective upon    bodies  placed   near  the   ends  of the  tourmaline,
    may be no greater than the opposite transient polarization that
    may arise from a    small loss of temperature.
       Mutual Attractions and qulsions        of   Electric Currents.—~We
    have seen that in an electric current there       is a  <U+FB02>ow or onward

                Prof. Norton    on Molecular  Physics.            279
movement of electric tether throughout the entire route of the
current.     Now the rapidly moving molecules of electric tether
must act impulsively against the universal aether in their path;
and every such impulse must be propagated inde<U+FB01>nitely outward
through this aether.     The innumerable impulses thus originating
in a current are parallel to the direction of the current, and
must take effect upon all surrounding molecules in this direction.
    They constitute what may be called the external impulsive force
of the current. The well-known phenomena under immediate
consideration, as well as all the other phenomena of the external
action of currents to be discussed, are to be ascribed to the ope
ration of this external impulsive force. Let us <U+FB01>rst take the case
of two parallel wires conveying currents in the same direction.
The impulses propagated from these wires will tend to weaken
the tension of the universal tether lying between the wires.         A
similar effect, but less in amount, will be produced upon          the
tether lying on the outer sides of the wires.    The aethereal tension
should therefore be in excess upon the outer sides of the wires,
and hence they should be urged toward each other, or there
should be an apparent attraction between the wires conveying
the currents.     The excess of aethereal tension here alluded to is
attributable to the fact that the impulses proceeding from the
one wire, in being propagated through the other, are materially
reduced in intensity.     This effect results mainly from the disper
sion produced by the interstitial tether, which is brought into a
very disturbed state of density by the swiftly moving atoms of
the electric tether in the current.     When only one of the wires
conveys a current, no attraction or repulsion is observed, because
the dispersion just mentioned is wantin".
    If the currents be supposed to traVerse the wires in opposite
directions, then the same operative cause, the external impulsive
forces of the currents, will compress the aether between the wires
to a greater degree than beyond them, and thus there will be an
 effective force urging them further apart.
    Let a, <U+FB01>g. 8, be a point of one of the currents from which an
 impulse is propagated, and ab, ac, ad                 Fig_ 8 '
lines radiating from itand crossing the
second wire, 12, under different degrees
of obliquity. The dotted lines drawn
 between bd and eg represent the lines
 of moving electrical atoms. Each of
 the lines ab, ac, ad will cross the same
 number of such lines, and therefore impulses propagated along
 them will encounter the same number of moving atoms, and eitpe
 rience the same proportional diminution. This diminution should
 be a certain constant fractional part of the impulse that reaches

280              Prof. Norton  on Molecular Physics.
any point of the nearer side eg of the wire.       The diminution
of the propagated impulse in traversing the wire, simply by
reason of the increased length of the passage, as the line is more
oblique, should also be a constant fractional part of the impulse;
      f
since c is the same proportional part of a f, or a n for each point
of the wire.     Hence the action of any point a of the <U+FB01>rst wire
                   f
upon any point of the second should be inversely proportional
to the square of the distance; and the entire force of action of
one inde<U+FB01>nite wire upon another should be inversely propor
tional to the distance between the two.       (See Lamé, Cour: de
Physique,   vol. iii. p. 236.)
   If the currents cross each other under a certain angle instead
of being parallel, it may be seen, by attending to the mutual
actions of the separate points of the two currents, that there
will be attractions or repulsions according to the relative direc
tions of the currents at the points; and that the entire action
will tend to bring the two currents into the same direction, in
which the attraction will be a maximum.
   Ewternal Action of an Electric Current upon bodies in their
natural state.—In undertaking to deduce from our fundamental
             the varied phenomena of the action of a current upon
principles
  odies in its vicinity, we have to consider that there are two
modes in which the external impulsive force of a current may
act upon such bodies and develope currents,—the one direct, and
the other indirect.       (1) The propagated impulses may take
effect directly upon the atoms of the electric atmospheres of the
molecules, impelling them in the same direction that the primary
current is moving, and so tend to generate a current similar to
the primary.      (2) Or these same aethereal impulses may fall
upon    the central   atoms of the molecules, force up the atmo
spheres on the side of the atoms upon which they fall, and so
develope a current opposite to the original one.       We have to
consider also that theoretically the external current-force may
operate in both these ways, either upon the simple molecules
which are grouped together into compound molecules, or upon
compound molecules as a whole. The action upon the constituents
of the compound molecules tends to develope currents within
the mass of these molecules.       Among the variety of especial
currents which may thus be excited, we have particularly to
note those which may be developed in the surface of each group,
and circulate around it from particle to particle.    If the direct
 mode of operation of the primary current predominates, such
circular currents are magnetic; if the indirect prevail, they are
diamagnelic.     If the two tendencies countervail each other, the
 substance is in a neutral magnetic condition.    The neutral mag
 netic state may also result from the absence of groups of parti

                Prof. Norton   on    Molecular Physics.             281
eles,   in the substance, within which circular currents        can be
established.
   To the action of the current upon each compound molecule,
with its own proper atmosphere (p. 99), as a whole, are to be as
cribed the remarkable phenomena of Induced Currents, especially
so called.    Experiment has hitherto failed to detect the exist
ence of any current, from one such molecule to another, or
through the mass of a body, produced by the uniform action of
an established current.      All such induced currents result from
either an increase or a decrease in the effective action of the in
ducing current, and are wholly due to the indirect mode of ope
ration of this current.     This fact indicates, in accordance with
the views that have been advanced upon electric polarization
 (p. 100), that the current developes      a polarization in the com
pound molecules of bodies which increases or decreases as the
external impulsive action of the current increases or decreases,
but remains constant so long as this action continues the same.
This polarization                 “ electrotonic state ” of bodies.
                   is Faraday’s
   [Magnetism—The general nature of the magnetic currents, as
distinguished from other electric currents, has just been indicated.
The existence of such currents in the surface of          a   compound
molecule seems to imply that there       is  virtual chain of particles
                                              a
extending circularly around    it, which there should be   if  the num
ber of particles in each group be large.         Ampére’s     researches
have completely established that the idea of circular molecular
currents   isthe key to all magnetic phenomena.        It suf<U+FB01>ces there
fore, for our present purpose, to show, as has been done, that
such currents are legitimately deducible from the fundamental
conceptions laid down at the outset, and that the mutually attrac
tive and repulsive actions of currents may also be derived from
the same mechanical ideas (p. 278).       we adopt, then, de<U+FB01>nitively,
Ampére’s theory of the constitution of        magnet.
                                              a
   The immediate cause of the development of magnetic currents
is the direct impulsive action of an established current taking
effect upon the particles in the surface of compound molecules.
   In respect to magnetic properties, we have specially to distin
guish soft iron and steel. The cause of their difference of pro
perty seems to lie simply in   a  difference in the conducting-power
of the groups of particles into which they are aggregated.             If
in soft iron these groups are good conductors, the electric tether
set in motion should pass freely around them, unattended with
any material polarization of the particles, and unrcsisted        by the
force that results from     such  polarization (p. 103).      When   the
exciting cause ceases to operate, there       no force remaining to
                                              is
counteract the resistance of the universal aather to the <U+FB02>ow of
the electricity and the retarding operation of contiguous oppo

sing currents.        But if   we suppose that,     in the case of steel, the
molecular groups          are  imperfect     conductors,    the magnetizing
force will develops a polarization of the separate molecules; and,
as a consequence, the currents may pass chie<U+FB02>y through their
atmospheres, as in the case of electric induction (p. 101).                  In
this state of things, when the force is withdrawn, it does not
follow that the magnetic currents will entirely pass off ; for there
would apparently be a force in operation which would tend to
retain currents of a certain intensity in circulation.             This is the
mutual action of the contiguous positive and negative sides of
two molecules throughout the chain.                It would seem that such
a circular chain of particles would not, of necessity, attain to a
condition of statical polarization, but might reach a dynamical
equilibrium in which the impulsive force, from each discharge
brought about by the action of contiguous molecules, should
restore the polarization lost by the discharge to the next pre
ceding molecule*.
     According to this view, permanent magnetization consists in
polarizing the molecules; and it is this induced state which de
termines and maintains, in opposition to all resistances, currents
of a certain intensity.         A certain amount of force (“coercive
force”)      and  a certain  interval   of time are expended in developing
this polarization.        At the same time it is only when this force
is exerted with this result that permanent magnetism can exist.
 Heat, or a blow, or an electric discharge, by destroying the mole
cular polarization, may demagnetize the bar. It is also to be
 observed that intense heat may demagnetize a bar, and destroy
the susceptibility to magnetism in iron or steel, by breaking up
the groups of particles into which the mass is aggregated.
     Diamaynelism.—It has already been intimated that the dia~
 magnetic state into which certain substances, as bismuth, phos
 phorus, antimony, &c., are brought by the action of a powerful
 magnet, probably consists in the circulation of currents around
 the compound molecules of the mass in the opposite direction
 to the inducing current, and that these currents result from the
 second mode of operation of the external force of the primary
 current (p. 280).        Accordingly, the susceptibility to diamag
 netism must arise from a special liability to expansion on the
 part of the electric atmospheres of the simple molecules, when
 urged upward by the aethereal pulses that fall upon their central
 atoms.
    *  It is worthy of consideration,  whether certain phenomena of luminosity
 as phosphorescence, heat-lightning,     &c., may not have a similar origin, viz.
 in recurring discharges resulting from a previous molecular polarization,
 established by an electric discharge through the mass—or from a similar
 effect produced in a fecbler degree by heat or light.

   Electro-magnetism.—The essential theory of the development
of magnetism by electric currents, and of electro-magnetic phe
nomena generally, is embracd in what has already been stated
(pp. 278—281).
    Magneto-electricity.—~The       excitation of electric currents by
magnetic action is a phenomenon of pure induction, and will be
included under the next head.
    Induction of Electric Currents.—The term induction, as ordi
narily used in dynamical electricity, has reference only to the
development of currents, through wires, or upon the surfaces, or
within the mass of bodies. It will suf<U+FB01>ce to con<U+FB01>ne our atten
tion to the origination of currents in wires forming a cloaed
circuit. The general idea of the process, as contemplated from
our theoretical point of view, has already been indicated.            The
fundamental principle which covers the whole ground                   that is,
 whenever the action of the impulsive force of any current begins
 oris   on the increase, the induced current sets in the opposite
 direction to the inducing current; and when the same action
 terminates or  is   on the decrease, the induced <U+FB02>ows in the same
 direction as the inducing current.       The rationale         is,
                                                           that the tethe
 real pulses of the originating force fall upon the condensed aether
 at the central portion of each group of molecules, and urge out
 ward the interstitial electric azther on that side of the group.
 This determines <U+FB02>ow of certain portion of the electric aather
                     a          a
 around to that side, and       a  consequent positive polarization on
 that side of the group or compound molecule.                 While this
 process   of polarization is  going   on,  there must  then  be   <U+FB02>ow of  a
 electricity  from  one compound molecule to        the next, in the same
  direction in which the transfer of aether occurs within the mole
 cules themselves, as an inevitable attendant upon the increasing
 polarization (p. 101).       When the primary action becomes con
 stant, there simply abides          astate of static polarization,      an
  “ electrotonic state,” in which an
                                          equilibrium prevails through
  out the circuit.    But when this action falls 011', the polarization
  maintained   by   itmust decline, and      a  current arises setting in
  the opposite direction to the former one.           The inducing cur
  rent may be either electric or magnetic, so called.             The in
  crease of its action upon the adjacent wire may result either
  from the closing of the circuit in the case of        galvanic current,

of the magnet, or a recess of the wire from the current, or a
movement of the wire in the magnetic <U+FB01>eld attended with a di
minished action of the entire impulsive force of the magnet.
   The oppositely directed currents induced by alternately closing
and breaking the galvanic circuit, when the two contiguous
wires are formed into a hollow coil, are greatly augmented by
inserting rods or bundles of iron wire within the coil.        The
explanation of this      is,
                         doubtless, that the direct action of the
galvanic current    is  reinforced            by
                                        the magnetic currents which           it
developes in the iron. The other cases of induction above referred
to need not be dwelt upon, with the exception of that resulting
from the movement of wire to di<U+FB01>erent points of the magnetic
                               a
<U+FB01>eld.
   This case has been subjected to rigorous experimental ana
                                                   a
lysis by Faraday, who has deduced from his researches the follow
ing general results.       If   wire, forming part of

                                                                 a

                                                   a  and  moved in the
magnetic     <U+FB01>eld, across  the  “lines of force,” or magnetic curves, a
current will be induced in the wire.                    If
                                                 the wire be moved in
one direction across these lines of force,          current in
                                                             a   certain  a
direction will arise, and       if be moved across them
                                     it                        the other
                                                                     in
direction, a    current in the opposite direction will be induced.
The quantity of electricity set in motion will depend upon the
number of lines of force crossed                   by
                                            the moving wire, and not
upon the obliquity of the direction of the motion to these lines.
Thus  if  the wire be placed over the middle of the magnet (m,
<U+FB01>g.   9) and moved in any
direction from this position
across the lines of force as
shown in the <U+FB01>gure, acur
rent will be induced in            it,
running in the same direc
tion as the circular currents
on the upper side of the ‘~
magnet; and    if  the wire be
moved across these lines to
ward the middle of the mag
net,  a current will traverse
the wire in the opposite di
rection.     In each case the
comparative quantity of electricity set in motion will depend
solely upon the comparative number of magnetic curves crossed,
and not upon the line mr, ms, or mt, along which the movement
takes place.
   These facts are  in   entire accordance with the fundamental prin
ciple of   induction   stated  on page 283.      For (1) the impulsive

               Prof. Norton   on   Molecular Physics.                        285
force of the magnet at any point of the <U+FB01>eld is the resultant of
the special impulsive forces due to all the circular currents of
the magnet, and has the same direction as these currents in the
upper face of the magnet.             This resultant will have the
greatest value at the middle of the magnet m, and decrease in
all directions from this point.      (3) The curves of equal impul;
 sive force correspond very closely to Faraday’s “lines of force.”
 For it will be seen on a little re<U+FB02>ection, that the force will, be
 yond a certain distance from the middle, if not from the very
 middle, decrease most rapidly parallel to the surface of the mag
 net; and that the curves of equal impulsive force, proceeding
 from points on the ends of the magnet, will recede over the
 middle of the magnet to a greater distance from it than half its
 length. This is strikingly true of the curves that originate from
  near the centre of each end; for at the very centre the force in
 question vanishes entirely, and therefore the curves for that
 point would be thrown to an in<U+FB01>nite distance from the middle
  of the magnet.
       In making a comparative estimate of the impulsive force of
  the magnet in different parts of the <U+FB01>eld, it should be observed
  that in receding from the magnet the force that results from any
  one molecular current is the resultant of the opposing impulses
  propagated from the oppositely directed currents on the nearer
  and further sides of the molecule, and that this not only depends
  upon the distance of the point from the molecule, but also upon
  the obliquity of the line connecting the two, to the plane of
  the circular current.   For the same distance the resultant will
  be greatest when the point lies in this plane, and zero when the
  point is oppoaite the centre of the current.       Bearing this in
  mind, it may readily be seen that if a line no be drawn parallel
   to the axis of the magnet at any distance from            it,
                                                        the impulsive
   force of the magnet along this line will decrease from the point
   1:, opposite the middle   of the magnet, inde<U+FB01>nitely in both di
   rections; also that the force will decrease along       line, asa         if,
   parallel to the  end, and  vanish at o in the prolongation of the
 ans.

 force taking effect upon the wire will decrease     and that      be;          if it
 inward, the force will increase.    Hence, agreeably to the funda
 mental principle before alluded to (p. 283), in the <U+FB01>rst case there
 should be an induced current having the same direction as the
 currents of the upper face of the magnet, and in the second
 case     current pursuing the opposite direction.

 amount of change of force which results from the displacement
 0f the wire, and therefore the quantity of electricity which
 this change sets in motion, should depend solely upon the
 number of curves traversed.        We may add that in whatever
 part of the magnetic <U+FB01>eld, and in whatever direction the wire be
 supposed to move, the theoretical result      in perfect accordance

          The individual molecular currents lying in      a    transverse section of the
magnet are here supposed to be replaced by two linear currents transverse

magnetic <U+FB01>eld; but Faraday has shown that a current may also
be induced in the wire, by bending it into a curve and causing
it to revolve around the magnet, after one end has been brought
into contact with the equatorial part of the magnet, and the
other with a wire or rod leading out

from the pole, as shown in <U+FB01>g. 11.
“A copper ring was <U+FB01>xed round and
in contact with the equatorial part,
and the wire e made to bear by
spring pressure against this ring,
and also against a ring on the axis.” The direction of the current
changed with the direction of revolution.          Corresponding cur
rents were also obtained by rotating       the  magnet in the opposite
directions, the wire remaining <U+FB01>xed.          To explain these currents
upon the principles now developed, we must <U+FB01>rst observe that
the impulsive force of the magnet will impart a transverse pola
rization to the molecules of the wire. Now let a motion of revo
lution be imparted to the wire in a direction opposite to that
of the circulation of the magnetic currents, and the relative velo
city with which the zethereal impulses will fall upon the mole
cules will be the sum of the velocity due to the impulse, and
that of the molecules themselves in the opposite direction.          The
molecules at the end e of the wire will therefore take on a
higher polarization than is induced in the copper ring by the
magnet simply.       This polarization should be attended with a
disturbance of the electric condition of the molecules in the
direction of the length of the wire.         There should then be an
inequality  in  this disturbance   at  the   point of contact e. This
inequality   should  originate  a   current   that  would pass around
the circuit. Let 1: denote the velocity answering to the magnetic
impulse, and v' the velocity of revolution of the molecule at e.
Then the effect due to the polarizing force at the end e of the
wire may be represented by m(v+r/)9, and that induced in the
contiguous particles of the copper ring by mv’.          The difference
is mv'(2v+v'), which represents       the   electromotive   force of the
current.    It the wire were made to revolve around an unmag
netized bar, the originating force of the current would be mv".
The electromotive force just mentioned would exceed this nearly
in the ratio of 21) to v'. A very high velocity of revolution of
the wire would therefore be required to develope a sensible cur
rent if the bar were unmagnetized.          The above expression for
the electromotive force, viz. mv'(2v+v'), which is nearly equal
to 2mcv', shows that this force is proportional to the velocity 1/
of revolution of the wire.      The entire force developed in ten
revolutions of the wire should then remain the same if the velo
city of revolution should be changed (as determined by Fara

        Prof. Young    on  Newton’s Rule for Imaginary Roots.         289
 day).     If the magnet rotates in the opposite direction, its im
 pulses against the aether will be correspondingly increased, and
 the result will be the same.
     Faraday, in certain papers originally published in the Philo
 sophical Magazine and the Philosophical Transactions, has in
 dulged in ingenious speculations upon the probable physical
 character of the lines of magnetic force, and distinctly intimates
 that he inclines to the opinion that they have in reality a physi
 cal existence, correspondent to their analogues the electric lines,
 instead of being simply “ representants of magnetic power,” or
 lines of resultant magnetic action.           In speculating upon the
 question in what this physical existence may consist, he remarks
 that “ it may be a vibration of the hypothetical aather ” (along
 the lines), “ or a state or tension of that aether equivalent to either
 a dynamic or a static condition, or it may be some other state.”
The results arrived at in the present paper are opposed to these
 speculative ideas of the great English physicist, for our conclu
sions are that the lines upon which the phenomena of induction
by a magnet depend are merely lines of equal magnetic action ;
but the action is that of a force whose existence has not here
tofore been recognized, viz. the so-called impulsive force of the
 magnet.

XXXVIII.        On Newton’s Rule      for Imaginary Roots.      By J. R.

                    object
                                 the exact number of imaginary roots
in a given numerical equation: Newton’s Rule does not under
take so comprehensive an of<U+FB01>ce.           All that is aimed at in the in
vestigation referred to, is the discovery of the number of inde
pendent imaginary pairs; all of which have this peculiarity,
namely, they necessitate the entrance of imaginary roots, ful
<U+FB01>lling the <U+FB01>rst or second of the conditions at p. 114, into the
limiting cubics at p. 115.
    As a distinctive epithet, we may call those imaginaries in the
primitive equation which have this peculiar character primary
pairs; and the object is to ascertain how many of such pairs
enter the equation.
    The desired information, as appears from what has just been
said, is to be derived exclusively from the cubic equations alluded
to: these are each to be submitted to the <U+FB01>rst and second of the
tests for imaginary roots given at p. 114:, the <U+FB01>rst test being
employed for the leading three terms of each cubic, and the

  second test for the <U+FB01>nal three.     Since, however, the value of n
  is 3 for every cubic equation, it follows that in the conditions
  referred to, 2n is the same as 3(n—1), and (n—1) the same as
  2(n—2) ; so that,    N“,    being put for the middle one of either
  of the three consecutive coef<U+FB01>cients in any cubic, only one con
  dition need be appealed to in reference to the character of the
  roots of that cubic, namely, the condition
                            3A'k A'k+,> A'QHI.     .  .   .  .  .   (1)
     Now in prosecuting the search after primary pairs, we proceed
   (mentally at least) as follows :——-Taking the three leading coef<U+FB01>
  cients of the proposed equation, we form from them the <U+FB01>rst
  three terms of the commencing cubic at p. 115.         From this in
  complete cubic we determine, by an appeal to the condition (1),
  whether or not a primary pair of imaginaries enters the proposed
  equation solely as a consequence of the relative values of the <U+FB01>rst
  three coq<U+FB01>icients of that equation.
     If a pair be seen to enter, a pair would still enter, alter the
  subsequent coef<U+FB01>cients as we may; but if the terms of the in
  complete cubic do not satisfy the condition (1), then a primary
'
  pair cannot enter the primitive equation solely as a consequence
  of the relative values of these three coef<U+FB01>cients.
     We now pass on to the fourth of the given coef<U+FB01>cients, by the
  introduction of which we complete the cubic, and then examine
  its last three terms.    If these satisfy (1), we infer one primary
  pair, and one pair only, whether the condition for the <U+FB01>rst three
  terms hold or fail.     In the former case there is a double indica
  tion of the same thing; in the latter case buta single indication.
     Whatever be the character of the <U+FB01>nal three terms in reference
  to the condition (1),    I have proved that that character will of
  necessity be transmitted to the leading three of the cubic next
  following: these therefore need not be submitted to the test (1) f
  and the second cubic being completed by aid of the <U+FB01>fth coef<U+FB01>d
  cient of the proposed equation, we then examine, as before, the
  <U+FB01>nal three terms.      And in this way we proceed, from cubic to
  cubic, till the last of the iven coef<U+FB01>cients is brought down.
     I  have demonstrated t at in this series of cubics consecutive
  ful<U+FB01>lments of the condition (1) merely repeat the information
  conveyed by the <U+FB01>rst ful<U+FB01>lmenti they concur in testifying to
  one and the same thing, namely, the necessary entrance of but
  a single pair of imaginaries into the proposed equation.         For
  aught we know to the contrary, other pairs may enter, and enter,
  too, like the primary pair, quite independently of subsequent
  coef<U+FB01>cients; but we can pronounce with certainty only as to the
  number of primary pairs that enter.
     If after a ful<U+FB01>lment of the condition (1), or after a series of
  ful<U+FB01>lments, there occur a failure, that failure must take place

           Prof. Young   on Newton’s   Rule for Imaginary Roots.         291
.   in the <U+FB01>nal triad of the cubic into which it <U+FB01>rst enters.        Should
    this be the terminal cubic, the examination ends, and nothing
    can be inferred beyond what was previously known. But if
    other cubics still remain, and the failure or succession of failures
    be followed by a ful<U+FB01>lment, this ful<U+FB01>lment must occur in the
    <U+FB01>nal triad of the cubic where it <U+FB01>rst appears. And it must indi
    cate a new and independent primary pair.
        This last conclusion I regard as an axiomatic truth—as a prin
    ciple of which, though no special proof is given, no special proof
    is needed by a mind clearly apprehending the antecedent rea
    soning.      To such a mind the following obvious considerations
    can scarcely fail to suggest themselves.
         1. The condition (1) is applied exclusively to the triads of the
    successive cubics, and not to those of the primitive equation at
    all. Whatever knowledge we gain of the character of the roots
    of this primitive, we derive from the character of these triads as
    tested, set after set, by the condition      (1), our inferences, how
    ever, being always    controlled  by  the fact  that each triad consists
     of three terms of a cubic equation, so that the two triads fur
    nished by every such cubic can never imply more than one ima
     ginary pair.     And however many of the successive triads ful<U+FB01>l
     the condition (1) of primary pairs, suf<U+FB01>cient reason is given why
     the inference of multiple pairs is forbidden: every <U+FB01>nal triad
     transmits its character, in reference to the condition (1), to the
     leading triad of the next cubic.
         Since a ful<U+FB01>lment after a failure (as also a failure after a ful<U+FB01>l
     ment) always takes place in a <U+FB01>nal triad, it is plain that such a
     ful<U+FB01>lment is entirely owing to the coef<U+FB01>cient last brought down
     from the primitive, to ccmpletethe cubic,bcing of a certain suitable
     value.    By simply altering the value of this coef<U+FB01>cient, we could
     expel the imaginary pair from the cubic, replacing it not only by a
     real, but even by an equal pair, all the other coef<U+FB01>cients remain
      ing untouched.     And consequently, by this change of a single
     coef<U+FB01>cient of the primitive equation, a pair of primary roots
      would disappear.      In a cubic not so constituted, that    is,in one
      not consisting of failure followed
                         a                     by
                                                a  ful<U+FB01>lment, such conver
      sion of imaginary roots into real could never be brought about
     by   any alteration in the coef<U+FB01>cient brought down from the pri
      mitive to complete that cubic.
         Suppose that from preceding cubic one primary pair
                              a                                    II  in the
      primitive has been detected, and let the primary pair now indi
      cated be denoted   by  19.   This latter primary pair   is  wholly de
      pendent for its existence, as such, upon an advanced eoe<U+FB02>icient
      0f the primitive equation, of which coef<U+FB01>cient the primary pair
     11   is wholly independent.     It   isimpossible, therefore, that
       and    can be one and the same pair.        And     submit that, to a I1
           IQ                                        I

careful reader of my demonstration, all this must be abundantly
apparent.
   2.   If,however, from having but an in<U+FB01>rm grasp of the sub
ject, anyone should demur to the above conclusion, or to that
marked      at page 116 of my former paper, let him further con
             3
sider that     only the three leading terms of an equation of the
                 if
nth degree be written down, that equation will necessarily have
two significant roots, the following coef<U+FB01>cients being merely
zer0s; that the introduction of another signi<U+FB01>cant term will
cause the entrance of another signi<U+FB01>cant root, of two signi<U+FB01>cant
terms, two more signi<U+FB01>cant roots, and so on; that          that for    is,
k+l terms there must be signi<U+FB01>cant roots in the equation,
                                 k
and that, too, how many soever of the terms between the <U+FB01>rst
and last (these themselves being signi<U+FB01>cant terms) are replaced
 by zeros.    But   the pairs
                      if          II,    1.2,
                                     noted above, could be but one
and the same pair, then for lc+l terms there would be fewer
than     signi<U+FB01>cant roots, which
        1:                              is
                                    impossible.
 I    here take my leave of this subject—a subject on which

be corrected.

opinion  on my supposed demonstration.                   I  did nothing of the
kind.

                                     caused to be forwarded to
Professor Young an invitation to attend my lecture.”  The only
invitation that reached me was through The Times’ newspaper,

MY of which
        experiments on the formation of indigo-blue, an account
                   had the honour of presenting to this Society
                                  I
several years ago, led me to make some inquiries regarding
the processes employed in tropical countries for the produc
tion of indigo from the various plants yielding that dye
stu<U+FB01>'.     found that all the authors who have written on
               I
the subject agree in af<U+FB01>rming that the process of fermen
tation, which     the one usually adopted for the purpose of
                                  is
extracting the colour from the plant, requires to be con
ducted with the greatest care, in order to yield      successful                            a
result.   Unless certain precautions are adopted,       product                                 a
of very inferior quality will be obtained; in some cases, in
deed, the colouring-matter       entirely lost.  This will not is
be surprising to any one who considers that though indigo
blue, when once formed,        very stable compound, the sub

     From the Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical                                 Society of Man
chester, S. 3. vol. iii. Session 1864—65.

294               Dr. Schunck   on some Products
nation  I should have been inclined to rest contented, had      I
not acquired a knowledge of some other facts relating to in
digo-blue, to which the same explanation cannot be applied,
but which evidently belong to the same class.
   It is well known to those dyers who employ the so-called
woad-vat, in which the reduction of the indigo-blue is effected
by the action of various organic matters, such as woad, mad
 der, and bran, together with lime, that if the process be not
carefully managed it may change its character entirely, the
 contents of the vat entering into a state of complete putrefac_
tion—a change which results in the total destruction, or at
least disappearance, of the colouring-matter.      Now this phe
nomenon, the reality of     which  cannot be doubted,  though its
nature has never been subjected to scienti<U+FB01>c scrutiny, cannot
be explained in accordance with what is at present known
regarding indigo-blue, which is considered by chemists to be
a body of such a stable character as not to be decomposed by
any except very potent agents, such as chlorine, bromine, and
nitric acid. In no work on scienti<U+FB01>c chemistry is it stated
that indigo-blue may be decomposed by any process of fermen
tation or putref'action, in the same way as sugar or albumen.
   In my experiments on indigo-blue        I have generally em
ployed for its reduction and puri<U+FB01>cation the process of
Fritzsche, which consists in acting on it with a mixture of
alcohol, grape-sugar, and caustic soda. The colouring-matter
dissolves when the mixture is heated, and is again deposited
on exposure to the atmosphere, in crystalline needles.       Now
in performing this operation with very small quantities of
indigo-blue and an excess of alcohol and grape-sugar, I found
that the colouring-matter did not make its appearance again
on agitating the solution with air. The yellow colour of the
liquid passed as usual through red to green; but, instead of
the indigo-blue being precipitated, the whole became yellow
or brownish-yellow, and the colouring matter' disappeared
entirely. In this way      I had the morti<U+FB01>cation of losing a
quantity of indigo-blue which       I had prepared with much
labour from human urine, though the loss resulted, as it after
wards turned out, in some gain of information.
   This fact was also dif<U+FB01>cult to account for, since it is
usually supposed that by the combined action of reducing
agents and alkalies indigo-blue merely takes up an atom of
hydrogen and then dissolves, and, by the action of the atmo
spheric oxygen is again precipitated, unchanged and undimi
nished in quantity.
   In orch to ascertain on what the disappearance of the
colouring-matter in this case depends,        I  <U+FB01>rst dissolved a

                     derived from Indigo-blue.                 295
small quantity of indigo-blue by means of grape-sugar and
caustic soda, using water as a solvent instead of alcohol ; but
though the indigo-blue was kept for a long time in solution,
 and heat was applied at the same time to assist the action,
it made its appearance again on exposure to the air, apparently
 undiminished in quantity.       In another experiment, in which
alcohol was used as the menstruum and protoxide of tin as
the reducing-agent, the same result was arrived at. It was
therefore apparent that the disappearance of the colouring
matter was due to the combined action of the alcohol and
the grape-sugar, not to the separate action of either. By the
use of a great excess of these two agents, together with caustic
soda and the long-continued application of heat to the solu
tion,  I succeeded in causing several grammes of indigo-blue
to disappear entirely.     I avoid the word decompose, because,
as  I shall show, the colouring-matter is not decomposed, but
enters into new forms of combination.
   It now occurred to me that, since by the action of caustic
alkalies on sugar acetic and formic acids are formed, the
effect produced by the grape-sugar in this process might in
reality be due to the presence of one or both of these acids
rather than to that of the sugar itself. My supposition was
completely veri<U+FB01>ed by experiment. On treating some pure
indigo-blue with alcohol, to which an alkaline solution of pro
toxide of tin was added until it dissolved, then adding acetate
of soda and digesting at a moderate heat, the indigo-blue after
some time ceased to be deposited on exposure to the air, or
even agitation; it had entirely disappeared.       The same thing
occurred when formiate of      soda  was  employed in the place of
acetate.    It was evident, therefore, that in this process acetic
or formic acid was capable of playing the same part as grape
sugar; and as the use of the latter might have tended to
introduce complications, in consequence of the formation of
secondary products,    I ceased to employ it in my subsequent
experiments.     The object of the present communication is to
give an account of the combined action of alcohol, acetate
of soda, and caustic alkali on indigo-blue, and the products
thereby formed.
                                                   I
   At the commencement of the investigation imagined that
it was an essential condition that the indigo-blue should
be in a state of solution ; but    I soon found that this was not
necessary.     The  operation    succeeds  equally well if indigo
blue freshly precipitated  or  in <U+FB01>ne  powder  be employed.    The
plan which     I adopted  was    quite simple.   Pure  indigo-blue
was introduced into a large quantity of ordinary spirits of
wine, and, after being well agitated, the mixture was raised

296               Dr. Schunck    on some Products
to the boiling-point.     A quantity of pure acetate of soda,
previously deprived   of its water of crystallization, and a little
solid caustic soda were then added, and the boiling was con
tinued for several hours. A reduction of a portion of the
indigo-blue took place in the <U+FB01>rst instance, as was e<U+FB01>dent
from the deep red colour of the liquid.         On agitating with
air, this red colour disappeared for a moment, the indigo-blue
being precipitated in powder, to be again dissolved on boil
ing the liquid; but after some time the liquid acquired a
dark-brown colour, and deposited nothing on exposure or
agitation.     The process was then completed.        There some
times remained a residue of indigo-blue, which obstinately
resisted the action of the boiling liquid; but, on pouring off
the latter, and adding fresh materials, it generally disappeared
rapidly.    I found it advisable to employ only a small quan
tity of indigo-blue at a time, as the process is a slow one
and requires a great excess of alcohol and acetate of soda.
                                  I
The presence of caustic alkali found to be quite essential, as
no perceptible action took place without it; but the quan
tity required was not large. The stronger the alcohol, and,
generally speaking, the freer from water all the substances
employed were, the more rapidly was the process completed.
   In order to obtain the products resulting from this pro
      I
cess, proceeded as follows :-—The dark-brown alcoholic liquid
containing them was <U+FB01>rst mixed with sulphuric acid until it
had acquired a slightly acid reaction, and it was then evapo
rated.     During evaporation, brown resinous masses were
deposited; and on adding water when the evaporation was
nearly completed, a fresh quantit of resin-like matter was
thrown down. The liquid <U+FB01>ltere from this matter was still
brown.     It was evaporated to a syrup, which, after standing
some time, became solid from the formation of crystals, con
sisting chie<U+FB02>y of acetate of soda. The whole mass of crystals
was then dissolved in boiling alcohol, and tolerably strong
sulphuric acid was added to the solution, until no more sul
phate of soda was precipitated, care being taken to avoid an
excess of the acid.   The liquid, after standing some time, was
<U+FB01>ltered and evaporated, so as to drive off the acetic acid as
well as the alcohol. When the evaporation was nearly com
pleted, water was added, which threw down a large quantity
of a brown pulverulent substance, as well as a little brown
resin, which, after <U+FB01>ltration, were added to the resinous
matter previously obtained. The <U+FB01>ltered liquid had lost much
of its brown colour.    I  shall return to it presently.
   The products insoluble in water obtained in this manner
consist partly of resinous, partly of pulverulent substances.

                      derived from Indigo-blue.                    297
Among these products there are at least <U+FB01>ve distinct sub
stances, which    I    have succeeded in separating from one
another b the use of various solvents; but it is probable
that smal quantities of other substances closely resembling
them are also formed at the same time.           These bodies are
all unfortunately amorphous,      and  possess very few character
istic properties. It     is indeed only their origin and mode of
formation which impart to them any interest; and               I
                                                               shall
therefore refrain from adding to the already cumbrous mass of
terms with which organic chemistry has to deal by invent
ing names for them, but shall simply distinguish them by the
letters of the alphabet.                       _
    The process adopted for the separation of these substances
from one another was as follows :—-The whole of the mass
insoluble in water was <U+FB01>rst treated with boiling water in
order to remove all the sulphate and acetate of soda.             It
was then dried, <U+FB01>nely pounded, and treated with successive
doses of ether, as long as anything dissolved.        The ethereal
liquid, which had a rich reddish-brown colour, was <U+FB01>ltered
and evaporated, when it left a resin-like residue of the same
colour.     This residue was digested with weak caustic am
monia, which dissolved a great portion of it. The portion
insoluble in ammonia was <U+FB01>ltered off, washed, dried, and
then treated with ether, which generally left a small quan
tity of brown powder undissolved.          The <U+FB01>ltered ethereal so
lution was evaporated, and the residue was dissolved in cold
 alcohol, which left behind a little resinous matter.           The
 <U+FB01>ltered liquid left on evaporation a brittle, brownish-yellow
resin, which  I   assume to be an unmixed substance, and shall
 distinguish by   the letter A. The matter dissolved by the am
 monia was precipitated by acid in thick <U+FB02>ocks, which, after
 being <U+FB01>ltered off, washed, and dried, were treated with ether.
The ether left some brown powder undissolved, which was
separated by <U+FB01>ltration.       The liquid was evaporated, and the
 residue was treated again with ether, in order to separate
 a little more of the brown powder.       The substance was then
 introduced into a hot solution of carbonate of ammonia, which,
if nottoo concentrated, dissolved the greatest part of leaving
                                                         it,
 only some brown powder behind.        If, as sometimes happened,
 the solution of carbonate of ammonia was not suf<U+FB01>ciently di
 lute, very little was dissolved by    it,the greatest part of the
 substance sinking to the bottom of the vessel as    a  viseid resi
 nous mass, which dissolved, however, almost entirely on pour
 ing of the liquid and adding pure water.          The addition of
 acid to the <U+FB01>ltered solution produced       abrown <U+FB02>occulent pre
 cipitate, which was <U+FB01>ltered off, washed with water, and treated

 298              Dr. Schunck     on some Products
 with cold alcohol. The <U+FB01>ltered alcoholic solution left, on eva
 poration, a resinous body hardly to be distinguished in ap
           from the preceding, and which       I
                                            will denote by the
 pearance
  etter B.
     The matter insoluble in ether, constituting by far the larger
  part of the whole mass, was <U+FB01>rst treated with a little cold alco
  hol, to which it communicated a dark-brown colour.              The
  <U+FB01>ltered alcoholic liquid left, on evaporation, a brown resinous
  residue, which was not further examined, since it was sure to
  contain some of that well-known product of decomposition
  which is formed by the action of caustic <U+FB01>xed alkalics on
  alcohol, and which, being also resinous,    I   saw no prospect of
 being able to separate from any product derived from indigo
 blue which might be mixed with it. The portion left undis
 solved by the cold alcohol was, after being dried, a brown
 powder, which consisted of three substances.         In order to se
 parate   these from one another,   the  mixture  was <U+FB01>rst subjected
 to the action of boiling dilute caustic soda-lye, in which one
 of the three was found to be insoluble. The alkaline liquid,
 which was of a dark-brown colour, was <U+FB01>ltered, and the residue
 left undissolved was again treated with alkali in order to
 remove the whole of the soluble portion, and it was then
treated with a boiling alcoholic solution of caustic soda, in
which the greatest part dissolved with ease.        The dark-brown
solution was <U+FB01>ltered and then mixed with an excess of hydro
chloric acid, which precipitated the greatest part of the sub
stance as a dark-brown powder.             This was collected on a
<U+FB01>lter, washed with alcohol until       all the acid and chloride of
sodium were removed, and dried. This body                I
                                                         will distin
                                                                     '
guish by the letter C. The caustic soda-lye contained the two
other substances in solution; and it was accordingly mixed
with an excess of acid, which produced an abundant brown
<U+FB02>occulent precipitate.     This was collected on a <U+FB01>lter, well
washed with water, and then treated with a boiling solution
of acetate of soda, which dissolved part of        it,thereby acqui
ring brown colour. The liquid was <U+FB01>ltered boiling hot, and
       a
the residue was treated with fresh solution of acetate of soda,
the process being repeated as long as the boiling liquid ac
quired any colour. The residue left undissolved              by
                                                            the ace
tate of soda was treated with boiling alcohol containing          a
little ammonia, in which     it   dissolved with case, forming    a
dark-brown solution, from which the greatest part was again
precipitated on the addition of an excess of hydrochloric acid
as a   brown powder.     This was <U+FB01>ltered off, well washed with
alcohol, and dried. This body may be denoted by the letter D.
The substance held in solution       by    the acetate of soda was

                          derived from Indigo-blue.                299
  precipitated by sulphuric acid in brown <U+FB02>ocks, which were
  <U+FB01>ltered off, well washed with water, and then treated with
  boiling alcohol, in which they dissolved completely. The alco
  holic solution deposited, on cooling, a brown powder, which
  was collected on a <U+FB01>lter, washed with a little cold alcohol,
  and dried. To this product I apply, for the sake of distinc
  tion, the letter E.
       The acid liquid <U+FB01>ltered from the mixture of substances
  insoluble in water still contained in solution a product of de
  composition derived from the indigo-blue.          It was evaporated
  until crystals began to appear on its surface, and it was then
  set aside and allowed to stand for some time, when a large
  quantity of crystals was gradually deposited.          After separa
  tion from the mother-liquor, these crystals appeared of a
  brown colour ; but by recrystallization from boiling water and
  deeolorization with animal charcoal, they were rendered white
   and pure.      They were then found to have the properties and
  composition of anthranilic acid, the well-known product formed
  by the action of caustic alkalies on indigo-blue.       The mother
   liquor of the crystals left, on evaporation, a thick brown syrup,
   which seemed to be a compound of anthranilic acid and acetic
   acid.    On dissolving it in water, adding sulphuric acid to the
   solution and evaporating,       I obtained a quantity of crystals,
   which were puri<U+FB01>ed by crystallization, <U+FB01>rst from water and
   then from boiling alcohol. They differed in appearance from
   anthranilic acid, and consisted indeed of a. compound of the
   latter with sulphuric acid.       The same compound is obtained
   in place of uncombined anthranilic acid, if a great excess of
,   sulphuric acid beyond what is required to unite with the free
    soda and that combined with acetic acid and the various pro
    ducts yielded by the process has been employed in the <U+FB01>rst
    instance. The sulphate, being more soluble in water than
    the free acid, does not crystallize so easily from the brown
    syrup which the liquid always leaves on evaporation ; and
    hence it is advisable not to use an excess of sulphuric acid in
    the process above described for the separation of the anthra
    nilie acid.
        As regards their properties, the products insoluble in water
    present very little that is of interest. The body A is a brittle,
     amorphous, brownish-yellow resin, transparent in thin layers.
     At a temperature of 100° C. it becomes soft and se_miliquid.
     When heated on platinum foil, it burns with a bright <U+FB02>ame,
     leaving much charcoal, which, on being heated, disappears
     without leaving any ash. It is decomposed by boiling nitric
     acid, yielding a product of decomposition in crystalline nee
     dles.   It is quite insoluble in alkaline liquids, such as caustic

300               Dr. Schunck   on some Products
potash, soda, and ammonia, even when a reducing-agent, such
as protoxide of tin, is added; but it is decomposed on being
heated with dry soda-lime, giving off alkaline fumes having a
peculiar penetrating odour. The body B can hardly be dis
tinguished by its external appearance from A, with which it
has also many properties in common ; but it is easily soluble in
caustic and carbonated alkalics, yielding yellow solutions, from
which it is precipitated by acids in brown <U+FB02>ocks. The com
pounds with baryta, lime, lead, silver, and copper prepared by
double decomposition are brown or yellow, and insoluble in
water.    When treated with boiling nitric acid it behaves like
A, yielding also a product of decomposition crystallizing in
needles.      The body C is a brown powder, which, on being
heated, burns without previously melting ; it is insoluble, like
A, in watery solutions of alkalies, and very little soluble in
alcohol alone, but easily soluble in an alcoholic solution of
soda.    D resembles C in most of its properties, but differs
from it by its solubility in caustic and carbonated alkalies.
E is a reddish-brown powder, soluble in alkalies, and more
easily soluble in alcohol than C and D, but distinguished from
the others chie<U+FB02>y by its solubility in acetate of soda.
   The composition, however, of these bodies is a matter of
some interest, since it is only from a knowledge bf their com
position that any light can be thrown on the nature of this
curious process.      I shall therefore proceed to give a short
account of the results yielded by the analysis of these products,
which will lead to a few remarks regarding their mode of for
mation and probable constitution.
                                 A.
   Of this body    I  made two series of analyses, the specimens
being prepared on different occasions.        Unfortunately the
results to which they led did not harmonize, though no differ
ence could be detected in the external properties of the two
specimens.
   I.  03275    grm. dried at 100° C., and burnt with oxide of
copper  and   oxygen, gave 0-9135 grm. carbonic acid and 02360
grm.   water.
   0'5390 grm., burnt with soda-lime, gave 0'2470 grm. chlo

   II.  03290 grm. of the same gave 0-9165 grin. carbonic acid
and 02335 grin. water.

  On the next occasion, though the method of preparation was
exactly the same as that above described, the analysis of the
substance led to di<U+FB02>'erent results, as the following details will
show :—
  I.  03810 grm. gave 1'0600 grm. carbonic acid and 02385

  0'7280 grin. gave 0'5000 grm. chloride of platinum and am

   Though this formula differs widely from the <U+FB01>rst,     presup                                   it
poses    asimilar mode of formation for the substance, the only
difference consisting in the relative quantities of the elements
uniting to produce     as will be seen from the following equa
                                           it,
tion :—
                                                  Indigo-hlue.       Alcohol.            Acetic acid.
  010   H“ Na       010+:8 H0:7-(Cin us N02)+9(06H002)+1(CL                                  H4 O4)+4coz
   It appears, therefore, that in both cases its formation was
due to the union of indigo-blue with alcohol, acetic acid, and
carbonic acid, accompanied by the loss of a. certain proportion
of water. The alcohol and acetic acid are ingredients employed

302                    Dr. Schunck       on some Products
in the process; but it is not easy to                see whence the carbonic
acid is derived.            I   think, however, it may originate in the
formation of anthranilie acid.               This acid, as is well known,
is produced by the action of caustic alkalies on indigo-blue,
which, taking up water and oxygen, yields anthranilic acid and
carbonic acid, in accordance with the following equation :—
                    Inti   o-blue.          Anthranilic acid.
                  0,, 1i,1vo.,+1110+4o=c,,H,1v0,+=co,.
   The oxygen in this case must be derived from water, the
hydrogen of which, instead of being set at liberty, probably
unites with a portion of the indigo-blue, forming reduced
indigo, which dissolves in the caustic alkali.                   Hence the par
tial reduction and solution of the indigo-blue, which, as men
tioned above, is observed at the commencement of the process.
The carbonic acid does not, as might naturally be supposed,
combine with the alkali, but unites in statu nascenti with
alcohol, acetic acid, and a portion of the indigo-blue to form
the body A. That it should do so in the presence of an
excess of alkali is not more surprising than that acetic acid
should, under the same circumstances,                     leave the base with
which it is combined in order to form a perfectly neutral body
—-a fact of which there can be no doubt.
                                         B.
   Of this body also two series of analyses were made, the
material being obtained at the same time as that of the two
series of A.        The <U+FB01>rst series yielded the following results :—
   I. 03315 grm. gave 089% grin. carbonic acid and 02465
grm. water.
   0'5270 grm. gave 0-2645 grm. chloride of platinum and
ammonium.
   II. 03330 grm. gave 0'9015 grm. carbonic acid and 02445
grm. water.

ammonium.
   III.  0'3390 grm. gave 0-9195 grm. carbonic acid and 02530
grm. water.

       In  this case the composition is to be explained by suppo
   sing   that    3 ats. of alcohol and 3 ats. of acetic acid have com
   bined with l at. of indigo-blue to form 1 at. of the substance,

       It appears,        therefore, that in the         case  of this body,       as  in that
    of A,  the composition may vary extremely, without any cor
'
    responding difference in external appearance and properties.
    The difference in composition in both cases is owing to the
    different proportion between the elements—indigo-blue, alco
    hol, acetic acid, and carbonic acid—of which they are com
    posed.       The two formulae to which the analyses of B led,
    viz. Cs, H35 NO8 and C40 H52,3 N08, differ from one another by
    a multiple of CH, and they therefore represent homologous
    bodies.

       This body is formed in relatively small uantities, and                                I

    This formula leads to the conclusion that the formation

   This body is formed in abundance during this process; and
I think it     probable that its composition is always the same,
as the  following analytical results will tend to show:—
~I. 0'35-10 grm. of the substance, dried at 100° C., and
burnt as usual, gave 0'9360 grm. carbonic acid and 01635
grin. water.
   0'5630 grm. gave 0'5540 grm. chloride of platinum and
ammonium.

grm. carbonic acid and 00985 grm. water.
   0'5700 grm. gave 054% gm. chloride of platinum and
ammonium.

respond is C56 H5M N20“), which requires the following values——

   The de<U+FB01>ciency of carbon in the second analysis may be
partly due to the extreme difficulty with which the combus
tion of the substance is effected—a dif<U+FB01>culty which is always
experienced in the case of such bodies as become charred
when heated without previously melting.
   If  the formula of C, C98 HHNO4, be doubled, it will be
found to differ from that of D merely by 2H0 less. The for
mation of both bodies is therefore to be explained in the same

 anhydride         of   D, the resemblance between the ~two substances,
in their appearance and properties, being so great that it
is only by their behaviour to caustic alkalies that they can be
distinguished.

    If this formula be correct, it follows that 2 ats. of indigo

    Since under ordinary circumstances this acid can only be
 obtained by the long-continued action of boiling concentrated
 alkaline lye on indigo-blue, its formation in this process,
 in which only small quantity of caustic soda dissolved in

 large quantity of alcohol was employed,      remarkable. There is
 can be little doubt that its formation in this case      connected           is
in some way with that of the other substances, and could not
be effected by the mere action of dilute alcoholic solution of
                                                       a
 caustic alkali on indigo-blue.

distinct chemical compounds, still        might be objected that
                                                           it
some of them were not free from an admixture of products
of decomposition derived from alcohol alone, the action of
caustic alkali on alcohol being     process not very well under
                                                   a
stood.    In order to satisfy myself on this point,         took an           I
alcoholic solution of caustic soda, boiled     for some time, and
                                                                it
then evaporated       in contact with the air.
                          it                         The solution
became brown; and on adding water and an excess of acid,
after evaporation of the alcohol,     obtained    brown <U+FB02>occulent
                                                   I                  a
precipitate, which, being <U+FB01>ltered off and washed, was dissolved
in alcohol.     The solution left, on evaporation,     dark brown             a
resinous residue, which      found to be quite insoluble in ether.
                                      I
That portion of the products obtained in this process which
was insoluble in water and ether, but easily soluble in alcohol
and alkalics, was therefore certain to contain some of this resi
nous matter; and       therefore laid the whole of
                         I                               aside, and           it
gave up all further examination of it.       It     certainly true      is
that by the action of alkali on alcohol in closed vessels totally                    a

                                derived from Indigo-blue.                              307
different product is obtained—a product which differs from
the other by its solubility in ether, and its total insolubility
in alkalies, and shows a striking resemblance to the body A,
which is also soluble in ether and insoluble in alkalics.  Still,
as my process was conducted in open vessels and not under
pressure,      I
            think it is not probable that any of this substance
 was     formed*.
   2.   From what has been stated above, it follows that all the
 products, except anthranilic acid, are formed by a very simple
 process, which consists merely in indigo-blue combining with
 alcohol and acetic acid in various proportions, and yielding
 compounds in which none of the constituents as such can be
 detected.    It therefore, not process of decomposition, but
                     is,                     a
 rather a synthetical process,      building up of complex bodies
                                           a
 from others of simpler constitution.
                     a                      This    proved by the      is
 fact of water being eliminated during the process, whereas in
 all cases in which complex organic substances are decomposed
 into simpler ones water      absorbed. This elimination of water
                                    is
proceeds so far, that some of the products, notwithstanding that
 they are formed by the addition to indigo-blue of many atoms
of alcohol and acetic acid (bodies having much less carbon and
 more oxygen), are found to contain even more carbon than
indigo-blue itself,    great proportion of the water both of the
                            a

    3. The physical properties of these compounds do not seem
to depend in any way on those of their constituents. Never
theless it is to be observed that those containing the largest
proportion of alcohol are insoluble in alkalies, whilst those in
which the indigo-blue preponderates are the least soluble in
alcohol and ether.
    4-. No law or rule can be detected determining the number of
atoms of alcohol and acetic acid which are capable of uniting
with the indigo-blue.          Were the series more extensive, it is
probable that some such law might be found to prevail.                  It
may     be  remarked,   however,        that  all the products  insoluble
in water, with one exception, contain either 8 or 10 equivalents
of oxygen (assuming the formula of C to be doubled), as will
be seen from the following tabular view of their formulae :—

     5. Regarding the rational formulae or probable internal con
stitution of these compounds          I  hardly venture to indulge in any
speculations.     They might be considered as conjugated com
pounds—compounds of which organic chemistry affords so
many examples; and it might consequently be possible to
obtain from them, by decomposition, some of the simpler bodies
which are known to have entered into their composition.                  1
have, however, been unable to discoy'er any facts in favour of
this view.      Neither indigo-blue nor any of its products of de
 composition can be obtained from them by any means which I
 have tried.                                        I
                 In one experiment which made for this pur
pose, and which consisted in subjecting the body D to the
 action of caustic soda,     I   obtained neither anthranilic acid nor
 acetic acid, as might have been expected. By evaporating the
 alkaline solution to dryness, and heating the residue to inci
   ient fusion, the substance was partly converted into a black
   nmus-like matter, insoluble not only in water and alcohol,
 but also in alkalies. The alkali was supersaturated with sul
 phuric acid, and the liquid was distilled, when a trace of what
 I  suppose to be formic acid passed over.            The liquid yielded
 no anthranilic acid.
     In this respect these compounds resemble some of the secon
 dary products which are formed during the decomposition of

                           derivedfrom [Mtge-blue.                       309
indican by acids, and from which no indigo-blue can be ob
tained, though they must be supposed to contain the elements
of that body and of various organic acids, such as formic, acetic
and propionic acids.            Indeed the resemblance between the
two series of compounds extends also to their physical pro
perties.     For instance, the body A resembles indifulvine,
one of the products derived from indican, both being brownish
yellow resins insoluble in alkalies. B is very similar to in
diretine ; and D is so like indifuscine, that the two can hardly
be distinguished from one another.                  There may, in fact, be
some analogy in the composition of the two last-named
bodies.     Indifuscine may, as I have shown on a former occa
sion, be considered as a compound of indigo-blue and pro
pionic acid minus water, as may be seen by the following
equation :—
              Indifuscinc.              Indigo-blue.    Propionic acid.
             cu H20 Nu 010+1HO=1(010 H5 N02) + “(Ca H6 04)
 In like manner D may be supposed to contain the same ele
 ments combined in a different proportion, since
                  D.                     Indigo-blue.   Propionio acid.
             Cm HM Na 010+ 1°HO=Z(Cm         H5 Noa)+4(ca    He 01)
     Analogies such         as   these, unsupported by experimental
 proof, may be only fanciful. Nevertheless they may prove
 of some use in facilitating the classi<U+FB01>cation of facts.                At all
 events, the circumstance of indigo-blue yielding, by the com
 bined action of alcohol, acetic acid, and alkalies, bodies so
 closely resembling the products obtained along with indigo
 blue in the decomposition of indican seems to afford a striking
 con<U+FB01>rmation of the view which              I   have taken regarding the
  composition of these products.
     There is another point of view from which these bodies
  may be considered.          They may be represented as substitution
  products of indigo-blue, one or more of the atoms of hydro
  gen in the latter being replaced by one or more organic radi
  cals.   For instance, the body C may be looked upon as the
  hydrate of a compound in which one atom of the hydrogen
  of indigo-blue is replaced by phener (Clg H5), since
                   021  HilNOl=C16 H4(C12H5)N02+1H0'
     In  order to obtain some con<U+FB01>rmation for this hypothesis                I
  took some of the body D, of which 1 had a considerable quan
  tity, and which only differs from C by containing more water,
  and subjected it to the action of hydriodic acid and phos
 phorus in a sealed tube.           By the action of the nascent hydro
  gen   I expected that indigo-blue might possibly be regene
  rated, but the experiment led only to a negative result; for
  though the tube was heated in the water-bath for several

  310                Dr. Schunck   on some Products
  days, the   substance, on its being opened, was found to be
  almost unchanged, a small part only having been converted
  into a resinous matter easily soluble in alcohol.         A similar
  negative result was obtained when an amalgam        of sodium   was
  employed as a source of hydrogen.                             I
                                           After these failures felt
  but little encouragement to make further experiments in this
  direction; and this part of the subject must therefore be left
  in its present state of obscurity.
     6. The occasional disappearance of the indigo-blue in the
  woad-vat,   in consequence of mismanagement, now admits
 of an explanation, which will probably be allowed to be the
 correct one. By the fermentation of the sugar contained in
 the madder and other materials employed, alcohol is gene
 rated, which in its turn may yield some acetic acid; and
 alcohol, acetic acid, and a base (lime) being present, nothing
 further is required for the development of the process above
 described.     By neutralizing a portion of the lime when neces
 sary,  the  danger   of losing colouring-matter is to some extent
                   I
 obviated; but would venture to suggest, as a means of ren
 dering it still less, the avoiding all materials containing much
 sugar or starch—substances which might, by their decompo
 sition, lead to the formation of alcohol.
    When, in the process above described, formiate of soda is
 employed instead of acetate of soda, exactly the same phone
 mena are observed.        The indigo-blue gradually disappears,
 and a dark brown alcoholic liquid is obtained, which is found
to contain bodies closely resembling those formed by means
 of acetate of soda. By operating on a tolerably large quantity
                I
 of material, was enabled to ascertain the presence in this
liquid of anthranilic acid, and of three products correspond
ing to, and having the same physical properties as, the bodies
B, D, and E. They were separated from one another by the
 same means as the latter,—the <U+FB01>rst being a brownish-yellow
resin, easily soluble in alcohol and ether, as well as in alka
lies; the second a brown powder, soluble in alkalies, but solu
ble with dif<U+FB01>culty in alcohol and ether ; whilst the third
was a reddish-brown powder, distinguished by its solubility
in a boiling solution of acetate of soda—a property which
afforded a ready means of separating it from the others.         No
compounds insoluble in alkalies, and corresponding to the
bodies A and C, were formed with formiate of soda.         The ana
lysis of the compound resembling B yielded the following
results :—
    0'2960 grin. gave 0‘7565 grm. carbonic acid and 0'1920
grm. water.

    The substance, it will be seen, is formed by the union of 6
 ats. of alcohol, 4 ats. of formic acid, and 1 at. of indigo-blue,
accompanied by the separation of 20 ats. of water, since

    Thc composition of the substance                        corresponding to E was
 also determined, the results being as follows :—
    0'1960 grm. gave 0-4500 grin. carbonic acid and 00820 grm.

    0'3635 grm. gave 0-3250 grm. chloride of platinum and

    These numbers correspond with the formula C96 H“ NOa ;
but the only formula which can lead to an explanation of the
manner in which the substance is formed, though it gives a
calculated composition not agreeing quite so well with the
experiment, is C96 HIa NOB, which requires
                                            Calculation.                Experiment.

    Assuming this to be the correct formula, its formation
would take place in accordance with the following equation :—
                                             Indigmblue.       Alcohol.        Formic acid.
      2(020  His Nos)+l°H0             =2(Gll3 H5 N02)+3(CA Ha Oa)+4(02 Hz 04)
    It will be seen that the same law regarding the number of
atoms of oxygen prevails here as in the ease of the bodies before
described, this number being either 8 or 10.
    If in this process ordinary alcohol is replaced by methylic
alcohol, the same effect is produced, provided acetate of soda
is employed ; but a mixture of methylic alcohol, formiate
of soda, and caustic soda does not act in the same manner on
indigo-blue, which remains unchanged, however long it may
be left in contact with the boiling liquid.                           It appears, there
fore,that one of the two agents, ethylie alcohol or acetic acid,
is quite essential.              One of the two may be replaced by an
homologous body              ;  but     when both are so replaced, the indigo
blue remains         intact.

     ment hitherto adopted has been to give integral numbers from 1
to n, and the corresponding reciprocals as decimals. In the present
Table both the numbers and their reciprocals are given without de
cimal points, which are to be supplied according to circumstances.
Advantage is thus taken of the fact that the signi<U+FB01>cant digits of
the reciprocals of, for example, 3'7256, 37'25 6, 372'56, &c. are
2684131; the reciprocals being respectively 02684131, 0026841311,
0002684131, &e.     In other words, Colonel Oakes has arranged his
Table with a view to the fact that if r is the reciprocal of n, then
will    rx
         10" be the reciprocal of n-I—IO".    In consequence he has
been able to render the arrangement     of the Table almost identical
with that of an ordinary Table of Logarithms.     In fact the only ex
ception is that the differences reckoned in order of the numbers are
all negative; as they must obviously be, since, the numbers increa
sing, their reciprocals will decrease.
   Pre<U+FB01>xed to the Table are two notices, one describing the arrange
ment of the Table and exemplifying its uses, the other giving a short
account of the manner in which the reciprocals of the larger numbers
were calculated.    A word or two may he said on the latter point.

     The chief merit of a work of this kind is, of course, accuracy.                           To
 secure this, every precaution seems to have been taken.                                “To pre
 vent error," says Colonel Oakes,
                                                  “ the co.
                                                                   logarithms were checked
 independently at each 50th term. In taking out the numbers, the pro
 gression of their differences was kept in view, so that no material
 error could occur.            The summation of the differences was checked
 at every 10th term by a subordinate summation, and by comparison
 with Barlow's Tables; and wherever the seventh <U+FB01>gure could be un
 certain, it was determined by actual division.                          Finally, every hun
 dredth term was computed by division.                           The whole of the calcula
 tions were performed in duplicate, and when the proofs were set up
 from one manuscript they were read with the other; and second
 and third proofs were also each examined by addition of the printed
 differences, and by comparison with Barlow’s Table at each 10thv
 term.       Lastly, the proofs we re again examined, and the whole Table
 virtually recomputed by summation on the Arithmometre of M.

      It is proper to' add that the work was undertaken at the suggestion
 of Professor De Morgan, who says that it is, as far as he knows,
 " the largest which has ever been                                                  “ it is a very

 useful Table, and that its applications are far too little known and
  thought of.”

 THE“ On      the Heating      of a Disk by rapid Rotation in vacuo.” By
 Balfour Stewart, M.A., F.R.S., and P. G. Tait, M.A.
    l. The authors were led, by certain views which they entertain re
garding the loss of energy by a body, to make experiments in order
to test these views, and about the end of 1863 they obtained results
in air, which encouraged them to have constructed an apparatus where
with to procure rotation in vacuo.
   2. The apparatus for this purpose was devised and executed by
Mr. Beckley, mechanician at the Kew Observatory, at which place
the experiments about to be described were made. In this apparatus
a slowly revolving shaft is carried up through a barometer                     tube,
having at its top the receiver which it is wished to exhaust.                 When
the exhaustion has taken place, it is evident that this shaft will re
volve in mercury.       In the receiver the shaft is connected with a train
of toothed wheels, and ultimately causes a circular disk to revolve 125
times for each revolution of the shaft.           The disks used have :1 dia
meter of 13 inches, and their plane is vertical.          Two insulated wires,
connected with a Thomson’s re<U+FB02>ecting galvanometer,                      are carried
through    two   holes   in  the   bed-plate   of the  receiver,    and    are then
connected with a thermo-electric pile, having the usual re<U+FB02>ecting
cone attached to it.      The outside of the pile, and of its attached cone,
is wrapped round with wadding and cloth, so as to be entirely out of
the reach of currents of air.         The vacuum-gauge is on the siphon
principle; it was constructed by P. Adie, and there is every reason to
believe that it is perfectly deprived of air.        The following <U+FB01>gure will

render the arrangements      clear: and it is only necessary to add that
the whole is covered overIwith an air~tight glass shade, 15 inches in
diameter and 16 inches high.
   3. The de<U+FB02>ection of the galvnnometer-ncedle,       produced by heat
ing the pile, is recorded by means of a small mirror attached to the
needle, which, as it moves, causes the re<U+FB02>ected image of a line of
light to travel over a graduated scale.       The galvanometer-needle is
rendered very nearly astatic by means of an auxiliary magnet; and
this arrangement can be made so sensitive that if the temperature
of the disk, exposed to the cone as in the <U+FB01>gure, were to rise 1° Fahr.,
this would be denoted by a change in the position of the line of light
equal to <U+FB01>fty divisions of the scale.
   4. In these experiments the disk was rotated rapidly for half a.
minute, and a heating effect was, in consequence of this rotation,
recorded by the pile.     The object of this paper is to investigate the
origin  of this heating effect.
   5. In this investigation     the authors prefer discussing the effect
produced on a metallic disk.         The metal aluminium was chosen,
from its lightness, so as to diminish the weight upon the bearings as
much as possible.     The reason for preferring a metallic disk is that
the heat produced in this case affects the whole substance of the
disk, and can thus be approximately measured.           The disk of this
metal employed was rzl'gth of an inch thick and 13 inches in diameter;
it weighed ten ounces, and in most of the experiments it was covered
with a coating of lampblack, applied by means of negative photo
graphic varnish. In some of the experiments a plate of rock-salt, tightly
secured in a brass <U+FB01>tting, was screwed upon the mouth of the cone.
When this was done, a small piece of anhydrous baryta was placed
within the cone to keep the inner surface of the salt dry, and a dish
containing strong sulphuric acid was likewise placed in the receiver.
Indeed the latter was always used; so that in the results obtained
the residual air may be considered as nearly dry, and the surface of
the disk, as well as that of the rock-salt, when this was used, nearly
free from moisture.
   Furthermore, in order to obviate the objection that the electric
currents which take place in a revolving metallic disk might alter
the zero of the galvanometer,       the position of the line of light was
read before the motion began, and immediately after it ceased, the
difference being taken to denote the heating effect produced by the
rotation.    The turning was made in this way :-—As soon as full speed
was obtained, which might be about 10 seconds after beginning the
motion, a chronometer was noted, and the handle was turned at a
uniform rate for 30 seconds, and thereafter stopped as soon as pos
sible.   The most convenient speed in vacuo was found to be 20 revo
lutions of the handle, or 2500 of the disk, in 30 seconds. It is believed
that the heating effect recorded may be considered as due to about
40 seconds at full speed.
   6. The thermometric value of the indication given by the galva
nometerwasfound in this way :—The disk was removed from its attach
ment and laid upon a mercury-bath of known temperature.            It was

 316        Royal Society :—Messrs. Stewart and Tait             on the
 then attached to its spindle again, being in this position exposed to
 the pile, and having a temperature higher than that of the pile by
 a known amount.         The de<U+FB02>ection produced by this exposure being
 divided by the number of degrees by which the disk was hotter than
 the pile, we have at once the value in terms of the galvnnometric scale
 of a heating of the disk equal to 1° Fahr.

     8. A piece of wood precisely similar to the rock-salt plateZwas next
inserted into the <U+FB01>tting of the latter, and after rotation there was no
indication whatever.       Hence the above e<U+FB01>'ect (art. 7) is due to radiant
heat, and not to currents of heated air reaching the pile.            Again re
taining the rock-salt, the interior of the cone was covered by black
paper, and the effect upon the pile was very much diminished: this
also goes to prove that thee<U+FB01>'ect (art. 7) is due to radiant heat; and
it now remains to discover whether this radiant heat comes from the
rock-salt or from heated air, or from the surface of the disk.
     9. The following sets of experiments were made with blackened
aluminium disk, but without rock-salt.

  VI.             3              30          20          0'93           0'60
And      when a black paper cover was introduced into the cone, other
things remaining as before, the indications of the galvanometer were
greatly diminished. The effect produced without rock-salt is there
fore also a radiant heat effect ; and as the indications (in terms of tem
perature) are as large as when rock-salt was used, we may conclude
that the effect of art. 7 was to no perceptible extent due to heating
of the rock-salt, otherwise it would have been diminished when the
plate of rock-salt was taken away.         Besides, as rock-salt is a bad ra
diator and a good absorber of its own heat, the plate would have had
to be heated perhaps as much as 15° or 20°, in order to furnish a
radiation equal to 0°‘8 from the disk. On both these accounts it is
impossible to believe that the effect was due to heating of the rock
salt.
    10. Nor is it probable that the heating effect is due to radiation
from heated air, since in order that nearly dry air of such a tenuity
might give such a radiation, it would require to be heated enor
mously. But another proof that the effect is not due to air is afforded

                 Heating  of a  Disk  by Rotation    in vacuo.         317
by removing the black from the aluminium disk and leaving it a rough
metallic surface, when the indication afforded by the galvanometer is
reduced to about one-fourth of the amount with the blackened disk.
    1 I. It only remains that the heating effect proceeds from the disk,
and since the heat-indication afforded by the galvanometer-needle
remains nearly constant for some time, this effect must be due to the
heating of the whole substance of the disk.
    12. Presuming, therefore, that the entire substance of the disk is
heated, the next point is to ascertain the cause of this heating effect.
    Now, in the <U+FB01>rst place, it cannot be due to conduction of heat from
the bearings, for in some of the experiments the disk was insulated
from its bearings by means of a plate of ebonite, and the result was
the same.
    Again, it is not due to revolution under the earth’s magnetic force,
for Professor Maxwell has kindly calculated the effect due to this
cause under the conditions of the experiment, and he finds it in<U+FB01>ni
tesimally small. Nor is the effect due to the condensation of vapour
of water upon the surface of the disk. In some of the experiments,
when the vacuum was newly made, there appeared to be a strictly
temporary effect, due probably to moisture, which increased the range
of the needle, but only during the time when the motion was taking
place, for it very soon assumed it permanent position. In other expe
riments, when the air was very dry, there appeared to be a temporary
cold effect of a similar description; but in all cases when the vacuum
 was kept long enough for the sulphuric acid to act, the only effect
was a. permanent one in the direction of' heat, and this is that which
has been described in these experiments.            This permanent heating
effect cannot, therefore, be due to the condensation of aqueous vapour,
 and indeed it is impossible to suppose that in the presence of sulphu
 ric acid so much vapour should remain suspended in air of so low a
 tension as to produce a permanent effect so very considerable by
 its deposition.
     13. In this endeavour to account for the heating effect observed, it
 would appear that we are reduced to choose between one of two
 causes, or to a mixture of the two.
        (I) It may be due to the air which cannot be entirely got rid of.
        (2) It is possible that visible motion becomes dissipated by an
    ethereal medium in the same manner, and possibly to nearly the
    same extent, as molecular motion, or that motion which consti
     tutes heat.
        (3) Or the effect may be due partly to air and partly to ether.
     14. Now, if it be an air effect, it is not one which depends upon the
 mass of air.     For (art. 7) the effect for a vacuum of 03 in. is as large
  as for one of 0'65 in.; and also (art. 9) the effect for s vacuum of
  0'37 in. is as large as for one of 0'60 in.; and further, in some ap
  proximate experiments, the effect produced upon a wooden disk, in a
  vacuum of 4'0 in. and 2'0 in., was found to be the same as in one of
  0'5 in., or very nearly so.    It may therefore be presumed that only a
  very inconsiderable portion of the effect observed depends upon the
 mass of air left behind.       It would, however, appear, from the views

   318             Intelliyence and Miscellaneous     Arlicles.
   of Professor Maxwell and Mr. Graham, that there is another effect
   of air, namely, <U+FB02>uid friction, the coctlicient for which they believe
   to be independent of the tension; and as far, therefore, as this effect
   is concerned, little is gained by diminishing the amount of the
   residual air. It would appear, however, that the <U+FB02>uid friction of
  hydrogen is much less than that of atmospheric air; so that, were
   the heating effect due to <U+FB02>uid friction, it ought to be less in a
   hydrogen vacuum.         An experiment was made with this purpose;
   and, other circumstances being precisely similar, it was found that
  in a hydrogen vacuum the heating effect due to rotation was 22'5,
  while in an air vacuum it was 23'5. These numbers may probably
  be considered      as sensibly    the same, and this experiment would
  therefore appear to denote that the effect is not due to <U+FB02>uid friction.
      15. The authors, in submitting these remarks to the Royal Society,
  do not suppose that their experiments have yet conclusively decided
  the origin of this heating effect, but they hope by this means to
  elicit the opinions of those interested in the subject, which may
  serve to direct their future research.

       URE metallic indium        has the colour and lustre of cadmium; it
        is very soft. and marks paper easily, giving a bright streak with
  only a slight shade of grey.
     The pesitions of the two characteristic lines of the indium spec
  trum were determined by direct comparison with the solar spectrum.
  The spectrum of the metal was obtained in the usual manner by
  means of a Ruhmkortf's induction-coil used in connexion with a
  Leyden jar. The comparison showed that the magni<U+FB01>cent blue in
  dium-line does not coincide with any of the dark lines of the solar
 spectrum, and hence, according to Kirchhotf’s acute deduction, that
 no indium exists in the sun’s atmosphere.            This blue line corre
 sponds    exactly  with   the  number  2523  upon Kirchhoft"s  scale. The
 second indium-line lies in the violet, between G and H, a part of the
 spectrum which was only partially measured by Kirchhoff : it coin
 cides with a strong Fraunhofer's line, which is very sharply de<U+FB01>ned
 on Rutlierfurd’s photograph of the solar spectrum. In order to de
 termine the position of this line with greater precision, the three 60°
prisms of the apparatus were <U+FB01>rst placed in the position of minimum
 deviation for the line G (2854'8), and then the distances of the three
known lines, 2721, 2670, and 2574, were measured by means of
the micrometer-screw.            In this way the value of a revolution of
the micrometer-screw was obtained in millimetres.            On now mea
suring in the same way the distances from G to the violet indium
line, and to the lines H and H', keeping the prisms always in the
position of least deviation, it was found that upon Kirchhoif’s scale

                    Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.           319
   the number 3265'8 nearly corresponded to the violet indium-line, the
   number 3582 to the line H, and the number 3677 to the line H'. A
   measurement of the positions of these lines on Rutherfurd’s photo
   graph of the solar spectrum gave nearly the same relative distances.
       In addition to the lines above mentioned, several other lines were
   visible in the indium spectrum; but these belonged in part to the
   gases of the atmosphere, and in part to the iron and zinc of which
   the indium employed appears still to have contained traces,—a point
   upon which light will be thrown by future experiments.
     Although the most recent determination of the equivalent of indium
   by C. \Vinkler is probably tolerably near the truth, it did not seem
   super<U+FB02>uous to ascertain its value by some other method.      I selected
   for this purpose the sulphide of indium, which I have found possesses
   the very valuable property, for the object in view, of being com_
   pletely converted by hydrochloric acid at the common temperature
   into chloride of indium, with separation of sulphuretted hydrogen.
   Chloride of indium, although extremely hygroscopic, can be accu
   rately weighed if certain precautions are observed; and, in addition,
   the proportion of sulphur can be accurately determined as a control
  by leading the sulphuretted hydrogen that escapes into a solution of
   a ferric salt, and determining volumetrically the quantity of ferrous
   salt that is thereby produced. Contrary to what has been stated
   hitherto, sulphide of indium is completely precipitated by sulphu
  retted hydrogen from any sufficiently dilute and not too acid solu
4
   tion. In colour, it cannot be distinguished from sulphide of cadmium ;
  in fact indium in all respects exhibits the greatest similarity to cad
  mium, in relation to which its electrical behaviour requires it to be
  classed as electro-negative.      The results of the numerical determi
  nations have not yet assumed a <U+FB01>nal shape; they will be contained

  regard to time, and its useful effect for exciting sensation was mea
  sured.     Both the intervals during which the light acted and during
  which it was absent were varied in their absolute as well as relative
  lengths; and the results of the experiments permit of conclusions
  being drawn as to the manner in which the vibrations of the retina
  are excited and die out.

 INVERSION OF THE ABSORPTION-BANDS IN THE SPECTRUM OF
           ERBIUM.  BY PROF. BARR OF UPSALA.
 I    have succeeded in   a very simple manner in inverting the absorp
tion-spectrum of erbia (and of terbia P), and in changing the ab
sorption-bands into bright lines, which, as regards brilliancy and
distinctness. are scarcely inferior to the lines of   gas-spectrum.

XLIII.    On some Physical E<U+FB02>‘ects produced by the contact of a
   Hydrogen-<U+FB02>ame with various Bodies.       By W. F. Barum'r'r,
   Assistant in the Physical Laboratory of the Royal Institution *.
      the         of this year, when conducting a series of experi
INments spring
        for Professor     Tyndall, on the character of the radiation
emitted by various solids heated by means of a hydrogen-<U+FB02>ame, I
noticed that on the surface of several of the substances examined
a deep blue colour arose as soon as the <U+FB02>ame was brought into
contact with the body.      Other engagements prevented a further
investigation of the matter until some time afterwards, when,
again observing the same phenomenon, I drew Professor Tyn
dall’s attention to         it,
                         and he advised my pursuing the subject.
For this purpose he kindly placed suf<U+FB01>cient time at my disposal,
for which, and other marks of kindness,       may here perhaps be
                                                   I
allowed to express my sincerest thanks.
   A careful examination of this blue coloration showed that             it
occurred only when the <U+FB02>ame came into actual contact with the
substance, the colour being restricted with great precision to the
place where the hydrogen was in combustion; accordingly                  it
gave in section  a faithful image of the construction of the <U+FB02>ame.
This singular appearance was invariably of          rich blue tint;

short, for  itdisappeared after   few seconds’ exposure when the

ately restored   byshifting the position of the jet to an untried
portion.    The hydrogen in some experiments burnt from                  a
small ori<U+FB01>ce in  a brass tube, and in others from      platinum jet
                                                               a         ;

  322     Mr. W. F. Barrett    on some Physical E<U+FB02>ects produced
  the gas was made in the usual way, and was washed before pass
  ing into the reservoir which held it. The blueness was not due
  to any foreign element in the gas ; for when chemically pure hy
  drogen was used, the colour appeared as bright as with the
  impure gas.
     I now examined a number of bodies taken at random from
  various places in the laboratory, and found the blueness was to
  be seen on most of them; it appeared with extreme brightness
  on some pieces of granite and glass tubing; but Was not at all
  con<U+FB01>ned to non-metallic bodies, as the majority of the metals
 presented the same appearance.         Still there were several sub
 stances which showed no blueness whatever, even when subjected
 to the most careful and repeated examinations; and there were
 others on which the blueness was only faintly and momentarily
 seen.    This latter occurred with many objects taken from the
 cases of the mineralogical collection in the museum of the Insti
 tution. Aclassi<U+FB01>eation of the substances experimented upon,
 according to the effects they gave, yielded no information as to
 the cause to which the phenomenon might be ascribed.            The
 results obtained were in many cases so utterly anomalous, and
 the blueness appeared so capriciously, it at once became evident
that only by varying the experiments in every way could I hope
to discover the origin of the colour.         Nevertheless, from the
nature of the appearance,    I  imagined it might probably have to
 be attributed to a new kind of <U+FB02>uorescence, differing from that
 investigated by Professor Stokes in requiring contact of the
source of rays, and in its disappearance after a short exposure to
 the <U+FB02>ame—therefore in some respects resembling phosphores
cence, yet quite distinct from it in the sharpness of its outline,
the rapidity of its appearance, and its non-persistence when the
source was removed even to the smallest distance.
    The examination of the various bodies demonstrated one fact
of some importance—namely, that in every case where the blue
ness appeared it was always of the same colour and shape, the
area over which it extended being, as already mentioned, strictly
determined by the size of the hydrogen-<U+FB02>ame.             Heating the
solid to redness, by any means, suf<U+FB01>ced to destroy its power of
showing the colour: for example, a piece of granite was taken
which gave the blueness in every part; one spot on it was then
exposed to the oxyhydrogen-<U+FB02>ame:         the granite when cold Was
again examined, when the blue appeared distinctly on every part
except that portion which had been heated; here the blueness
was suddenly extinguished.        This spot, which by heating had
been deprived of its power to give the blue colour, and which it
is evident did not recover the property on cooling, had its power
restored after a few days’ exposure in the laboratory, the blue

    by the contact   of a Hydrogen-<U+FB02>ame with various Bodies.        323
 ness then being seen with a brilliancy which seemed to vary
 according to the length of time it had been exposed. Moreover,
 if a piece of granite, brick, &c., which showed the blueness
 vividly, was broken in two, the colour was invariably absent on
 the newly-fractured surfaces.
                                   I
    Upon trying a block of ice, found the blue coloration was
 produced here also, as soon as the hydrogen-<U+FB02>ame touched its
 surface; but it was not so certain in its appearance as on other
 bOdies: it was best seen around the bottom of the block, or be
 tween two pieces of ice placed nearly in contact.         Some liquids
 as well as solids showed the blue colour when the hydrogen
 <U+FB01>ame was brought down upon them.           Occasionally it was to be
 seen on the surface of water; but invariably        it appeared with
 great brilliancy on sulphuric acid.     With regard to the latter,
 a mere trace of the liquid could be detected by the sudden ap
 pearance of the blue: what, however, was most remarkable, and
 seemed extremely suggestive, was that the blueness did not dis
 appear even after a prolonged exposure of the acid to the <U+FB02>ame,
 the colour remaining undimmcd throughout.             As soon as the
 flame was brought to bear upon the surface of the acid, contact
 with the liquid was immediately announced by a "vivid blue
 light, of a splendour only comparable to the blue line observed
 by Professor Tyndall in the spectrum of highly heated lithium
 vapour.    The blueness here, as elsewhere, shone from the body
 itself, and  did not in any way tinge the <U+FB02>ame with its colour.
 It appeared like a sudden luminosity emitted from the surface
 of the liquid wherever the actual <U+FB02>ame came in contact with it.
    The next inquiry which suggests itself    is,
                                               whether the blueness
 was peculiar to the contact of   a hydrogen-<U+FB02>ame, or could       it  be.
excited by other sources?       To answer this,       tried   luminous
                                                           a a

jet of coal-gas, the non-luminous <U+FB02>ame issuing from           Bunsen’s
 burner, and flames of alcohol, bisulphidc       of   carbon, carbonic
oxide, ole<U+FB01>ant and marsh-gas—each flame being reduced to about
the size of the jet of hydrogen employed.       No trace of the blue
luminosity was seen with any of these <U+FB02>ames.              Bodies which
showed the colour strongly with burning hydrogen, when trans
ferred to any of the foregoing flames were perfectly inert.        Was
the blueness, then, to be attributed to the high temperature of
the hydrogen-<U+FB02>ame,      to its richness in chemical rays, or to its
possession of some other property?      I   endeavoured to solve the
<U+FB01>rst part of this question   by urging the different <U+FB02>ames with the
 blowpipe, and also   by  holding piece of granite, which showed
                                  a
the blueness vividly with hydrogen, in the still hotter oxyhy
drogen-<U+FB02>ame   ;   but in no case was the blue colour produced.      I
Obtained, however,   a  very slight coloration      by
                                                    using oxygen and
coal~gas, allowing the latter to be rather in excess.       Finally, on
                                  Y2

 324,        Mr. W. F. Barrett      on some  Physical E<U+FB02>'ects produced
 account of the extreme richness of this source in rays of high
                      I
 refrangibility, made use of the secondary spark from apowerful
 Ruhmkor<U+FB01>’s coil. But even here no blueness was evident along
 the line of the spark.           Moreover the passage of the discharge
 over a piece of granite was unable to bestow or restore its power
  of showing the blue radiance when the solid was afterwards
  exposed to the hydrogen-<U+FB02>ame *.
       An accidental experiment revealed the source of this curious
  appearance.          Amongst the various substances I examined, I
  found that       vulcanized   india-rubber, when exposed to the <U+FB02>ame,
  exhibited the blue colour with great brilliancy.              But here had I
  reason to believe the blue colour was occasioned by the com
  bustion of the sulphur with which the india-rubbcr is asso
  ciated. To see if such were the case, a plate of platinum had its
  surface rubbed with a stick of sulphur, and was then exposed
  to the <U+FB02>ame.           Although no bluencss was visible before, yet
  after the rubbing the coloration shone out brightly for a short
  time, having in every respect the same appearance as the
  luminosity seen on granite, &c. Afterwards I found that the
  slightest contact of sulphur, or a body containing it in the free
  state, was suf<U+FB01>cient to impart to any substance the power of
  showing the blue coloration beneath the hydrogen~<U+FB02>amc. When
  a plate of platinum which showed the blue colour from being
  wiped over with a piece of vulcanized rubber, was examined
  with a high power under the microscope, some spots were seen
  which were unaffected by a drop of water, but which readily
  dissolved in bisulphide of carbon. These and other experiments
  convinced me that, at any rate, the chief part of the phenome
.non must be attributed to the presence and combustion of
  minute quantities of sulphur.              It may be urged that if the
  blueness be simply due to the combustion of sulphur, the dif
  ferent <U+FB02>ames tried ought, equally well with the hydrogen, to
  show the luminosity. But such is not the case, and as yet                        I
  have no experimental grounds for explaining why this difference
  in action should exist. It cannot be wholly due to the high
      * On granite and some other bodies, the spark, when caused to pass
  through the substance, rami<U+FB01>ed for a short distance, more especially from
  one pole, into beautifully sinuous lines of light, the current s litting itself up
  as it struck the block, in order to pass through the paths of east resistance.
  This occurred when the secondary terminals, separated beyond the striking
  distance, were caused almost to touch the surface of the granite.           When
  the terminals were approximated to each other until the spark crossed the
  interval, grazing over the surface of the granite, it was found that the stri
  king-distance was considerably greater than in air alone.          This may be
  accounted for by the fact that the discharge dc<U+FB02>ngrated a portion of the
            in its passage, rendering the spark not only longer, but far more
  granite
    rilliant than when the granite was absent.

 temperature of the hydrogen-<U+FB02>ame, but may probably have
 some connexion with the chemical nature of the gas.
    But how came the sulphur on the surface of those bodies
 which had not been purposely placed in contact with that ele
 ment? It was extremely unlikely that some sulphurous sub
 stance had accidentally touched all the different solids on which
 the blueness was distinctly seen.       Could the sulphur proceed
from the atmospheric dust deposited on the surface of these
solids? This explanation was established by the following ex
periment.     An old block of granite was taken and examined
by the hydrogen-<U+FB02>ame; it showed the blue coloration vividly
on every part of its surface.         The block was now split in
halves and again searched by the <U+FB02>ame: on the newly fractured
surfaces not the faintest trace of colour was seen even in a
darkened room.        The two fragments were now placed on an
upper shelf in a store-room adjoining the laboratory, in which
no <U+FB01>re was ever made.          Over one of the pieces a glass vessel
was inverted, dust being thus excluded from      it, whilst the other
fragment was left uncovered; both had their fractured surfaces
turned uppermost.        After three days they were again tried
with the hydrogen-<U+FB02>ame.         The upper side of the portion which
had been under the glass showed, as before, no blueness
whereas the other exposed fragment was now found to give           a ;
well-marked blue colour on its upper and previously inert sur
face.  A    piece of white paper had been placed       by the side of
the granite, and from this    it   was seen that dust had settled on
the exposed fragment. Two plates of chemically clean platinum
similarly exposed gave corresponding results; the same was true
of marble and other substances; and similar effects were ob
tained when the bodies were exposed in other places away from
the laboratory, in private dwellings, or in the open air. An
instructive result was given   by   the examination of <U+FB02>ask which,
                                                       a
having remained      in the   laboratory undisturbed for some time,
had become thickly coated with dust on its upturned parts. After
trying the under surface of the <U+FB02>ask, which showed no blueness
whatever, the hydrogen-<U+FB02>ame was caused to pass slowly up the
surface of the <U+FB02>ask.      As the upper portions were approached,    a
slight  coloration  made  its appearance; and when the <U+FB02>ame came
into contact with the   dust   on the upturned surface, an extremely
bright but momentary blueness was seen on the spot examined.
The duration of the colour could easily be prolonged        by moving
the <U+FB02>ame to other dusty portions of the <U+FB02>ask.
    These experiments, as far as they go, show,        I believe, that
among    the  other foreign ingredients   of our atmosphere, sulphur,
either free or in state of combination, must be regarded as occu
                 a
pying not very unimportant place—derived,
           a                                     it may be, from our

326        Mr. W. F. Barrett       on some   Physical Efects produced
coal <U+FB01>res.        From investigations that have recently been made
in France, it has been stated that traces of sulphate of soda are
often present in the air: it may be objected that under the in
tense heat of the hydrogen-flame, it is this body which has been
decomposed and burnt, and thus the sulphur of the compound
mistaken for the free element.            This conclusion is incorrect; for
sulphate of soda does not apparently decompose in this way, no
blue coloration having ever been produced by contact of a hydro
gen-<U+FB02>ame with this salt.           On the other hand, the various speci
 mens of      alum   which   were  tried, both on old and new surfaces,
 showed a vivid blue <U+FB01>gure of the <U+FB02>ame.                  On the sulphides
 generally, and on some of the sulphates, the blue was well seen,
 owing to their decomposition by the burning hydrogen.               The sin
 gular persistence of the blue appearance on sulphuric acid points
 to the probability that the liquid was instantaneously decomposed
 by the contact of the <U+FB02>ame*.
     The explanation of the capricious appearance of the blue colo
 ration seen on the surface of many bodies is now easy.                Those
 which showed the luminosity had either been long exposed to
 the air, or had in some way come into contact with sulphur.
 The latter will account for the blueness seen on the surface of a
 block of ice. In order to convey the gas from its reservoir to
 the jet from which it was burnt, a piece of vulcanized india
 rubber tubing had been used, in handling which the <U+FB01>ngers had
 become coated with a <U+FB01>lm of sulphur.               This was readily proved
 to be the case by exposing the <U+FB01>ngers to the burning hydrogen;
 on the fore <U+FB01>nger and thumb the blue section of the <U+FB02>ame was
 seen to perfection, which was not the case after the hands had
 been thoroughly washed. Having grasped the ice with unwashed
 hands, the sulphur on the <U+FB01>ngers had been partially transferred
 to its surface.        By the liquefaction of the ice the particles of
  sulphur were carried down to the base of the block; hence, as
  already noticed, the blucness was always seen brightest around
  the lower part of the ice.        But the <U+FB01>ngers had not thus come into
  contact with the water on which the blueness occasionally <U+FB02>ashed
 out.      Here the coloration was found to be due to particles of
  sulphur carried over, by the current of hydrogen, from the inte
  rior of the tube, on to the surface of the water: there they Were
  burnt; and when observed through a lens, their presence could
  be veri<U+FB01>ed by the discontinuity of the blue colour.               If absent
  before, a slight shake of the tubing was generally su<U+FB02>icient to

      1' This is in harmony uith    a fact observed by Professor Tyndall in his
   researches   on radiant heat : the passage of a gas through a new piece of

     by the contact of a Hydrogen<U+FB02>ame         with various Bodies.       827
In subsequent experiments care was taken to avoid the use of
any vulcanized indie-rubber tubing.           This destroyed the blue
seen on water and'ice, but did not affect the other results
which have been enumerated.
   The sudden appearance of a blue colour when a hydrogen
<U+FB02>ame is brought into contact with a body, thus becomes a test
for the presence of sulphur, and as such it is one of great deli
cacy.    For example, after the <U+FB01>ngers had touched a piece of vul
canized indie-rubber, the passage of them through a small quan
tity of water caused the blueuess to be seen on its surface. \Vhat
weight of matter was here employed in the production of a dis
                I
tinct colour will not venture to suggest.              The best mode of
observing the blue coloration on water, and indeed elsewhere, is
to bring the <U+FB02>ame vertically down on to the surface of the
body examined: when a certain part of the <U+FB02>ame reaches the
body, if sulphur be present, a blue ring of light is seen.
   I  have to thank my friend Mr. Broughton for enabling me
to compare the delicacy of this physical test with the best che
mical tests for sulphur.       To accomplish this, milk of sulphur
was mixed with precipitated silica in varying proportions until a
point was reached at which the chemical reagent (nitroprusside
of sodium) failed to indicate the presence of sulphur. With
the hydrogen-<U+FB02>ame, the silica alone gave no blue colour, but it
immediately appeared on the admixture of sulphur, and could
easily be recognized, not only in part of the very mixture where
the chemical test failed, but far beyond this degree. It is almost
needless to state that whatever was employed to support the
powder was carefully examined by the <U+FB02>ame just before the
experiment was made.          A mixture of silica and sulphur was
made containing the iseéath of a grain of the latter.               Of this,
the minutest quantity that could be removed, less than “ii-bath
of a grain, was placed on a piece of platinum or thrown on the
surface of water; in either case, when contact with the hydrogen.
<U+FB02>ame was made, the blue colour shone for a moment.                   By the
chemical test, the sulphur in a less minute quantity of the pdwder
remained undetected.       If it could be uniformly mingled, have     I
reason to believe that certainly the 100,000th part of a grain
of sulphur could readily be detected by means of the hydrogen
<U+FB02>ame.     The presence of sulphur in the hommopathic powders
which are said to contain a trace of that substance was easily
veri<U+FB01>ed by moistening the powder (so as to prevent the com—
bustion of the sugar of milk) before it was examined by the hy
drogen-<U+FB02>ame : as the water evaporated, the blue was seen for an
vulcanized iudia-rubber tubing was sufficient to raise its absorption several
degrees, solely from the impalpable dust removed from the tubing.

 instant.     But, from the brightness of the colour in the two
cases,    it would appear that the homceopathic doses of sulphur
 are  exceeded by the quantity we daily inhale with the atmo
 spheric dust.
    I must now brie<U+FB02>y allude to another phenomenon which was
 observed early in the foregoing investigation.      In addition to the
 blue colour seen on so many bodies, I found that contact of a
 hydrogen-<U+FB02>ame with some metallic surfaces gave rise to a second
 appearance succeeding or sometimes accompanying the blue co
 loration. This was a bright scarlet spot encircled by a green
 ring of light, forming together a section of the <U+FB02>ame. The co
 loration now mentioned was not nearly so general in its appear
 ance as the sulphur-blue.       On tin, or any of its alloys, it was
 seen brightly, and it also momentarily appeared on any surface
which had been rubbed by these bodies.          With a piece of thick
and tarnished tin-foil a beautiful experiment may be made. Sera.
ping the foil in places, and bringing it into contact with the hydro
 gen-<U+FB02>ame, the blue colour is seen on the dull parts, and the scarlet
and green light appears on the bright surfaces, the latter remain
ing until the foil melts. The colours may sometimes be made to
commingle, and a lovely purple is the result.          On some clean
pieces of lead the same appearance was noticed ; but here it soon
faded away, and was probably only caused by the impurity of
the metal. On clean zinc it could not be seen ; but after a piece
of tin plate had been drawn over its surface it appeared for an
instant.     Like the blue coloration, this scarlet appearance could
not be obtained by exposing tin to a coal-gas or alcohol-<U+FB02>ame,
nor to that of the oxyhydrogen blowpipe.           An examination of
this colour through a spectroscope will,     I trust, in a future in
vestigation, throw more light on its nature.
    I may mention in passing, that I found many of the solids
examined phosphoresced brilliantly when held for a short time
in contact with the hydrogen-<U+FB02>ame.          This was the case with
marble, lime, selenite after it had been calcined by the <U+FB02>ame or
with plaster of Paris, granite, sand-paper, and with different
kinds of writing-paper.       On sand-paper, if the hydrogen be
suddenly extinguished, a phosphorescent image of the <U+FB02>ame is
observed.      Chalk gives a brilliant greenish light, which changes
into a still brighter yellow as lime is formed, the mass glowing
throughout on the continuance of the <U+FB02>ame.
    The combustion of the hydrogen itself offers some points
worthy of further investigation.        VVben burnt in an inverted
vessel, it is generally accompanied by the blue colour, which is
seen around the upper part of the <U+FB02>ame where this is in contact
with the sides of the vessel.        If, however, the hydrogen be
mixed with about a third its bulk of air, the blue colour becomes

     Mr. P. E. Chase            on   Gravity and Magnetic Inclination.       329
much fainter, and a dark space is observed above the burning
hydrogen surmounted by a <U+FB02>ame of a light green colour.                  The
greenness    is  seen   very  well  by employing      a long test-tube, and
slowly bringing       the   mouth upwards as the hydrogen burns.
Mr. VValdie, in a paper “On Combustion and Flame,” published
in the Philosophical Magazine for August 1838, remarks that
“ one peculiarity in the <U+FB02>ame of
                                         hydrogen must have been fre
quently observed, namely, a green jet inside of the usual dark
central portion; and when the <U+FB02>ame is full, a dark central part
even in this.”       No explanation of this green colour is given b
the writer; but it        is,
                           I   believe, quite distinct from that which       I
                                            Mr. Waldie have frequently
                                              by by
remarked.      The appearance seen                        I
noticed, and   is    probably caused          impurities in the gas. In
connexion with the hydrogen-<U+FB02>ame, however, there                 is another
curious appearance, which possibly has often been observed—
namely,  a  kind of luminous stream to be seen stretching itself
some distance above the tip of the <U+FB02>ame when the gas burns in
a  darkened room.
    After the results detailed in the foregoing paper had been ob
tained, it  occurred to me that         would be well to try the effect of
                                         it
bringing gases as well as solids and liquids into contact with the
hydrogen-<U+FB02>ame.      I     tried carbonic acid, and found that the pre
sence of this gas instantly changed the colour of burning hy
drogen from    a    yellowish brown to        pale lilac, the whole of the
                                                a
hydrogen-<U+FB02>ame being here tinged.               The same change in colour
may be seen        by  allowing the products of combustion from
                                                                               a a

I  have as yet made no additional experiments: the explanation
 of the phenomenon             therefore merely conjecture; but
                                is                                       it   is
 possible this  lilac-blue   colour  may be due to the hydrogen-<U+FB02>ame
rendering   incandescent      the  molecules   of carbonic acid—or, more
probably,   to a   partial decomposition      of the gas, and combustion
of the carbonic oxide.

  330        Mr. P. E. Chase       on Gravity and Magnetic Inclination.
  renewed reasons for regretting the want of a complete record
  of the investigations on which Professor Secchi based his con
  clusion, that all “the phenomena hitherto known of the diurnal
  magnetic variations may be explained by supposing that the sun
  acts upon the earth as a very powerful magnet at a great dis
  tance”*.         As I know of no magnetic law which will account for
  those anomalies, I propose brie<U+FB02>y to describe them, and to point
  out some relations between the gravitation-currents and the dip
  of the needle, as a sequel to my papers on the in<U+FB02>uence of gra
  vity upon the total magnetic force and the magnetic declination.
      General Sabine’s discussions have shown some important points
  of difference between the magnetic disturbances at intertropical
  and extratropical stations, the Cape of Good Hope being mag
  netically, though not geographically, intertropical.               In the third
 volume of the ‘ Toronto Observations,’ and in Professor Baehe’s
  discussions of the observations at Girard College, projections of
 the daily and semiannual inclination-curves                  are given‘l'; and
  plate 5 of the second volume of the
                                                  ‘
                                                    Hobarton Observations ’
 contains a graphical representation of the diurnal variations of
 the inclination at the different observation-hours in the four
 seasons.       If we also project, from General Sabinc’s Tables of the
 mean results, the daily and semiannual curves at St. Helena
 and Cape Colony, and compare the curves at the <U+FB01>ve stations, it
 will be found that,
      1. The greatest daily disturbance of inclination occurs about
 noon.
     2. At (magnetically) intertropical stations the dip is dimi
 nished, but at extratropical stations it is increased in the middle
 of the day.
    " Phil. Mag. S. 4. vol. ix. p. 452.      Faraday (Experimental Researches,
 vol. iii.- p. 493) states “ that the celebrated Professor Gazzaniga, starting
from his numerous experiments, which demonstrate the in<U+FB02>uence of mag
 netism upon the same a'e'rial <U+FB02>uids in a manner therefore different from
that of Bancalari, was induced to consider the sun and all the other celes
tial bodies as so many enormous magnets; by which he established that at
traction is merely one e<U+FB02>‘ect of the magnetism of the great celestial masses
  laced at an enormous distancchan idea which reappeared in 1846 in
   russia, and in 1847 in France.”
    While admitting the intimate relationship of magnetism and             vity, I
must dissent from the learned Professor’s inference.         For the evigdce ap
pears irresistible, that the earth’s magnetism is directly dependent on the
terrestrial       vitation of the thermall disturbed a'érial currents, and that it
is only sligirt‘ly affected by the perturbations of solar and lunar gravitation;
so that if we regard the relationship as a causal one, magnetism rather than
attraction should be considered the effect. (See Gauss, “ General Theo
of Terrestrial Magnetism,” §§ 30, 40,- Taylor’s Scienti<U+FB01>c Memoirs, vol. ii.

     Reasoning    either   it prior-i,  or from     See hi’s      postulates,     we
might naturally infer that the ellipticity of the atmosphere
would be increased by the direct action of the sun, and that
consequently, from the tendency of magnetic parallelism to the
gravitation-currents, the dip would be augmented at noon in all
places between the magnetic equator and the magnetic poles.
     Mr. William Ferrel, in his paper* which furnished the <U+FB01>rst
 satisfactory explanation of the barometric depression at the equa
tor and at the poles, shows that, in consequence of the earth’s
 motion, <U+FB02>uids tend to assume aform similar to his <U+FB01>g. 1 (Math.
 Monthly, vol. i. p. 215), “the surface of the fluid being slightly
 depressed at the equator, having its maximum height about the
parallel of 35°, and meeting the surface of the earth towards the
poles.”      The direct action of the sun, in increasing the equato
 rial ellipticity of the air, may also increase the tendency to equa
 torial and polar depression; and the magnetic parallelism may
 therefore be manifested in the solar-diurnal inclination-disturb
 ance precisely as it is manifested at St. Helena and Cape of Good
  Hope, by a diminution of dip between the parallels of 35°, and
 an increase in higher latitudes.                          -
      These coincidences may Well suggest the need of more exten
  sive observations in different parts of South America, Northern
 Africa, Southern Asia, the Paci<U+FB01>c Ocean, and the Frigid Zones,
 to furnish the data for determining to what extent mountain
  ranges, coast-lines, land and water radiation, winds, and ocean
  currents modify the theoretical phenomena of dip and declination.

   portions of the globe, have obtained the following results, which
   serve to show the character of ome of these modi<U+FB01>cations :—
                                 I.  Declination.
      1. The currents manifest a tendency to follow the lines of most
   direct ocean communication between the warmest and the coldest
   portions of the globe, the general declination being westerly in
   the Atlantic, and easterly in the Paci<U+FB01>c Ocean.
      2. The lines of no variation are apparently determined in part
   by the contours of the land* that divides the waters of the globe
  into two great bodies.
      3. The currents are de<U+FB02>ected by the southern pointed extremi
  ties of the several continents toward the east on the eastern shores,
  and toward the west on the western shores, of New Holland,
  Africa, and South America.
      4. The magnetic currents, in the three respects above enume
  rated, exhibit a precise parallelism to the ocean iidal<U+FB02>ow.
      5. In the comparatively narrow belt of the Atlantic Ocean, the
  declination between the parallels of 35° reaches 30°; in the
  broad expanse of the Paci<U+FB01>c, the maximum within the same
  limits of latitude is 15°.
      6. Between the parallels of 70° and 80° the declination be
  comes very great, and the currents tend to a gyratory or cyclonic
  motion, which appears to be modi<U+FB01>ed by glaciers or local poles
 of great cold.
      7. The cyclonic tendency is most marked in the southern
 hemisphere, where the ocean waters experience the least inter
 ruption to their normal motions.           Mr. F errel’s computation gives
 “ 28° 30' for the polar distance of the parallel where the surface
 of the <U+FB02>uid or the stratum of equal pressure meets the surface
 of the earth”1'. It will be readily seen that at that distance the
 south pole is entirely surrounded by water; and it seems there
 fore highly probable that, if there were no land in the frigid
 zones, there would be no de<U+FB01>nite magnetic poles, but a simple
 polar belt toward which the magnetic currents would <U+FB02>ow in
 parallel spirals I, except when de<U+FB02>ected by land radiation, or
 tidal or other gravitation-currents.

   8. The lines of equal dip are arranged in approximate parallels
around the two (principal) magnetic poles.
   9. In consequence of this parallelism they are convex toward
the north in the Paci<U+FB01>c Ocean, and toward the south in the
Atlantic Ocean.
   10. The magnetic parallels also approximate to the isothermal
parallels, both in direction and in position, but with some im
portant departures.
   11. In South America the magnetic equator is depressed
nearly 30° south of the isothermal equator; it                is,
                                                               howevar,

poles.                                 v
   12. The magnetic parallels near the magnetic poles are more
convex than the isothermal lines, but they present some inter
esting instances of parallelism to the ocean-currents, which are
indisputably gravitation-currents.
   13. This parallelism         specially observable in the regions of
                                 is
the equatorial currents, the Gulf-stream, and the North Paci<U+FB01>c
and Japan currents.
   14.    If  series of waves were propagated through the air from
               a

continental contours and ocean currents, they could be represented
with great accuracy        by
                            the magnetic parallels.
   All of the foregoing modi<U+FB01>cations, as well as the theoretical
phenomena previously referred to, have their exact counterparts
in the currents which tend to restore the gravitation-equilibrium
0f the air and water. It may be unwise, ignorant as we are of
the true nature of causal ef<U+FB01>ciency, to assert that one form of
force    is
          produced    by another, but        one of the most important
                                                  is

   It would certainly be very satisfactory, if it were possible, to
have   some means of exhibiting,        by simple laboratory experi
ments, the direct and mutual convertibility of gravitation and
magnetism; but I fear the attempt to reproduce, in any appre
ciable mechanical form, the magni<U+FB01>cent and daily repeated ope
rations in the laboratory of nature which I have feebly endeavoured
to interpret must            be futile.   In order to obtain even the
small amount of distur ance ('00134) which I have noted in the
                     always
half-daily variation of atmospheric weight (Trans. Amer. Phil.
Soc., vol. xiii. p. 121), it would be necessary to take observations
at two stations, one of which should be 2655* miles more dis
tant from the earth’s centre than the other.                         If
                                                       the differences
of vapour, temperature, barometric pressure, force and direction
of wind, atmospheric electricity, &c. did not so complicate the
problem as to discourage even the most sanguine experimenter
from any attempt at solution, any result that could be obtained
under such circumstances would give little general satisfaction.
   It is possible, however, that the end, which we should vainly
striVe to reach directly, may be indirectly attained.     Indeed the
various stages of an indirect road have long been known, but we
have not been able to compare them by any common measure.
The motion of gravity, by percussion or the obstruction of sim
ple fall, has been repeatedly converted into the motion of heat;
and the motion of heat by the thermo-electric pile has been con
verted into the motion of magnetism.             The experiments of
Barlow, Coulomb, Kup<U+FB01>'er, and ChristieT on the in<U+FB02>uence of
heat upon the magnet, furnish data that may lend some aid to
any investigator who seeks to ascertain the precise value and
modi<U+FB01>cation of each force, in these successive conversions.

 still more satisfactory when viewed in connexion with the gravi
 tation-disturbances, I will brie<U+FB02>y refer to some of the more im
 portant points that have helped to con<U+FB01>rm me in the various
 views that I have hitherto advanced.              Such are, e. g., the evi
 dences of the identity of helices and magnets (2239) ; the exist
 ence of magnetic repulsion without polarity (2274) ; the relative
 magnetic position of gases and vapours (2416) ; the relations of
 the magnecrystallic,      cohesive, and magnetic forces (2479, 2562,
 2578); the probable dependence of the magnetic motions of
 <U+FB02>uids upon their mass and density (2768, 2769, 2781, 2863);
 the magnetic in<U+FB02>uence of winds and varying atmospheric pressure
 (2952, 2954)}; the supposed velocity of magnetic transmission
in :space or tether (2958) ; the daily bipolar minima of cold
 (3006) ; the closed circuits and prominent characteristics of the
magnetic lines of force (3117, 3278, 3279, 3284) ; the tendency
of all bodies to evolve electric currents when moving in a mag
netic <U+FB01>eld (3337) ; the relative diamagnetic and magnetic effects
 of heat and cold upon air and the diamagnetic gases, as well as
upon iron, nickel, and cobalt (2861, and           III. pp. 446, 460, 464,
472, 473, 489, 490).
    It should not be forgotten that there is no such thing within
the compass of our observation as “potential” gravity, no in
stance of matter in absolute rest, and just beginning or tending
to move under a gravitating pull.            Every particle of the earth,
independently of the action of heat, chemical a<U+FB02>inity, and cohe
sion, is at every instant subjected to four principal and important
impulses—two toward the centres of the sun and earth respec
tively, and two tangential to the earth’s orbit and to its circum
ference.     Of the several motions, the orbital one is by far the
most important.         Next in point of velocity is the one tangential
to the circumference ; in point of intensity, the one toward the
centre of the sun.       Since the solar central and tangential motions
are in wquilibrio, it seems eminently proper that the others should
be regarded as disturbances, which tend, as              I  have elsewhere
shown, to give     a daily elliptieity to each section of air parallel to
the equator.      Not only are the barometric daily tides a necessary
consequence of such ellipticity; owing to the di<U+FB02>'erence of speci<U+FB01>c
gravity, the cold air, in addition to the proper motion of convec
tion, is alternately drawn toward and repelled from the earth’s
                 I
surface; and am inclined to believe that many of the pheno
mena of the deposition of dew and the magnetic perturbations,
which cannot be explained by other more important gravitation
currents, may be thus accounted for.

zinc, and to the consequent value of these minerals for the con
struction of a sensitive thermo-electric pile.        In order to com
plete these investigations, experiments were made with all pro
curable minerals which conduct electricity, for the purpose of
ascertaining how they comport themselves in this respect.
   For this purpose the following apparatus was used:-—-Two
square pieces of thick platinum-foil, m and n, 10 millims. in
length, were <U+FB01>rmly nailed with sprigs made of platinum wire to
the board A, leaving a groove between them 1 millim. in width.
Each of these plates pressed tightly against a platinum wire,_the
other ends of which communicated with their respective binding
screws.     To the binding-screws were fastened the wires of the
galvanometer.                         _                           _ _

   To test any given mineral by means        of  this  apparatus, apiece
about the size of a small pea, thoroughly cleaned, was placed on
the platinum plate n, which we will call the test-plate, and a
piece of antimony of the same size on the other platem.

XLVI.        On a Triangle in-and-eircumscribed to a 'Quarlic Curve.
                   By Professor CAYLEY, F.R.S.*
         quartic curve (.23— 9)’+ (y’—b’)9=c4 presents a simple
Vl‘HEexample      of a triangle in- and-circumscribed to a single
curve, viz. such that each angle of the triangle is situate on, and
each side touches, the curve.      Assuming that the triangle is
symmetrically situate in regard to the axis of 1 , viz. if it be the
isosceles triangle a ce, the sides whereof touch
                                                          a
the curve in the points B,D,F respectively, then
we must have a single relation between the con
stants a, b, c of the curve; or if (as may be
done without loss of generality) we write      1,

XLVII.       01. the Conditions      of Stability of thin'Films QfLiquids;
     a Report     by Professor PLATEAU on a illemoir by Professor
     LAMARLE of Ghent.—Second Part*.
         the <U+FB01>rst part of this investigation'l', M. Lamarle considered
 IN      more particularly the theoretical questions connected with
the stability of systems of <U+FB01>lms ; in the present part he examines
the matter experimentally, by means of skeleton <U+FB01>gures of iron
 wire and the glycerized liquid, or a simple solution of soap.              He
 studies <U+FB01>rst of all the systems of the seVen typical polyhedra,
which he had discussed in the First Part,—those, namely, which,
disregarding for the moment the question of stability, would be
composed of plane <U+FB01>lms, all meeting in a single point at the
centre of the <U+FB01>gure, and conforming to the laws I have esta
blished.      With regard to these systems, he arrives at the same
results as those which        I   have described in my Sixth Series, and
shows their connexion with the formula: deduced in his First
Part; but he has obtained in addition, partly by direct experi
ment, and partly by the help of reasoning and calculation, a series
of new results of which         I am about to give an outline.
     But, to avoid repetitions, it may be pointed out previously
that, according to an observation communicated to me by M. van
Rees, and mentioned in my Sixth Series, when, after obtaining
upon a skeleton its ordinary system of <U+FB01>lms, the base of the
skeleton is again plunged into the liquid and then withdrawn,
there is formed in the base a <U+FB01>lm which afterwards ascends be
tween the <U+FB01>lms of the system, shutting in a certain quantity of
air, and thus causing a closed laminar polyhedron with curved
faces to be generated in the middle of the <U+FB01>gure.              We now pro
ceed to the results obtained by M. Laniarlc.
                  I.  System    of the Regular Tetrahedron.
    In the laminar tetrahedron with convex faces, produced in the
middle of the <U+FB01>gure by the above process: (1) The curvature of
the faces is spherical, and consequently the curvature of the edges
is circular.      (2) The centre of the sphere to which any one of
these faces belongs is situated at the opposite summit.               (3) The
centre of the circumference         to which any  one  of the  edges belongs
is situated at the middle of the chord of the opposite edge.
  II.   System  of the Right Triangular Prism with Equilateral Base.
     1.  If the  side of the base is denoted by a, and the height            of

3443              Prof. Plateau    on the Conditions  of
the prism     is comprised     between the typical value          and a
                                                             £6
value which is either exactly or very nearly indeed equal to           it
                                                                    g,
 is possible to obtain at will, by proper manipulation, at the middle
 of the <U+FB01>gure resulting from a single immersion, a triangular <U+FB01>lm
 parallel to the bases, or a liquid edge parallel to the lateral edges.
 I  had pointed out these two forms, but as belonging respectively
 to limits of height differing more widely from each other.
     2. In order to be able to obtain a triangular laminar prism at
 the middle of the <U+FB01>gure, it is necessary that the ratio between
 the height of the skeleton and the side of the base should not
exceed a certain limit.
     3. When this laminar prism is obtained, its faces never have
a spherical curvature:      for them to assume such a curvature, it
 would be needful for the lateral edges of this same laminar prism
 to be diminished so far as to disappear.          It is possible to ap
 proach as nearly as we choose to this condition ; and it may even
 be attained, but not permanently, for in that case six liquid edges
 meet at each of the summits of the laminar polyhedron; and
           I
this, as tried to show by experiments, and as M. Lamarle has
 demonstrated, in the <U+FB01>rst part of this investigation, involves the
 instability of the system.
                       III.   System  of the Cube.
     1. The faces of the laminar hexahedron formed at the middle
of the <U+FB01>gure have a spherical curvature, and the radius of the
 sphere to which they belong is half as long again as the straight
line joining two summits opposed to one of the faces.
     2. If the height of the skeleton be made greater than the side
of the base, so as to convert it into a right square prism, M. van
Rees’s process still gives an internal laminar prism with curved
faces, provided the height of the prism is not too great; but the
faces of this prism never have a spherical curvature.
     3. If the height of the skeleton notably exceeds the side of
the base, the central <U+FB01>lm of the ordinary system always presents
itself parallel to two of the lateral faces; but if the height exceeds
the side of the base by a suf<U+FB01>ciently small quantity, this <U+FB01>lm
can be transformed by an appropriate method into one parallel
to the base—a transformation analogous to what we have seen
above in the ease of the system of the triangular prism.
   IV.  System  qf the Right Peniagonal Prism with Regular Base.
     1. Denoting by    r  the radius    of the circle inscribed in the
base,   I had given, in my Sixth Series, for the typical height of

                 Stability 0f thin Films of Liquids.                345
the prism the value             _
                        21'.  J3 =2rx 1-732.
This value, which    I had arrived at by neglecting the very slight
curvature of the <U+FB01>lms composing the system, is not quite accu
rate; the true value is
                            2’_- =2r
                                ¢2_         >< 1-618.
                          ~/3-./5
   2. Here again, for it to       be possible to produce a laminar
pentagonal prism     at  the  middle  of the <U+FB01>gure, the skeleton must
not have too great a height in comparison with the dimensions
of the base.     Under these conditions, and provided also that
the height exceeds the typical height, the laminar prism will
have faces of spherical curvature, if it has a certain determinate
volume relatively to the size of the skeleton.              This laminar
prism will then have a height equal to 21'853 times the chord of
the side of its base, and the radius of the sphere to which its
faces belong will be equal to 23072 times the same chord.
    3. WVhen the height of the skeleton is only very little less
than the typical height, it is possible, by certain manipulations,
to obtain at pleasure, in the system of <U+FB01>lms resulting from a
single immersion, either a very small pentagonal <U+FB01>lm at the
middle of the <U+FB01>gure, or the other system—that is to say, the one
corresponding to the typical height or to a greater height.
              V. System of the Regular      Dadecalzerlron.
    The faces of the laminar dodecahedron produced at the middle
of the system have a spherical curvature; the radius of the spheres
to which they belong is equal to about 23 times the chord of
their side.
    In all the above systems with an internal laminar polyhe
 dron, when the faces of the latter have a spherical curvature, all
 the <U+FB01>lms which extend from the edges of the skeleton to the
 edges of this laminar polyhedron are plane; and consequently
all the liquid edges which join the angles of the skeleton with
 those of the same polyhedron are straight.
              VI.   Systems of two Special Poly/redra.
    These polyhedra, as well as their systems of <U+FB01>lms, would
require for their proper comprehension either a long description
 or <U+FB01>gures.    I will therefore con<U+FB01>ne myself to saying only a few
 words about them.         The <U+FB01>rst is composed of two equal and
 parallel squares,  one    of  which is turned through a quarter of a
 revolution in relation to the other, and which are connected
 together by eight half-regular pcntagons.         In each of these pen

tagons, the plane containing the side common to one of the
squares, and the two adjacent sides, makes a reentering angle of
about 168° with the plane which contains the other two sides.
This skeleton affords <U+FB01>ve different systems of <U+FB01>lms which can be
obtained at pleasure; and, in addition, eight different laminar
polyhedra can be produced at the middle of them.
   The second polyhedric skeleton is still more dif<U+FB01>cult to de
scribe.   It consists of four rectangles and four half-regular
pentagons; each of these pentagons is also formed of two parts,
of which the planes make a reentering angle with each other.
This skeleton gives two different systems of <U+FB01>lms; and four
internal laminar polyhedra can be produced upon it.
   M. Lamarle then leaves the typical polyhedra, and developes
some general considerations upon the systems of <U+FB01>lms belonging
to other skeletons.
   He takes, as an example for investigation in detail, the regular
octahedron. By aid of an arti<U+FB01>ce of reasoning, he arrives dpriori,
and solely by theory, at <U+FB01>ve different systems of <U+FB01>lms, which
are very probably the only systems possible in the skeleton in
question.    The <U+FB01>rst is formed entirely of plane <U+FB01>lms, and its
centre is occupied by the common summit of six spearhead
shaped quadrilateral <U+FB01>lms, having their sharp points respectively
at the six summits of the skeleton; the second is formed b
curved <U+FB01>lms, and has an hexagonal <U+FB01>lm at the middle.           I  had
previously indicated these two systems: the three new systems
found by M. Lamarle, and which are formed of curved <U+FB01>lms,
contain at the middle, one of them a pentagonal <U+FB01>lm, another a
trapezoid four-sided <U+FB01>lm, and the last an equilateral four-sided
<U+FB01>lm.    M. Lamarle is able to obtain these systems at pleasure,
and also to cause them to change at pleasure one into another.
   He dwells specially upon the <U+FB01>rst of these <U+FB01>ve systems—that
is to say, upon the one which has plane <U+FB01>lms only—and shows
that the dimensions of its parts are related to each other and to
the dimensions of the skeleton in very simple numerical ratios.
   As to the internal laminar polyhedra, M. Lamarle obtains
<U+FB01>fteen different ones in this same system.       He has succeeded in
deducing    all of them  from    the  theory, and  in effecting their
derivation,   both  theoretically    and  experimentally,  from one
another.
   Lastly, M. Lamarle discusses, still in reference to the same
skeleton, systems of a kind which he calls incomplete, inasmuch
as they are formed by breaking certain <U+FB01>lms in a system already
formed, and they consequently present vacant spaces.           When
one of the above-mentioned laminar polyhedra is obtainedin the
middle of a system of plane <U+FB01>lms, six small triangular <U+FB01>lms are
formed abutting on this polyhedron ; and it is by breaking either

two or four of these small <U+FB01>lms that M. Lamarle obtains the in
complete systems in question.               In the case of three of them,
resulting from the disappearance of two opposite <U+FB01>lms, the in
ternal polyhedra which were originally octahedrie, are converted
into hexahedra of very elegant forms; the disappearance of two
more of the opposed small <U+FB01>lms converts one of these hexahedra
into a tetrahedron of a remarkable appearance, on account of the
outlines of its faces.

XLIX. An        Account    of  the Water-Barometer       constructed and
    erected by   ALFRED Binn, Experimental Chemist, Birmingham.
                               [With  a Plate]
    To the Editors    of the  Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,
                         of the British Association which has just
AT beenMeeting
          the
                held at Birmingham,        I had the pleasure to show a
water-barometer      which   has  been  in  perfect action for six years.
A general desire having been expressed that some account of the
instrument should appear, I have the pleasure to send you the
following particulars and drawings.
    In the construction of a water-barometer four things have to
be attended to :—
    1st. The water must be deprived of air;
    2nd. The air must not again enter the water;
    3rd. The Water must go into the barometer, to the exclusion
 of the air; and
    4th. The instrument must be so constructed that, while the
atmospheric pressure within the instrument shall be uninter
rupted, no air shall penetrate into the vacuum-chamber.
    I  begin by describing the material.        The tube is composed of
metal and glass, and the three taps are those which go by the
name of “ Lambert taps.”           The size of the metal part is half an
inch internal diameter, and is that sort of white-metal tube
which is in universal use by gas-<U+FB01>tters, called “compo.”                I
believe it is an alloy of lead and zinc.
    I recommend that which is made by Messrs. Stock Brothers
 and Co., in Birmingham, as their compo tube will stand an
 internal pressure of <U+FB01>fty pounds of air to the inch without leaking :
it is also very cheap. The glass tube to show the “readings ” is
 1 inch internal diameter and 6 feet long.            The brass Lambert
 taps   are half  an inch   internal  diameter.     These  taps are con
 structed internally with a cushion of india-rubbcr, pressed down
 by means of a brass plate acted upon by a screw, which makes
them absolutely secure.
    I now proceed to describe the upper and lower parts of the baro
 meter in reference to the drawings.         Plate IV. A A is the compo
 tube, having two enlarged sockets B, B, 1% inch in diameter
 and 3 inches deep.       These sockets were made of brass, and their
 of<U+FB01>ce is to receive the ends of the glass tube.          To <U+FB01>x the glass
 tube C, about six inches of the compo tube was soldered to the
 bottom of the socket, and being inverted and <U+FB01>xed very steady,
 enough dry sand was poured into the compo tube to <U+FB01>ll it up to
 the bottom of the socket B.         The using of the sand was to pre

 350              Mr. A. Bird   on a Water-Barometer.
 vent the cement from running into and stopping up the compo
 tube.    The glass tube C, perfectly clean inside, was now placed
 in the socket; and being most carefully steadied to keep it
 upright, six inches of dry sand were poured down to keep the
 cement from rising up the glass tube C.
    The cement was composed of two parts of gutta percha and
 one part of common black pitch.         These two substances were
 heated in an iron ladle with alip, till they became perfectly <U+FB02>uid
 and quite free from froth. A “ copper bit” used by plumbers
 having been heated to low soldering-heat, a small quantity of
 the cement was poured into the socket.         The copper bit was
 then applied to the outside, the effect being to perfectly liquefy
 the cement in situ.    A little more of the hot cement was then
 poured in, and again the heated copper bit was applied till
the socket was quite full of very <U+FB02>uid cement without any air
 cavities therein.   As the cement cooled, it clung to the glass
and metal, and became absolutely solid and air-tight.         If the
cement is poured in all at once, it is impossible to prevent cre
vices, which will let in air when the barometer is <U+FB01>lled, causing
the water gradually to descend till it falls out of the instrument.
   A place being chosen on the staircase of my house, a <U+FB02>at
board, 7 feet long and 1 foot wide, was fastened to the wall,
upon which board was <U+FB01>xed the socketed glass tube C, and gra
duated scale F, from the top of which 422 inches were most care
fully measured down to the “ zero ”-point E beside the cistern.
   The scale F is to the right of the glass tube. It is made
of well-seasoned boxwood, and is graduated to inches and
tenths.    The sliding-tube G, with the vernier H, is between the
glass tube and the boxwood scale F. On the left side of the
glass tube C is another sliding-tube g, with a vernier h, to
record position of top of tidal column of water at 9 4.11. the
morning previously.
   The glass tube,     scale, and verniers having been securely
placed on the board and perfectly upright,the gas-<U+FB01>tter proceeded
to connect, by soldering, the remainder of the compo tube
above the glass tube C, which was continued upwards till it
entered nearly at the bottom into a round vessel K, made of
zinc, 4 inches in diameter and 18 inches high.     Inside the vessel
the tube coils round in a spiral, like the worm of a still.     This
vessel and spiral are not necessary to the action of the baro
meter; but as the spiral is in the part of the tube in which is
the vacuum-chamber, it gives the opportunity of arti<U+FB01>cially
cooling with ice or snow the included aqueous vapour, and thus
determining by actual experiment the amount of correction
required.
   If the experiment of cooling      the included vapour to 32° be

                  Mr. A. Bird  on a I’Vater-Barometer.             351
tried in summer, when the external temperature is 70° or 80°,
the sudden cooling causes so great an evaporation from the sur
face of the water, and condensation in the upper part of the baro
meter, that a real rain-shower is produced, the condensed water
running down the glass tube in innumerable pellucid drops in
the most beautiful manner, thus perfectly imitating the conden
sation of invisible watery vapour in the higher regions of the
atmosphere.       When the compo tube leaves the zinc vessel, it is
led up perpendicular to the Lambert tap L.           Above the tap L
the tube still rises perpendicular, when it suddenly bends down,
leaving the end open at M.
     I now describe the part of the barometer below the glass tube.
     The compo tube being soldered on, was carried down to the
cistern, not necessarily perpendicular; for instance, the tube
may descend at an angle of 30° or 40°, and may twist in
any convenient direction.        The entire instrument erected by
 me is in the house, to escape a freezing temperature.         At the
 lowest bend of the compo tube is a short upright tube, having at
the end a Lambert tap N, to which is soldered a male screw of a
 gth-inch gas union-joint O, the use of which will be understood
 further on. The compo tube now begins to ascend; and at the
 top of the bend is another Lambert tap P. Beyond this the compo
 tube bends down and reaches nearly to the bottom of the cistern,
 which is a one-gallon white-glass narrow-mouth upright bottle
 R. The bottle rests upon a stand S, which moves up and down
 by means of a set screw T, acting through a stout shelf U U;
 and the bottle is kept steady by means of the two uprights W,W,
 upon one of which is <U+FB01>xed the zero-point E.
     I shall now describe the method of <U+FB01>lling the barometer, which
 was as follows.
     Four gallons of water were carefully distilled, and being put
  into a perfectly clean and new tin oil-can with a narrow mouth, the
  water was boiled for one hour over a bright <U+FB01>re, the object being
  to drive out the air.    \Vhile still boiling, two quarts of olive oil
  were poured in.      This slightly increased the pressure in the
  water underneath, causing the last remains of the air to rise with
  the steam in jets or spirts through the stratum of oil. The
  instant ebullition was stopped, the oil closed over the boiled
  water, and it became hermetically sealed from the atmosphere.
  The contents of the tin can were now cooled, and the can X was
  placed above the top of the water-barometer.         A piece of gth
  inch gutta-percha tube     YY,  suf<U+FB01>ciently long to reach from the
  can X above to below the very bottom of the barometer, was pro
  cured, and one end of the tube was put into the mouth of the
  can X, the end passing through the supernatant stratum of oil
  down to the bottom of the water underneath.         At the other end

 352               Mr. A. Bird on a W'aler-Barometer.
 of the gutta-percha pipe Y is a <U+FB01>th-inch tap, terminating with a
 <U+FB01>th-inch female screw union-joint Z. The gutta-percha pipe
 being in position, and hanging down as seen in the drawing,
  became a siphon; and the air being sucked out, the water at
 once came over, and was stopped from running away by turning
  the small tap Z.      The female union~screw at Z being tightly
  screwed on to the male screw-joint O, the water was ready to
 enter the barometer.
     The <U+FB01>rst thing to be done was to displace the air in the bend
 of the tube, reaching from the tap N at the bottom, to the
 extreme end of the compo tube in the cistern B.       This was done
 in the following manner :—The cistern or bottle was taken clean
 away and <U+FB01>lled quite full to the very brim with best olive oil;
 the three Lambert taps being all open, and the bottom end of
 the “ compo
                  ” tube
                          hanging down, the small gas-tap Z was
 opened;    the   water then began to ascend both legs of the baro
 meter, and when it reached the tap P, it passed over and ran
 out of the end of the tube which was hanging down.          At that
 instant the stream was stopped with the thumb, and, the tap Z
 being turned off, the bottle full of oil was brought to the thumb
 which stopped the end of the compo tube and kept-in the
 water.    The thumb supporting the tube was now put into the
oil, and the end of the tube slipped down to the bottom of the
oil. The bottle was then put into its place on the stand S, and
the surplus oil being siphoned out, there remained in the cis
tern R about 3 inches in depth of olive oil, the compo pipe dip
ping into it nearly to the bottom.
     The next thing was to <U+FB01>ll the longer part of the barometer,
which was accomplished as follows :—The tap P being closed
and the small tap Z opened, the water rapidly rose in the baro
meter; when the water had reached the opening M at the top,
it was allowed to run a minute or two to carry any traces of air
away which might have lingered in the tube.         Tap L at the top
and tap N at the bottom being then securely closed, tap P was
opened, and the column of water began to descend and to accu
mulate in the cistern R under the stratum of olive oil.       As the
column    fell it  was narrowly watched   in the glass tube, but not
a bubble of gaseous matter was observed.          On examining the
cistern R, it was found that the oil did not quite reach the zero
point E, more oil therefore was poured in till the zero-point E
and the level of the oil were coincident.       The graduated scale
was now looked at, and it showed that the column of water was
400 inches high, the mercurial barometer being 304 inches,
and the temperature 67°.
    In order to test if gaseous matter would accumulate in the
vacuum-chamber, the gutta-percha siphon was allowed to remain

                 Mr. A. Bird   on a lValer-Barometer.             353
in its place for   some weeks, and    four different times tap P was
closed, tap N opened, with tap Z, thus <U+FB01>lling the barometer up
to tap L at top,.whicli being opened allowed the water and
gaseous matter, if there had been any, to <U+FB02>ow out at M.            On
closing tap L and tap N and opening tap P, the column of
water again fell; and after siphoning out the surplus water
from under the oil in the cistern till the oil was level with the
zero-point E, the column of water was found on the four differ
ent trials to be exactly the same height on the scale after each
trial as before. It was therefore plain that no gaseous matter
had accumulated above the water, and that, with the exception of
the vapour of water, it was a perfect vacuum.
   I will now mention one or two precautions which are required
in order to ensure success.      In the <U+FB01>rst place the water must be
distilled—for this reason, amongstothers,thatif thewater contains
“                  ” or
  earthy salines         colouring-matter, it is certain, by the con
stant evaporation and precipitation in the working part of the
glass tube, to crust it over so completely, that in a few months
the water becomes invisible; pure distilled water is therefore in
dispensable.     Then, if the slightest leak in the barometer exists,
it will infallibly bring the instrument to grief. In order, there
fore, to be sure that the barometer was sound (before the water
deprived of air was put in), I closed tap L at top and tap P;
then, connecting the gutta-percha tube with the “ street water
works ” pressure, I allowed it to enter the barometer till the in
cluded air was contracted to one-fourth of its length, having a
pressure of water under it of between 40 and 50 lbs. to the inch.
    The barometer stood this internal pressure for ten hours
without the air being forced out.       I  therefore concluded that if
the barometer would stand this great pressure inside, it would
stand 14 lbs. to the inch pressure on the outside, and without
hesitation  I  <U+FB01>lled it with the prepared water.
   As the instrument is made by a gas-<U+FB01>tter, it would be eas to
put the whole of it together, Lambert taps included, an to
prove it with some powerful water-pressure before the instru
ment is taken to the place where it is to be erected.        Also the
water deprived of air and covered with the stratum of olive oil
in the tin can could be sent, if necessary, 100 miles away with
out the possibility of any air getting into it. If a gutta-percha
pipe is not to be had to <U+FB01>ll the barometer, a piece of compo
tube will answer every purpose, which, when done with, is none
the worse for gas-<U+FB01>tting purposes.
   I shall conclude with some account of the action of the water
barometer.      In the PhilosophicalTransactions for 1832 is a de
scription by Mr. Daniell of a water-barometer which he erected at
the “ Royal Society’s Rooms,” at Somerset House, which was in
   Phil. Mag. S. 4-. Vol. 30. No. 204-. Nov. 1865.           2 A

354                Mr. A. Bird   on a IVatcr-Barometer.
action for two years, but afterwards got out of order.        In de
scribing the action, Mr. Daniell states that “ the water appears to
be in perpetual motion, resembling the slow action of respiration.”
    I can fully corroborate Mr. Daniell in this particular, and
from careful and continued observation am able to state that the
times of the oscillations are about every four minutes and twenty
seconds.     It is requisite to watch the oscillations with a magni
<U+FB01>er, as they vary from the twentieth to the thirtieth part of an
inch, which distance can be well observed when it is slightly
magni<U+FB01>ed.       But the most surprising oscillations in the water
barometer are during a thunder-storm accompanied with great
falls of hail and heavy rain-drops.     I have given a chart of <U+FB01>ve
minutes’ readings for one hour and <U+FB01>ve minutes during a heavy
thunder-storm from the north-east, which passed over Birming
ham July 20, 1859.         The upper curved line shows the water
oscillations, and the lower curved line shows the oscillations in
the mercurial barometer.        The temperature is recorded at the
feet.    It will be observed that while the water-column rose and
fell in a most surprising manner, the mercurial column showed
hardly any motion, which was of a laggard character.
    At 4.20 EM. the storm reached its climax, the heavens grew
darker overhead, and the water rapidly descended, causing‘a most
impressive feeling on the mind, when suddenly came a terri<U+FB01>c
blaze of lightning instantly followed by the “thunder can
nonade”      (if
              I  may so call it); then down came the bail and
heavy rain, and as the sky began to brighten the water com
menced to rise, and in the next <U+FB01>ve minutes           had risen more
                                                      it
than four-tenths of an inch.
   Since Sir John Herschel proposed his new then -——that the
disruptive electric discharge     the result, and not
                                       is                   t cause of
                                                                e
the udden condensation of cloud into “ rain-drops,” in conse
quence of the cloud coming in contact with an extremely cold
and dry current of air—it has occurred to me that the sudden
increase in the density of the air, as shown by the rise of the
water-column, may be due to the sudden precipitation of rain
drops of unusual size, leaving the atmosphere drier and conse
quently denser;        being well established that the mercurial
                       it
column  is  always high when the air      dry, and vice versri.
                                            is
I     conclude this account of the water-barometer              by
                                                               stating
that the object with which        written

                                        a

        the    expectation     of preparing      brominated       diamylene,
IN Gm H19 Br,        Bauer* studied the action of alcoholic soda on
bromide of diamylenc, G” H‘“0 Br“. The reaction is very ener
getic and results in the removal of both atoms of bromine and
the formation of a new hydrocarbon, G“) H“.                 Thus:

         diamylene.                                           carbon.
The new body belongs to the acetylene series, and stands in               the
same    relation to diamylene that valerylenefl' does to amylene.
And it is related to rutic acid in the same way that acetylene is
to acetic, and valerylene to valerianic acid ; hence Bauer proposes
to call the new hydrocarbon Rutyteiw.

It  is a colourless liquid, lighter than water, and with a pleasant
odour.     It boils at about 150° C. By carefully keeping down
the temperature it can be made to unite with bromine and form
a new compound, Gm H'a Br’, bromide of rutytene.                 This cannot
be kept without decomposition.             It acts with great energy on
alcoholic solution of soda, and on dry acetate of silver; in both
cases a hydrocarbon of the formula G10 H‘6 is probably formed.
    With a view of extending our knowledge of xylole, and of
clearing up the very discrepant statements of its properties which
 exist, BeilsteinI has undertaken an investigation of this body.
 By subjecting a large quantity of coal-tar to fractional distilla
tion over metallic sodium, he obtained constant boiling-points at
82°, 111°, and 141°, corresponding                respectively to benzole,
toluole, and xylole.       He thus con<U+FB01>rms H. Miiller’s observations,
who <U+FB01>nds that xylole boils at 140°.
    By oxidation of toluole with chromic acid Hofmann obtained
benzoic acid; and it was natural to expect that by oxidation of

xylole the homologous toluylic acid, G8 H89“, would be formed.
This, however, is not the case: when xylole is oxidized by chro
mic acid it yields the bibasic tereplzthalic acid, according to the
equation
                    H“’+G"'=Ga l1694+2Hg 9.

   Fittig and Tollens made the interesting observation* that the
                                        s    a
mixed radical methyl-phenyle,g                      is in all respects identi
                                            {is},
cal with toluole, G7 H8 ; and it was natural to expect that ethyl
plzenyle,      g      , which    has the same        composition    as xylole,
would be identical with it. But Fittig’s observations show that
this is by no means the case; there are material differences
between the two substances.
   Fittig, in conjunction         with Glinzer, has recently prepared-l
another        body which     has the composition of xylole; it is the
mixed      radical   methyl-benzyle,     and is procured by the
                                57111:},
action of sodium on a mixture of brominated toluole, G7 H7 Br,
and iodide of methyle.   MethyLbenzyleboils constantly at 139°,
and, both in its physical properties and in the chemical changes
which it experiences under the in<U+FB02>uence of various reagents, it is
identical with xylole.
   Brigeli has prepared benzoyle, the radical of benzoic acid, by
treating chloride of benzoyle with sodium. In order to moderate
the action, the chloride of benzoyle was dissolved in anhydrous
ether, and the sodium used in the form of amalgam.           It was
ultimately necessary to apply heat to complete the reaction.
   The ethereal solution was <U+FB01>ltered off from the chloride of
sodium and mercury, washed with water to decompose some of
the undecomposed chloride, and then, after distilling off the ether,
the liquid, being left to itself, deposited some crystals. On ana

  G8 ll3 13 9. The crude product of the action of the protocbloi-idc,
  treated with soda, is precipitated by dilute sulphuric acid; this
  precipitate is exhausted by weak alcohol at the boiling-point,
  which dissolves out the biniodized phenylic acid, G3 H4 1‘19,
  and the residue is then crystallized from strong boiling alcohol.
  The crystals are yellow, easily soluble in ether, and decompose,
  when heated, with disengagement of much iodine.
      In the hope of getting a more highly iodized compound, the
  author acted with protochloride of iodine on teriodized phenylic
  acid.     Under these conditions all the iodine became free, and
  quintiehlorophenic acid, G6 HCP 9, was obtained, subliming in
  magni<U+FB01>cent white needles 3 to 4 centimetres in length.
      Seekamp*     found that when a solution of oxalic acid containing
  some uranium-salt        was exposed to the sun’s rays it was decom
  posed   into  carbonic    acid, carbonic oxide, and formic acid.
      Succinic and pyrotartaric acids, which are homologous with
  oxalic acid, experience an analogous decomposition under the
  same circumstances.         A 5 per cent. solution of succinic acid, to
  which 1 per cent. of uranium-salt was added, exposed to the
  sun’s rays soon became green ; succinate of uranium was depo
  sited as a green powder, carbonic acid was given off, and the
  completely decolorized liquid furnished propionic acid.              Pyro—
 tartaric acid in like manner was decomposed with formation of
 butyric acid. The decompositions which take place are as
 follows :—
                    G‘HGQ‘ = G92 + @H‘Q’
                  Succinic acid.            Propionic acid.

     Chloroxynaphthalic acid,        G10 H5 C193, differs from alizarine,

 drogen    ; and   many years ago     W013   and Strecker endeavoured,
but without success, to replace the chlorine in the above com
pound by hydrogen, and thus produce alizarine from naphthaline.
     Martins and Griess'l' have succeeded in producing from naph
thaline a body of the same composition as alizarine, but entirely
different in properties.         The starting-point for their investiga
tion was binitranaphthylic alcohol, G") H6 (NQQPQ, a substance
recently introduced into manufactures, and a description of which
is promised.       When this body is acted upon by tin and hydro
chloric acid, as a direct product of the action a beautiful tin

The    base appears to be of easily alterable nature, and has not yet
been obtained in the free state.          If an aqueous solution of the
tin-salt is decomposed by sulphuretted hydrogen, and the acid
<U+FB01>ltrate from the sulphide of tin saturated with potash, while air
is excluded no precipitate is formed; but as soon as air is allowed
access, oxygen is greedin absorbed and the formation of a yellow
crystalline substance takes place. This body is a base having
the formula G“) H8 N‘2 9, and forms with acids very well-de<U+FB01>ned
salts.     Curiously enough, it is decomposed when boiled with
either alcohol or water; the change in the ease of water is as
follows :—
               Gl° H6 N92 9+ HQG=GI° H7 N9"2 + NHs.
     The new body crystallizes in beautiful yellowish-red needles;
 it is an indifferent body, but is decomposed by boiling hydro
chloric acid in the following manner :—
                Gm H7NOQ+HQO=G1°              I1693+NH3.
    This new body crystallizes in yellow needles which are easily
 soluble in ether.       Like alizarine it is snblimed when heated, and
 gives  oxalic  and  phthalic acids when oxidized, but it differs from
 alizarine in giving no precipitate with chloride of barium; and
 cotton with a mordant of alum is not coloured; wool and silk
 are coloured yellow.         Like chloroxynaphthalic acid it forms a
 series of well-de<U+FB01>ned salts.
     The authors have observed analogous reactions in the phe
 nylic acid group, which they propose following up.

     Schiitzenberger describes* the following process of obtaining
 methyle-gas.      The method of Sir B. Brodie for the preparation
 of peroxide of acetyle consists in allowing pure precipitated bin
 oxide of barium to act upon cooled acetic anhydride.               By using
 an excess of binoxide and warming the mixture, a large quantity
 of gas is disengaged with regularity, and at the same time some
 acetate of barium is formed.          The operation may be effected in
 a 4- or 6-ounce <U+FB02>ask provided with a delivery-tube.              The gas is
  a mixture in exact proportions of two volumes of carbonic acid
 and one volume of a carburetted hydrogen.                The former is ab
  sorbed by potash, and the carburetted hydrogen left undissolved
 is found to have the composition and all the properties of the
                                                                  a

 paration of which thus becomes very easy.                 The reaction, in
 virtue of which it is formed, is thus written :—

360           M. Maly     on the Synthesis    ofFormic Acid.
    Gautier has found* that when gaseous hydriodic acid is
brought into contact with gaseous hydrocyanic acid, or is passed
into an ethereal solution of this acid, the two substances com
bine, forming a white amorphous powder, which crystallizes from
alcohol or water in transparent needles.           This body has the for
mula GHQNI, and the author considers that its formula is
      G H
N       H , that it is an iodide of ammonium in which the tri
        I
atomic radical    GH replaces H3.
    Maly'l- gives the following two methods for the synthetieal
preparation of formic acid.          Sodium-amalgam,          besides decom
position of water, acts upon aqueous solution of carbonate of
ammonia with formation of ammonium-amalgam; this decom
poses with liberation of hydrogen, while at the same time the
carbonic acid is in the act of being transferred from the ammonia
to soda.     To a concentrated aqueous solution of carbonate of
ammonia a weak sodium-amalgam was gradually added; and when
all the ammonia-amalgam that formed at <U+FB01>rst was again dec0m~
posed, the liquid was poured off from the mercury and distilled
with sulphuric acid. The acid distillate thus obtained was found
to contain formic acid, the identity of which was established by
anal sis and by the usual tests.
       hen a mixture of powdered metallic zinc and of carbonate
of zinc is added to hot potash-lye, the nascent hydrogen adds
itself to the carbonate of potash which is in course of formation,
and formic acid is also obtained,
                G99+H9+KH9=G H K99+H'9.
                                      Formiate of
                                         potash.
 The conditions for the synthesis of formic acid are thus (l) hy
 drogen in the nascent state, (2) carbonic acid at the moment of
 transference, and (3) the presence of a powerful base.
    Furfurol exhibits in almost all respects a complete analogy
 with oil of bitter almonds; by alcoholic potash it is converted into
 pyromucic acid, as Ulrich has shown.            It is probable that in this
 reaction the corresponding      alcohol  is formed    ; and, with a view to
 the direct preparation of this substance, Schmelz and Beilstein            I
 allowed sodium-amalgam to act upon furfurol, which it does
 with great energy, and without the disengagement of hydrogen.
 When the action was over, the reddish-brown liquid was poured

off from the mercury and treated with sulphuric acid, by which
the alcohol in question was deposited as a reddish-brown oil.
To purify this oil it was dissolved in alcohol, the alcoholic solu
tion mixed with ether, water gradually added, and the whole
well shaken, by which two'layers were obtained, one containing
a  solution of the alcohol of pyromucic acid in ether, and the
lower one an aqueous solution of pyromucate of soda.           On eva
porating the ethereal solution, a reddish liquid was obtained
which decomposed on evaporation. By the action of alkalies this
alcohol appears readily to pass into pyromucic acid.
   When bromine is added to pyromucic acid a violent reaction
is set up, accompanied by disengagement of carbonic acid. This
reaction is at <U+FB01>rst moderated by cooling, but its completion
requires the aid of heat.      It is also necessary that an excess of
bromine be added, and that the solution be of the proper degree
of concentration.      When these conditions are complied with,
and the solution is concentrated in the water-bath, it yields crys
talline laminae of a new body, mucobromic acid. This is a deci
dedly acid substance, and forms salts, which, however, are‘ex
tremely unstable, and have hence not been further examined.
Its formation is expressed as follows :—
      G5  H493+8Br+2H9 9=G4            Hsl Bre 93+%’+6HBr.
     Pyromucic                       Mucobromic
         acid.                          acid.
This reaction only expresses the <U+FB01>nal decomposition of pyro
mucic acid; and an oily body is <U+FB01>rst formed which is perhaps
G4 H9 93.      The action of excess of bromine on the soda-salt of
pyromucic acid is the same as on the free acid.
   The decomposition of pyromucic acid by chlorine is quite
analogous to that of bromine; it gives rise to mucochloric acid,
G4 H2 C1193.       Iodine is without action upon pyromucic acid.
   By comparing the formula of mucobromic acid, 84 Hii Br’ 95,
with that of mellithic acid, G4 H"2 9‘, it is seen that the latter
acid might be formed by the simple replacement of the bromine
                                                     ‘
of the former by oxygen.
   By treating mucobromic acid with baryta the bromine was
removed, but the decomposition in other respects was different.
When the acid is boiled with excess of baryta, air being excluded,
carbonate of baryta is deposited, and a gas is liberated which
spontaneously in<U+FB01>ames in the air, and is brominated acetylene,
G9 HBr; and the solution contains the baryta-salt of a new acid
which the authors call muconic acid.         The formula of this salt is
G4 Ba’9”+ §H9 9, and the free acid is obtained in crystals from
its lead-salt by treatment with sulphuretted hydrogen.
   In the formation of this acid the elements of water are con

                                         acid.         'acetylene.
   In the decomposition of mucrobromic acid by oxide of silver,
the <U+FB01>nal products are the same, but intermediate products are
formed which ultimately decompose.
   The authors have described several salts of pyromucic acid,
and they propose to continue the study of the products of de
composition of mucobromic acid.
   When atropine is boiled with baryta-water it is decomposed,
as  Kraut has found*, into a new acid, atropic acid, and a new
base, tropine, in the manner expressed by the following equa
tion :—

                      Atropine.        Atropic acid.             Tropine.
   The two new bodies remain in solution as atropate of tropine
After removing the baryta b carbonic acid, hydrochloric acid and
ether are added, by which         tropinethe dissolved out as hydro
                                                            is
chlorate, the acid being left.       The free base       obtained           is                    by
removing the hydrochloric acid                  by
                                       oxide of silver, and the small
trace of silver       by
                   sulphuretted hydrogen.      The aqueous solution
evaporated   and  left over  sulphuric  acid solidi<U+FB01>es  to    mass of              a

but    forms with acids
       it                  series of beautifully crystallizing salts.

     llusemann and Marme* have described the preparation of a

  (Chinese Box-thorn).           The aqueous decoction of the plant pre
 ferably    of  the  leaves)   was    treated with acetate of lead, and the
 <U+FB01>ltrate from the precipitate treated with sulphuric acid to re
 move the lead, then neutralized with soda and evaporated. The
 salts of the new base are so soluble that its precipitation was
 impossible by the ordinary methods, and a new one was made
 use of.       This consisted in the addition of phosphomolybdate
 of soda, with which the base forms an insoluble compound. The
 precipitate produced in this way was decomposed with moist
 levigated chalk, and the evaporated mass exhausted with boiling
 alcohol.
     This alcoholic extract left, on evaporation, a deliquescent crys
 talline mass. To obtain the base in the free state, its sulphate
 is decomposed with carbonate of baryta.                  The free base crystal
 lizes from water and from alcohol in small plates and prisms 3 in
 ether it is almost insoluble.           Analyses of its salts give for it the
 formula     G‘H‘NQ’;         it  is  isomeric     with butalanine, the base
 found by Gorup-Besanez in the salivary glands of the ox; but
 it differs from it materially; and it most resembles sarCOsinc,
 with which it is also homologous.                Its poisonous action is in—
 considerable.        It forms a series of beautifully crystallizing salts
 and double salts.

remarks that follow were intended to show to be an admissible

those remarks at the bottom of that page does really assume
the principle contended for, and that that principle has not the
axiomatic character         I had considered it to have.          All therefore
that    I have satisfactorily done, in reference to Newton’s theorem,
is to show that the condition (1) at page 290 always implies a
pair of imaginary roots, and that, however numerous be the con

    I had always regarded this <U+FB01>rst part of Newton’s theorem as
the part which it was the more difficult to prove; and as
to the second part, namely, that a ful<U+FB01>lment after a failure

                    In this was mistaken ; and I hasten to acknow

that by disputing this claim I should have put him to any trouble.
I  cannot atone for it in any other way but this.           He will see
that   I  have  not allowed   any considerations  whatever    to prevail
with me against my own conscientious convictions—against a
clear sense of what is just and right; and I trust that this amende,
which is entirely spontaneous, and not the result of any external
in<U+FB02>uence, will be accepted in the same spirit in which it is ten

    There can be but one opinion of the course adopted by Pro
 fessor Young in avowing his mistake; it can only tend to raise
 him in the estimation of all right-thinking persons.              Most
 writers in the course of their lives have published some erroneous
 results, but comparatively few have had the magnanimity              to
 make so prompt an avowal.          I wish it were not indispensable
 for me to observe on the two charges of inaccurate statement
of matters of fact brought against me in the last Number of this

of this Journal that I directed an invitation to be forwarded to

statement         (if   be conceived that anything turned upon      point             a
apparently        so immaterial)    to  denial of his having received it.

I  was not informed that       had not been transmitted.
                                     it                      As to the
other charge, Professor Young’s memory must certainly be in
default, as my observations on his “supposed demonstration ”
formed no part of my lecture, but were called forth          his inter        by
pellations addressed to me at the close of                         it,
                                                       and his express
“invitation ” to state wherein the same was inaccurate. Surely
then      “Iwas invited         by
                             Professor Young to express an opinion
on his supposed demonstration.”

       LII.  On the Magnetism of Salts oft/1e Magnetic lllctals.
             By Professor WIEDEMANN of Brunswick*.
     N  a series  of earlier investigations the author endeavoured to
       establish the properties of temporary and permanent mag
 nets, in so far especially as they can be explained on the assump
 tion of moveable molecular magnets.           By this assumption the in
 crease of the temporary and permanent magnetic momentum with
 increasing magnetizing power, its change by alternating action
 of the latter in an opposite direction, and the mechanical and
 thermal deportment of the various magnetized bodies can be
 explained, at any rate qualitatively.          For a further establish
 ment of this theory, as well as from a chemical point of view, it
 appeared interesting to consider more closely the properties of
the feebly magnetized bodies, the salts of the magnetic metals,
and their solutions.       Hence the magnitude of their temporary
magnetic    momentum        under various circumstances was deter
mined.
    The measurements of this momentum were made with the
aid of a special torsion-apparatus.            To a vertical brass pin,
moveable in a sheath, a German-silver wire was suspended, to
which was attached a long vertical brass bar, the lower end of
which was loaded with weights, and provided with brass paddles
which were immersed in a vessel full of oil.           At the upper end
of the brass rod a mirror was fastened, by means of which the
rotation of the bar about its vertical axis could be read off by a
scale and telescope in the usual manner.          On the bar, below the
mirror, and in a north and south direction, was a horizontal brass
arm about 20 millims. in length, to which was attached a small
glass <U+FB02>ask <U+FB01>lled with the substance to be investigated.          In front
of this, and in an east and west direction, was a straight hori
zontal soft iron bar rounded in front and surrounded by a mag
netizing spiral, the magnetic momentum of which could be read
off in a mirror galvanometer placed in the direction of its axis.
After the magnetizing current was closed, by turning the pin
                '  From the Berliner Bericlite, June 1865.

                  Salts   of the Magnetic Metals.                    367
to which the German-silver wire was attached, a de<U+FB01>nite direc
tion could be assigned to the glass <U+FB02>ask, which was read off by
means of the mirror <U+FB01>xed to the brass rod.      The current was
then opened, and the position of the mirror again observed.
The rotation of the mirror measures the magnitude of the tor
sion in the German-silver wire which supports the apparatus,
and thus the force of magnetic attraction.
   By numerous experiments it was shown that, within the limits
of observation, this attraction is proportional to the square of
the magnetic momentum of the attracting electromagnet—that
thus,
   1. The temporary magnetic momentum of the vessel <U+FB01>lled with
various saline solutions is directly proportional to the magnetizing
power.
  An approximation to the maximum of magnetizing could not
be observed   with the magnetizing forces used.
   If  the glass vessel was <U+FB01>lled with solutions of the same salt of
different degrees of cencentration, and with solutions in differ
ent solvents (perchloride of iron in alcohol, ether, water), and,
from the temporary momentum imparted to the solution by the
magnetizing power, unit of the momentum subtracted which was
produced by the same force when the vessel was <U+FB01>lled with the
solvent alone, values were obtained which are proportional to the
weights of the salt contained in the unit of volume.
    2. The magnetic momentum of the salts dissolved in di<U+FB02>‘ercnt
solvents is directly proportional to the weights contained in the unit
of volume, and independent of the solvent.
   If   in the same way the temporary momentum of the glass
vessel when <U+FB01>lled with various aqueous saline solutions (proto
sulphate of iron, protochloride of iron, perchloride of iron, sul—
phate of nickel, sulphate of cobalt, ferricyanide of potassium)
was investigated at different temperatures, and in each case the
magnetism was subtracted 0f the vessel <U+FB01>lled with water for the
same temperature and the same magnetizing force, it was found
that,

 increasing temperature, and in the same ratio in all calls inves

                          m,= mo(1 0'003251) .
    Afact interesting in relation to the theory of magnetism   is,that
 this decrease of magnetic momentum, whose magnitude corre
 sponds to the intensity of the Ampérian molecular currents circu
 lating round the magnetic molecules,     is  not very different from
 the decrease of the conductibility of the metals for the voltaic
 current for the same changes of temperature.

   The values m, the temporary magnetic moments excited in
the unit of weight of the salts by the unit of magnetizing force,
may be designated as the speci<U+FB01>c magnetism of the salts.
   The values a in the preceding Table are obtained by multi
plying the values m by the atomic weight of the corresponding
salt.

the product of the speci<U+FB01>c magnetism into the atomic weight is con
stant, or the magnetism of each atom of these compounds is the
same.     In this respect the oxygen salts and haloid salts cor
responding to one another show the same deportment.
    The mean magnetic moments of an atom of a protosalt of
nickel, cobalt, iron, and manganese are as 142 : 313 : 387 : 468.
    5. Hence the magnetism of an atom of the cobalt salt is very
nearly the mean between the magnetisms of the atoms of salts of
nickel and manganese, %(142+468)=305.                                  In like manner the
magnetism of the atom of ferrous salts is the mean between the
magnetisms of the atoms of cobalt and manganese salts,
                        .   i (313+468)=390'5.
    The atoms of salts of different oxides of the                      same   metal have,
on the other hand, very different magnetism—thus, for instance,
the atoms of ferrous and ferric salts, whose magnetisms with
the same weight of iron are as 1 : 1'24.                          Ferric oxide obtained
in the soluble form by dialysis, as well as basic compounds of
ferric oxide with acids in which a part of it is in the same con
dition, behave like the soluble ferric oxide.
    Finally a number of solid salts were investigated.                          The mag
netic momenta m of the same weights, as well as the products p.
of the values 11:. into the atomic weights, were
                                                                   m'.          n.

    6. Hence the magnetism of the dry salts is almost the same
as the magnetism of the same salts when dissolved; the combina
tion of anhydrous salts with water of crystallization does not ma
terially alter their magnetism.
    7. From a few further experiments the insoluble salts show the
same department (phosphate and carbonate of cobalt, manganous
phosphate); so that in these salts also the product of the speci<U+FB01>c
magnetism into the atomic weight has the same value as in the
soluble salts.
   ‘  Except in the case of ammonia-ferrous sulphate, the values m refer to
the proportion of anhydrous salt.

then said to be in loco, or it is af<U+FB01>xed to some other point of

        First, if three <U+FB01>gures are in loco, these, as just seen, will be
    the <U+FB01>gures which belong to three in<U+FB02>exions in a line. Suppose
                                                                               '
    the <U+FB01>gures are 1, 2, 3; then the in<U+FB02>exion originally denoted,
    say, by the <U+FB01>gure 4 may be denoted by any one of the remain
    ing <U+FB01>gures 5, 6, 7, 8, 9; but when the <U+FB01>gure is once <U+FB01>xed upon,
    then the remaining in<U+FB01>exions can be denoted only in one manner.
    Hence when the <U+FB01>gures 1, 2, 3 remain in loco there are 5
    modes; and consequently the number of modes wherein 3 <U+FB01>gures
    remain in loco is 5 x 12, =60.
        Next, if only a single <U+FB01>gure, suppose 1, remains in loco, the
    triads which belong to the <U+FB01>gure 1 are 123, 147, 159, 168; and
    there is 1 mode in which we simultaneously interchange all the
    pairs (2, 3), (4, 7), (5, 9), (6, 8).    (Observe that the triads 123,
    147, 159, 168 here denote the same lines respectively as in the
>
   primitive denotation, the <U+FB01>gure 1 remains in loco, but the <U+FB01>gures
    belonging to the other two in<U+FB02>exions on each of the four lines
   are interchanged.)       There are, besides this, 2 modes in which
   the <U+FB01>gures (2,3), but not any other two <U+FB01>gures, are interchanged;
    similarly 2 modes in which the <U+FB01>gures (4, 7), 2 modes in which
   the <U+FB01>gures (5, 9), 2 modes in which the <U+FB01>gures (6, 8), but in
    each case no other two <U+FB01>gures, are interchanged;         this gives in
    all 1 +2+2+ 2 +2, =9 modes.               There are besides, the <U+FB01>gure
    1 still remaining in loco, 18 modes where there are no two <U+FB01>gures
    (2, 3), (4, 7), (5, 9), or (6, 8) which are interchanged:      viz., the
   <U+FB01>gure    2 may be made to denote any one of the in<U+FB02>exions origi
 '
    nally denoted by 4,5,6, 7,8, or 9. Suppose the in<U+FB02>exion originally
    denoted by 4; 3 will then denote the in<U+FB02>exion originally denoted
   by 7: it will be found that of three of the remaining six in
   <U+FB02>exions, any one may be denoted by the <U+FB01>gure 4, and that the
   scheme of denotation can then in each case be completed in one
   way only.       This gives 6 x 3, =18, as above, for the number of
   the modes in question; and we have then 9+ 18, =27, for the
   number of the modes in which the <U+FB01>gure 1 remains in loco; and
   9 x 27, =243 for the number of modes in which some one
   <U+FB01>gure remains in loco.
       Finally, if no <U+FB01>gure remains in loco, the <U+FB01>gure 1 will then
   denote some one of the in<U+FB02>exions originally denoted by 2, 3, 4,
   5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Suppose that originally denoted by 2 ; 2 cannot
   then denote the in<U+FB02>exion originally denoted by 1, for if it did,
   3 would remain in loco: 2 must therefore denote the in<U+FB02>exion
   originally denoted by 3, or else some one of the in<U+FB01>exions origi
   nally denoted by 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.     It appears, on examination, that
   in the <U+FB01>rst case there are 4 ways of completing the scheme, and
   in each of the latter cases 2 ways; there are therefore in all
   1 x 4+6 X 2, =16 ways; that
                                    B is is,
                                            16 modes in which (no <U+FB01>gure

up the total number 432 of the modes of denotation of the nine
in<U+FB01>exions.

     1. “A Theorem relating to Neutral Series."
    The theorem is as follows.       If a,--a,+n,— . . . be a convergent
 series which has the limiting form 1—1 + l — . . . , and if a, be of

    Prof. De Morgan       on  In<U+FB01>nity, and        on the Sign  ququaIily.     373
  continuous law, so that a,“ : (1, <U+FB01>nally approaches towards a limit,
  the   limit towards which the series approaches as its form approaches
  neutrality is az—az-H divided by az—az<U+FB01>.                     And this limit is
  always %. If there be in the series a cycle of laws involving an even
  number of terms, so that
            a2nz_a2nz+h  a2nz+l_a2n:+2a        v - - a2az+21|—1—a<U+FB02>uz+2n
 approach in ratio to Ice, kl, . . .k,,,_1, then the two series ao—al +a2—...

 ratio of ko+k2+ . . . +k2,,_, to kl+k3+ .. . +k2,,_|.                 But if the
 cycle have an odd number of terms, each of these series is g, just as
 if the law had been continuous. The demonstration is founded upon
 the following theorem :—lf Po-i-Pl-l- . . . and QD+QI+ . . . be di
 verging series, whether of increasing or decreasing terms, their two
 in<U+FB01>nite sums are in the <U+FB01>nal ratio of P, to Q,. Applications of this
 theorem are given to the determination of a large number of terms

     2.                                  Sign of Equality."
    The author professes himself satis<U+FB01>ed of the subjective reality of
 the notions of in<U+FB01>nitely great and in<U+FB01>nitely small. His paper, as far
 as it deals with various objections by various modes of answer, is
 not capable of abstract; but four points, on which be especially
 relies, may be stated as follows :—
     1. The concepts of the mind are divisible into imageable and un
imageable: the <U+FB01>rst can be pictured and placed before the mind's
 eye; the second cannot.          The mathematician, dealing in great part
 with imaged concepts, is apt to repel the unimageable, as if it
 could not be a legitimate object of mathematical reasoning. But all
 that is necessary to reasoning is knowledge of the connexion of sub
jects and predicates.      In<U+FB01>nite quantity is unimageablc in its relation
 to <U+FB01>nite quantity, but not therefore inconceivable, nor destitute of
known attributes. A million of cubic miles is as destitute of image
as in<U+FB01>nite space; nevertheless it is a conception the attributes of
which give known propositions.
    2. Number, or enumeration as distinguished from multitude, is a.
 concept from which no notion of in<U+FB01>nity can be gained; but much
pcrplexity has arisen from the attempt to make it a teacher of this
subject.      Abstract number has more than one affection which is de
rived from the concrete in such manner that the two abstractions,
number and its affection, cannot have their function explained ex
cepting by return to the concrete.            Such affections are the divisible
unit, on which the doctrine of fractions is founded, and the opposi
tion of positive and negative.          The representation of in<U+FB01>nite and of
in<U+FB01>nitesimal numbers is a third a<U+FB02>’ection of the numerical, which
cannot be explained on purely numerical notions.
    3. The in<U+FB01>nite is not a kind of terminus to the <U+FB01>nite, but another
status of magnitude, such that no <U+FB01>nite, however great, is anything
but an in<U+FB01>nitesimal of the in<U+FB01>nite.             And the same may be said of
each order of in<U+FB01>nity with reference to the one below it.

374              Cambridge Philosophical      Society   :—
   4. The symbol *5 the in<U+FB01>nite of common algebra, represents an
extreme of in<U+FB01>nite which can no more be attained by passage through
orders of in<U+FB01>nity, than any in<U+FB01>nite by passage from <U+FB01>nite to <U+FB01>nite.
    Each of these positions comes into con<U+FB02>ict with some of the usual
arguments for or against the introduction of in<U+FB01>nites.
    The second part of the paper is on the meaning of the sign of
equality.    Mr. De Morgan contends for the ultimate attainment of
a purely formal algebra, in which every transformation shall have
meaning and validity in every possible case.         He points out certain
dif<U+FB01>culties and inconsistencies in the ordinary use of the sign of
equality, which can, he a<U+FB02>irms, receive a consistent explanation on
the extension which he proposes. and which, to some extent, he con
siders as virtually adopted.
    His notion is that equality, strictly so called, is but a species of the
genus undistinguiahable;     and that the actual use of the sign (=)
shows a leaning to the generic de<U+FB01>nition.          Every order of in<U+FB01>nitcs
or in<U+FB01>nitesimals has its own    metre,  and the  sign (=) indicates undis
tinguishability with reference   to the  metre, which   is often in thought,
but for which no symbol is employed.          Algebraical changes may or
may not demand or permit changes in the metre.              It would be im
possible to give any further account, with justice to the subject, in
a short abstract.

    November 28.—Papers Were read by Dr. Humphry on the ques
tion, “ Is the Vertebral Theory of the Skull to be abandoned P"
    This communication was intended partly as a reply.to the opinion
expressed by Professor Huxley in his lectures on comparative             ana
tomy, that the vertebral hypothesis of the skull has been abolished
by the recent discoveries in development.         Dr. Humphry commencd
by calling attention to the Laws of Uniformity of Plan, and Variety
in Detail, which prevail throughout the animal kingdom, and, indeed,
throughout the material system, and which the recent discoveries
by the microscope have shown to rule over the ultimate structure
and formation of all the tissues of the body.         The discovery of the
illustration of these laws in the plan of cell-formation of the tissues,
and in the development of all animal and vegetable structure from
the simple cell-form, he regarded as the grandest discovery in phy
sical science that has taken place in our time. Of late years, the
attention of anatomists has been much directed to the cxempli<U+FB01>ca
tion of these laws in the vertebrate classes, to tracing the uniformity
of plan, especially in the skeleton, through the variety in detail which

       Dr. Humphry      on the Vertebral Theory     of the Skull.     375
the members of these classes exhibit.        This constitutes the branch
of anatomy called " Homology."         The general features of the plan
upon which vertebrate animals are constructed are clear enough in
all of them.    Osseous segments, or vertebrae, with neural and vis
ceral processes, enclosing respectively the neural and visceral cen
tres, constitute the trunk, including neck, chest, loins, &c.       Proba
bility is in favour of the view propounded by Goethe and Okeu, and
worked out by Oken and Owen, that the skull falls in with the Law
of Uniformity, and corresponds with the rest of the frame in having
a vertebral composition.       It is by all anatomists admitted to be
segmentally constructed.       Most anatomists are agreed as to the
number of segments.       Ought not, therefore, these segments to be
described by the same name as those of which they form a conti
nuation, especially as they bear the same relations to the neural
and visceral centres, and the same or nearly similar relations to the
nerves and blood-vessel?      In their mode of development, too, the
segments of the skull show a marked general correspondence with
those of the trunk.     The chorda dorsalis, around which the verte
bral centres are formed, extends at any rate halfway along the base
of the skull; and the bodies and arches of the cranial segments are
evolved from a continuation of the same embryonic structure (the
“ vertebral plates”) as the trunk segments—the chief difference
being that in the trunk segmentation takes place at an earlier period
than in the head.     In the trunk, it is observed in the vertebral plates;
and these primitive segments are called " protovertebraz."        They ap
pear not to exist in the head.       The segmentation, however, takes
place in the cranium as soon as ossification begins, even if it does
 not do so before ; and the signi<U+FB01>cance of the protovertebraa as dis
 tinctive features between the skull and the trunk is diminished,
 <U+FB01>rst, by their being related to the formation of the nerves as much
 or more than to that of the vertebrae; and secondly, by their not
 really corresponding    with the vertebrae, each permanent vertebra
being formed by a half of two protovertebraa.         Dr. Humphry expa
 tiated on this and other points in the development of the skull, and
 expressed his decided opinion that the differences between the deVe
 lopment of it and of the trunk vertebrae were by no means suf<U+FB01>cient
 to controvert the view—-—which coincides with the Law of Uniformity,
 and which is con<U+FB01>rmed by the segmental construction of the skull,
 by the relation of its components to surrounding parts, and by so
 many fundamental      resemblances in development—that the same
 name may he applied to the segments of the skull and of the trunk,
 and that the one, as well as the other, consists of vertebra: modi<U+FB01>ed
 to meet the requirements of the parts in which they are found.          He
 concluded by stating that the greater number of those anatomists to
 whose observations we are indebted for most of our knowledge of
 the development of the skull and of the trunk, are agreed that the
 differences between the mode of formation of the segments in the
 two form no real argument against the vertebral character of either;
 and he thought stronger reasons must be adduced than had yet been
 shown before the anatomists could be called upon to abandon the
 vertebral theory of the skull.

    and —."
        An account is given of the work on arithmetic of John Widman,
    printed in 1489, in which the signs + and — are used to denote
    more and less.     The use made is twofold: at+b signifying that b
    more than a is wanted, infers a direction to add b to a.        But a+b
    in the old rule offalse position is used to signify that the assumption
    ofa for the answer gives b too much in the solution. This last
    usage was continued by many writers through the greater part of the
    sixteenth century.
        Some account is given    of the Die Case of Chr. Rudolf, which
    passes for the <U+FB01>rst work     in which + and — are used.          The <U+FB01>rst

       From the mannner in which VVidman introduces his signs, Mr.
    De Morgan thinks there is some ground to suspect that they were
   originally warehouse marks, indicating the scale into which smaller
   weights were introduced to make the balance, when the nearest
   number of larger weights had been put in. This point and others
   require the examination of older works, print and manuscript.

       By Professor Clifton,“ Note on the Early History of the Signs +
  and    —.”
       February 27.-—Mr. Alfred Newton, M.A., F.L.S., communicated
   some " Notes on Spitzbergen,“ of which the following is an abstract.
      T he author stated that last summer he accompanied Mr. Edward
  Birkbeck on a voyage to Spitzbergen, in that gentleman's yacht, the
   ‘Sultana,’ R.S.Y.C.      After giving a slight sketch of some of the
  principal voyages which had been made to that country, be pro
  ceeded to say that the ‘ Sultana' left Hammerfest           on the 3rd of
  July, in company with a Norwegian sloop which had been specially
  <U+FB01>tted to encounter the ice, and chartered to attend upon the yacht.
  On the 6th they arrived at the entrance of Star Fjord, which was
  found to be entirely blocked by the ice.           Horn Sound and Bell
  Sound were subsequently discovered to be in the same condition.
  They then made for Ice Sound, and anchored in Safe Haven on the
  9th. Ice Sound was described as a very much larger inlet than it is
  represented in the charts to be, extending at least <U+FB01>fty miles into
  the interior.    All the valleys on the north side, and consequently
  having a southern aspect, are completely occupied by large glaciers,
- which, with one exception, are only terminated by the sea. The
  single exception consists of a small but remarkable glacier suspended
  on a hill-side, some 360 yards from the beach, resting conformably
  on its own moraine, and having no apparent means of discharge.
  The author supposes this last was effected by <U+FB01>ltration through its
  bed.     The south side of Ice Sound contains several bays of consi
  derable size; and the valleys opening upon it, and therefore having

               Mr. A. Newton’s Notes       on Spilzbcrgen.           377
 a nonhern aspect, were entirely free from glaciers; the observa
 tion being directly opposed to the account given of the Spitzbergen
 glaciers by Sir John Richardson in his ‘ Polar Regions.’         A great
 many reindeer frequent this part of the country, and countless numbers
 of sea-fowl breed on such of the high cli<U+FB01>'s around the Sound as are
 inaccessible to the Arctic foxes. In Ice Sound Mr. Birkbeck’s party
 had the pleasure of meeting the Swedish Scienti<U+FB01>c
                                                        Expedition under
 Professor Nordenskjold, who are engaged in measuring an arc of the
 meridian.    On the 4th of August the party separated, some going
 to the eastward in the Norwegian sloop, while the yacht made an
 other ine<U+FB01>’ectual attempt to ascend the Stor Fjord.      The sloop sailed
 as far as Ryklis Islands, but was stopped by the ice.      She then pro
 ceeded further east in the hope of getting round the pack, and came
 in sight of “ Commander Gile’s land," the existence of which had
 been so long doubted, it having been ignored by Sir John Richard~
 son in his work, and in the Admiralty Chart of Spitzbergen.            It
 appears to lie about sixty miles east of the entrance to Walter Thy
 men’s Strait, and its <U+FB02>at or round-topped hills
                                                 (so different from those
of Spitzbergen) were very plainly seen. The author stated that in
 1859 the master of a Norwegian vessel landed upon        it, and he pro
duced a pebble which had then been brought thence, in proof of the
reality of its existence as land, and not either ice or fog-bank.      He
then proceeded to remark on the driftwood with which the shores of
the "Thousand Islands" are strewn, which he believed to be cer
tainly of Siberian origin, and not brought, as sometimes imagined,
by the Gulf-stream,—stating that though often worm-eaten, he had
never observed any signs of barnacles upon it. He then commented
on the discovery of the passage from the top of Stor Fjord to Hin
lopen Strait, of which there had long been a traditionary knowledge,
though  it was not effected till 1859; and showed, from the Swedish
surveys in 1861, that this passage must lie some thirty miles further

a  new Arctic expedition.

       " Additional Observations on the Raised Beach of Sangatte,
with reference to the date of the English Channel, and the presence
of Loess in the Cliff-section."     By Joseph Prestwich, Esq., F.R..S.,
Treas. G.S.
    In his paper on the Loess and Quaternary beds of the North of
France and South-east of England, Mr. Prestwich expressed an
opinion that the break in the land between France and England
was not the result of the last geological change, but that the channel
existed at the period of the formation of the Low-level gravels of the
Somme and Thames Valleys, and probably at that of the High-level
gravels. During a recent visit to the Sangatte Raised Beach, the
author recognized fragments of chert in the shingle and associated
sands, which he inferred were derived from the Lower Cretaceous
strata; associated with them were fragments from the Oolitie series
of the Boulonnais and two pebbles of red granite, probably from the
 Cotentin.
   These facts seemed to the author to add much probability to the
existence of a channel open to the westward, and extending between
France and England, anterior to the Low- and possibly to the
High-level Valley-gravel period.       Above the raised beach occurs a
mass of chalk- and <U+FB02>int-rubble, with beds of loam, from 20 to 80 feet
thick, and containing Land-shells.       Mr. Prestwich considered this
 accumulation analogous to the Loess, which it resembles in general

that deposit.
  2.   “ On   the Super<U+FB01>cial Deposits of the Valley of the Medway,
with Remarks on the Denudation of the \Vcald."          By C. Le Neve
Foster, Esq., B.A., B.Sc.. F.G.S., and William 'l‘opley, Esq., F.G.S.,
of the Geological Survey of Great Britain.
   In the <U+FB01>rst part of the paper the authors gave a description of
the super<U+FB01>cial deposits of the valley of the Medway. They showed
that deposits of river-gravel and brick-earth (loess) occur at various
heights up to 300 feet above the level of the river. A detailed
account was given of the “ pipes” at Maidstone, where brick-earth
(loess), containing land and freshwater shells and mammalian re
mains, has been let down into deep cavities in the Kentish Rag,
probably by the gradual dissolving away of the limestone by the
action of rain-water containing carbonic acid.      Several interesting
cases of disturbed gravel were mentioned.
   The second part of the paper was intended mainly to show what
light is thrown upon the theory of the denudation of the Weald by
a study of the super<U+FB01>cial deposits.     After a brief account of pre
vious theories, with objections to the theory of fracture and the
marine theory, the authors endeavoured to prove that the gravel and
brick-earth (loess) occurring at a very great height above the level of
the Medway are old alluvia of that river.     If this point be granted,
it follows that so large a denudation has been effected by atmo
spheric agencies,     e. rain and rivers, that, in the opinion of the
                    2'.
authors, there will be little dif<U+FB01>culty in supposing the present in
equalities of surface in the Weald to have been produced by these
agents acting on a comparatively plane surface of marine denuda
tion.    A discussion as to the origin of Escarpments then follows.
The authors considered that the Escarpments of the Chalk and Lower
 Greensand which surround the Weald are not sca-cli<U+FB01>s, but are due
to the difference of waste of the hard and soft formations under                    '
atmospheric denudation.

  l. “ Note on Ovist moschatus, Blainville.”                  By M. E. Lartét,
For. Mem. G.S.     Translated by the late H. Christy, Esq.,               F.R.S.,
F.G.S.
  A  hoof phalange found by Mr. Christy and the author at one of
their stations in the Gorge d’Enfer was stated to be identical in
form and dimensions with the corresponding bone of the existing
Ovibos moschatus, to which species M. Lartét therefore referred it.
With   it  were found remains of Ursus spelreus, Felis spelwa, Wolf,
Reindeer, and Aurochs, as well as worked <U+FB01>ints differing from those
found in any other of the Dordogne caves.      The author remarked
that the Gorge d’Enfer     the most southern locality at which re

      2. “ On    some Additional Fossils from the Lingula-<U+FB02>ags."    By
 J. W.     Salter, Esq., F.G.S.   With a Note on the Genus Anopo
  loans; by Henry Hicks, Esq., M.R.C.S.
      In a recent paper Mr. Salter described the new genus Anopolenus
 as a blind Trilobite allied to Paradozides, without facial sutures or
 head-spines,     and with truncate body-segments not produced into
 spinous appendages, as in most of its congeners.     The remains of a
 new species, provided with extraordinary free cheeks, have proved
 that this conclusion was founded upon a part only of the head and of
 the body of the animal. which now appears to be more truly inter
 mediate between Paradoxides and Olenus than was before supposed,
 while at the same time it presents characters opposed to those of
 either genus.
     Mr. Hicks gave a full description of the genus as now known,
 and of the new species, which he called Anopalenus Salteri.     From
 his description it appears that Anopolcnus possessed minute eyes, a
 facial suture, and expanded pleurae, but that their arrangement was
 abnormal.
     In conclusion Mr. Salter compared the two species of Anopolcnus
 now known, stating that the one <U+FB01>rst described, without the more
 anterior of the two segments which compose the head, was to all
 appearance a perfect 'I‘rilobite.    He also gave a <U+FB01>gure of a new
 species of Cleans-O. pecten.
     3.  “ On the Discovery of     a New   Genus of Cirripedia in the
 ‘Wenlock Shale of Dudley.I ”       By Henry \Voodward, Esq., F.G.S.
    The attention of the author having been called to two species of
 C/u'lon described M. de Koninck from the \Venloek Shale, he found
 one of them (Chilon Wriglztianus) to he a Cirripcde.       He stated
 that the distinctive characters of ()hiton are :—(l) The valves never
 exceed eight in number; (2) the series is always unilinear; (3) the
 valves are always symmetrical, and divided into three areas.     The
 species mentioned does not, however, conform to any of these
 characters, as it had probably as many as four rows of unsymmetrical
plates, having no apophyses, a uniformly sculptured surface, and not
divided into three areas; each series exceeded eight in number.
    Mr. \Voodward then endeavoured to show that C/n'lon lVriglili
anus was really a Cirripede, and formed the type of a new genus, to
which he gave the name Turrilepas.
    4. “ On some new species of Euteryprida."        By Henry \Vood
ward, Esq., F.G.S.
    In his Advanced Text-book of Geology, Mr. Page <U+FB01>gured and
named the only known species (S. Powrici) of his new genus Slylo
nurus, but gave no description of it.    Mr. Woodward now described
the species in detail. from specimens found near Pitscnndly, in the
Turin Hill Range, Forfarshire; he also gave a description of a new
species (S. Scolicus) found in an Old Red Sandstone quarry in Mon
troman Muir, near the Forfar and Montrose Pike.        Mr. Salter has

     On the Carboniferous Rocks of the Valley of Kashmere.        381
expressed an opinion that S. Powriei is a full-grown male, and
S. Scoticus a young female of the same species; but Mr. Woodward
observed that if the sexes are not to be determined by the thoracic
plates, but by more general characters, then thetwo forms of plates
in Slimonia indicate two species of females, and the two forms in
Plerygotus minor ought to indicate two species of males.
   5. “ On a new genus of Eurypterida from the Lower Ludlow
Rocks of Leintwardine, Shropshire.”       By Henry \Voodward, Esq.,
F.G.S.
   In this  paper  Mr. Woodward described a Crustacean alluded to by
 Mr. Salter in    the ‘ Annals and Magazine of Natural History' for
1857, under the MS. name of Limuloidos.         It appears to form a
connecting link between the Xipkosura and the Eurypterida, but it
differs from the former in not having a cephalothorax—the cephalic,
thoracic, and abdominal divisions being distinct, and apparently
capable of separate <U+FB02>exure ; and from the latter in having only three
thoracic segments, &c.       The name Limuloides not being allowable
as a generic appellation, the author applied it to the species, using
the generic term Hemiaspz's.

 F.G.S. Communicated by R. A. C. Godwin-Austen, Esq., F.R.S.,
 F.G.S.
    This  paper was a continuation of one read before the Society last
 year,  in which the Carboniferous, Jurassic, and Post-tertiary de
 posits and fossils were described by Capt. Godwin-Austen, Mr.
 Davidson, and Mr. Etheridge.       In this communication Capt. God
 win-Austen con<U+FB01>ned himself to the Carboniferous formation, which
 was shown by him to have, in the Valley of Kashmere, a thickness
 of more than 1500 feet.      The upper portion of this mass contained
 but few fossils, except in one particular bed near the entrance of the
 ravine above the village of Khoonmoo; but the lowest portion, or
 Zéwan bed, is made up chie<U+FB02>y of the remains of Brachiopoda and
 Bryozoa; and a higher stage, though still near the base of the
 formation, contains abundant remains of Producti.      The position of
 a limestone containing Goniatites is not very clearly determined,
 but it is probably a member of the Zéwan series.
    The sections in which the relative positions of the different beds
 were exhibited were described in detail, and plans and a map were
 given showing their geographical relation.
    Mr. Davidson described the Brachiopoda forwarded with the
 paper, stating that they abound particularly at Barns and Khoon
 moo, but are rarely in a very good state of preservation.      Among
 them are several common and wide-spread European and American

species, with a few that have not hitherto been noticed.              They ap
pear to be of Lower Carboniferous age.
    In the Introduction Mr. Godwin-Austen gave a synopsis of the
more remarkable facts brought forward in the paper, and in a Ré
sumé he gave lists of the fossils which had as yet been determined.
These were forty-seven in number, forty-two of which had speci<U+FB01>c
names, and twenty-two of which are well-known forms; eight are
common to the Punjaub and Kashmere, seven of them being also
European species.         Of_'_the Kashmere
                                                list, full half the species are
found in British Carboniferous beds; and Mr. Godwin-Austen re
marked on the support given to the notion of the approximate con
temporaneity of distant formations containing the same fossils byzthe
occurrence of these European Lower Carboniferous species near the
base of the Carboniferous formation of Kashmere.

Richmond, Yorkshire.”            By W. Boyd Dawkins, Esq., B.A., F.G.S.
\Vith an Introductory Note on the Deposit in which they were
found. By E. Wood, Esq., F.G.S., and G. E. Roberts, Esq.,
F.G.S.
    These mammalian remains were discovered last autumn on a
terrace of blue clay, mixed with limestone debris, about 130 feet
above the north bank of the River Swale, during excavations for a
new sewer.       The deposit was stated by Mr. Dawkins to be a heap
of kitchen-refuse; and the great majority of the bones, except the
solid and marrowless, are consequently broken, while not one of the
numerous skulls is perfect.           The collection contained bones of the
following species :—Ursus         arctos, Canisfamiliaris, Sus scrqfa, Horse,
 Cervus Elaplzus, Cervus llama, Bos longifrons, Bos brachyceros, Ovis
Aries, Capra mgagrus, and the horn-cores of a third form of goat,
which appeared to be the Egoceros Caucasian, which had also been
found by Mr. Dawkins and Mr. Sanford in a bone-cavern explored
by them in l863.         In a note to Mr. Dawkins, M. Lartét expressed
his opinion that these horn-cores belonged to some of the diversi<U+FB01>ed
forms that are the result of hybridity, and stated that they resembled
 some found in a bone-cave in the Pyrenees, which appeared to belong
to a hybrid between the goat and the Bouquetin.

         ON THE DEPORTMENT OF             T‘vVO   SALTS   IN SOLUTION
                                 BY E. GERLAND.
      CCORDING        to Berthollet, whenever two salts are dissolved, four
        salts are formed out of them, inasmuch as each acid unites with
 each base.     This law has recently received an important con<U+FB01>rma
 tion from Graham's researches on liquid diffusion. He found in the
 case of mixtures of chloride of potassium and sulphate of soda, and
 of sulphate of potash and chloride of sodium, that the difusion qfthe
 metals is not limited by the acids with which they are united.
    The validity of Berthollet’s law may be further tested by investi

                        Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                                           383

  as Graham used.     For Wiillner has found that the diminution of the
 tension of the vapour for each salt and each mixture of two salts,
 even when, from being salts of the same acid or the same base, they
 do not act chemically upon each other, is a special function of the
 temperature.     Hence               if,

 formed, the diminutions of the tensions must be the same, whatever
 be the compound in which the two acids and bases are brought into
 solution.                                                                      ‘

 by which the mercury in both limbs can be kept at the same level.
 From the position of the manometer, and the difference in the levels
 of the mercury in the two legs of the barometer, the tension of the
 vapour can be determined.        The heating of the barometer was
 effected in    transparent water-bath. -

    The author used two solutions of salts mixed in equivalent quanti
 ties (the salts being dry); one of these solutions was as saturated as
 possible (in the case of sulphate of potash not above 10 per cent.),

    The author concludes from the values which he obtained, about
 thirty in each case, between 12° and 96°,—
    1. That the tension of the vapour of solutions which are prepared
 with salts mixed in equivalent proportions        the same, provided the is
 constituents of the salts are the same.
    2. That the diminutions of tensions in the mixtures belonging to
 each other, as also in the case of simple salts, increase proportionally
 to the percentage amount calculated according to the <U+FB01>rst salt-mixture.

    In order to obtain an interpolation formula for the diminutions
observed, and to represent it in its dependence on the temperature,
the diminutions of the tension was considered to be dependent on the
latter.   It was found that the three mixtures of salts, at all degrees
of temperature, diminish the tension of the vapour in the same pro
portion, so that if   V:    the diminution, T= the tension of vapour in
pressures   of millimetres of mercury,   v=aT, and           = invariable

(as Wiillner had already found).        Thus, for instance, for
 lKSO‘+0-6031NaCl          and  O'8351NaSO‘+ 0'768 KCl, V =0'00574 T.
   The values given above are calculated by these formulae ; they
do not diverge from the observed ones by more than the ordinary
errors of experiment.
   Two salt-mixtures of the same constituents, which contain them
in equivalent proportions, diminish the tension in quite the same
manner; hence the correctness of Berthollet's law is proved.          For
if the four salts were not formed, the diminution could not be
the same, seeing that different salts act di<U+FB01>'erently on the tension.
But if they are formed, each two of the four salts have the
same acids in the same metals, and in each mixture 9. composi
tion of the two salts is possible in four ways. But the diminu
tion by two such salts is not equal to the sum of the diminutions by
the individual salts.      Hence equality of diminution can only occur
if the substances, of which there are equal quantities in both solu
tions, are present in the solution in the form prescribed by Berthol
let's law.
    The law propounded by Wiillner, that the diminution by two salts
in solution is not equal to the sum of the diminutions of the indivi
dual salts, is con<U+FB01>rmed by the experiments adduced.            For if the
diminutions for the individual salts of the four in solution are cal
culated, there is obtained from the diminutions given by Willner for
 1 per cent of the salt taken,

     ON THE GENERAL        sxrsrsxcs or comm in run ANIMAL
                      KINGDOM.       BY 0. L. ULEK*.
   In the blood of the lower animals, especially the Mollusca, the
existence of copper has been an established fact for some years.        In
the higher animals it has been but little sought for; and when it has,
mostly none has been found.        Thus in 1853, Wackenroder was un
able to detect either copper or lead in the blood of the ox, the sheep,
or the fowl; but he found it in the blood of the duck.
   In the human blood and muscles the existence of copper has been
as often asserted as denied: the details of this question are given
in Liebig and Kopp’s Jaln-csbcriclil for 1847 and 1848.

  '
     Hence, when I commenced my investigations, the existence of
copper in the blood appeared to be an accidental occurrence, void of
physiological importance; which view derived support from the fact
that copper had been repeatedly found in the human bile, in gall
stones, and in the liver, which especially accumulates metals foreign
and injurious to the body.
      In my experiments, about 800 to 1500 grains of the muscular
substances and other soft parts of vertebrate animals, and 15 to 250
grains of those of the invertebrate animals were used. The substances,
which were coarsely minced when necessary, were incinerated in a
platinum dish over a Bunsen’s gas-burner.         The reduction to ash is
dif<U+FB01>cult and tedious, but indispensable for the certain detection of the
copper; for so long as unburnt carbon is present, this retains not
only the copper but also the iron, so that these metals are not acted
upon by the muriatic acid for instance.        The combustion of the car
bon may, however, be promoted by exhaustion with boiling water,
 which removes the soluble salts.         The <U+FB01>ltered solution contains
phosphoric acid. alkaline chlorides and sulphurets, but no copper, and
 may therefore be disregarded.      The <U+FB01>lter with the carbon is dried,
 the latter separated from the <U+FB01>lter, and perfectly incinerated. The
 copper exists in the ash as oxide.      It is moistened with a little hy
 drochloric acid, gently warmed, a little water added, <U+FB01>ltered, and
 washed. The perfectly clear liquid is treated with solution of sul
 phuretted hydrogen. If it becomes brownish, or even yellowish, we
 may be sure that copper is present; but it frequently becomes blackish
 brown or even brownish black.         The liquid is set aside in a warm
 place for some hours, when a brown or black deposit is formed,
 which is <U+FB01>ltered and washed.      The very small <U+FB01>lter with the preci
 pitate is dried and incinerated. The ash warmed with a drop or two
 of hydrochloric acid gives with ammonia a blue solution. More con
 clusive evidence is afforded by reducing the ash on charcoal with
  soda by the blowpipe, triturating the incinerated mass in an agate
 mortar with water, and pouring o<U+FB02>’ the carbonaceous particles,when
  spangles of copper are left behind.      Not unfrequently the spangles
  are metallic grey or yellowish grey instead of red; in this case lead
  is precipitated and reduced with the copper, and obscures its red
  colour.
       Copper was detected in the following classes of animals :—
       Mammalia.— In the human urine and faeces with lead-and hence,
   as was found by experiment, in the <U+FB02>esh and blood.          In the sto
   mach and intestines of a European and of a Canadian lynx copper
    was found.   Also in those of the Lesser and Red Coatimondi(Nasua
   mezicana and rufa); in those of the Chetah (Cynailurus gutlata);
   those of Canis cancrivorus ; repeatedly in horse<U+FB02>esh, and the <U+FB02>esh of
    the ox.
       To determine whether the copper existed in the soluble portions
    of ox-<U+FB02>esh or in the insoluble tissues, Liebig's extract of <U+FB02>esh was
    used; and in this it was detected, as also in boiled ox-<U+FB02>esh.
       Birds.—Copper was found in the <U+FB02>esh of the breast of the teal;
    in the yelk of a henfs egg, as also in the white, but in far less
                               I

     Amphibia.—ln the geometric tortoise; in the common lizard, lead
 being also present in greater quantity than that of the copper; in
 that of the common adder; and in the brown frog.
     Fiskes.—In the eel and in the haddock, the former containing the
 largest quantity.
     Crustacea.-In the common shrimp, copper was found in abun
 dance. A Scolopendra italica left 1'52 gr. of ash, containing '015 gr.
 of copper.
    Insects—2314 grs. of Spanish <U+FB02>ies left 12'65 grs. of ash, contain
 ing '0092 gr. of copper.
    Arachnida.—Copper was found in the ash of two South American
 bird-catching spiders.
    Annulata.—ll<U+FB01>7 grs. of fresh earthworm gave 163'5 gr. of ash
 ( with  a considerable   quantity of earth), containing '003 gr. of
 copper.
    Among the Echinodermata, copper was detected in two small star
 <U+FB01>shes (Asterias rubens); among the Entozoa, in two round worms;
 among the Polypi, in a sea-anemone (Tealia crassicornis), and in a
 sponge.
     Copper was thus found in animals whenever it was searched for.
 As animals live in part directly and in part indirectly upon plants,
 it follows that it must occur in all plants; and as plants derive their
contents from the soil or from sea-water, copper must be generally
diffused through both of these media.        John and Meissner proved
the existence of copper in the ashes of plants more than <U+FB01>fty years
ago, while Sarzeau detected it in more than two hundred plants, and
searched in vain for plants free from it.     This result has been more
recently con<U+FB01>rmed and extended by Commaille.            Copper has been
repeatedly detected in soils, while Durocher and Malaguti, as also
Field and Piesse, have found it in sea-water.
SPECULATIONS UPON A POSSIBLE METHOD OF DETERMINING                  THE
    DISTANCE OF CERTAIN VARIABLY COLOURED STARS.                      BY
    JOSEPH WHARTON.                                 ‘
    Arago conceived the idea of testing the correctness of the corpus
cular or emission theory of light by subjecting two rays of different
velocities to the same refracting in<U+FB02>uence; for, as that theory ex
plained the refraction to be due to retardation of velocity caused by
the molecular attraction of the refracting medium, rays entering the
medium at different velocities should be differently refracted.       To
get rays of different velocities, he took light from a star toward which
the earth in its orbit was moving, and from another star which the
earth was moving away from.            Supposing the ray to strike the
earth from the <U+FB01>rst of these stars at the real velocity of light plus
the velocity of the earth, and that from the other at the real velocity
of light minus that of the earth, Arago had two rays entering his
refractor at velocities differing by about              Arago found no
difference in the refraction of his two rays, and his conclusion thence
derived that the corpuscular theory of light is untenable, has been

                   Intelligence and Miscellaneous Arlicles.            387
   generally accepted, this experiment having in fact been frequently
   quoted as one of the props of the adverse or nndulatory theory.
       It seems, however, rather surprising that any great weight should
   be attached to an apparent disproval, by a single test, of one merely
   imaginary function of corpuscular light, especially as the test itself
   is utterly fallacious; for who shall say that retardation by attraction
   is the only possible means by which emitted light could be refracted P
   and how can we know that the two stars selected by Arago had
  either no proper motion of their own, or none of a sort to affect his
  result P
      Perhaps the only cases in which we can be sure of receiving star
  light of absolutely different velocities are those of such binary stars
  the plane of whose orbit is not at right angles with the line from
  thence to the earth.       When that line lies in the plane of such an
  orbit, and the two stars are situated at right angles to that line, it
  is clear that the velocity of the rays reaching us from one star ex
  ceeds that of the rays from the other by double the speed of those
 stars in their orbit. That light reaches us at various velocities from
  all the various stars is of course as certain as that they have proper
  motions, or that our solar system is moving through space; but the
 dif<U+FB01>culties in the way of gaining any accurate comparison of those
  velocities are very great.
      In re<U+FB02>ecting upon the undulatory theory of light, I have been
 quite unable to conceive how the luminiferous asther could " tremble
 laterally," as the phrase is, causing vibrations transverse to the line
 of propagation, without a direct relation existing between those
 lateral vibrations and the forward impulses by which the phenomena
 of light are translated.     The zether being continuous and material
 and elastic, being, in a word, capable of sustaining a vibration, a
 vibratory impulse in it at right angles to the course of a ray of light
 seems fairly comparable to a lateral displacement       of a point in a
rope, or to the merely vertical vibration in a water-wave not of trans
 lation, or to the vibration of air by a sound, all of which vibrations
 produce (we may almost say are) longitudinal undulations.
     But if the lateral vibrations of the nether produce the onward pro
 pagation of the ray, then the number of lateral impulses in a second
 equals the number of forward impulses arriving in a second at a
relatively stationary point; and as it is established that the number
of lateral impulses varies according to the colour of the light, so the
number of forward impulses striking a relatively stationary point
(say a retina):must vary with the colour of the light ; and if the source
of light, instead of being at a constant distance, should rapidly ap
proach the retina, the latter must receive a greater number of
impulses per second, and its impression of colour therefore must be
correspondingly modi<U+FB01>ed.         If the retina and the source of light
rapidly separate from each other, the number of impulses striking
the retina must on the other hand be diminished, producing the cor
responding change in the perceived colour.
     Now if we imagine a star emitting white light to approach us in
an orbital movement at a suf<U+FB01>cient rate of speed, its light should
                                   2 C 2

appear to us reddish, changing at the perigee into white, changing
again into bluish as the star departs, and again into white at the
apogee.     There are, however, variable stars whose colours undergo
exactly those changes, viz. passing from one colour to its comple
mentary, and back again, with periods of white light intervening.
The binary stars, whose colours are frequently complementary to
each other, should, under the proper circumstances, exhibit the same
circuit of change ; but I am not prepared to say that they do so in any
case: it is in fact asserted. that the larger star is usually red and the
 smaller one blue.
     Supposing this train of thought to be sound, and that by extremely
 careful observation a. difference could be detected in the position of a
 variably coloured star when it appears red, from its position when
 blue, we should then be upon the track to calculate its distance.
 We should need to know the differing rates of light-impulses re—
 quired to produce the observed colours, the time occupied by the
 star in passing from one extremity of its course to the other, and the
 angular distance between those extreme positions.         Let us assume
 that such a variably coloured star has been found, which has a mea
 surable change of position in one line—in other words, the plane of
 whose orbit coincides with our line of vision; and let us assume that
  its extreme colours indicate a difference in the rate of arrival of light
  impulses (or in other words, a difference in the velocity of' the light
  arriving from that star at the two periods) equal to 2v: then the
 actual speed of the star in its orbit    =0;   and as the orbital period of
                                                   v x t _
 the star has been found   =t,   it   follows that        is the real length
                                                   31416
 of that diameter which is the measured angular distance between
 the two extreme positions of the star.  Knowing the angle and the
 length  of the base which subtends     we   it,
                                           have the distance of the
 star.
   If    pair of binary stars could be found whose colours alternate,
         a
 and which alternately eclipse each other, the matter would be sim
 pli<U+FB01>ed by so much as accurate measurement of the angle of parallax
 would be facilitated.
     Should  itbe objected that no such binary stars have been observed,
 and that no change of position has been noticed in any single stars
 of variable colour, can only reply that possibly
                       I                                  may be worth

 while to direct attention to those points.
     Should  it  be said that this hypothesis of the cause of variable
 colour in stars would oblige us to believe that rays of different
  colours are propagated at different velocities, and that this whole
  suggestion  is valueless until those velocities have been determined
  by direct experiment,    Ianswer that very probably rays of di<U+FB01>'erent
  colours have different velocities, and that to determine them would
  be a most important achievement.
     To conclude, offer the analogy of the changing tone of
                   I                                                loco

ON THE ACTION OF LIGHT               UPON SULPIIIDE      0F LEAD, AND ITS
     BEARING UPON THE PRESERVATION OF PAINTINGS IN PICTURE
     GALLERIES.          BY DR. I). 8. PRICE*.
     The author’s attention was directed to this subject by observing
 that in the cases in the South Kensington Museum, which are
 painted with white lead, substances which emitted                 sulphurous
 vapours did not cause a darkening of the surface of the case, except
 ing where it was protected from the direct in<U+FB02>uence of light.               A
 number of experiments were then tried as to the action of light upon
 sulphide of lead produced by the action of sulphuretted hydrogen
 upon lead paint. A board painted white with white-lead was ex
 posed for several hours to the action of sulphuretted hydrogen, until
 the surface had acquired a uniform brown colour.               Plates of glass
 of different colours were then placed upon the painted surface, one
  portion being at the same time covered with an opake medium, and
  another left entirely exposed.         The board was then placed facing
  the light.      The glasses employed were red, blue, yellow (silver),
  violet, and smoke-colour glass.         The results exhibited were after an
  exposure of eight days, and showed that the parts of the board
  directly exposed to light were bleached ; those protected by an
  opake medium were not acted upon; while with the glasses of dif
  ferent colours intermediate effects were produced, those of the violet
  glass being most decided.           Drying-oils in conjunction with light
   rapidly bleach sulphide of lead, and boiled oil effects the bleaching
   still more rapidly. When water-colouris used bleaching takes place,
   but much more slowly than in the case of oil. After quoting autho
   rities, stating that generally light was advantageous to the preser
   vation of pictures, Dr. Price showed a striking illustration of this
   fact.     He had a picture painted, and then exposed it to the action of
   sulphuretted hydrogen, until it became sadly discoloured, and to all
   appearance destroyed.         Some strips of paper were laid across the
   picture    so as to cover  some parts. The picture, thus partially covered,
   was exposed to light for a long time.           The result, as shown at the
    Meeting, was very curious indeed—the parts of the picture eXposed
    being perfectly restored, while those protected by the paper remained
    still discoloured. From his experiments he came to the conclusion
   that it was advantageous to have picture-galleries well lighted, espe
    cially where, as in towns, the atmosphere was charged with sulphur
    compounds,       and that it was quite a mistake to have curtains placed
    in front of pictures with a view to their protection. In the course
    of his communication, Dr. Price referred to the use of zinc paint for

       USE OF MAGNESIUM as ELECTROMOTOR METAL 1N                     vomarc
                         ELEMENTS.     BY M. BULTINCK.
       Having observed the great oxidability of magnesium as compared
   with other electromotor metals, I supposed it might be used advan
   tageously in place of a less oxidizable metal.              I made the experi
   ment with amultiplier, taking as standard of comparison copper and
   zinc in pure distilled water, andl have had the following result.
       Taking on the one hand two wires, one of zinc and the other of
  copper, and connecting both with a multiplier, and then immersing
  them simultaneously in distilled water, I obtained at the moment of
  immersion a de<U+FB02>ection of 30°, and after <U+FB01>ve minutes the needle
  stopped at 10°.      On the other hand, with two wires of magnesium
  and silver respectively,     and of absolutely the same dimensions            as
  those of the wires of copper and zinc, I obtained at the moment of
  immersion a de<U+FB02>ection of 90°, and after <U+FB01>ve minutes' immersion the
  needle stopped at 28°, showing a difference of 60° in favour of mag
  nesium and silver over zinc and copper.
      This <U+FB01>rst result inspired the desire of having a voltaic element
  with magnesium instead of zinc ; but as I had only a. little of this
 metal in the shape of <U+FB01>ne wire, it was limited to making a voltaic
 chain, which, spite of its smallness, has given surprising results. It
 is constructed as follows :—                                >
      It consists of three pieces-a small piece of caoutcbouc 14 millims.
 in length and 4 millims. broad by 3 millims. thick, 9. magnesium wire
 35 millims. in length, and a silver wire of the same dimensions as
 the magnesium wire.         The magnesium and the silver wire are folded
 upon themselves in two equal parts; then each wire thus folded is
 put astride one of the ends of the piece of caoutchouc, but so that
 one (the magnesium,        for instance) is across the breadth and the
 other across the thickness, and that the part which forms the fold
 projects su<U+FB02>iciently to serve as ring. The whole is well <U+FB01>xed by
 means of a double knot of silk thread.
     Twenty such elements joined form the chain. As regards the
 e<U+FB01>'ects, by placing the chain in water without any addition of salt
 or acid, all the effects possible with a Pulvermacher's chain are ob
tained—the only difference being that Pulvermacher‘s chain must be
immersed in acidulated or saline water.             By the use of magnesium
& galvanic current can thus be formed without the use of any acid
01' salt.—Comptes      Rendus, October 9, 1865.

being placed on a somewhat inclined plane, the slit of the telescope

NOTE      ON THE VELOCITY OF SOUND, AND ON THE MECHANICAL
     ENERGY 0F CHEMI'CAL ACTIONS.            BY DR. SCHRODER, VAN DER
     KOLK.
       DEAR Sm,                                Zutphen, August 17, 1865.
     I ee from the July Number of the Philosophical Magazine that
you have done me the honour to translate into English my paper
on the Velocity of Sound, for which I beg to thank you.              Since,
however,     a few misprints occur_ in the German version, in the
formula as well as in the text, page 3, I take the liberty of sending
you a corrected copy. In the case of the three mistakes which you
have yourself noticed, you are perfectly right: they were clerical
errors in the manuscript, but fortunately they do not affect the result.
 I sent the calculation of the Mechanical Equivalent to Poggendorff as
early as February, but it has not yet appeared.        The value found is
42210, which agrees pretty well with Joule’s number.
     lam also greatly indebted to you for your remarks upon my paper
 “ On the Mechanical Energy of Chemical Actions."            Your remarks
on page 273 in regard to phosphorus,         and on page 276 about the
oxide of copper, are correct.         With regard to oil of turpentine, I
must, however, observe that I did not by any means assert that it
remains unaltered; but, as I had read somewhere or other that such
was the case, I was wishful to anticipate the objection that in this
 instance a body pass'ed of itself into a higher state of energy, and
 left it an open question whether it was so or not. If it is altered,
so much the better.        On page 278 you ask why should silver impart
 more heat to the water than porcelain would do P I never said that
 it would; porcelain, however, would not ful<U+FB01>l the second condition,
 namely, acting differently on the constituents of the water. On the
 other hand, a body must satisfy both conditions in order to decom
 pose the water.        Your remark on page 280 is quite correct; I ought
 to have added that I here used the expressions stronger and weaker
 base, as well as greater and less af<U+FB01>nity, in the sense which they
  bear in common language; for in what follows I point out the inad
  missible character of these distinctions, as well as the dif<U+FB01>culty there
  is'in giving a correct de<U+FB01>nition of them.

   As you have studied my paper so accurately, I was unwilling to
omit communicating to you the above, from which you will have
seen that in reality I am perfectly at one with you.
   [have since found some additional applications of this theorem
which I hope shortly to publish.             Amongst others, Rose observes
(Pogg. Ann., vol. ciii. p. 311) that some minerals, for instance
Gadolinite, when heated to a certain temperature, begin suddenly to
        .      I                        0
glow in consequence of heat being set free. When they are heated
again, after being cooled, this glowing is not repeated.            He discusses
the question whether this could be connected with a change of spe
ci<U+FB01>c heat; but evidently it is nothing but a transition from a state
of more to a state of less energy.            Perhaps, however, we may con
clude from this that this substance could not have been formed by
<U+FB01>re, at least not if it occurs in nature at the surface, but that it is
rather of Neptunian origin.

            LVI.  Professor HELMHOLTZ      on  Ice and Glaciers.
      To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,
      HAVE been recently favoured by Professor Helmholtz with
                              “
       a brochure entitled      Popular Scienti<U+FB01>c Lectures,” from
 the preface of which I learn with great satisfaction that other
 discourses, of a cast similar to those here placed before the public,
 may be expected to follow.      The present pamphlet contains four
 lectures,—-the first, “ On the Relation of the Natural Sciences to
 Science in general ;” the second, “On Goethe’s labours in Natural
 Science,” the third, “ On the Physiological Origin of Musical
 Harmony ;” and the fourth,
                                  “ On Ice and Glaciers.” The pam
 phlet is in German, and it is much to be desired that some com
 petent person should undertake its translation into English.
    I turned with natural interest to the last-mentioned discourse
 to see how my notions and experiments on the formation and
 motion of glaciers were regarded by so eminent a man.           And as
it can hardly be doubted that the subject will also interest many
of the readers of the Philosophical Magazine, I will here endea
vour to give a summary of the scienti<U+FB01>c portion of the lecture.
    Professor Helmholtz refers the cold of the upper regions of
the atmosphere to the causes generally assigned ; but he adds a
remark important at the present moment, when the origin of the
hot wind called Fiihn in Switzerland is the subject of so much
discussion.    This wind, as Helmholtz justly observes, may not
only be a cold wind upon the mountain summits, but a met one.
It is deprived of its moisture upon the heights, and it is warmed
by its subsequent fall into the valleys.    The heat and dryness of

the Fohn are therefore no proof that its origin is Sahara, and not
the Atlantic Ocean.
   It will probably be remembered that I deduced the formation
of glaciers, and their subsequent motion through valleys of vary
ing width and <U+FB01>exure, from the fact that when two pieces of ice
are pressed together they freeze together at their places of con
tact.    This fact was <U+FB01>rst mentioned to me verbally by its dis
coverer, Mr. Faraday.      Soon afterwards, and long before I had
occasion to re<U+FB02>ect upon its cause, the application of the fact to
the formation and motion of glaciers <U+FB02>ashed upon me.         Snow
was in the yard of the Royal Institution at the time; stuf<U+FB01>ng a
quantity of it into one of the steel moulds which Ihad previously
employed to demonstrate the influence of pressure on magnetic
phenomena, I squeezed the snow, and had the pleasure of seeing
it turn out from the mould as a cylinder of translucent ice. I
immediately joined Mr. Faraday, and expressed the conviction
that his little outlying experiment would be found to constitute
the basis of a true theory of glaciers.    It became subsequently
known to me that the Messrs. Schlagintweit had made a similar
experiment with snow; but they did not connect with it the ap
plications which suggested themselves to me, and which have
since been developed into a theory of glacier-motion.
   A section of the mould used in the experiment above referred
to is given in <U+FB01>g. 1.      AB is the solid base of the mould;
CDE F a hollow cylinder let
into the base; P is the solid
plug used to compress the snow.
When suf<U+FB01>ciently squeezed, the
bottom, A B, is removed, and
the cylinder of ice is pushed out
by the plug. The mould closely
resembles one of those employed
by Professor Helmholtz.
    The subsequent development
of the subject by the moulding
of ice into various forms by pres
sure is too well known to need
dwelling upon here.      In apply
ing these results to glaciers,
I  dwelt with especial emphasis
upon the fact that while the
power of being moulded by pres
sure belonged in an eminent
degree to ice, the power of yield
ing by stretching to a force of
tension was wanting.      On this
point Prof. Helmholtz speaks

                   Prof. Tyndall  on Ice and Glaciers.           395
 as follows :—“Tyndall in particular maintained, and proved
 by calculation and measurement, that the ice of a glacier does
 not stretch in the smallest degree when subjected to tension—
 that when suf<U+FB01>ciently strained it always breaks ;” and he adds
in another place, that the property thus revealed establishes
 “ an essential difference between a stream of ice, and one of lava,
tar, honey, or mud.”                            '
    In the beautiful experiments of M. Tresca recently executed,
the power of ice to mould itself under pressure has been very
 strikingly illustrated.   Professor Helmholtz also, in the presence
of his audiences at Heidelberg and Frankfort, illustrated this
property in various ways.       From snow and broken fragments
of ice he formed cakes and cylinders; and uniting the latter, end
to end, he permittcd them to freeze together to long sticks of
ice.    Placing, moreover, in a suitable mould a cylinder of ice
           Fig. 2.
of the shape represented in <U+FB01>g. 2, be squeezed it into the cake
represented in <U+FB01>g. 3.       In fact he corroborated, by a series of
striking experimental     devices of his own, the results previously
obtained by myself.
    With regard to the application of these results to the pheno
mena of glaciers, Professor Helmholtz, after satisfying himself of
the insuf<U+FB01>ciency of other hypotheses, thus <U+FB01>nally expresses his
conviction :-—“I do not doubt that Tyndall has assigned the
essential and principal cause of glacier-motion, in referring it to
fracture and regelation.”
    It is perhaps worth stating that the term “regelation” was
<U+FB01>rst introduced in a paper published by Mr. Huxley and myself
more than seven years after the discovery of the fact by Faraday,
and that it was suggested to us by Dr. Hooker, now Director
of the Royal Gardens at Kew. As already remarked, the
formation and motion of glaciers, and other points of a kindred

nature, had been referred to regelation long before I occupied
myself with the cause of regelation itself.        This latter question
is not once referred to in the memoir in which the regelation
theory was <U+FB01>rst developed*. The inquiries, though related, were
different.     In referring the motion of glaciers to a fact experi
mentally demonstrated, I referred it to its proximate cause.          To
        that cause to its physical antecedents formed the subject of
refer
a distinct inquiry, in which, because of my belief in the substan
tial correctness of Mr. Faraday’s explanation, I took compara~
tively little part.
    Five persons, however, mingled more or less in the inquiry-—
viz. Professor Faraday, Principal Forbes, Professor James Thom
son, Professor William Thomson, and myself             Professor James
                                                                    1'.

fessor Clausius§, from'the mechanical theory of heat.            He had
shown    it  to be  a consequence of this theory that the freezing
point of water must be lowered               by
                                        pressure; that     to say, water
 when subjected to pressure will remain liquid at                         a is
                                                            temperature
below that at which     it would freeze    the pressure were removed.

This theoretic deduction was con<U+FB01>rmed in            remarkable manner
                                                                a
 by   the experiments of his brother, Professor William Thomson                           H.
 Regelation, according to Professor Thomson’s theory, was thus
 accounted for :—“\Vhen two pieces of ice are pressed together,
 or laid the one upon the other, their compressed parts liquefy.
 The water thus produced has rendered latent portion of the heat    a
of   the surrounding ice, and must therefore be lower than 0° C.
 in temperature.        On escaping from the pressure this water
 refreezes and cements the pieces of ice together.”           always ad    I
 mitted that this explanation dealt with           “true cause.” But
                                                                a
 considering the in<U+FB01>nitesimal magnitude of the pressure suf<U+FB01>cient
 to produce regelation, in common with Professor Faraday and
 Principal Forbes   I   deemed the cause an insuf<U+FB01>cient one.        Pro
 fessor James Thomson, moreover, grounded upon the foregoing
 theory of regelation      a theory of glacier-motion, in which he
 ascribed the changes of form which           glacier undergoes to the
                                                       a
 incessant liquefaction of the ice at places where the pressure                          is
 intense, and the refreezing, in other positions, of the water thus
  produced<U+FB01>l.  I    endeavoured to show at the time that this theory
  Was inapplicable to the facts.    Professor Helmholtz has recently

    Thus, then, as regards the incapacity of ice to stretch in obe
 dience to tension, and its capacity to be moulded to any extent
 by pressure—as regards the essential difference between a glacier,
 and a stream of lava, honey, or tar—as regards the suf<U+FB01>ciency of
 pressure and regelation to account for the formation of glaciers,
and of fracture and regelation to account for their motion—as
 regards, <U+FB01>nally, the insuf<U+FB01>ciency of the theory which refers the
 motion to liquefaction by pressure, and refreezing, the views of
 Professor Hemholtz and myself appear to be identical.
    But the case is different with regard to the cause of regela
tion itself.   Here Professor Helmholtz, like M. Jamin*, accepts
the clear and de<U+FB01>nite explanation of Professor James Thomson
as the most satisfactory that has been advanced; and he sup
ports this view by an experiment so beautiful that it cannot fail
to give pleasure even to those against whose Opinions it is ad
duced.     But before passing to the experiment, which is described
in the Appendix to the lecture, it will be well to give in the
words of Professor Helmholtz the views which he expresses in
the body of his discourse.
    “ You will now ask with surprise,” he says, “how it is that
ice, the most fragile and brittle of all known solid substances,
can <U+FB02>ow in a glacier like a viscous mass; and you may perhaps
be inclined to regard this as one of the most unnatural and
paradoxical assertions that ever was made by a natural philo
sopher.    I will at once admit that the inquirers themselves were
in no small degree perplexed by the results of their investiga
tions.    But the facts were there, and could not be dissipated by
denial.    How this kind of motion on the part of ice was possible
remained long an enigma—the more so as the known brittleness
of ice also manifested itself in glaciers by the formation of nume
rous <U+FB01>ssurcs.     This, as Tyndall rightly maintained, constituted
an essential difference between the ice-stream,'and a stream of
lava, tar, honey, or mud.
   “ The solution of this wonderful enigma was found—as is often
the case in natural science—in an apparently remote investiga
tion on the nature of heat, which forms one of the most important
conquests of modern physics, and which is known under the
name of the mechanical theory of heat.            Among a great number
of deductions as to the relations of the most diverse natural
forces to each other, the principles of the mechanical theory of
heat enable us to draw certain conclusions regarding the de
pendence of the freezing-point of water on the pressure to which
the ice and water are subjected.”

398                 Prof. Tyndall     on Ice and Glaciers.
   Professor Helmholtz then explains to his audience what is
meant by latent heat, and points out that, through the circula~
tion of water in the <U+FB01>ssures and capillaries of a glacier, its inte
rior temperature must remain constantly at the freezing-point
of water.
   “But,” he continues, “the temperature of the freezing-point
of water can be altered by pressure.    This was <U+FB01>rst deduced by
James Thomson, and almost simultaneously by Clausius, from
the mechanical theory of heat ; and by the same deductions even
the magnitude of the change may be predicted.        For the pres
sure of every additional atmosphere, the freezing-point        sinks
0°'0075 C. The brother of the gentleman <U+FB01>rst named, William
Thomson, the celebrated Glasgow physicist, veri<U+FB01>ed experimen
tally the theoretic deduction by compressing a mixture of ice and
water in a suitable vessel. The mixture became colder and colder
as the pressure was augmented, and by the exact amount which
the mechanical theory of heat required.
   “ If, then, by pressure a mixture of ice and water can be reu
dered colder without the actual abstraction of heat, this can only
occur by the liquefaction of the ice and the rendering of heat
latent.   And this is the reason why pressure can alter the point
of congelation * * * *.
   “ In the experiment of William Thomson just referred to, ice
and water were enclosed in a solid vessel from which nothing
could escape.   The case is somewhat different when, as in the
case of a glacier, the water of the compressed ice can escape
through <U+FB01>ssures. In this case the ice is compressed, but not the
water which escapes.    The pressed ice will become colder by a
quantity corresponding to the lowering of its freezing-point by
the pressure.   But the freezing-point of the uncompressed water
is not lowered.   Here, then, we have ice colder than 0° C. in
contact with water at 0° C.    The consequence            is,
                                                  that round the
place of pressure the water will freeze and form new ice, while,
on the other hand,    portion of the compressed ice continues to
                        a
be melted (wiihrend dafiir ein Theil des gepressten Eises fort
Schmilzt).
   “This  occurs, for instance, when two pieces of ice are simply
pressed together. By the water which freezes at the points of
contact they are <U+FB01>rmly united to continuous mass.

factory.”
   In the Appendix, Professor Helmholtz returns to the subject
thus handled in the body of his discourse.    “The theory of the
regclation  of ice,” he  observes, “has given rise to a scienti<U+FB01>c
discussion between Faraday and Tyndall on the one hand, and
James and William Thomson on the other. In the text of this
lecture I have adopted the theory of the latter, and have there
fore to justify myself for so doing.”   He then analyzes the rea
sonings on both sides, points out the theoretic dif<U+FB01>culties of
  Faraday’s explanation, shows what a small pressure can accom
 plish if only suf<U+FB01>cient time be granted to                it,
                                                         draws attention to
 the fact that when one piece of ice            placed upon another the
                                                     is
 pressure   is  not distributed over the whole of the two appressed
 surfaces, but    is   concentrated on        few points of contact.
                                                 a                      He
 also holds with Professor James Thomson, that in an experiment
 devised    by Principal Forbes even the capillary attraction exerted
 between two plates of ice             suf<U+FB01>cient, in due time, to produce
                                      is
 regclation.     To illustrate the slow action of the small differences
 of temperature which here come into play Professor Helmholtz
 made the following experiment, to which reference has been
already made.
     “A glass <U+FB02>ask with drawn-out neck was half <U+FB01>lled with
                                 a
water, which was boiled until all the air above             was driven out.
                                                                 it
The <U+FB02>ask was then hermetically sealed.             When cooled, the <U+FB02>ask
was void of air, and the water within             freed from the pressure
                                                      it
of the atmosphere. As the water thus prepared can be cooled
considerably below 0° C. before the <U+FB01>rst ice           formed, while when
                                                           is
 iceis  in the <U+FB02>ask    it freezes at 0° C. [why f], the <U+FB02>ask was in the
 <U+FB01>rst instance placed in         freezing-mixture until the water was
                                 a
 changed    into  ice.  It   was  afterwards permitted to melt slowly
   in  place  the  temperature    of  which was +2° C., until the half
it a
of     was lique<U+FB01>ed.
     “ The <U+FB02>ask thus half <U+FB01>lled with water with                 disk of ice
                                                                      a
swimming on      it   was placed in      mixture of ice and water, being
                                           a
quite surrounded        by   the mixture.        After an hour the disk
within the <U+FB02>ask was frozen to the glass. By shaking the <U+FB02>ask
the disk was liberated, but          froze again as often as the shaking
                                     it
was repeated.        The <U+FB02>ask was permitted to remain for eight days
in the mixture, which was preserved throughout at                 tempera a
ture of 0° C. During thi time               number of very regular and
                                                a
sharply-de<U+FB01>ned ice-crystals were formed, and augmented very
slowly in size. This        is perhaps the best method of obtaining
beautifully formed crystals of ice.
   “ While, therefore, the outer ice which had to support the pres
sure of the atmosphere slowly melted, the water within the <U+FB02>ask

wh0se freezing-point,      on account of a defect of pressure, was
0°‘OO75 C. higher, deposited crystals of ice. The heat abstracted
from the water in this operation had, moreover, to pass through
the glass of the <U+FB02>ask, which, together with the small dif
ference of temperature, explains the slowness of the freezing
process.”
    A single additional condition in connexion with this beautiful
experiment I should like to have seen ful<U+FB01>lled—namely, that the
water in which the <U+FB02>ask was immersed, as well as that within                      it,
should be purged of its air           boiling. It
                                     by              just possible
                                                                is
that the point of congelation may not be entirely independent of
the presence of air in the water.
    The revival of this subject by Professor Helmholtz has caused
me to make  a   few experiments on the moulding and regelation
of ice. The following experiment illustrates both :—A quantity
of snowy powder was scraped from block of clear ice and placed
                                          a
in  a  boxwood mould having     a  shape like the foot of   claret       a
glass.    The ice-powder was compressed              by
                                               an hydraulic press,
and clear mass of ice of the shape shown in section at the bottom
    a
of <U+FB01>g. was the result. In another mould the same powder was
        4
squeezed so as to form small cylinders, three of which are shown
separate in <U+FB01>g. 4.  A     third mould was then employed to form
a  cup of ice, whichis   shown at the top of <U+FB01>g. 4.   Bringing all
the parts into contact, they were cemented through regelation to
form the claret-glass sketched in <U+FB01>g.          from which several

   There are brass shapes used for the casting of <U+FB02>owers and
other objects which answer admirably for experiments on the
rcgelation of ice. One of them was purchased for me          Mr.             by
Becker. Ice-powder squeezed into              it,
                                       regelated to   solid mass     a

and came from the mould in the sharply de<U+FB01>ned form sketched
in <U+FB01>g. 6.
   I placed a small piece of ice in warm water and forced it un
derneath the water by a second piece.       The submerged morsel
was so small that the vertical pressure was almost in<U+FB01>nitesimal.
It froze, notwithstanding, to the under surface of the superior
piece of ice. Two pieces of ice were placed in a basin of warm
water, and allowed to come together.      They froze as soon as they
touched each other.     The parts surrounding the place of contact
rapidly melted away, but the two pieces continued for a time
united by a narrow bridge of ice.       The bridge <U+FB01>nally melted
away,   and  the pieces were   for a  moment      separated.    But it
is well known that bodies which water wets, and against which
it rises by capillary attraction, move together when caused
to swim upon water.        The ice morsels did so, and immedi
ately regelation set in.    A new bridge was formed, which in
its turn was dissolved, and the pieces closed up as before.      Thus
a kind of pulsation was kept up by the two pieces of ice.        They
touched, froze; a bridge was formed and melted, leaving an interval
between the pieces.     Across this interval they moved, touched,
froze, the same process being repeated over and over again. We
have here the explanation of the curious fact, that when several
large lumps of ice are placed in warm water and allowed to touch
each other, regelation is maintained among them as long as they
remain undissolved.      The <U+FB01>nal fragments may not be the one
hundredth part of the original ones in size; through the process
of closing up just described, they incessantly lock themselves
together until they <U+FB01>nally disappear.      What is true of ice-frag
ments in a basin of water, is also true of the ice-blocks in the
Miirgelin See; and probably, if attention were directed to     it, the
play  of regelation might  be observed in  the icebergs  of the ocean.

  402                 Prof. Tyndall   on Ice and Glaciers.
  With   a certain amount of skill, numerous interesting observa
  tions may be made on the regelation of <U+FB02>oating fragments of ice.
      According to Professor James Thomson’s theory, to produce
  regelation the pieces of ice have to exercise pressure, to draw from
 the surrounding ice the heat necessary for the liquefaction of the
 compressed part; and then this water must escape and be re
 frozen.    All this requires time. In the foregoing experiments,
 moreover, the water lique<U+FB01>ed by the pressure issued into the
 surrounding warm water, but notwithstanding this the <U+FB02>oat
 ing fragments regelated in a moment.                 It is not necessary
 that the touching surfaces should be <U+FB02>at; for in this case a film
 of water might be supposed to exist between them of the tem
 perature 0° C.       The surfaces in contact may be convex: they
 may   be virtual  points   that touch each other, clasped all round by
 the warm liquid, which is rapidly dissolving them as they ap
 proach each other. Still they freeze immediately when they touch.
     There are two points urged by Helmholtz—one in favour of
 the view he has adopted, and the other showing a dif<U+FB01>culty
 associated with the view of Faraday—on which a few words may
 be said.    “I   found," says Helmholtz, “ the strength and rapi
 dity of the union of the pieces of ice in such complete correspond
 ence with the amount of pressure employed, that I cannot doubt
 that the pressure is actually the suf<U+FB01>cient cause of the union.”
     But, according to Mr. Faraday’s explanation, the strength and
 quickness of the regelation must also go hand in hand with the
 magnitude of the pressure employed.             Helmholtz rightly dwells
 upon   the  fact   that  the  appressed    surfaces  are usually not per
fectly congruent—that they really         touch  each other in a few points
only, the pressure being thus concentrated.              Now the effect of
pressure exerted on two pieces of ice at a temperature of 00 C. is
not only to lessen the thickness of the liquid <U+FB01>lm between the
pieces, but also to <U+FB02>atten out the appressed points, and thus to
spread the <U+FB01>lm over a greater space.            On both theories, there
fore, the strength and quickness of the regelation ought to cor
respond to the magnitude of the pressure.
     The dif<U+FB01>culty referred to above is thus stated by Helmholtz :—
“ In the explanation
                           given by Faraday, according to which the
regelation is caused by a contact action of ice and water,         I <U+FB01>nd a
theoretic dif<U+FB01>culty.       By the freezing of the water a very sensible
quantity of heat would be set free ; and it does not appear how
this is to be disposed of.”
    On the part of those who accept Faraday’s explanation, the
answer here must be that the free heat is di<U+FB01>'used through the
adjacent ice.      But against this it will doubtless be urged that ice
already at a temperature of 0° C. cannot take up more heat with
out liquefacti0u.       If this be true under all circumstances, Fara

                     Prof. Tyndall     on Ice and Glaciers.                   403
day’s    explanation must undoubtedly be given up.               But the
essence   of that explanation seems to be that the interior portions
of a mass of ice require a higher temperature to dissolve them
than that suf<U+FB01>cient to cause fusion at the surface. To be perfectly
distinct, let a beam of solar heat, or a beam from the electric
lamp,be sent through a massof ice. The substance breaks up into
those six-petaled liquid flowers which have been described else
where.      The <U+FB01>owers expand as the beam continues to act, the
energy of the absorbed portion of the beam being almost wholly
expended in enlarging the <U+FB02>owers formed during the <U+FB01>rst few
seconds of exposure, and not in forming new <U+FB02>owers.                  Now
the assumption involved in Faraday’s theory                 is,
                                                           that, before            a
<U+FB02>ower makes its appearance in the interior, the ice there must
have been raised to temperature higher than 0° C., while at the
                         a
 surface the ice fuses at this temperature.        When therefore two
 moist surfaces of ice at the temperature 0° are pressed together,
 and when, in virtue of the contact action assumed by Faraday,
 the <U+FB01>lm of water between them isIfrozen, the adjacent ice (which
is   now in the interior, and not at the surface as at <U+FB01>rst)             is   in   a
 condition to withdraw        byconduction, and without prejudice to
 its own solidity, the small amount of heat set free.        Once grant
 ing the contact action claimed            by
                                         Faraday, there seems to be no
 dif<U+FB01>culty in disposing of the heat rendered sensible              by
                                                                 the free
 zing of the <U+FB01>lm.

I   enveloped ice containing such water-parcels in tinfoil,and placed
it   in a freezing-mixture until the liquid parcels were perfectly
 congealed.      Removing the ice from the freezing—mixture, placed     I
it,   covered   by its envelope, in     dark room, and found, after

  to fuse this interior ice, passed through the <U+FB01>rmer surrounding
  ice without the slightest visible prejudice to its solidity.      But            if
  the freezing temperature of the ice-parcels be 0° C., then the
  freezing temperature of the mass surrounding them must be
  higher than 0° C., which           what the explanation of Faraday
                                      is

   In   aformer   paragraph     have attached to the description of

precaution used          Professor Helmholtz the query “ why?”
                         by
He states that water freed of its air sinks, without freezing, to                  a
temperature far below 0° C. while when;          piece of ice
                                                     a          in the  is
same water       cannot so sink in temperature, but
                it                                                is
                                                            invariably
deposited in the solid form at 0° C.        This surely proves ice to
possess     special power of solidi<U+FB01>cation over water.

   less to say that the fact is general—that a crystal of any salt
   placed in a saturated solution of the salt always provokes crys
  tallization. Applying this fact to the minute film of water en
  closed between two appressed surfaces of ice, it seems to me in
   the highest degree probable that the contact action of Faraday
  will set in, that the <U+FB01>lm will freeze and cement the pieces of ice
   together.
      Apart from the present discussion, the following observation
  is perhaps worth recording.           It is well known that ice during
  a thaw disintegrates so as to form rude prisms whose axes are at
  right angles to the planes of freezing.           I have often observed
  this action on a large scale, during the winters that I spent as a
  student on the banks of the Lahn.           The manner in which these
  prisms are in some cases formed is extremely interestin".            On
  close inspection, a kind of cloudiness is observed in the interior
  of a mass of apparently perfect ice. On cleser inspection, this
  cloudiness appears arranged in stria: at right angles to the planes
  of freezing, and when the direction of vision is across these planes
  the ends of the atria are apparent.            The spaces between the
  striae are composed of clear unelouded ice.          The objects which
  produce this cloudiness are exceedingly small, but when duly
  examined they turn out to be piles of minute liquid <U+FB02>owers,
  whose planes are at right angles to the direction of the striae.

      Since writing the above, I have been favoured with acopy of a
 Discourse delivered by Professor De la Rive, at the opening of
 the forty-ninth meeting of the Société Helvétique, which assem_
 bled this year at Geneva.          From this admirable résumé of our
 present knowledge regarding glaciers I make the following extract,
 which, together with those from the lecture of Helmholtz, will
 show suf<U+FB01>ciently how the subject is now regarded by competent
 men :—“ Such, gentlemen,” says M. De la Rive, “ is a descrip
 tion of the phenomena of glaciers, and it now remains to explain
them, to consult observation, and deduce from it the fundamental
character of the phenomena.            Gbservation teaches us that gra
vity   is the motive    force, and that this force acts upon a solid body
--ice—-imparting to it a slow and continuous motion.                What
are we to conclude from this?             That ice is a solid which pos
sesses the property of <U+FB02>owing like a viscous body—a conclusion
which appears Very simple, but which was nevertheless announced
for the <U+FB01>rst time hardly <U+FB01>ve and twenty years ago by one of the
most distinguished philosophers of Scotland, Professor James D.

Forbes.      This theOry, for it truly is a theory, basing itself on
facts as numerous as they are well observed, enunciatcs the prin
ciple that ice possesses the characteristic properties which belong
to plastic bodies.        Although he did not directly prove             to Pro  it,
fessor Forbes belongs not the less the great merit of insisting on
the plasticity of ice, before Faraday, in discovering the pheno
menon of regelation, enabled Tyndall to prove that the plas~
ticity was real, at least partially.
     “ The experiment of                    classical in connexion with our
                                             is
                               Faraday
subject.     It consists, as you know,               this, that
                                                      in            two morsels
                                                                       if
of ice be brought into contact in water, which may be even warm,
they freeze together.          Tyndall saw very quickly the application
 of Faraday’s experiment to the theory of glaciers                      he com
                                                                            ,-
 prehended that, since pieces of ice could thus solder themselves
 together, the substance might be broken, placed in                       mould, a
 compressed, and thus compelled to take the form of the cavity
 which contained it.          A  wooden mould, for example, embraces                         a
 spherical   cavity;     placing   in   itfragments of ice and squeezing
 them, we obtain an ice sphere; placing this sphere in                    second  a
 mould    with      lenticular   cavity and   pressing          it,
                                                              we transform the
                a alens. In this way we can impart any form what
 sphere into
 ever to ice.
     “Such   is   the discovery of Tyndall, which may well be thus
 named, particularly in view of its consequences.                  For all these
 moulds magni<U+FB01>ed become the borders of the valley in which                                   a
 glacier <U+FB02>ows.        Here the action of the hydraulic press which has
 served for    the    experiments of the laboratory             replaced
                                                                  is           the     by
 weight of the masses of snow and ice collected on the summits,
 and exerting their pressure on the ice which descends into the
 valley. Supposing, for example, between the spherical mould and
 the lenticular one,     a graduated series of other moulds to exist, each
 of which differs very little from the one which precedes and from
 that which follows          it,and that      mass of ice could be made to
                                              a
 pass through all these moulds in succession, the phenomenon
 would then become continuous. Instead of rudely breaking, the
                                                  It by
 ice would be compelled to change                 insensible degrees from the
 spherical to the lenticular form.                 would thus exhibit        plas      a
 ticity which might be compared to that of soft wax. But ice
is    only plastic under pressure;            it  not plastic under tension:
                                                   is
 and this  is   the important point which the vague theory of plas
 ticity was unable to explain. While viscous body, like bitumen
                                                     a
 or honey, may be drawn out in <U+FB01>laments                    by
                                                           tension, ice, far from
  stretching in this way, breaks like glass under this action. These
  points well established          byTyndall,        became easy for him to
                                                     it
 explain   the   mechanism       of glaciers,  and         by

out, so that when both faces are placed together, as in <U+FB01>g. 7,
they enclose a ring 4 inches in external diameter, from M to N,

An hydraulic press may            of  course be
employed in this experiment, but it is
not necessary; with the hammer and

 itselfto my ingenious friend Mr. Duppa
 when he saw the ice-rings just referred
 to, and which was actually executed by
 him yesterday (the 16th) in the laboratory of the Royal Institu
 tion. Pouring a quantity of plaster of paris into a proper vessel, an
 ice-ring was laid upon the substance, an additional quantity of
 the cement being then poured over the ring.          The plaster “ set,”
 enclosing the ring within it : the ring soon melted, leaving its per
 fect matrix behind. The mould was permitted to dry, and, molten
  lead being poured into the space previously occupied by the ice, a
 leaden ringwas produced. Now icc can be moulded into any shape:
 statuettes, vases, <U+FB02>owers, and innumerable other ornaments can
 be formed from it.          These enclosed in cement, in the manner
 suggested by Mr. Duppa, remain intact suf<U+FB01>ciently long to enable
 the cement to set around them; they afterwards melt and dis—
 appear, leaving behind them perfect plaster moulds, from which
 casts can be taken.—-J. T.

 quantity of heat which a body receives or gives out during any

is transformed into mechanical work, whether external or inter

    4. In the value of the metamorphic function F which                  I  gave
in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh for
 1850—51, I proceeded on the supposition that every substance
is capable of passing into the state of perfect gas at every tem
perature.       If such is the fact, the value of F is as follows :—
                                        4P

    5. Professor Clausius points out that, if the substance under
 consideration is at any temperature incapable of passing into the
 state of perfect gas, the preceding value of the integral of equa
 tion       is incomplete, and requires the addition of a function of
 the temperature to complete it. The value which he gives in

 Clausius observes that, for substances which at all temperatures
 are capable    of passing into the perfectly gaseous state, that term
 vanishes, and the two functions become identical; but that‘for
 substances which at any temperature are incapable of passing
 into the perfectly gaseous state, the term in question has some
 value, and the two functions are no longer absolutely identical.
 I admit that Professor Clausius is right in both those assertions ;
 and that, in assigning the value to F which is given by equation               ,
 I  did not contemplate the existence of substances which at any
 temperature are incapable of passing into the perfectly gaseous
 condition.
     7. Whether such substances exist or not is            a question which
 experiment alone can decide.            I  cannot agree, however, with
 Professor Clausius in thinking it dif<U+FB01>cult to conceive that such
 substances as iron can pass into the perfectly gaseous state at
 low temperatures.        Iron, copper, tin, zinc, and lead at low tem

  peratures have distinct smells by which they can be recognized;
  therefore they exist at low temperatures in the gaseous condition:
  and why, then, not in the perfectly gaseous condition?           And if
  those metals exist in the perfectly gaseous condition at low tem
  peratures, may not other substances chie<U+FB02>y known to us as solids
  do so, although we cannot smell them?
      8. Professor Clausius dissents from a statement of mine, that
 the real speci<U+FB01>c heat of a substance can be different in the three
  different states of aggregation—solid,         liquid, and gaseous.
 \Vhen differences occur between the apparent values of the spe
 ci<U+FB01>c heat at constant volume of the same substance in those three
 conditions, he ascribes them to internal work.
     I  admit that it is dif<U+FB01>cult to conceive how the same substance
 can alter its real speci<U+FB01>c heat in changing its state of aggregation.
 But it is also dif<U+FB01>cult to conceive how the elevation of tempera
 ture of liquid water, for example, can be accompanied by internal
 work to an amount suf<U+FB01>cient to account for the excess of the
 speci<U+FB01>c heat of liquid water at constant volume above that of
 steam and above that of ice, those three quantities being nearly
 as follows :—
     Speci<U+FB01>c heat at constant volume of ice, about .       .  .    0'5

                ,,             ,,          steam     .  .  .  .    0'37
     It appears to me that both dif<U+FB01>culties are diminished, if not
removed, by supposing that in some cases the same substance,
when in di<U+FB02>'erent states of aggregation, is not absolutely identical,
but isomeric, and may so have different values for its real speci<U+FB01>c
heat.      For example, we may suppose that one atom of ice or of
steam is composed of two atoms of liquid water 5 just as it has
been conjectured that an atom of common oxygen may consist of
two atoms of ozone; and then a change in the real speci<U+FB01>c heat
becomes a natural result.
       do not, however, propose that supposition as more than a
    I_
conjecture ; and for the present      I  am content to regard as cer
tain merely the fact that the minimum speci<U+FB01>c heat of the same
substance in different states of aggregation is in many cases
different, leaving the relation between that minimum speci<U+FB01>c heat
        the real speci<U+FB01>c heat to be ascertained by further investi
and
gation.

the sum of all the (1 .2.3...p)"-l terms so obtained is the
commutant denoted by the above-mentioned symbol.              In the
particular     case 9:2, the commutant  is  of course a determinant:
in this case, and generally if 6 be even, it is immaterial which
of the columns is left unpermuted, so that the (T) instead of
being placed over any column may be placed on the left hand of
the A; but when 6 is odd, the function has different values
according as one or another column is left unpermuted, and the
position of the (1') is therefore material.    It may be added that
if all the columns are permuted, then, if 0 be even, the sum is
1 . 2 . . . 12 into the commutant   obtained by leaving any one
column unpermuted ; but if 0 is odd, then the sum is                                  :0.

 LX.      On Chemical Reactions obtained   employing Anhydrousby
              Liquids as Solvents. By  G. GORE, F.R.S.*
       ATER   has long been used as     solvent to bring a     large                a
         number of substances into   liquid  state  suitable
                                                    a        for the
exercise of chemical af<U+FB01>nity; and  very large    class
                                                    a   of chemical
reactions    due to the liquefying power of water upon one or
                is
both of the two substances which are brought into contact for
                            "                       by
                                 Communicated            the Author.

             by employing Anhydrous Liquids as Solvents.           415
the purpose of chemically acting upon        each other; but we have
comparatively neglected      the solvent  power of other liquids which
might be employed for the purpose.           Numerous reactions may
be obtained by dissolving one or both of the acting substances
in non-aqueous liquids, such as bisulphide of carbon, chloride of
sulphur, chloride of arsenic, bichloride of tin, other, 820. Various
substances which are insoluble in water, such as phosphorus,
sulphur, selenium, iodine, &c., and various compounds also
which are decomposable by water, such as the chlorides of phos
phorus, antimony, &c., may thus be brought into a liquid state
and rendered <U+FB01>t for chemical reaction; and I prop0se in the fol
lowing communication to illustrate this by various experiments
which    I have made with bisulphide of carbon as the dissolving
agent.     The bisulphide employed in these experiments had been
previously redistilled from fragments of fused chloride of calcium
mixed with carbonate of lead in powder.
    It is well known that bisulphide of carbon dissolves phospho
rus, sulphur, and iodine, and mixes freely with bromine and
with chloride of sulphur; and sulphide of phosphorus and iodide
of sulphur have each been formed by dissolving their ingredients
in that liquid and removing the solvent by evaporation.
    In examining the behaviour of bisulphide of carbon with
numerous inorganic substances,        I  have obtained the following
positive   results:   the  substances   were  generally in the driest
state, and were in      most  cases digested in the liquid in closed
bottles during several weeks at the ordinary atmospheric tem
perature:—
    Anhydrous sulphuric acid diSsolved slightly and formed a
fuming liquid. Persulphide of hydrogen containing an'excess
of sulphur dissolved instantly and copiously, and formed a yel-.
low liquid.      (Bisulphide of carbon also absorbs sulphuretted
hydrogen gas.)       Selenium in powder dissolved slowly and spa
ringly, and formed a rich yellow liquid; the solution when eva
porated left a residue of red powder intermingled with brilliant
golden scales; white phosphorus added to the solution produced
no visible change.      PhOsphide of selenium dissolved slowly and
 sparingly, and formed a yellow solution.        Sulphide of selenium
dissolved slowly and sparingly, and formed a very rich yellow
liquid. Iodide of selenium dissolved sparingly, and formed a
purple solution.       Bromide of selenium formed a red liquid._
Pentachloride     of phosphorus dissolved and formed a colourless
 liquid. Bisulphide of carbon, digested with potassium and
 sodium, slowly acquired in the former case a faint yellow colour,
and in the latter case a deeper yellow colour; the metals acquired
 (as is already well known) thick coatings of reddish-brown
matter.     Hydrate of soda slowly acquired an orange-red colour.

416          Mr. G. Gore      on Chemical Reactions obtained
Caustic   baryta, lime, and soda-lime slowly acquired a lemon
yellow   colour.     Bisulphide of carbon that had been saturated
with gaseous <U+FB02>uoride of silicon fumed in the air strongly.            Bi
chloride of titanium (freed from excess of chlorine by agitation
with mercury) mixed instantly with bisulphide of carbon, and
 formed a yellow and strongly fuming liquid.
    Metallic arsenic in contact with platinum slowly imparted a
 brownish-yellow tint to bisulphide of carbon, and appeared to
 dissolve in very minute amount. Iodide of arsenic formed a dark
 rcd solution.     Bromide of arsenic formed a colourless solution.
Terchloride of arsenic mixed freely.           Iodide of antimony dis
solved sparingly, and formed a red solution.            Bromide of anti
mony    dissolved   to a  colourless  liquid.   Terchloride of antimony
dissolved freely,    and  formed   a  colourless liquid.   Pentachloride
of antimony produced decomposition, with a light yellow preci
pitate, and two liquid layers of reddish-yellow colour.
    Carbonate of cadmium slowly became reddish yellow.                Bi
chloride of tin mixed freely, and formed a colourless solution.
Thallium slowly blackened.           Carbonate of cobalt became of a
dark red-brown colour.           Copper reduced by hydrogen slowly
became black.       Protochloride of mercury dissolved to a small
extent.     Silver in contact with platinum slowly blackened.
Crystals ofnitrate of silver blackened super<U+FB01>cially.        Benzoic acid
dissolved moderately, and formed beautifully <U+FB02>at colourless crys
talline plates. The proportion of instances of the foregoing class
in which no apparent effects ocwrred, and which are not speci<U+FB01>ed,
amounted to about 75 01-80 per cent.
    Bisulphide of carbon added to a saturated solution of proto
chloride of mercury in ether precipitated the mercury-salt unde
composed.
    With a. solution of phosphorus in bisulphide of carbon the
following positive results occurred (the liquids were all kept
in a dark place) z—Anhydrous boracic acid slowly became of a
lemon-yellow colour.         Anhydrous sulphuric acid was decom
posed, and sulphurous acid gas set free.            Iodine dissolved and
formed a fuming liquid, which was of a yellow colour, unless the
iodine was in excess ; if the proportion of the solvent was small,
a mass of crystals was produced.          Iodic acid slowly decomposed
with formation of a copious scarlet-red powder, and the liquid
became yellow. Bromine dissolved with violent action, and pro
 duced a nearly colourless fuming liquid ; if the proportion of the
solvent was small, the addition of an excess of bromine caused a
precipitate.     Iodide of ammonium became lemon-yellow.
    Iodatc of potash became yellowish red, and the supernatant
liquid became yellow.         Nitrate of potash became lemon-yellow.
 Hydrate   of   soda   slowly became red.       Iodide and bromide of

            by employing Anhydrous Liquids as Solvents.            417
barium slowly caused      a yellow deposit.    The iodides of calcium
and magnesium produced a copious yellow deposit slowly. Mo
lybdic acid became of a dark-blue colour, almost black, being
evidently reduced to a lower oxide by the phosphorus.              Mo
lybdate   of  ammonia    became    partly green.    Chromic   acid  was
also reduced, and became dark green.            The iodides of arsenic
and antimony formed rich-yellow solutions, and, like the bro
mides of those metals, gave reddish-yellow deposits.          Teroxide
0f bismuth slowly became brown.
    Iodide of zinc, the hyponitrite, and yellow chromate of lead
produced yellow deposits.        Carbonate of cobalt quickly became
of a brown-black colour. Hydrated oxide of nickel and car
bonate of nickel slowly blackened. Copper redueed by hydrogen,
and suboxide of copper, soon became black.            Dry carbonate of
copper immediately       blackened    and   unload  gas.   Phosphate,
anhydrous sulphate, ammoniuret, and arsenite of copper soon
                                                     '
became black.
    The iodides of mercury and of silver, and both the chlorides
of mercury, produced yellow deposits.          Dry crystals of nitrate
 of silver became black, and gave a lemon-yellow deposit. Green
cyanide of copper and white cyanide of silver became black,
and the liquid smelt strongly of hydrocyanic acid. Cyanide
of mercury became red-brown.           Nitrocyanide of sodium pro
 duced a lemon-yellow deposit.
    Salts of copper appear to be particularly liable to be decom
 posed by this liquid.       The rcsults obtained with iodides were
 probably   due  in part to the  presence of free iodine, which most
 iodides are liable to contain, as may easily be proved by digest
 ing them with bisulphide of carbon.         The percentage of nega
 tive results obtained with this liquid was about eighty.
     The purer variety of precipitated sulphur was dissolved in
 bisulphide of carbon, and the yellow solution <U+FB01>ltered.            This
 liquid was singularly inactive; upwards of one hundred in
 organic substanccs were submitted to its action ; it only slowly
 blackened the salts of lead, copper, mercury, and silver; the
  carbonate and <U+FB02>uoride of lead, however, were rapidly blackened
  by bisulphide of carbon containing free sulphide of hydrogen in
  solution ; agitation, therefore, of bisulphide of carbon with car
 bonate of lead will not remove free-sulphur, but will probably
 remove any sulphuretted hydrogen it may contain.            The solu
 tion of sulphur in bisulphide of carbon blackened metallic
 mercury and copper reduced by hydrogen when agitated with
 them. Sulphur, when dissolving in bisulphide of carbon, absorbs
 heat to a small extent.        Carbonate of lead in a solution of
 sulphur in bisulphide of carbon did not become blackened by
 passing hydrogen gas through the liquid.

418              Mr. G. Gore   on Chemical Reactions.
    With a solution of iodine in bisulphide of carbon the follow
ing positive results occurred :—-A stream of hydrogen converted
it into a clear yellow liquid. Agitation with dilute sulphuric
 acid and zinc decolorized it. White phosphorus converted it into
a pale yellow fuming liquid.        It was quickly decolorized by
agitation with a strong aqueous solution of sulphurous acid.
Pentachloride    of phosphorus removed its red colour. It was
also decolorized with varied degrees of rapidity by sesquicarbo
mate of ammonia, potassium, hydrate of potash, hypophosphite
of potash, sulphide of potassium, and sulphite of potash. Sodium
converted it into a pale yellow liquid.     It was decolorized by by
drate of soda, sulphide of sodium, hyposulphite of soda (especially
by an aqueous solution), peroxide of barium, baryta-water, sul
phide of barium,lime-water, sulphide of calcium, soda-lime, slowly
by magnesium or aluminium—also by arsenic or bisulphide of
arsenic, each forming a yellow solution—by tersulphide of arsenic,
arsenite of soda, antimony in powder or tersulphide of antimony
 (each left the liquid pale yellow),     slowly by teroxide of bis
muth, tel-sulphide of bismuth (which became a dark-red powder),
zinc, an alloy of zinc and sodium, sulphide of cadmium, prot
 oxide of tin, sulphide of lead, iron reduced by hydrogen, slowly
 by hydrated oxide of nickel, carbonate of nickel, copper reduced
 by hydrogen, suboxide of copper, slowly by carbonate of copper,
 also by arsenite of copper, mercury, oxide, sulphide, and sul
 phate of mercury, subchloride of mercury, oxide of silver, and
 slowly by nitrate of silver.    The percentage of negative results
 with this liquid amounted to about sixty-six.
    A weak solution of bromine in bisulphide of carbon behaved
 similarly to that of iodine. It was slowly decolorized by contact
 with water, also by a stream of hydrogen or by agitation with
 zinc and dilute sulphuric acid.     White phosphorus decolorized
 it rapidly with violent action, the product of decomposition
 dissolving to a colourless liquid.   Agitation with aqueous solu
 tions of sulphurous acid, hyposulphite, or bisulphite of soda
 instantly removed its colour. Dry sulphite of potash or of soda
 or bisulphite of soda, also decolorized   it,  less rapidly.   Potas
 sium, sodium, magnesium, and aluminium were very slowly
 corroded. The sulphides of sodium, barium, and calcium slowly
 removed its colour.     Metallic arsenic decolorized   it with strong
 action.   Metallic antimony and the two sulphides of arsenic
 decolorizedit  quickly. Teroxide of arsenic, teroxide of antimony,
 tersulphide of antimony, and metallic tellurium gradually re
 moved its colour.
    Sulphide of cadmium, metallic tin, sulphide of lead, metallic
 iron, copper reduced by hydrogen, carbonate of copper, metallic
 mercury, and oxide of mercury decolorized        it   slowly.   Silver

   Anhydrous carbonate of copper was slowly blackened by contact
with metallic arsenic in powder beneath bisulphide of carbon.
                                 Remarks.
    Bisulphidc of carbon dissolves metalloids only, viz. phos
phorus, sulphur, selenium, bromine, and iodine; metals tend
only to remove its sulphur. It dissolves the chlorides, bro
mides, and iodides fvof phosphorus,              arsenic, and antimony,
generally   with   facility, those   of phosphorus and arsenic (espe
cially  the chlorides and bromides) the most readily.          It dissolves
also, with varied degrees of facility, the chlorides, bromides, and
iodides of sulphur and selenium.             Persulphidc of h drogen is
freely soluble in it.     It also mixes freely with the bic lorides of
titanium and tin. Metallic oxides, <U+FB02>uorides, chlorides, bro
mides, iodides, and sulphides, and the whole series of oxygen
salts, including carbonates, borates, hypophosphites, phosphites,
phosphates, sulphates, sulphites, hyposulphites, chlorates, bro
mates, iodates and nitrates, are insoluble in it.
    The solution of phosphorus in bisulphide of carbon may be
considered as a deoxidizing liquid, as shown by its action upon
 sulphuric acid, molybdic acid, and chromic acid, and especially by
its behaviour with the various oxygen salts of copper. And the
 solutions of bromine and iodine may be viewed as oxidizing
liquids, being decolorizcd chie<U+FB02>y by deoxidizing substances,
 such as metals, sulphides, sulphites, hyposulphites, 8:0.               By
 means of these solutions of opposite chemical character, nu
 merous chemical reactions may be obtained, as already shown.
 Various sulphides might also probably be formed by means of
 the solution of sulphuretted hydrogen or persulphide of hydro
 gen in bisulphide of carbon.
    My intention in the foregoing paper being merely to show
 that numerous chemical reactions might be obtained by em
ploying anhydrous liquids as solvents, I have refrained from
 further examining the special reactions obtained.

relates to a phenomenon which, though of daily occurrence, has
been hitherto very imperfectly examined.         Notwithstanding the
extensive literature* which we possess on the subject of Twilight,
there is not in the whole of it a single correct and complete de
scription of the phenomenon, to say nothing of anything like a
satisfactory theory.    I will therefore, in the <U+FB01>rst place, give a
short description of the occurrence of twilight, based on my own
observations, made on cloudless evenings, and continued for
almost a whole year, in Miinden and in the Alps, and will then
compare the results with those of the theory which has hitherto
been generally received, so as to show the ineorrectness of the
latter.
   I. A short time before sunset the lower part of the sky be
comes eovered with a yellowish-white tint, which towards the
east passes into a dull purple.      This purple zone, the counter
twiliglit (Geyendiimmeruny)    as it is called, increases in intensity
about the moment of sunset, and reaches, according to the con
dition of the atmosphere, from 6° to 12° above the horizon.
As the sun sinks, the ashy-grey shadow of the earth rises in
the form of a segment, in consequence of which Le Mairan called
it the dark segment. As soon as the limb of this segment, which,
for reasons afterwards stated,     Iwill call the <U+FB01>rst dark segment,
has attained an elevation of more than 1° or 2°, it is tolerably
sharply de<U+FB01>ned.       It rapidly pursues its course towards the
zenith, seeming to stretch itself in the manner of a dark veil
over the countertwilight.      As it approaches the upper edge of
the latter, its own limit becomes more and more indistinct, until
at last it is impossible to recognize it any longer.     At this time
the sun is from 3° to 4° below the horizon.
   Whilst this is taking place in the cast, a very different spec
tacle is displayed in the western heavens. The western horizon
is coloured, at sunset and afterwards, orange~yellow or even red,
and this yellowish coloration is de<U+FB01>ned from the upper blue por
tions of the sky, at an elevation of from 9° to 12°, by a very
transparent, shining, whitish zone, which gradually spreads out
in a horizontal direction.     Iwill call     with Brandes, the twi

             4."                         This value was the mean
of twenty observations varying between 3° 40' and 4° 50' as
extreme limits.   The radius of the disk has at this moment at
tained a value of about 30°, and its centre is about 15° above
the horizon.    The centre sinks very quickly, so that the purple
light <U+FB01>nally contracts to a narrow girdle of dull purple colour,
very sharply marking oil' the yellow portion, which, from the
form it thus assumes, may be called the first bright segment.
 This limitation retains its sharpness, even after the complete
 disappearance of the purple light, which occurs when the sun
 is about 6° below the horizon.    Measurements of the height 0
 of the limb of this segment showed that on each day the um
 w+9=7 is nearly constant, or denoting the depression of the
 sun.   The value of 'y varied on di<U+FB01>'erent days from 8° to 12°.
 This law extends even to the twilight-sheen, so that we are justi
 <U+FB01>ed in denoting the yellow portion in the western heavens as
 belonging to the bright segment from the very beginning of
twilight.
  While the purple light, which, it may be remarked in passing,
shows scarcely any trace of polarization, attains its greatest in
tensity, westerly objects which immediately after sunset Were
quite pale and colourless, appear again illuminated with a tole
rably bright rose tint.    This illumination is often sui<U+FB01>ciently
intense to be remarked in narrow town streets where the sky is
scarcely visible.    The Alps afford at this time the glorious
spectacle of the afterglow (Nachgliihen).     In the vale of Cha
mouni each of these appearances has its proper name: a dis
tinction is drawn between the “ coloration brillante du Mont
Blanc,” the “ teinte cadavéreuse,” the “ coloration seconde, ou
la resurrection,” and lastly the “ extinction.”
    The whole of the phenomena are, however, to be seen in the
plain as well ; so that there is no ground whatever for seeking
 the cause of the afterglow on Mont Blanc, as De la Rive does,
in the extraordinary height of the mountain.         That the pheno
 menon   does not   depend upon any     mere  effect  of contrast, as
 Necker supposes, is proved by the fact that it may be observed
 even in places whence the sky is not seen, but only the illumi
nated objects, such, for example, as a house on the opposite side
 of the way seen from a room.
    The moment of complete disappearance of the purple light is
 accompanied by a remarkable diminution of daylight.         For this
 reason, doubtless, the termination       of twilight, popularly so
 called, that      is,
                  of the portion of twilight during which common
 occupations can be pursued without arti<U+FB01>cial light,         <U+FB01>xed at

 about the same moment.

422            Dr. Wilhelm von Bezold            on    Twilight.
   \Vhile the <U+FB01>rst bright segment continues its course towards
the horizon, a repetition of the appearances already described is
preparing itself in the east.   The eastern horizon again displays
a faint purple colour, or a second countertwilig/zl, over which
a second (but very imperfectly         de<U+FB01>ned) dark segment rises
up.   In  the west  there appears    over the <U+FB01>rst bright segment a
second twilight-sheen, but  not reaching to quite the same eleva
tion as the <U+FB01>rst; it is separated from the bright segment by a
dirty yellowish-green stratum.      It moves downwards in the same
way as the <U+FB01>rst, and a second purple light is gradually developed,
exactly like the <U+FB01>rst, except that it is much less intense and has
somewhat more of a reddish tint.        On many days it is as in
tense as the <U+FB01>rst is on others, though for the most part it
is so faint that it is impossible to observe it with any cer
tainty. Out of twenty-four evenings,            I
                                              saw it only eight times,
and I was able to determine the moment of its maximum inten
sity with tolerable accuracy only on four occasions.            From
these observations, it resulted that the depression of the sun
corresponding to the maximum of the <U+FB01>rst purple light was to
the depression corresponding to the maximum of the second in
a nearly constant ratio of 1 : 2'2.   It will of course be understood
that the second purple light is accompanied by a second illumi
nation of favourably-situated    objects; and thus in the Alps a
second afterglow may often be observed.
     The second purple light undergoes the    same changes as the
<U+FB01>rst,   and  consequently occasions at last the formation of a
second bright segment.     It was the height of this segment of
which Lambert* made a series of measurements one evening, but
erroneously regarded as the continuation of what he called the
<U+FB01>rst twilight-bow (Diimmm-ungsbogcn), that               is,
                                                   the limit of the
<U+FB01>rst dark segment. When the second bright segment sinks
below the horizon, the last brightness disappears, and twilight
is at an end.   This corresponds on an average to        depressiona
of the sun of about 17°.
   The course of the phenomena, which are observable in exactly
the inverse order, in the morning remains in general the same.
The intensity and extent of the individual appearances, how
ever, are very different on different days; nevertheless twilight
always retains its de<U+FB01>nite character, so that its course can be
foreseen from the <U+FB01>rst ,- or, to borrow the language of mathema
tics, the law remains always the same, but the constants which
enter into its expression vary from day to day.
   My measurements were made with an apparatus which con
sisted simply of a strip of wood, one foot in length, which carried

the whole being attached to a graduated are. Telescopes, or strictly
dioptric apparatus, are of no use, inasmuch as they limit the
view too much, and introduce disturbing effects of contrast.
For the results of the measurements      I must refer to my before
mentioned paper.
    II. All the theoretical investigations which have hitherto been
made upon twilight are fundamentally nothing more than further
developments of the theory promulgated by the Arabic astrono
mer Alhazen.      According to this view, the part of the sky from
which light can reach us after a single retlexion, is separated
from the part which cannot give us light except by at least two
re<U+FB02>exions by a bow, which was called the <U+FB01>rst twilight-bow,
and whose height above the horizon depended only, according to
this view, upon the position of the sun, and upon the height of
the atmosphere, Hence the phenomena of twilight were re
garded as affording a proper basis for determining the height of
the atmosphere ; but it is well known that no serviceable results
were thus arrived at.     A de<U+FB01>nition, similar to that of the <U+FB01>rst,
was given of a supposed second twilight-bow; and places were
said to be in the <U+FB01>rst twilight when the <U+FB01>rst twilight-bow was
above their horizon, and in the second twilight when the second
how was above their horizon.
    A glance is enough to show the insuf<U+FB01>ciency of this theory.
The dark segment, of which, according to this supposition, the
<U+FB01>rst twilight-bow marks the limit, and which ought therefore
to advance over the whole sky according to a perfectly de<U+FB01>nite
law, disappears at a very moderate elevation, and follows in
other respects quite a different course.       If, for instance, the
height of the atmosphere is calculated on the basis of this
theory from the measurements of this phenomenon, each ob
servation gives a greater value than the preceding one.          The
results, indeed, vary from 0'05 to 2 geographical miles.         The
bright segment and that very remarkable phenomenon the
purple light, are left entirely out of consideration in the old
theory.
   Moreover    the observed division into the <U+FB01>rst and second
twilight does   not by any means answer to what the theory re
quires.   For, according to this, the end of the <U+FB01>rst twilight
ought to coincide with the beginning of the second, whereas in
reality the two encroach upon each other.     The course of the
second  is, indeed, completely analogous to that of the <U+FB01>rst,    if
only we assume that the <U+FB01>rst purple 'light plays exactly the
same part in relation to the production of the second twilight
that the sun does in the case of the <U+FB01>rst.   That    to say, the
                                                          is

 moment of the complete disappearance of the <U+FB01>rst purple light
 must be taken as the beginning of the second twilight; and this
 takes place nearly at the middle of the <U+FB01>rst, for the <U+FB01>rst bright
 segment does not set until the sun is from about 9 to 12 degrees
 below the horizon.
     I will content myself with having, on the one hand, esta
 blished the course of the phenomena, and having, on the other
 hand, demonstrated that the theory hitherto accepted is alto
 gether incorrect and insuf<U+FB01>cient, without venturing to try to
 replace it by a better.    I believe, nevertheless, that the beha
 viour of the <U+FB01>rst dark and bright segments is quite capable of
 explanation when the problem is regarded from the photo
metric point of view.     The brightness of any portion of the sky
must in fact depend, <U+FB01>rst, upon the number of illuminated
particles which lie upon the straight line drawn from the 0b
 servcr’s eye to the point in question; secondly, upon the ab
sorption of light by the atmosphere; and lastly, upon various
other conditions of more or less importance.        If, in the mean
time, we consider only the two <U+FB01>rst-named conditions, it is easy
to see that, after sunset, there must be two zones with a maxi
 mum of brightness, the lower limit of the. countertwilight and
the twilight-sheen.     According to this, the latter would mark
the limit between those points of the sky which send us chie<U+FB02>y
 transmitted light and those which send us chiefly re<U+FB02>ected light.
     The difference of colour which may be remarked on the two
sides of this zone is a con<U+FB01>rmation of the truth of this view.    In
like manner the course of the phenomena, as it results from
measurements, accords in general entirely with the conception
here indicated.
    The above are the most important results of an investigation
which I am unfortunately unable to pursue, from want of a proper
place for making observations.
    Brie<U+FB02>y stated, they are as follows :—
    Twilight consists of a <U+FB01>rst and a second period, each of which
exhibits the dark and the bright segment with the twilight-sheen
and the purple light.
    These two periods of twilight overlap each other, so that the
beginning of the second coincides approximately with the end of
the <U+FB01>rst half of the <U+FB01>rst period.
    In the morning the same phenomena may be observed, but
they follow each other in the inverse order.

will call conductors, held by insulating supports.       At their free
ends they are provided with binding-screws for fastening wires;
at the other, with which they approach the glass disk, with radial
cross bars: these latter in turn are provided with a great number
of <U+FB01>ne points § an inch long, which stand quite near the disk,
but without touching it. These series of points are opposite the
external parts of the coatings.
   For the sake of greater insulation, it is best to coat the disks
with a solution of shellac.       By the working of the apparatus,
the rotating disk especially becomes a conductor ; for it gradu
ally gets covered with an exceedingly <U+FB01>ne dust, which appears to
consist of carbon, and to be formed from the decomposition of
the resin.    After three or four hours’ continuous activity the
action perceptibly decreases; and then, if a further decrease is
injurious, the disk is taken out and the dust removed by a
moistened pad.        From time to time, a new coating of shellac
is desirable, to keep the action at the same level.
   The principle on which the apparatus works presupposes a eer~
tain electrical excitation; and as this is not effected by the rota
tion of the disk alone, it must be given by a previously electri<U+FB01>ed
body.     For this a thin plate of vulcanite, about 4 inches broad
and twice as long, is well adapted, especially when the surface,
which is sometimes a good conductor, has been removed by scra
ping with a. knife.     This becomes electrical when it is laid on a
table and rubbed with fur, and more easily if this is done alter
nately on both sides. The electri<U+FB01>ed surface is brought near to
one of the coatings, while the disk rotates like the hand of a
watch, and the conductors are connected with each other or with
the earth.     The two coatings then immediately take opposite
electrical charges, whose intensity increases, accompanied by a
crackling noise, till after a few minutes a de<U+FB01>nite and provi
sionally constant maximum value is obtained.         At the same time
a continuous     electrical current is established, with which, as
long as it is not completely broken, experiments can be made.
   For this purpose a discharger is very convenient, which con
sists of three insulated brass supports.     If the two outside ones,
a and 0 (<U+FB01>g. 2, Plate V.), are connected with the conductors, or
one of them with the earth, the striking-distance between a and
b can be varied by means of the moveable wires m and n ; while
between b and 0, instead of the wire I, the body which is to be
exposed to the action of the current can be inserted.
   The current loses its continuity if the wires m and n are not
in perfect contact; for the tone which accompanies the lumi
nous phenomenon shows that it consists of a great number of
small discharges.       If these discharges are to be intensi<U+FB01>ed at

electrodes, 01' the surface of the conductors must be increased:
the latter is best effected by a Lcyden jar, the coatings of which
are connected with a and 0.
    By increasing the striking-distance, the ef<U+FB01>ciency of the ma
chine is not in general diminished.             This is best seen in charging
a jar, for the time then varies in the same ratio as the intensity
of the charge. Beyond a certain point, the striking-distance can .

repelled, while + E collects on the disk, and the latter must
again be partially bound, during half a turn, until it comes to a
notch and the points of the <U+FB01>rst coating.         Thus it is seen that
the one coating charges the other, and it is a question whether
these charges will gradually decrease or increase.
    Under the in<U+FB02>uence of the charge which the rotating disk
acquires, the quantity of the electricity on the coatings is resolved
into that which is bound and that which is free. If the indu
cing action is very slight, the charge can be so small that its
intensity is at <U+FB01>rst less than the intensity of the latter.      If the
inducing action is greater, the losses which occur during rota
tion may become so considerable that after half a turn this is
still the case.     If the glass disk has become more feebly elec
trical than the points of the coatings, the former are not electri
<U+FB01>ed by the latter, but the latter by the former.       \Vith the dis
appearance of the free E the inducing action is smaller, the
charge which the rotating disk assumes, and its inducing action,
become less and less ; the induced electricity becomes more and
more free, and that which has become free will again disappear:
the charges of the coatings must therefore be continually less
ened.    But if the glass surface at the notches is more strongly
electrical, it must inversely gradually acquire higher and higher
charges as long as the insulation permits an increase. The latter
is limited by the position of the conductors, and by the attrac
tion which is simultaneously exerted by them on the electrical
surface. This attraction is strongest if the circuit is not open, for
then it is to be regarded as a bodyin connexion with the ground.
The more completely the circuit is opened, the more will the
attraction diminish, since there is on the conductors a continu
ally higher tension which is of the same kind as that of the
glass.    The tension on the coatings will increase as long as their
mutual distance, or the distance from the notches opposite them,
permits.     From a certain point a discharge takes place through
the air.    But this point need not be reached within the limits of
the striking-distance.
   If  we consider more closely the current in the circuit, we shall
see that it consists of two currents which are different but in the
same direction.        One is formed by induction, by the glass disk
being continually charged afresh; the other is formed by the li
beration of this charge, of which only a small part is necessary
to retain the tension on the coatings.      If  we suppose these cur
rents, of which  I    will call the former the primary, and the latter
the secondary, to be separated, they must be ditferent, both
quantitatively and   in,   their maximum striking-distance. In the
<U+FB01>rst respect    the   primary will exceed the secondary, because the
charge of the disk    is    materially weakened during half   a   turn;

             M. W. Holtz     on a new  Electrical lilaclzine.      429
in the latter, on the other hand, an inverse deportment prevails,
for the tension of the free electricity on the glass surfaceis neces
sarily higher than that which results from its inducing action. But
since both currents traverse the same conductor, and one is only
a consequence of the other, the cessation of the one must follow
the cessation of the other, and the greatest striking-distance of
the primary current is at the same time that of the apparatus.
    If one of the conductors is connected with the earth, it is only
after exceeding this striking-distance that the secondary current
can disappear, since the coating opposite to it can still electrify
the glass disk.      In fact, without interrupting this current the
electrodes may be removed to more than double the distance;
but this will very soon diminish with the charge of the coating,
since no more new electricity is added.
    If there is a jar in the circuit, both currents must simultane
ously disappear when the charge has attained a de<U+FB01>nite amount.
The intensity on the coatings of the <U+FB01>xed disk sinks ; the jar allows
part of its charge to pass on to the rotating disk; and as this,
after half a turn, passes to the opposite electrical coatings, in a
short time the machine begins to work in the opposite direction.
But the jar must in this way continually be charged and again
discharged.
    Without a jar, too, inversions of the current may occur, if the
maximum striking-distance is near, and the <U+FB01>xed disk is only
 coated on its outside.    The opposite electricity then collects on
 the inside, which remains bound so long as there is a portion of
free electricity on the outside.     If this latter is lost, either in
tentionally or unintentionally, the latter begins to act induc
tively in the opposite direction.       It is very inconvenient, that
under these conditions the rotation can scarcely be interrupted
for a few seconds without, on beginning it again, the current
being found already in the opposite direction.
    By two simple arrangements the machine can be made still
more suitable for each special object.
    To keep up the action independently of the opening of the
circuit, it is necessary, as I have stated, to keep the currents
separate. The construction might easily be so altered that those
currents could only move in separate conductors; but this would
 do away with the possibility of using them together where it
was desirable to do so.      It is rather advantageous to avoid the
separation until the primary current ceases; and this is effected
as follows.
   Imagine a third conductor, which may be called g, parallel to
the others and at about a quarter of a turn from them, fastened
on the corresponding supports, and the coating marked -— pro
longed to its points and permanently joined with the conductor e,
As long as the striking-distance is within de<U+FB01>nite limits, both cur.

rents will, as before, traverse e and         For even if two conductors
are now opposite the lengthened coating, the disk will only be
charged by that which precedes it in the direction of the rotation.
It is only if the resistance between e and becomes greater that  f
                        to act, and the primary current will <U+FB01>nally
 ' gradually begins
only pass between e and g. If now the electrodes are removed,
the action of the machine undergoes thereby no interruption.
 From a certain point the secondary current will indeed disappear,
but on the conductors a constant quantity of free electricity will
be retained.      It     is,
                         moreover, not even necessary to prolong the
 coating,if  only that point of the glass opposite the conductor                            9   is
touched as often as the machine         set in motion. In this case, or

 not disturb one another, which in general will be the sooner the
  ease the greater the intensity of the free electricity, the greater
 therefore at the same time the striking-distance in the circuit.
 The maximum will therefore more or less diminish with the

    The expenditure of force which corresponded to this effect
 was, as compared with other electrical machines, very small; for
if  the disk was suddenly left to itself,           generally continued to

 constantly with a feeble bluish light.         Strati<U+FB01>cation is obtained
 when a and c are simultaneously connected with a larger jar. It
 is also obtained if the electrodes are pointed and at a very small
 distance.    With a greater striking-distance, and especially with
 the use of the above-mentioned small jar, the tube is so in
 tensely luminous that the phenomenon is quite visible even by
broad daylight.
    Physiological actions only occur if there is at the same time a
 layer of air in the circuit.       If the current of sparks is taken
 directly  on  the  hand,  it  produces an extremely smart pricking
 sensation.     If the human      body be interposed between b and 0,
 distinct shocks are felt even without a jar.          But if a and c are
simultaneously in connexion with the small jar, if the electrodes
are points and so near that they all but touch, the sensation
of a tolerably powerful induction-apparatus is felt. By gradually
increasing the striking-distance, this action may be increased to
any extent; but at a distance of 31;”, where there are still
more than <U+FB01>fty discharges in a second, it is unendurable.
    To exhibit the heating effect which the current produces in a
thin wire,   I  interposed a Riess’s air-thermometer in the circuit.
\Vith a slight inclination of the instrument the liquid <U+FB02>owed out
of the tube; with a greater inclination it assumed a more or less
constant position.       To test the heat of the sparks, I allowed
them to   strike  through a narrow glass tube into which the elec
trodes were led.       \Vithin a short time it was so warm that         I
could light a match at it. A direct lighting by the current was
produced by giving the electrodes the form of points and bring
ing them as near as possible. Phosphorus and gun-cotton were
immediately in<U+FB02>amed between such points, and <U+FB01>nely-divided
charcoal became incandescent.            Tindcr was only ignited with
great dif<U+FB01>culty, and gunpowder not at all.
    Of chemical actions, the decomposition of water may be
mentioned ; but      I may remark that I have only succeeded in it
with wires melted into glass tubes. The little bubbles ascend
in <U+FB01>ne but continuous streams, and at one electrode apparently
in double the                 at the other.   By interposing a layer of
                   quantity
air, this action was on y enfeeblcd.
    To con<U+FB01>rm the magnetic actions,          I  used the extra coil of a
Stohrer’s induction-apparatus.           In the inside, near the open
end, a magnetic needle was placed, and the current led continu
ously through the spiral; I obtained thus a pretty constant
de<U+FB02>ection of 35° to 40°.
    From further experiments it will be seen to what degree these
 actions can be increased.        In order to ascertain the in<U+FB02>uence of
the magnitude of the disk,           I  am having machines made of
various sizes, and hope soon to be in a position to report on

that of the electrical machine.

                       I
 action of an apparatus which depended on the application of this principle.
 Both disks were coated on their outside with tinfoil, and this coating was
 divided by insulating spaces into     greater or smaller number of sectors

alternately joined with each other. Those of the <U+FB01>xed disk were positively
and negatively electri<U+FB01>ed by an ordinary electrical machine. To two suc
ceeding ones conductors were opposite, which touched the rotating disk
with <U+FB01>ne wires. If these were in connexion, and the disk rotated, all the
sectors when they passed those of the solid ones were discharged and again
charged.     I have subsequently placed sixty such elements, in which the
coatings of the <U+FB01>xed disk were replaced by wires enclosed in glass, on                a
smaller apparatus, and thus rendered      possible to electrify the disk, which

          AVING had occasion to make use of the modulus of com
        mon logarithms carried to a considerable number of <U+FB01>gures,
I  attempted the veri<U+FB01>cation of the <U+FB01>gures given in Hutton’s
Tables (Introduction, Hyperbolic Logarithms) by the methods to
be met with in ordinary works, but soon gave it up, embarrassed
by the endless rows of <U+FB01>gures which the modes of procedure
required.    After a little consideration I was led to have recourse
to an expedient which had already been resorted toT for avoid
ing this irksome calculation—that of deducing the logarithm of
10 from the logarithms of a moderate number of small fractions,
the denominators of which ditl‘cr by unity from the numerators,
and are composed of a suf<U+FB01>cient number of <U+FB01>gures to ensure rapid
convergence, and, if practicable, of digits easily worked with.
The following consideration indicates the mode by which these
small fractions may be found.       If by any process the denomi
nator of a fraction can be doubled, the series into which that
fraction is introduced will converge with more than twice the
rapidity, since the higher powers will be proportionally of larger
                                                                                           w+1

     In  the examples the mode of procedure has been to make use
 of one or other of these expressions, as it may happen to suit
 itself to our immediate purpose,——that purpose being to select,
 with careful discrimination in the selection, a promising set of
 primary equations to develope ; developing these with a view to
 coalescing as man fractions as POSSible into others with larger
 denominators, at t e same time trying to secure as many small
 digits or ciphers as possible in the denominators, so as to render
  them easy divisors, and, where we fail in this, so large as to have
  but few terms to compute.            We may then proceed as follows:

LXIV.      On Electric Conduction, and the possibility of curing the
   retardation of Electric l'Vlwcs in Submarine Telegraph Lines.
   By JOHN James WATERSTON, Esq.*
       the September Number of the Philosophical Magazine              I
 IN endeavoured        to show that the thermal action in the metallic
part  of  the  voltaic  circuit took place on the surface only, and not
through     the  substance    of the conductor.     I  took for granted
that there was no question as to this being the case in the con
duction of common electricity, since all are agreed that, as charge,
it exists only on the external surface of conducting-matter.
                  I
   It appears have been too hasty in assuming this to be an
established point.        In the evidence before the committee on the
Atlantic cable, an experienced electrician holds that common
electricity is conducted through the substance of the wire, the
same as galvanic (Report, Appendix II. p. 327, § 208) ; and this
is more distinctly af<U+FB01>rmed in a class-book on chemical physics,
which there is little doubt represents what is generally held and
taught by professors.
   At p. 459, § 276, of Dr. Miller’s ‘ Chemical            Physics,’ the
process of conduction is described in the following words :—“ In
all cases where electricity is in motion, whether it be exerted by
chemical action as in the voltaic pile, or by. friction as in the
common electrical machine, the force is conveyed by the entire
thickness of the conductor; the charge is not con<U+FB01>ned to the sur
face, as occurs when the power is stationary, and produces effects
by induction only.”         This is a distinct statement; but the evi
dence upon which so important a point may be supposed to rest
is not given, nor is any reference made to where it may be
found.      A little further on (p. 461) a <U+FB01>gure is given of the ap
paratus    used  by M. E. Becquerel in measuring the conducting
power   of   wires  of different metals for voltaic electricity.  If by
means of such an apparatus we <U+FB01>nd that an iron wire plated will;
copper conducts the same as a copper wire of the same diameter,
and that a copper wire plated with tin conducts no better than a tin
wire of the same diameter, we may at once conclude by such cru
cial experiment that voltaic electric conduction is a surface phe
nomenon; and e. g. in designing a submarine telegraph-cable
with its strength in the core, we may be convinced of the pro
pricty of rather having a steel wire coated with copper than, as
in Allan’s system, a copper central wire with steel wires enclo
sing it.
   That common electric conduction is a surface phenomenon
may, I think, be held to be a direct consequence of its existing

 Let A and D be connected to earth or

 located on the sides of B and C that are
 adjacent to A and D, being inductively
retained there as in the magic pane.
 Let this charged system        BLLC      be
 supposed to move closer to A, the sur
 face B draws nearer to A, and simulta-                 (L.____

 B and A now becomes greater than
 between C and D. Also the quantity of electricity engaged
 between B and A becomes greater than between C and D.
 Electricity leaves C and travels to B ; and this takes place more
 and more as B gets closer to A.          Thus we have a current of
 positive electricit   travelling from    C   to B and conducted by
 means of' LL.       f the motion of the system is towards D, a
positive current travels back from B to C. Thus a current may
 be made to flow in either direction by mechanical force applied
to the system, and it may be made to flow with greater or
less speed according as the movement is made more or less
promptly.
    Let an electroscope   be placed at  G:   the leaves will show maxi
mum divergence when the system is exactly in the middle between
A and D, and will close as C approximates D orB approximates
A. We may assume the distance between B and A to be less
than any given magnitude, in which case the tension of the
electricity becomes inde<U+FB01>nitely small (although discharge has
been prevented by the interposed dielectric).                   By applying
mechanical force and expending work, we separate the plates
and raise the tension of the electricity, which consequently
moves along the conductor; and this may be supposed to be
effected with an inde<U+FB01>nitely great quickness, so as to represent
the discharge of a Lcyden jar. Those who af<U+FB01>rm that electricity

L L,” call upon us to believe that, while at the beginning and
end of any minute interval in the above motion the charge is
con<U+FB01>ned to the surface, yet during the minute interval in which
the electricity is in motion it burrows below the surface and
moves through the body of the conductor.
   That the actual potentiality of the electric force resides, not
upon the charged surface, but in the space ad'aeent and exterior
to   it,
      has,     think, been experimentally esta lished (see
               I                                               54-,               §
“Electrical    Experiments,” Phil. Mag. February 1865).            That
such   is also the case with the electricity of the galvanic current
 we have some proof in the phenomena of induced currents.             It
is true that    current of this kind (M), while the circuit
                a                                                closed,     is
 does not induce      current in an adjacent wire circuit (N) at rest,
                         a
but the inductive in<U+FB02>uence           manifested when N approaches
                                    is
or recedes from M; therefore that very potential in<U+FB02>uence ema
nating from M must exist in the space occupied                 before N
                                                                    by   N
begins to move, and before the inductive current consequent to
that motion makes its appearance.            That change of distance
between     N and M should be accompanied               by
                                                     change of electric

Mr. Latimer Clark (Report on the Atlantic Cable, Appendix II.
§    23, 25).
    Should the crucial experiment above suggested prove that con
duction in metal conductors         is
                                    a surface phenomenon,       think    I            it
will be found possible to avoid the retarding effect of induction
in submarine cables.        The mere covering of gutta percha upon
a  wire does not cause retardation (Atlantic Cable Report, Appen
dix II.    69).
           §        The presence of       conducting medium on the
                                              a
outside of covered wire        is
                              necessary.    Hitherto experiments seem
to have been confined to iron and water as the outside conductors.
So far as   I know, the effect of copper as outside conductor has
not yet been tried.      Iron has one-sixth or one-seventh the con
ducting-power     of copper; water only about 1000 millionth.
Electric conduction as whole depends on the freedom of motion
                             a
allowed to the force as      whole.
                              a        The induced current should thus
have the same freedom to move as the primary.
    Practical considerations would probably require that the
outside copper conductor should be insulated          so that, to make
                                                        ;
the trial effectively,         would be necessary to connect the

  of the battery, while the other pole led
   to the central wire.         At the signal
  end, of course, a similar arrangement
   (<U+FB01>g. 2). This would give to the in
  duced current the same propelling force
  as the primary, and utilize the half of
  the power of the battery that is now lost
  by putting to earth.        That putting to
  earth is discharge of half the force of the
  current is an obvious deduction from
  theory (see Phil. Mag. for March 1865),
 but it has also been experimentally
 proved by Wheatstone (Atlantic Cable
                                                         Fig. 2.
 Report, p. 292, Exp. 5).            At p. 103,
  § 30, Atlantic Cable Report, a similar
 arrangement to <U+FB01>g. 2 is suggested by
 Mr. C. V. Walker; but the necessity of
 having the outside and inside conductor
 of the same metal—the vital point in
 my opinion—is not insisted upon. This
 arrangement would exclude earth-cur
 rents (§§ 21, 25, p. 102, Atlantic Cable
 Report); and if the signal-house, as well
 as the shore end of the cable, be iron                          {\
 covered, it is dif<U+FB01>cult to see how atmo
 spheric electricity could intrude upon
 the signals.
       There are other considerations with
respect to conduction that press upon
the attention as suggested by theore
tical considerations, but it would be

together with some oxide of zinc, which is washed by decantation.
    Either of the precipitates obtained by the above methods is
 dissolved in nitric acid, the lead precipitated by sulphuric acid,
 and the other foreign metals by sulphuretted hydrogen; the
latter removed by warming, the iron oxidized by chlorate of pot
 ash, and precipitated by ammonia.               The precipitate contains
 indium, together with iron and some zinc.             This is dissolved in
 acetic acid and heated with sulphuretted hydrogen, which precipi
 tates all the indium, with some iron and zinc, which adhere to it
 very pertinaciously.      They are best removed by dissolving the
 sulphide in hydrochloric acid, boiling well to expel sulphuretted
 hydrogen, and allowing the mixture to stand for twelve to twenty
 four hours with excess of carbonate of baryta.               This process is
 well adapted for the quantitative determination of indium.
    The oxide is best reduced by heating it in a very slow current
 of hydrogen.        The metal is thus obtained in several small
 globules, which can be melted under cyanide of potassium to a
 regulus.
    Indium in its colour resembles platinum; it is softer than lead,
 can be cut   with a knife, and rolled out in thin sheets by very
 slight pressure. It colours paper, and takes the brightest polish
 with a <U+FB01>ne cloth.       It retains its lustre in the air. It dissolves
 in dilute hydrochloric and sulphuric acids with disengagement
 of hydrogen, gives sulphurous acid with concentrated sulphuric
 acid, and is quickly oxidized by nitric acid.            Heated in a cru
 cible to bright redness, it evaporates and burns with a violet light
 to a yellow oxide.     Its speci<U+FB01>c gravity is 7362 at 15°.
    The oxide InO appears to be the only one. It is of a straw

a honey-yellow        colour and transparent.          Its salts are white.
From their      solutions   zinc precipitates  the metal   in white lustrous
laminae.     The hydrated oxide is a white voluminous precipitate
like alumina, quite insoluble in ammonia and the <U+FB01>xed alkalies.
    Sulphate of indium was obtained in indistinct crystals.             It is
more soluble and more dif<U+FB01>cult to crystallize than the zinc sul
phate.      Nitrate of indium readily crystallizes from an acid solu
tion,  in  stellate  groups of prisms.
    Sulphide of indium is precipitated by sulphnrettcd hydrogen
from an acetic acid solution as a yellow slimy precipitate, which
dries up to reddish-brown brittle pieces.           The presence of strong
acids prevents the precipitation.            The clear yellow precipitate
produced by sulphide of ammonium is dissolved in an excess of
the precipitant when warm.             On cooling, the sulphide is again
dep0sited, probably       as  hydrate.
    \Vinkler found the atomic weight of the metal to be somewhat
less than that found by the discoverers (37'128). He determined
it by converting the nitrate into oxide by ignition.               He found
the number 35'9l8 as the mean of three determinations.
    Dr. Bottger describes* the following simple method of ob
taining selenium from the residue of the sulphuric-acid works.
The mass is freed from acid by repeated washings with water;
it is then boiled with a concentrated solution of sulphite of soda
until it has become quite black in colour, owing to the presence
of lead. The solution is then <U+FB01>ltered through a double <U+FB01>lter
paper, and the <U+FB01>ltrate is allowed to drop into dilute hydrochloric
acid. The selenium, which has been dissolved up by the sulphite,
is then immediately precipitated in thick vermillion-coloured
<U+FB02>akes, which, in case any foreign matters adhere to them, may
be perfectly puri<U+FB01>ed by being again subjected to the same
treatment.
    Marignac has investigated         a number of niobium compounds-r,
both analytically       and   crystallographically.       Rose described a
<U+FB02>uoride of niobium which          he  called Untemiob<U+FB02>um‘id.       He consi
dered it to be the <U+FB02>uoride of an allotropic modi<U+FB01>cation of the
metal niobium, Unterniobium, Hub Fla; Marignac has investi
gated a number of double salts of this body, all of which cry
stallize Well, and exhibit simple ratios of composition.
    The analysis shows that this <U+FB02>uoride contains three atoms of
<U+FB02>uorine.      The double salts are isomorphous with the correspond

ing double <U+FB02>uorides of tin and titanium. In all cases the group
 Hnb Fl3 (if Hnb represents the atomic weight of niobium in the
hyponiobic compounds) is exactly equivalent to a molecule of
<U+FB02>uoride of tin, Sn F1“, or <U+FB02>uoride of titanium, Ti F14.
   To bring this into accordance with the doctrine of isomor
phism, _two suppositions are possible.      If hyponiobium is an
element, then it must be assumed that hitherto unknown <U+FB02>uo
rides of tin and titanium, Sn F1 and Ti F], are compound radicals
which play the part of metallic elements, just as ammonium
replaces potassium.
   Or hyponiobium is not a simple body as Rose had supposed,
but contains one atom of a metalloid which is isomorphous with
<U+FB02>uorine.
   Now not only are the <U+FB02>uoride-of-hyponiobium double salts iso
morphous with those of <U+FB02>uoride of titanium, but also with those
of oxy<U+FB02>uoride of tungsten. All these compounds acquire analo
gous formulae, if it is assumed that hyponiobium is an oxide,
NbQ.      These <U+FB02>uorine double salts stand then, as regards their
composition, intermediate between the potassium <U+FB02>uoride of
titanium and the potassium oxy<U+FB02>uoride of tungsten, thus—
                         Ti  K9 F16,   H9 9,

                         W K9 F14 9“, H92 9.
   On this view the chloride of hyponiobium becomes an oxy
chloride, NbQCla; hyponiobic acid, or properly ozyniobic acid,
has the formula Nbi2 05, or perhaps (NbQY' 98.
   Marignac found for the equivalent of niobium, on this view, the
number 93 (11:1,      9:  16) (Rose found 97-6).    If hyponiobium
is an oxide, several peculiarities in Rose’s investigation      are
cleared up.    In his chloride of hyponiobium he always found
oxygen, which be ascribed to an admixture of a certain quantity
of an oxychloride.    But on determining the amount of oxygen,
he obtained three times as much as he could have done on this
supposition, and be ascribed the result to an error of experiment.
His analyses agree, however, better with the formula Nb9Cl8
than with NbCls.      0n the new supposition, too, it is easy to
see why Rose failed in converting the chloride of hyponiobium
into chloride of niobium by excess of chlorine.
 '
    M arignac’s formulae have acquired a con<U+FB01>rmation in the
experiments of Deville and Troost, who have determined the
vapour-density of oxychloride of niobium, as they had previously

440° and 7'89 at 860°.      The formula l‘leCla requires 7'5.

takes place easily, provided the temperature at which oxide of
niobium is reduced is not exceeded.    The magnesium and the
platinum boat in which the reduction took place were covered
with apparently regular lustrous crystals, which were not altered
by water, and when heated in the air were changed into hypo
niobic acid.   Crystals of the same kind were obtained when
hyponiobate of potash was heated with sodium.      Probably this
body stands to niobium in the same relation as Peligot’s uranyle

economical light is obtained    instead of pure magnesium, an

  Mitscherlich* describes              a method        according     to which,          as he
states, chlorine, iodine, and bromine compounds can be discovered
by the spectrum-apparatus, and even the smallest quantities of                                  ’
these halogens detected.
   The method depends upon the property which copper has of
forming compounds with the halogens, which are very hard to
decompose by the in<U+FB02>uence of other substances, and are only
resolved into their constituents at the highest attainable tempe
rature.   The spectra of these compounds are admirably adapted
for recognizing the smallest quantities of the halogens.         In this
respect copper   has a material   advantage   over other metals,   inas
much as their haloid compounds are decomposed into their con
stituents at lower temperatures, and the spectra either of the
oxide or of the metal are obtained.
    The application of the new method is as follows.         The dried

   It has usually been considered that nascent hydrogen acted
on nitric acid in two ways: either there was        partial removal  a
of oxygen with production of lower oxides of nitrogen, or there
was    atotal removal of the oxygen, while at the same time hydro
gen was taken up, producing therefore ammonia.        Lossen, how
ever, has shown* that under certain circumstances           body              a   is
obtained which stands between the oxygen compounds of nitro
gen and its hydrogen compound ammonia—a product of the
reduction of nitric acid which has parted with some of its oxygen
and has taken up hydrogen.        This body, whose composition                    is
represented        by
                 the formula NH8 O, L0ssen calls hydroz'ylamine.
   It produced
          is                by
                       the action of tin and hydrochloric acid on
nitric ether. The mixture soon becomes heated, but without
any considerable disengagement of hydrogen.       When the action
is complete, the tin     removed is                     by
                                      sulphuretted hydrogen, and
after concentration, at <U+FB01>rst large quantities of sal-ammoniae
crystallize out, and afterwards the hydrochloric compound of
the new body.      This     separated from the sal-ainmoniac
                                      is                                          by
treatment with absolute alcohol, and then precipitating the sal
ammoniac with bichloride of platinum, which does not precipi
tate the hydrochlorate of hydroxylamine.
   Leaving out of view the ethyle of the nitric ether, which                      is
simply exchanged for hydrogen, the formation of hydroxylamine
is thus expressed,

The hydrochlorate 0f hydroxylamine has the formula N113 0, HCl.
It crystallizes in distinct prisms. The sulphate, which also crys
tallizes, has the formula 2NH39, H" S9“. The nitrate is extremely
soluble, and could not be obtained in crystals. The oxalate crys
tallizes from a hot saturated solution in beautiful prisms.           It
has the formula .‘ZNH3      0, (3‘2 H2 94.
    Hitherto the body has not been obtained pure in the free
state.    \Vhen a strong solution of one of its salts is treated with
caustic potash, a disengagement of nitrogen takes place with the
simultaneous formation of ammonia.           The decomposition is es
sentially expressed by the equation
                    3NH39=NH3+2N+3HQ 9.
If in   a solution   of this sulphate the sulphuric acid is exactly
precipitated     by baryta-water, a solution of hydroxylamine          is
obtained which is somewhat more stable.                It can be boiled
without any material decomposition taking place; and a part of
the hydroxylamine passes off with the aqueous vapour.
    Hydroxylamine is an oxygen base which differs from the
metallic oxides in the mode in which it unites with acids. While
the latter unite with acids with liberation of water, hydroxyl
amine, like ammonia, unites directly with the acids.          Hydroxyl
amine is an ammonia in which an atom of hydrogen is replaced
by the radical H9. To this radical the name hydroxyle has
long been given; and the compound NH39 is as much entitled
to the name hydroxylamine as the compound NGH5 to the name
methylamine.

    Berlandt* describes the following method of giving a conduct
 ing surface to a body which is to be electrotyped. The impression
 is wetted with dilute alcohol to avoid the formation of air-bubbles,
 then washed with distilled water, and while still wet a solution
 of nitrate of silver (one in four of water) is poured over it ; in a
 few minutes the excess of liquid is poured of, and a solution of
 green vitriol (one in three) poured over it.        In <U+FB01>ve minutes this
 is allowed to drain off; the impression is again treated with
  solution of silver, and then with vitriol solution three or four
 times, till the surface of reduced silver has a whitish-grey colour.
  The impression is then washed with pure water and snb'ected t0
 the action of the electric current. At the <U+FB01>rst moment t e entire
 cast is covered with a thin layer of copper of dark brown colour,
  and in a few minutes the layer, which <U+FB01>rmly adheres, acquires a
 natural copper-colour.

 A. C. Godwin-Austen, Esq., F.R.S., For.       Sec. G.S.
     The submerged forest of Porlock Bay has been brie<U+FB02>y noticed by
 Sir H. De la Beche, but has not been suf<U+FB01>ciently described, inasmuch
 as it illustrates more clearly than the larger forests of Bridgewater
 Level or Swansea Bay the nature and order of the oscillations of
 small amount which have taken place at times shortly antecedent to
 the present, and which were classi<U+FB01>ed by the author in this paper as
 follows :—(1) The formation of an angular detritus and its accumu
 lation at lower levels; at this period the land was at its highest
 relative elevation.    (2) Forest-growths established on the detrital
 beds just mentioned; the stumps of these forest-trees, some of which
 are of large size and great age, at present constitute the Submerged
 Forest.          Accumulation of freshwater mud (resulting probably
 from a depression of the land), by which the trees were killed.
 (4) Surface of water-plant growths on the mud-deposit, or nearly
 dry surface, on which the trees fell.     (5) Area depressed below the
 sea-level, and sea-mud with Scrobiculariw deposited.          (6) Conver
 sion of the surface into meadow-land at the level of the highest
 springs of the present day, caused by re-elevation.          (7) Shingle,
 heaped up on the meadow-land, and showing that the most recent
 change has been one of slight depression.
    This succession of changes corresponds with that of numerous
 other localities in the West of England; and as Mr. Godwin-Austen
 considered the angular detritus (1) to be the result of suba'érial
 weathering, which took place over this area approximately contem
poraneously with the deposition of the Boulder-formation in more
northern districts, this Porlock submerged forest seems to <U+FB01>x a rela
tive date for the rest—namely, as being subsequent to the Glacial
 Period.     By this means, also, a relative date is arrived at for many
of the raised beaches in the West of England, as of that near Baggy
Point, where the old sen-bed, at an elevation of 60 feet, is covered
by an enormous accumulation of angular debris ; these raised beaches
may therefore correspond in time to certain marine deposits, which, in
Norfolk and Suffolk, next underlie the great “ Boulder Formation."

   After a brief description of these well-known “    Roads.” the author
gave an analysis of the two principal theories that have been started
to account for their formation—namely, the Ice~dum theory and the
Marine theory. With regard to the <U+FB01>rst theory, Mr. Boog Watson
stated his opinion that, although it has some strong points, especially
                                                                      ”

it is weak inasmuch as the cause assigned is extremely local in its
action, while the phenomena to be explained are very general and
have a wide range—terraces similar to those of Glen ltoy occurring
in Scandinavia and elsewhere.       In the author's opinion, also, the
ice-dam is impossible, and would be inef<U+FB01>cient if possible ; it would
not be watertight, and there is no place for it in the history of the
Postpliocene changes in Scotland.        But he remarked that objec
tions like these cannot be urged against the Marine theory, as the
sea has been on the spot, and is able to perform the work required
of it. At the same time the author admitted that the Marine
theory is not free from dif<U+FB01>culties, the chief being the perfection and
                      “ Roads," and their barrenness in marine
horizontality of the                                             organ
isms; and he concluded by suggesting some explanations of these
apparent      anomalies.

still very obscure but very important problem, which we shall sooner
      a
or later solve:      I  mean that of the relation existing between the
function of the nerves and electricity. Being convinced that my
later experiments upon the electromotor power of the organ of
the torpedo in a stale of repose are calculated to throw great light
upon this problem, was unwilling to lose the opportunity offered by

 _ There      is no dif<U+FB01>culty in discovering the electromotor power of
the organ of the torpedo independently of the discharge,              in the
 state which    I  have called that    of
                                        repose      : only requisite to pos
                                                        it   is
 sess galvanometer sensitive to the muscular current of the frog, and
      a
 to close the ends of the instrument with two plates of amalga
 mated zinc plunged in sulphate of zinc. and communicating with
 each other by pads of <U+FB02>annel or <U+FB01>ltering-paper.           The galvanometer
 which    I used was not provided with         good astatic system; so that
                                                a
I    only obtained a deviation of from 40 to 45 degrees with the
 gastrocnemius of        anot very lively frog. With this instrument,                 a
 piece   of  the  organ  cut  from    asmall torpedo which had ceased to
 give discharges, produced       a deviation  of 14 or 15 degrees in the
 same direction of the current as that obtained at the moment of
 the discharge.        This result    isconstant. The following are the
 principal results at which       Iarrived, and which con<U+FB01>rm my former
 experiments.
      1. A piece of the electric organ. cut from        torpedo which gave
                                                              a
 no sensible discharge to the galvanoscopic frog when its skin was
  irritated; gives   a constant cunent between the dorsal and abdominal
  surfaces in the same direction as the discharge obtained on pulling

 454             Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
 or cutting the nerves of this piece.      With a delicate galvanometer,‘
 the needle of the galvanometer      settles at 40 or 50 degrees, and
 remains so for along time.      I obtained a persistent and well-marked
 deviation with some portions of the organ which had been kept for
 <U+FB01>ve or six days in a cavity made in a piece of ice.         It has been
 thought (I believe, in Germany) that this electromotor power of the
 organ of the torpedo in a state of repose was analogous to that of
 living muscles; but experiment does not appear to me to support
 this hypothesis.
     2. In fact, the electromotor power of the organ of the torpedo
 in a state of repose increases markedly after the portion of the organ
 has been made to give the discharge by the irritation of its nerves.
 This increase also remains for a certain time, and diminishes but
 very slowly.     I may relate in regard to this point, an experiment
 which never fails to succeed, and which consists in opposing two
 portions of the organ cut from the same torpedo, in such way that
 no sign of the differential current is given.    If the nerves of one of
the portions be then irritated, and the circuit of the galvanometer
be re-established, the needle will immediately be seen to deviate,
from the existence of a strong ditferential current, which is per
 sistent, and is owing to the irritated organ. We know that on
repeating the same experiment with two pieces of muscle, the very
opposite result is obtained.
    3. During the very hot season especially, I have met with some
torpedoes which,when outof the water, rapidly lost their electric func
tion, and in which the electromotor power in a state of repose was
none, or almost none.        On irritating the nerves of the organ of
these torpedoes, or on wounding the fourth lobe, the electromotor
power reappeared immediately and remained for a certain time. I
am thus more than ever induced to believe that, instead of interpo
sing the chemical action of the muscular respiration, as is done with
good foundation to account for the electric power of the living mus
cles, the electricity of the torpedo and other electric <U+FB01>shes ought
to be attributed to kinds of secondary piles formed in the cells of
the electric organs by the action of the nerves.         Just as nervous
action intervenes to cause in the organs of secretion the production
of liquids of different chemical nature, so we may conceive similar
effects to be produced in the elementary cells of the electric organs.
We know that the organ of the torpedo, in repose or activity, does
not exert an action upon the atmospheric air analogous to that
which is produced by muscle in a state of repose or contraction.
So also the in<U+FB02>uence of nervous irritation in increasing in a double
manner the electromotor power of the organ of the torpedo cannot
be conceived without imagining that it is due to an unceasingly
acting cause, such as the presence of two substances capable of
acting chemically upon each other, and constantly reproduced by
the action of the nerves.      I consider that this hypothesis merely
indicates the direction in which we may be led to make new expe
riments with the hope of some success.
    I pro<U+FB01>ted by this opportunity to try upon the rays some beautiful
experiments recently performed by M. Robin.           Several years ago,

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                 455
after this skilful anatomist had announced the discovery of an organ
in  the rays analogous to that of the torpedo, [tried in vain to obtain
signs of electricity in the organ of the ray. In regard to this point,
1 must own that I was only able to operate upon small and not very
lively rays, and that very probably I did not succeed in satisfactorily
detecting the organ found by M. Robin.                M. Schitf has lately
helped me in the preparation, and has taught me to recognize the
organ of the ray.         Operating upon a very lively and tolerably
large ray,   and   inducing in this <U+FB01>sh a number of very strong con
tractions, I obtained with the galvanoscopic frog, the nerve of which
was laid upon the organ, evident signs of electric discharges.              I
wished to vary this experiment and to repeat it upon other
rays, but I was unable to procure them.            As the electric organ of
the ray is enveloped in a large quantity of muscular substance, I
would suggest to M. Robin to repeat and vary his beautiful experi
ment by operating upon the isolated organ of the <U+FB01>sh, so that no
doubt may remain that the electric effects obtained are not attri
butable to the muscular <U+FB01>bre. The difference in the dimensions and
the number of the elementary cells, and the nerves, of the electric
organ of the ray and that of the other electric <U+FB01>shes, gives great
importance to the complete study of this function of the ray; and
 this study should explain the peculiar electric phenomena discovered
by M. Robin in the electric function of the ray, and which cannot be

                            BY M.    J.  PELOUZE.
    It is well known that the sesquioxide of chrome imparts a green
 colour to <U+FB02>uxes, and especially to glass.        The bichromate of potash
 possesses  the  same   property, as  it is decomposed   by heat into oxide
 of chrome and neutral chromate of potash. The latter salt is in its
 turn decomposed by the silica, whence result oxygen, silicate of
 potash, and oxide of chrome.
  _ Hence, in the presence of silica, all the chromic acid of the alkaline
bichromate passes into the state of oxide of chrome, which remains
in the glass.     If the proportion of the salt is small, the glass is trans
 parent, perfectly homogeneous, and of a green colour with a yellowish
 tinge. But if it is larger in a certain proportion, spangles of the
 sesquioxide of chrome are found in the glass.
    My experiments were made with the following proportions, which
 have always been the same, the proportion of the chromate alone
 being variable :—
                  Sand                             250parts,
                  Carbonate of soda . . . . . .    100   ,,
                  Calcareous spar . . . . . . . .   50 ,,
  . First EzperimenL—With 10 grms. of the bichromate the glass
 melts, re<U+FB01>nes, and anneals well.         It is homogeneous, transparent,
 and green with a tinge of yellow.
   :Second Experiment—“Tim 20 grms. of the bichromate the glass is
 worked and annealed as easily as in the preceding case; its colour

456            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
is very dark green, and minute spangles of the sesquioxide of chrome
are easily recognized in it.
    Third Experiment—‘Vith 4O grms. of the hichromatc, the fusion
is decidedly more dif<U+FB01>cult, and the glass is <U+FB01>lled with extremely
brilliant crystals. Those persons who saw specimens of this glass,
at once compared it to Venetian aventurine,      and called it chrome
aventurine, which name I propose to retain.
   FourthErperiment.—VVith 50 grins. of the bichromate, fusion is ex
tremely dif<U+FB01>cult. The glass is <U+FB01>lled with a confused mass of span
gles, and has no longer the lustre and beauty of the preceding.
   Hence the best proportions for the preparation of the chrome
aventurine are these :—
                 Sand . . . .                 250 parts,
                Carbonate of soda. . . . . .  100   ,,
                Carbonate of lime . . . . . .  50   ,,
                Bichromate of potash      . .  4O   ,,
  The resulting     glass contains from 6 to 7 per cent. of oxide of
chromeI   nearly  half of which is combined with the glass, the other
half remaining free in the form of brilliant scales or spangles.
   The green aventurine is much more easily prepared than the
Venetian.     It exists during the fusion of the glass, while the latter
is only formed during the annealing.        Imay refer those who are
interested in this question to Fremy and Clémandot’s paper upon
arti<U+FB01>cial aventurine in the Camptes Rendus for 1846, p. 341*.
   Chrome aventurine sparkles in the sun and in strongly lighted
places; in this respect it is surpassed by the diamond alone.       It is
harder than common glass, which it scratches and cuts easily, and
is especially harder than the Venetian aventurine; hence its greater
value.
   Among the irregularities presented by the outlines of the spangles
disseminated in the chrome aventurine, M. Daubrée has recognized
with certainty the form of the regular hexagon, which belongs to
the crystalline system of the sesquioxide of chrome.     Moreover the
spangles have the greatest resemblance to certain varieties of lami
nated oligistic iron ore, such as are met with in certain lodes, espe
cially the specular variety; and it is well known that oligiste iron
is isomorphous with the sesquioxide of chrome.
   The colour of the new aventurine is that of the third yellowish
green, the thirteenth shade in M. Chevreul's chromatic circle.
   The lapidaries who saw my <U+FB01>rst specimens of the new aventurine,
andwho cut some of them, agree in stating that it forms an important
acquisition to their branch of manufacture, for which reason I have
thought it worth making public.—Comptes Renzlus, October 16, 1865.
      ON THE DETECTION     OF POISONING BY CARBONIC OXIDE.
                        BY M. HOPPE-SEYLER.
   Blood charged with carbonic oxide, investigated in the solar spec
trum after suitable dilution, exhibits almost exactly the same absorp
tion-bands as oxygenated blood. It'sulphide ofammonium be added,             W,“
the bands do not disappear for some days; while blood free from

    carbonic oxide, a few minutes after it has been treated with sul
    phide of ammonium, shows only one absorption-band between the
    spectrum-lines D and E. From this unalterability in the bands, the
    presence of carbonic oxide in the blood may be recognized; in the
    case of animals which have been gradually poisoned by a small quan
-   tity of carbonic oxide, the gas can in this manner be detected.
    It is desirable in such cases greatly to dilute the blood Nume
    rous cases have shown that after animals have been poisoned with
    carbonic oxide, recovery takes place in the open air if the poisoning
    has not gone too far.    And Pokrowsky has shown that in this recon
    valescence no carbonic oxide, but more carbonic acid than usual is
    exhaled.    De<U+FB01>brinated blood gradually loses its carbonic oxide on
    standing in the air; hence in forensic cases rapid investigation is
    desirable : yet several days may elapse without any appreciable
    diminution in the quantity of carbonic oxide.—Zeitschrift<U+FB01>ir   analyt.

     RELATION OF THE WEIGHT OF A MAGNETIZING SPIRAL TO THE
              MAGNETIZING FORCE.  BY DR. MENZZER.
        Ifan electro-magnet is to be constructed, the current for which
    is to be produced by a given battery, it is of practical importance to
    consider, <U+FB01>rst, what thickness and length of wire must be chosen for
    the coil, and what combination must be once for all taken in order
    to obtain the most powerful electro-magnet for the given cost.         It
    is assumed that the maximum of intensity is in all cases obtained
    when the essential resistance, or that offered by the battery, is equal
    to the external resistance in the interpolar, i. e. in this case the mag
    netizing coil.
       The author gives an investigation in a special case, from which he
    arrives at the result that

               ANOTHER.        NEW FORM OF THE HELIOTROPE.
                                BY K. A. STEINHEIL.
      The interesting paper of Professor Miller of Cambridge (Phil.
 Mag. S. 4.vol.xxx. p. 71). on two new forms of the heliotrope, reminds
 me of one which some thirty years agol had made, and which since
 then has been kept in the physical collection of our State, but has
 never been described.         A knowledge of it may contribute to complete
 the literature on this subject.
     In determining heights by triangulation, it is desirable, in order
 to get rid of part of the uncertainty of the path of a luminous ray

that the determinations of two points take place not only mutually
but simultaneously.     To make this possible, I have devised a helio
trope  which  is placed upon the tube of a theodolite telescope, and
re<U+FB02>ects the sunlight along the axis of the telescope.    By means of
it the axes of the two telescopes are brought into the same straight
line when each observer sees the light of the sun re<U+FB02>ected from the
other’s instrument.
   The instrument (see adjacent <U+FB01>gure);consists of two mirrors, a and
                            ,                              i

b, which form angles of 45° with the axes w and n. The mirrora can
rotate about the axis of 1;, b with the entire piece about the axis of :e.
By these two rotations it can be arranged that rays which fall from
any point of the sphere on a are re<U+FB02>ected at b at an angle of 45°, and
in the direction towards 1‘.     But in order to see in the telescope
whether the sun’s rays are re<U+FB02>ected towards w, an image of the sun
is needed which shall be 180° from the point that is to receive light
from the heliotrope. This is effected when the mirror b consists oftwo
 halves, a and    which are in the same plane, but <U+FB01>t against each
                [5,
other with vertically ground edges.      This line 717' must make with
 the surface of the mirror exactly an angle of 90°:        must not be
 polished, but must only be rubbed smooth, otherwise            it it
                                                            produces too
intense an image of the sun in the telescope; for the rays which
 proceed from to
