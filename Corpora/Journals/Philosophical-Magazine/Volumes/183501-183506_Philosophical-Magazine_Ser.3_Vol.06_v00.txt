2    Prof. Johnston on the Dimorphism of Baryto-calcite.
prism, and yet it bears an analogy to both. It had the oblique
character of the one form and the prismatic of the other: it
 belongs to the hemiprismatic system of Mohs.
    Since it was first examined and described by Brooke and
 Children, the baryto-calcite has been found in considerable
 quantity in several lead-mines in Alston Moor. More recently,
however, it has also been met with in other localities; but ap
parently under different circumstances, and presenting a dif
ferent appearance.     The lead-mine of Fallowfield near Hex
ham, in Northumberland, is known to modern collectors of
minerals as the locality where the finest specimens of cry
 stallized carbonate of barytes have yet been obtained. In
this mine a mineral has for some time been met with, crystal
lized in six-sided pyramids, pure white, often transparent, hav
ing occasionally a beautiful pink tinge, and sometimes opake,
from an incrustation, apparently of sulphate of barytes. More
 lately the same mineral has been met with in one of the lead
mines near Alston Moor, presenting the same characters, with
the exception of the pink tinge, which    I have not observed in
any of the specimens I have seen from that locality.
    These crystals scratch carbonate of barytes and the oblique
rhombic baryto-calcite of Brooke; have a specific gravity of
3-76 at 60°Fah, and exhibit the right prismatic form of ar
ragonite and carbonate of barytes.     The observation as to the
form, which in the present case is the most important pro
perty, has been confirmed by the examination of Professor
Miller of Cambridge.
    Another variety of the same mineral, found at Fallowfield,
has a pale cream colour and pearly lustre, and forms some
times masses, more frequently round flattish concretions of
the size of a pea and upwards. Viewed through a microscope,
these concretions present an aggregation of minute triangular
faces, being sides of hexagonal pyramids, similar to those
which in the more regularly crystallized specimens sometimes
attain nearly half an inch in length.I  have analysed both these
varieties, and found them to consist of the carbonates of lime
and barytes united atom to atom –(C+Ca) + (C + Ba)—
with scarcely a trace of iron and manganese.     These crystals
have, therefore, the same composition as the oblique rhombic
baryto-calcite of Mr. Brooke as determined by Mr. Children.
They are, however, of a different form, being right rhombic
prisms, and belonging to the proper prismatic system of Mohs,
while the oblique rhombic crystals belong to the hemipris
matic system.    This mineral, therefore, is dimorphous.
   There  is, however,a  peculiarity in  the dimorphism  of this
mineral which has not,I    believe, been observed in  any other

instance.  The ordinary form of the carbonate of barytes is
the right rhombic prism.  The carbonate of lime in arrago
nite crystallizes in the same form; there is nothing very un
expected, therefore, in a combination of the two assuming
the same form.     Neither will it be very unexpected when we
meet, as we probably hereafter shall, with a similar compound
of the two carbonates in the form of the rhomboid in which
calc spar ordinarily crystallizes.   It will be an interesting fact
when observed, but we are in some measure prepared for it
by the knowledge of the form and composition of the plumbo
calcite.   But what is remarkable in the second form of the
baryto-calcite      that    is,neither    rhomboid nor
                                              it    is        right    a                                   a

  It   iswell known that the carbonates          lime, iron, man                   of
ganese, and zinc are only plesiomorphous, the oblique angles
of  their respective rhomboids being 105° 5'—107°–107° 20',
and 107° 40'. Now, the rhombic base          Mr. Brooke's baryto              of
calcite    106° 54";
            is             considerably within the limits, there
                                         it   is

unlikely that this rhombic base, approaching         nearly     that                        so                 to

   There are two ways         which we may suppose this oblique
rhombic form        arise,                     or in
                               two principles with which we may

that the prismatic form of the witherite has modified it so
as to produce a species of hybrid or intermediate form, hav
ing the prismatic character with a less degree of obliquity
 (102°54') than the rhomboid, then it would be unnecessary as
yet to consider either the witherite as di-, or the carbonate of
lime as tri-morphous.       How far such a combination of the
forms is possible,           I
                      am not prepared at present to investigate;
it will probably, however, be from the study of the forms of
compound minerals, resulting from the union of simple minerals
whose forms are known, that we shall arrive at the first general
conclusions in regard to the connexion of the forms of che
mical compounds with those of the elements of which they
consist.
   It is not unworthy of remark, that the right rhombic baryto
calcite is harder and heavier than the oblique, a relation
similar to that which arragonite bears to the rhomboid of car
bonate of lime. If we take the mean specific gravity of calc
spar at 2-65, and that of the witherite at 4:3, and multiply
each by their atomic weights, and divide the sum of the pro
ducts by the sum of the weights, we obtain for the specific
gravity of a compound of the two, atom to atom, 3-707, rather
less than the mineral was found to possess by experiment.

   In a letter have just received from Professor Torrey of
New York, he mentions a mineral under the name of baryto
strontianite, found in considerable quantity at Kingston, Upper
Canada.     It is not unlikely that an examination of the forms
of this  compound     mineral might lead to interesting results.
Unfortunately, the specimens he sent with the letter have mis
carried.    Should this meet his eye, he may, perhaps, find an
opportunity of transmitting others.

 penetrating eye.      The result was that his arrangements in
 zoology were adopted and applauded with the same eagerness
 and universality as his arrangements in botany.             He distri
 butes animals into six classes,       mammalia, birds, amphibia,
 fishes, worms, insects *. It was a great improvement upon
 preceding arrangements, but still it is liable to many objec
 tions. Under the honourable and imposing title of Primates,
—the nobles of the creation,-it groups together men, mon
keys, and bats, in the same class and in the same order; while
it exhibits other incongruities equally palpable.            But from
arrangements founded upon the number of teeth, or of toes,
what was to be expected but unnatural associations? It should
be recollected, however, that his arrangements are professedly
artificial, and are not to be tried by such rules of criticism as
are applicable to arrangements professing to be natural. They                                           '.
 have been reformed and improved by Blumenbach +, as far,
perhaps, as they are capable of improvement; and in their
present improved state they may be regarded as making a
laudable approximation to the arrangements of nature. The
characters of the classes are taken partly from the external
structure, and partly from the internal structure. But Cuvier
in his Régne Animal, and Carus in his Introduction to the
 Comparative Anatomy of Animals, have established a new
principle of arrangement, and have shown to the satisfaction
of zoologists, that         all
                          characters     classes truly natural must

           The Rev. P. Keith                 on the Structure      of Animals.             7
 four in number, are attached, forming in their ensemble the
 skeleton or carpentry of the body.          Animals of this class are
 said to be vertebrate, Vertebrata.          They have red blood; a
 muscular heart; a mouth, the origin of the intestinal canal;
 two horizontal jaws; distinct organs of sight, smelling, hear
 ing, tasting, situated in the cavities of the head; a generally
 diffused tact or circumscribed touch; the locomotive muscles
 attached to bones; the viscera lodged in the head and trunk;
 the head distinct from the body;
                                           and the sexes in separate
 individuals. Of this general model there are many varieties,
 the descending gradations of which may very easily be traced
 from man to the meanest reptile.
    The second division of the descending animal scale includes
the Mollusca, namely, individuals which consist of a soft and
gelatinous mass, and exhibit a structure less complex than
 that of the Vertebrata. The body is without a skeleton, and
without a distinct head; the muscles being attached to the
 skin, forming a soft and contractile covering, (which in many
Species is encrusted with a shell), in which envelope the viscera
are contained, together with the nervous system, which in these
animals takes the form of scattered masses of threads. The
chief of these masses lies in [or around] the oesophagus, and
is called the brain.      Of the senses common to the Vertebrata,
they seem to possess only taste and vision; with the exception
of one family—Sepiac—which exhibits also organs of hearing.
But they have an apparatus for circulation, respiration,                               di
gestion and secretion, scarcely less complicated than that of
the preceding division.
    The third division of the descending animal scale is that of
 worms and insects, designated by the appellation of articulated
animals, Articulata, exhibiting a structure still less complicated
 [?] than that      of
                  the Mollusca. Their nervous system consists                             of
two cords, extending along the belly, and expanding              regu             at
lar intervals into knots,               or
                                 ganglia. The first      these, placed  of
 on  the oesophagus,      called the brain, though not much larger
                              is
than the rest.     The covering         the body,   of

in   others hard,       divided                by
                                     transverse folds into

number      ofrings, with the muscles attached           the interior;  to
and hence their appellation             Articulata, or,
                                                    of       MacLeay         as
would rather call them, Annulosa".            Many      them have   of                 la
teral and articulated limbs, originating          pairs, while others

 taste and       of sight, but they have no perceptible or indubitable
 organs of hearing, with the exception of a single tribe, the
 Crustacea; and the jaws, if any, are lateral.
    The fourth and lowest division of the animal scale includes
 the zoophytes of preceding naturalists, which Cuvier now de
signates by the appellation of radiate animals, Radiata. They
exhibit the greatest simplicity of animal structure, and a pe
culiarity of conformation that cannot be mistaken.         In the
foregoing divisions, the organs of motion and sensation are
found to be symmetrically placed on two respective sides of
a certain axis.      In the zoophytes [and other Radiata, the
corresponding organs are arranged in rays around a common
centre, and hence their appellation of radiate".    The subjects
of this division approach the homogeneous character of plants.
They have no distinct nervous system, nor specific organs of
sense, but merely nervous molecules dispersed throughout a
gelatinous massi. In a few of them, you may trace some faint
vestiges of a circulation, with respiratory organs on the surface
of the body. In the polypi, the intestines are a mere bag
without passage; and in the infusory animalcula, the lowest
in the animal scale, the individual is merely a homogeneous
mass of pulp, endowed with motion and feeling. With these
divisions in view, we proceed to exhibit a brief and popular
sketch, first, of the external structure, and secondly, of the
internal structure, of animals.

     Division I. THE VERTEBRATA.—Of animals of the division
Wertebrata, some are viviparous, and furnished with teats by
which they are enabled to suckle their young; this is the class
of the Mammalia: some are oviparous, and adapted by their
structure to the act of flying; this is the class of Birds: some
are destined to live in water, and adapted by their structure
to the act of swimming; this is the class of Fishes: and some
are doomed merely to crawl upon the earth, and to pass a
great part of their existence in a state of stupor; this is the
class of Reptiles.

as constituting an order of himself, into which no other genus
is worthy of being admitted, and as exhibiting a fabric that
we cannot but regard as the most perfect model of animal or
ganization.
   In surveying this model, the first thing that arrests our at

   articulate as resulting not merely from want of intellect, but
  from want of due organization also *, or of the due comple
   ment of nerves necessary to associate the several organs in one
  act of vocality.    Why they are destitute of intellect, though
  furnished with an organization approaching to that of man, it
  is not our present business to inquire; but facts show that they
  are so. How, else, are they so totally incapable of education ?
  The ourang-outang and chimpansé have even been admitted
  into human society, by way of experiment, but they have
  shown no disposition to adopt the habits and manners of men;
  and though capable of imitation in some things, they can
  never be taught to imitate the articulate tones of the human
  voice.    Besides, they have no relish for the society of men;
  and   remain,  even in the midst of mirth, “for ever silent and
 for ever sad.”      Hence, though we may fairly say of them,
  “Mens     agitat molem +,” yet we cannot say that it is the “mens
 divinior” which is proper to man.
     In quadrupeds the feet are four in number, as the name im
 ports. They are single and undivided, as in the horse; or
 they are divided into toes, of which some genera have two, as
 the ox and goat; and some more than two, as the hog and
elephant, which last has five fingers inclosed within the skin
of the foot; while others have the toes united by means of an
intervening membrane, and have hence obtained the appella
tion of web-footed, as in the case of the seal and otter. Yet the
limbs of quadrupeds, upon the whole, whether anterior or pos
terior, will be found to exhibit a striking analogy to the type of
man, if we look at and compare the same joints.

several circumstances have led me to adopt a different plan
from that therein proposed, relative to a publication on the

more canvassed of late; and at the Edinburgh Meeting of the
British Association for the Advancement of Science, some
suggestions which have been lately made led me to offer a few
remarks bearing upon an important distinction which must

be    introduced.       The nature of any such distinction cannot be
  made    intelligible   without some previous statement or expla
  nation of the     theory    referred to : to supply such a statement
  will be my object in the ensuing pages.             And I am the more
  desirous to do this, because, I believe, the elaborate researches
  of M. Cauchy are even yet but little known to British students.
  He has directed his profound analytical skill to the construc
  tion of a theory of undulations built on such an hypothesis of
 the arrangement and mutual action of a system of molecules as
 leads to results including the general theoretical explanation
 of the unequal refrangibility.
     The slowness with which a knowledge of the labours of
 Continental philosophers too commonly finds                  way into En              its

de points matériels sollicités par des forces d'attraction ou de
répulsion mutuelle.”          In this paper he considers the subject
in a very general point of view. He supposes a great number
of molecules or material points arbitrarily distributed in space,
and subject to the influence of mutual attractive or repulsive
forces tending to put them in motion. He assumes these
forces to be proportional to the masses and some function of
the distance between any two molecules; and hence proceeds
to deduce expressions which give rise to certain partial dif
ferential equations representing the motions of the molecules
under the above conditions, referred to three rectangular axes.
The investigation pursued is of a high degree of generality;
and expresses the equilibrium or motion of such a system of
particles.      It is also closely connected with another inquiry,
which he has discussed in a separate memoir, the interior
equilibrium or motion of a solid body, considered as a system
of distinct molecules.
     In the fourth volume (1829) of the same collection, p. 129,
liv. xlii., the author enters upon some further applications in
 a memoir, entitled “Sur              équations differentielles d'équili

 This    investigation,    relating chiefly      the “elasticity”         such         of
a    system, turns upon the equations                    of

 motion of a certain velocity”; but it is not simply this, for
 the velocity of wind, which is much greater than that of most
 initial soniferous impulses, does not suffice to produce sound,
 unless it meets with an obstacle; and certainly the movements
 of the earth and the heavenly bodies should, according to this
 definition, develop sound, and realize the poetic idea of “the
 music of the spheres.” A more exact physical definition
 would be, motion of a certain velocity resisted with a certain
jorce. The moving and the resisting forces, acting in op
 posite ways, constitute the vibrations of soundt.
    4. The motion of matter producing sound should be consi
 dered as molecular, although the result is the motion of a
 mass.     Let it be represented thus: an impulse being im
 pinged on certain molecules, momentarily overcomes the re
 sistance of their inertia, and causes them to start from their
 place; that force of repulsion which, existing between the dif
 ferent molecules, more or less strongly resists the attempt to
 approximate them, transfers the impulse from molecule to
 molecule, and thus extends it throughout the mass. The im
 pulse that forced these molecules from their position being
 overcome by the reaction of the elastic forces, (attractive and
 repulsive,) these forces drive them back to beyond their pro
 per station, whence, from the same cause, they again spring,
 until by a series of these alternating vibratory motions, the
 disturbing force is lostf. The assimilating or propagating
 power, then, of these vibrations depends on the repulsive and
 attractive forces (2.) of the molecules of the vibrating matter,
 and in proportion as these are strong to resist or react on a
 mechanical impulse, they will convert that impulse into a
 sonorous vibration (3.).
    5. Uniformity or equality of molecular elasticity (2.) is
   * “It     appears that the only condition necessary for the production of a
simple sound is a sufficient degree of velocity in the motion or impulse
which occasions it.”—Dr. Young's Lectures, vol. i. p. 378. Dr. Young
here considered sound in a physiological sense. The paragraphs 2, 4 and 5,
appeared in a chapter on Sound prefixed to my “Rational Exposition of
Physical Signs,” &c.,published in 1828, some years before Sir John Herschel's
articles in the Encyclopaedia Metropolitana and Philosophical Magazine re
ferred to in the Editors' notes below.

on Sound, art. 138,) is as follows: “Every impulse mechanically communi

 28            Dr. Charles J. B. Williams                   on the Production
  equally necessary for the production and propagation of so
  norous vibrations; for if the elasticity of some molecules be
  less than that of others, the reaction, being less prompt (4.),
  will produce vibrations not consentaneous with those of the
  others, and may impair or even destroy them, and this the
  more effectually the more irregular and varied these mo
  tions are. Hence in bodies of mixed density the vibrations
  do not continue, -     and the sound heard is only a stroke or
  knock.
     Now, to understand more clearly the relative power of dif
  ferent conductors with regard to sound, we will take in con
 trast the relations of two, which differ greatly, steel and air.
     6. When a piece of the former, freely suspended, is struck,
 the impulse is propagated through the particles in the manner
just described (4.), until it is expended in forcing them into an
 excursion at the opposite surface: then, their elasticity coming
 into play will determine their recoil with a similar excursion
 on the other surface, and then back again, until the disturb
 ing force is lost by friction, &c.” The continuance of the
 vibrations and the production of a tone are here independent
 of surrounding bodies. In air, on the other hand, one ele
 ment of molecular elasticity (2.4.), attraction, is wanting;
 hence, after an impulse has been applied to a body of                 this               it,
 fails     produce
          to             continued tone without the aid
                           a                                     reflecting         of
 walls of some denser matter.
     7. Another remarkable difference between air and sono                               a
 rous solid          is,
                     that tones       volumesof                   of
                                                    the former become
 deeper        proportion
               in              their size; whilst, up
                                      to                    certain limit,  to  a
 enlarging the bodies                   of
                                 solids increases the   rapidity      their              of
vibrations, and therefore heightens their tones.            The cause                            of
this difference has been sufficiently investigated with regard
to   air; but although the fact          familiar,is have not met with
                                                                  I

                                                       of  the tone                             of

that      solids

                       small thickness the impulse        not expended      is
on   reaching the opposite surface with the vibration proper                                     to
the material; hence the impulse continues            operate, and forces
                                                                       to

of a cord.  But although rapid revolutions of such a wheel,
so as to make above 100 or 150 strokes in a second, do pass
into continuous tones which can be referred to a particular
pitch in the musical scale, yet the slower rotations do not pro
duce a bass note, as an equal number of the vibrations of a
cord, but only a succession of distinct clicks.        This shows,
I  think, that the single clicks have a pitch, and that this is at
the point where their succession begins to form a continued
tone *.
    11. That single strokes have a pitch, and consist of at least
two vibrations (“semi-vibrations,” Wheatstone), is further ap
parent to an ear accustomed to distinguish between musical
notes, when they are made with different degrees of force: the
gentle strokes are obviously lower than the forcible ones.
The cause of this curious fact seems to be, that a forcible im
pulse, by momentarily increasing the density, accelerates the
vibration.     So also a very violent blow on a bell or bar, or a
forcible  pull of a cord, will make the initial vibrations quicker,
and therefore the tone sharper, than in the proper note.
This is perceptible in the loud notes of the harp; but the less
yielding tension of metallic wires makes them still more liable
to this change of tone; it is therefore most obvious in the
twang of those instruments with wires, which are acted on by
points projecting from a revolving barrel.
    12. With the exception of this effect of force (14.), the note
of continued sounds resulting from a rapid succession of
strokes, which for convenience may be called click sounds, de
pends entirely on the frequency of these strokes (10.).          In
bodies of no given tension, this rapidity is most indeterminate
and irregular; but in cords or bodies of a fixed key, when
the series of impulses surpasses in rapidity the vibrations of
the fundamental note, they will pass into         upper octave,     its                       or
                higher harmonics. This

further explanation.
   15. The echoes of a large empty room are often of a lower
pitch than the original sound; a whistle, for instance, although
answered by a similar note, will also excite a number of
echoes that are obviously lower.             As this depth of echo is in
proportion to the size of the room (14.), there is reason to be
lieve that it arises from the various stray pulses falling into
vibrations corresponding with their successive periods of re
flection.    Every room has            proper pitch   its     echo; and this             of
depends          on
              the relation                      of

echoes that    give    the   tinkling   sound          many    hollow bodies  to

singular fact I presume to depend on the greater strength of
the moderately rapid vibrations, by which they are enabled
to traverse a longer space than the fundamental note. The
same thing occurs with distant echoes; and, although natural
philosophers have not noticed this circumstance, melodrama
tists have successfully availed themselves of it to represent
the effect of an echo on the stage.  So also Shakspeare:

simplest possible forms of apparatus and experiment, that no
fallacy might be inadvertently admitted. The well known
difficulty of effecting decomposition by a single pair of plates,
except in the fluid exciting them into action (863.), seemed to
throw insurmountable obstruction in the way of such experi
ments; but I remembered the easy decomposibility of the so
lution of iodide of potassium (316.), and seeing no theoretical
reason, if metallic contact was not essential, why true electro
decomposition should not be obtained without                          even                       it,             in   a
single circuit,       persevered and succeeded.

amalgamated over the whole surface (863.), the results were
obtained with equal facility and in the same direction, even
when only dilute sulphuric acid was contained in the vessel c
(fig. 1.). Whichever end of the zinc was immersed in the
acid, still the effects were the same: so that         for       if,

duce a drop of dilute sulphuric acid, y, between them at one
end: there will be no sensible chemical action at that spot unless
the two plates are connected somewhere else, as at PZ, by a
body capable of conducting electricity.           If that body be a
metal or certain forms of     carbon,  then the current passes, and,
as it circulates  through   the fluid at y, decomposition ensues.
   890. Then remove the acid from y, and introduce a drop
of the solution of iodide of potassium at a (fig. 3.). Exactly
the same set of effects occur, except that when the metallic
communication is made at PZ, the electric current is in the
opposite direction to what it was before, as is indicated by
the arrows, which show the courses of the currents (667.).
   891. Now both the solutions used are conductors, but the
conduction in them is essentially connected with decomposi
tion (858.) in a certain constant order, and therefore the ap
pearance of the elements in certain places shows in what                   di
rection a current has passed when the solutions are thus em
ployed.    Moreover, we find that when they are used at op
posite ends of the plates, as in the last two experiments (889.
890.), metallic contact being allowed at the other extremities,
the currents are in opposite directions.         We have evidently,
therefore, the power of opposing the actions of the two fluids
simultaneously to each other at the opposite ends of the plates,
using each one as a conductor for the discharge of the current
of electricity, which the other tends to generate; in fact, sub
stituting them for metallic contact, and combining both ex
periments into one (fig. 4.).      Under these circumstances there
is an opposition of forces; the fluid, which brings into play
the stronger set of chemical affinities for the zinc (being the
dilute acid,) overcomes the force of the other, and determines
the formation and direction of the electric current; not merely
making that current pass through the weaker liquid, but ac
tually reversing the tendency which the elements of the latter
have in relation to the zinc and platina if not thus counter
acted, and forcing them in the contrary direction to that they
are inclined to follow, that      its  own current may have free

    896. This becomes the condition of a single pair of plates
where metallic contact is allowed.             In such cases, only one
set of  opposing    affinities are to be overcome by those which
are dominant in the vessel c ; whereas, when metallic contact
is not allowed, two sets of opposing affinities must be con
quered (894.).
   897. It has been considered a difficult, and by some an im
possible, thing to decompose bodies by the current from a
single pair of plates, even when it was so powerful as to heat
bars of metal red hot, as in the case of Hare's calorimeter,
arranged as a single voltaic circuit, or of Wollaston's power
ful single pair of metals.      This difficulty has arisen altogether
from the antagonism of the chemical affinity engaged in pro
ducing the current with the chemical affinity to be overcome,
and depends entirely upon their relative intensity; for when
the sum of forces in one has a certain degree of superiority
over the sum of forces in the other, the former gains the
ascendancy, determines the current, and overcomes the latter
forces so as to make the substance exerting them yield up                                            its
elements       perfect accordance, both

 and much more readily. But besides that, many which before
 resisted electrolyzation now yielded up their elements. Thus,

 or weaker, is at once referrible to the condition and force of
 the chemical affinities which are brought into action, and may,
 both in principle and practice, be considered as perfectly              di
 stinct from any other mode.
    909. The direct reference which is thus experimentally
made in the simple voltaic circle of the intensity of the electric
current to the intensity of the chemical action going on at the
place where the existence and direction of the current is de
termined, leads to the conclusion that by using selected bodies,
as fused chlorides, salts, solutions of acids, &c., which may
act upon the metals employed with different degrees of che
mical force; and using also metals in association with platina,
or with each other, which shall differ in the degree of chemi
cal action exerted between them and the exciting fluid or elec
trolyte, we should be able to obtain a series of comparatively
constant effects due to electric currents of different intensities,
which would serve to assist in the construction of a scale so
as to supply the means of determining relative degrees of in
tensity accurately in future researches.
    910.      I have already expressed the view which I take of the
decomposition in the experimental place, as being the direct
consequence of the superior exertion at some other spot of the
same kind of power as that to be overcome, and therefore as
the result of an antagonism of forces of the same nature (891.
904.).        Those at the place of decomposition have a reaction
upon, and a power over, the exerting or determining set pro
portionate to what is needful to overcome their own power;
and hence a curious result of resistance offered by decomposi
tions to the original determining force, and consequently to the
current.        This is well shown in the cases where such bodies
as chloride of iead, iodide of lead, and water would not de
compose with the current produced by a single pair of zinc
and platina plates in sulphuric acid (903.), although they
would with a current of higher intensity produced by stronger
chemical powers. In such cases no sensible portion of the
current passes (967.); the action is stopped: and I am now of
opinion that in the case of the law of conduction which               I de
scribed in the Fourth Series of these Researches (413.*), the
bodies which are electrolytes in the fluid state cease to be such
in the solid form, because the attractions of the particles by
which they are retained in combination and in their relative
 position, are then too powerful for the electric current. The
 particles retain their places; and as decomposition is prevent
    [* An abstract of Mr. Faraday’s Fourth Series, stating the nature of the
 law of conduction in question, was given in Lond, and Edin. Phil. Mag.,

ed, the transmission of the electricity is prevented also; and
although a battery of many plates may be used, yet if it be of
that perfect kind which allows of no extraneous or indirect ac
tion (1000.), the whole of the affinities concerned in the acti
vity of that battery are at the same time also suspended and
counteracted.
    911. But referring to the resistance of each single case of
decomposition, it would appear that as these differ in force
according to the affinities by which the elements in the sub
stance tend to retain their places, they also would supply cases
constituting a series of degrees by which to measure the initial
intensities of simple voltaic or other currents of electricity,
and which, combined with the scale of intensities determined
by different degrees of acting force (909.), would probably
include a sufficient set of differences to meet almost every im
portant case where a reference to intensity would be required.
    912. According to the experiments I have already had oc
casion to make, I find that the following bodies are electroly
tic in the order in which     I have placed them, those which are
first   being  decomposed      by the current of lowest intensity.
These currents were always from a single pair of plates, and
may be considered as elementary voltaic forces.
              Iodide of potassium (solution).
              Chloride of silver (fused).
              Protochloride of tin (fused).
               Chloride of lead (fused).
              Iodide of lead (fused).
               Muriatic acid (solution).
              Water, acidulated with sulphuric acid.
    913. It is essential that in all endeavours to obtain the re
 lative electrolytic intensity necessary for the decomposition of
 different bodies, attention should be paid to the nature of the
 electrodes, and [to that of] the other bodies present which may
favour secondary actions (986.).        If in electro-decomposition
one of the elements     separated  has an affinity for the electrode,
 or for bodies present in the surrounding fluid, then the affinity
 resisting decomposition is in part balanced by such power, and
 the true place of the electrolyte in a table of the above kind is
not obtained: thus, chlorine combines with a positive platina
electrode freely, but iodine scarcely at all, and therefore I be
lieve it is that the chloride stands first in the preceding table.
 Again, if in the decomposition of water not merely sulphuric
but also a little nitric acid be present, then the water is more
freely decomposed, for the hydrogen at the cathode is not ulti
mately expelled, but finds oxygen in the nitric acid, with
which it can combine to produce a secondary result; the af
finities opposing decomposition are in this way diminished,

 46             Mr. Galloway's            Translation           of Dr. Olbers's
 of the  distance from the sun increases, is still extremely doubtful.
 A   density  assumed to diminish less rapidly than according to
 this  law,  would have a great influence on the motion of a comet
 which describes so much larger an orbit than Encke's.              San
 tini found the acceleration of Biela's comet, computed on this
 hypothesis, to be 0:03 of a day; whereas experience gave 0.45, if
 not even 0.90 of a day. This likewise seems to make it probable
 that the density of the aether diminishes more slowly, and ac
 cording to a different law; perhaps the law of the ordinates
of a logarithmic curve. 3rd. It is not improbable that the
resisting medium is not at rest, but has a direct rotatory motion
 about the sun. Even the perpetual revolution of the planets
must at length communicate to the aether through which they
move a direct motion of rotation; but I am of opinion that such
a motion is coeval with the formation of our planetary system,
and was originally connected with              Now, granting the

lion passage of Halley's comet next year, it becomes an object
of greater interest to observe it as soon as possible, and we
are naturally led to inquire whether it will not be visible
during the winter, or early in the spring of 1835.                    Ferrer and
Wisniewsky had the good fortune to rediscover the comet of
1811 in July and August 1812, when it was at a greater                                                        di
stance from the sun, and at least at as great a distance from
the earth, as Halley's will be in February and March 1835.
Whether it will be visible or not depends principally, as has
been often noticed, on its distance from the sun.                       A comet
does not     escape    observation in our       telescopes     from the small
ness of     itssize, but from insufficient brightness                enable                   to             it   to

 drawings in the latter work are very inaccurate, as they had
only been roughly sketched by Hooke for the purpose of aid
ing his memory, and were finished by Richard Waller, from
Hooke's description (P. Works, p. 164); yet they illustrate
what appears extraordinary in Hevel’s drawing, and show
that the nucleus of this comet, besides the usual nebulous
envelope, was inclosed within a hollow parabolic conoid of
bright matter of the same nature as the tail, resembling in some
measure, it would seem, the comet of 1811. The nucleus, how
ever, in Halley's comet was in immediate contact with the apex
of the conoid; whereas, in the comet of 1811, the apex of the
conoid was separated from the nucleus by a dark interval of
considerable extent. What Hevel represents as a horn proceed
ing from the nucleus, was merely the northern border of the
conoid, which, according to Hooke, is very much brighter
than the southern.      It is to be expected that on         approach                 its

terebrans, as at present existing in certain localities of the British
Islands.” By William Thompson, Esq., Vice-President of the Natural
History Society of Belfast. Communicated by J. G. Children, Esq.
Sec.R.S.
  The opinion which      has been advanced, that the Teredo navalis is
no  longer  to be found on the British coast, is shown by the author to
be  erroneous;    for numerous specimens of that destructive animal,
collected from the piles used in the formation of the pier at Port
patrick in Ayrshire, were furnished to him by Captain Frayer, R.N.
(of His Majesty's Steam-packet Spitfire). Some of these specimens
had attained the length of nearly two feet and a half, a magnitude at
least equal to, if not exceeding, the largest brought from the Indian
seas. After giving a description of the animal, the author enters into
an inquiry into the agency it employs to perforate the timber which
it consumes as food, and in which it establishes its habitation.        He
ascribes to the action of a solvent, applied  by the proboscis, the smooth
and rounded termination of          cell, which     its
                                                   afterwards enlarged     is                                                 by

ganglia and nervous cords undergo great changes both in their form
and situation, and also in their number, during the passage of the
insect from the larva to the pupa state; and after these changes have
been carried to a certain extent, they are suspended for several weeks,
during which the insect remains in a state of hybernation; but at the
expiration of this period the changes again proceed, and are continued

      After removing from    the water the deliquescent chlorides of lime
  and    magnesia   by the addition of carbonate of soda, he transmits
  through the mother liquor, consisting of chloride and bromide of
  sodium, a current of chlorine gas, till it communicates the maximum
  golden tint, and then adds sulphuric aether, which, by agitation, car
  ries with it to the surface the bromine and chlorine, constituting a
  reddish yellow stratum. The proportion in which these two elements
  exist in the evaporated solution may be ascertained with the greatest
  nicety by the addition of a solution of nitrate of silver; the method of
  calculation for this purpose being detailed by the author.
     7. “On the Nature and Origin of the Aurora Borealis.”            By the
  Rev.   George  Fisher,  M.A.,  F.R.S.
     The author deduces from his own observations made during a re
 sidence of two winters in high northern latitudes, taken in con
 junction with the concurring testimony of various navigators and tra
  vellers, the general fact that the Aurora Borealis is developed chiefly
  at the edge of the Frozen Sea, or wherever there is a vast accumu
 lation of ice ; and he conceives that it is produced in situations where
 the vapours of a humid atmosphere are undergoing rapid congelation.
  Under these circumstances, when viewed from a distance, it is seen
  fringing the upper border of the dark clouds, termed the “sea blink,”
 which collect over these places; and it generally forms an arch a
 few degrees above the horizon, shooting out vertical columns of pale
 yellow light. He concludes that the Aurora Borealis is an electrical
 phenomenon, arising from the positive electricity of the atmosphere,
 developed by the rapid condensation of the vapour in the act of
 freezing, and the induced negative electricity of the surrounding
 portions of the atmosphere; and that it is the immediate consequence
 of the restoration of the electrical equilibrium by the intervention of
 the frozen particles, which being imperfect conductors, become lumi
 nous while transmitting this electricity.       In tropical and temperate
 climates this  phenomenon      does not  occur,  because the electric equi
 librium is restored     by means of    aqueous   vapours, a process which
 often gives rise to thunder and lightning, but never to the Aurora
 Borealis; the latter being peculiar to clear, cold and dry weather.

 municated by Dr. Roget, Sec. R.S.
     The author inquires into the influence which he conceives the fol
 lowing circumstances may have on the path of a projectile on the
 surface of the earth; namely, first, the direction of the line of pro
jection relatively to the meridian or cardinal points; secondly, the
 latitude of the place; and thirdly, the barometric conditions of the
 atmosphere.

turnal atmospheric tides, embracing two maxima and two minima in
the twenty-four hours. The following are the chief topics noticed in
the paper, and the principal facts established by these inquiries:
namely, l. The removal of the doubts entertained by Humboldt,
founded on the authority of Horsburgh, of the suspension of the at
mospheric tides during the monsoon in Western India; the existence
of the four atmospheric tides already mentioned, and their occurrence
within the same limiting hours as in America and Europe; the greatest
mean diurnal oscillations in Dukhun taking place in the coldest
months, and the smallest in the damp months; whilst at Madras,
the smallest oscillations are in the hottest months, and in Europe it
is supposed that the smallest oscillations are in the coldest months.
2. The regular diurnal and nocturnal occurrence of the tides,
without a single case of interversion, whatever may be the thermo
metric or hygrometric indications, or the state of the weather; storms
and hurricanes only modifying, but not interrupting them.       3. The
anomalous fact of the mean diurnal oscillations being greater at
Poona, at an elevation of 1823 feet, than at the level of the sea, in a
lower latitude, at Madras.     4. The fact of the diurnal tides, at a
higher elevation than Poona, being less, whilst the nocturnal tides
are greater than at Poona; and the seasons apparently not affecting
the limiting hours of the tides.    5. The maximum mean pressure
of the atmosphere    being greatest  in December and January; then
gradually diminishing until July and August; and subsequently       in
creasing to the coldest months. 6. The very trifling diurnal and
annual oscillations compared with those of extra-tropical climates.
7. The annual range of the thermometer being less in Dukhun
than in Europe, but the diurnal range much greater; the maximum
mean temperature occurring in April and May, and gradually de
clining until December and January; and the observed mean tempe
rature of places on the continent of India being much higher than
the calculated mean temperature according to Mayer's formula.
8. The mean annual dew-point being higher at half-past nine o'clock
than either at sunrise or at four in the afternoon; the dew-point
being highest during the monsoons, and lowest during the cold months,
and varying considerably within very short distances; being, for ex
ample, remarkably contrasted in Bombay and Dukhun; and the fre
quent occurrence of dew quite locally and under anomalous circum
stances. 9. The amount of rain in Dukhun being only 20 per cent.
of that falling in Bombay, 90 or 100 miles to the westward. 10. The
wind being principally from the west and east, and rarely from the
opposite quarters. 11. The great abundance of electricity under cer
tain circumstances. 12. The rare occurrence of fogs. 13. The great
amount of solar radiation ; and lastly, the singular opacity of the
atmosphere during hot weather, giving rise occasionally to the mirage.

    The author, in this paper, has prosecuted more immediately and
more minutely than in his former communication*, the inquiry into the
structure of the ovary of the Ornithorhynchus, with a view to determine
its exact relations with that of the normal Mammalia, and of the ovi
parous Vertebrata.     He has obtained from this investigation the full
confirmation of the truth of the opinion he had previously formed, that
lactation might coexist with a mode of generation essentially similar
to that of the Viper and Salamander; and this fact has been further
established by the subsequent examination which he has made of the
uterine foetus of the Kangaroo.
    The author traces the regular gradation which obtains in different
orders of Mammalia in which true viviparous or placental generation
takes place, towards the ovo-viviparous or oviparous modes, in which
 the exterior covering of the ovum never becomes vascular, and shows
 that the Ornithorhynchus constitutes a connecting link in this chain.
    Drawings illustrative of the anatomical descriptions of the parts
 examined by the author accompany the paper.

that the      abrupt   terminations which the beach                   Hope's Nose

 But in the neighbourhood of Babbacombe, he says, there are several
faults which at first sight offer a very different character.         Of
these he mentions two, that at Watcombe and another west of Petit.
Tor rock. The first presents a vertical change of level of about 200
feet; but it is not, like the faults before alluded to, rounded off, and
therefore the author infers that it is of more recent origin.
   Some observations are then offered on the position of the trap in
the neighbourhood of Babbacombe; and it is shown, that in the hill
to the east of the town it rests on shale, and is overlaid by beds of
 shale and limestone, the trap dipping to the south-west conformably
 with the stratified deposits. At          lower surfaceits   adheres firmly          it

bed which rests     upon   the trap    moulded into         outline.    From
this phaenomenon, and the absence                marks            all

superineumbent limestone and shale were subsequently deposited.
In   other instances, however,            the hill between Torquay and
                                                as      in

Missouri, and Yellow-stone rivers, as well as from their springs in

range.
   Above the Big Bend occurs also an extensive range of horizontal
beds of lignite, sandstone, shale, and clay, forming bluffs 200 and
300 feet high, and continuous for several days’ journey. Lignite is
also found on the Cherry River, and along the whole of the country
watered by the Powder River, in beds from 3 to 9 feet thick. This
formation Mr. Rogers conceives to be more recent than that which
contains the fossils, as the latter has a slight westerly dip, and there

   A letter was then read from H. T. De la Beche, Esq., F.G.S.,
and addressed to the President, on the Anthracite found near
Biddeford in North Devon.
    Mr. De la Beche says, the anthracite occurs along a strip of
 country about thirteen miles in length from east to west and about
three quarters of a mile in breadth from north to south.     It com
mences eastward at Hawkridge Woods on the banks of the Taw,
and extends westward to Greencliff in Biddeford Bay, where the
sea cuts off all further observation of its course in that direction.
On the opposite side of the bay, however, a very carbonaceous
slate is found in the cliffs among the greatly contorted strata of
grauwacké between Clovelly and Hartland Point.        There can be
little doubt, Mr. De la Beche observes, that this carbonaceous slate
belongs to the same system as the Biddeford beds, and thus it would
be extended about eleven miles still further westward, where the
sea again cuts it off.    The anthracite between Hawkridge and
Greencliff has been extensively worked at various times, and at
the latter place is now worked for the sole supply of a limekiln.
The beds of anthracite do not occur precisely in the same line with
each other, so that one or two beds are not so far continuous, but
swell out in particular places, the maximum thickness not exceed
ing 12 feet.
   The letter was accompanied by a collection of fossil plants,                                             all
collected   by
             Mr. De Beche; and  la      says there canhe      question             be        no
that the shales, slates, sandstones, and anthracite, among which
they are found, belong      the grauwacké, the evidence being
                                     to                            the                                 of

kund on the prone surface of a rock. The animal carries the shell
horizontally or nearly so; is quick in              motions; and, like Heli its

    The following Note by Mr. Benson relative to the importation of
 the living Cerithium Telescopium, Brug., adverted to at the Meeting
 on March 25, 1834, (vol. v. p. 145,) was read.
    “The possibility of importing from other countries, and especially
 from the warmer latitudes, the animals which construct the innu
 merable testaceous productions that adorn our cabinets and mu
 seums, the accurate knowledge of which is so necessary to enable
 the conchologist rightly to arrange this beautiful department of na
 ture, must be an interesting subject to every naturalist, and will
 render no apology necessary for the following notices extracted from
 my journal. Their publicity may incite others who may have op
 portunities of trying the experiment to follow the example.
    “January 1832. Observed near the banks of the canal leading
 from the eastern suburb of Calcutta to the Salt Lake at Balliaghát,
heaps of a Cardita with longitudinal ribs, of a large and thick Cy
rena, and of Cerithium Telescopium, exposed to the heat of the sun
for the purpose of effecting the death and decay of the included ani
mals previously to the reduction of the shells into lime.
    “Early in the month I took specimens of them, and leaving them
for a night in fresh water I was surprised to find two Cerithia alive.
I  kept them during a fortnight in fresh water, and on the 22nd
January carried them, packed up in cotton, on board a vessel bound
for England.     After we had been several days at sea I placed them
in a  large open  glass with salt water, in which they appeared un
usually lively.   I kept them thus, changing the water at intervals,
until the 29th May, when we reached the English Channel. I then
packed them up, as before, in a box, and carried them from Ports
mouth to Cornwall, and thence to Dublin, which I did not reach
until the 14th June; here they again got fresh supplies of sea wa
ter at intervals.    One of them died during a temporary absence be
tween the 30th June and 7th July; and on the 11th July the sur
vivor was again committed to

but from this notice it would scarcely have been anticipated that so
large a collection was made as was found in the present instance.
The dilatation had a rounded appearance; distended the skin so
as to show distinctly and widely separated the insertion of each of
the small feathers at this part; and measured in length 11 lines,
and in depth 6. On opening the pouch it proved to be simple, and
unconnected except with the cavity of the mouth.
   Mr. Heming also exhibited a drawing taken from the recent bird.
   Dr. Marshall Hall showed some experiments in the decapitated
Turtle. Irritation of the nostrils, laryna, and spinal marrow induced
 acts of inspiration; that of the fins and tail induced movements of
 the other parts respectively.
     But the principal object of Dr. Hall was to show that irritation
 of the nerves themselves equally induced movements of the limbs,
 &c. When either the sentient or the motory branch of the lateral
 spinal nerves was stimulated, motions were induced in all the limbs.
 Dr. Hall stated that a movement of inspiration and of deglutition
 was caused in the Donkey by irritation of the eighth pair of nerves.
  It has been already stated that irritation of the nostrils, or the
 branches of the fifth pair of nerves, induced inspiratory acts in the
 Turtle.    From these and other facts, Dr. Hall is induced to consider
 the functions of these two nerves as similar.       He further observed
 that both are nerves of secretion, and that both are muscular nerves
 —if the minor portion of the fifth be included—as well as exciters
 of respiration: the fifth differs chiefly in being sentient, being dis
 tributed to external as well as internal surfaces.    With the fifth and
 eighth, Dr. Hall associates other spinal nerves.        He considers re
 spiration as a part of a general function of the nervous system,
 which presides over the laryna, pharyna, sphincters, ejaculators, &c.,
 to which he has given the name of reflex, from its consisting of im
 pressions carried to and from the medulla oblongata and medulla
 spinalis. Some illustrations of this function were given by Dr. Hall
 at the Meeting of the Committee of Science and Correspondence on
 November 27, 1832, (Lond. and Edinb. Phil. Mag. vol.                   p.

 branches   des nerfs et qui n'agit jamais en arrière.”  In Dr. Hall's
 experiments the influence first pursued a backward course to the
 spinal marrow, being afterwards reflected upon the muscles.
    Dr. Hall next observed, in regard to respiration, that, whilst Sir
 Charles Bell is contending that it is involuntary, and Mr. Mayo that
 it is voluntary, the old doctrine of its being mixed, or partaking of
 both properties, is the true one. He founded this view upon the
 following facts:
   1. If the cerebrum be removed, respiration continues as an invo
luntary function through the agency of the eighth pair of nerves;
   2. If the eighth pair be divided, respiration equally continues,
but as an act of volition; but
   3. If the cerebrum be first removed, and the eighth pair be then                                         di
vided, respiration ceases on the instant.     Wolition is first removed
with the cerebrum; the influence of the eighth pair is then removed
by    its
       division.  The two sources      the mixed             of
                                                       double function                 or
being both cut off, the function ceases.
   Dr. Hall explains and reconciles                           in
                                         this manner the difficult and
apparently contradictory facts, that the medulla oblongata alone,

   to be necessary in the results of the Trigonometrical Survey of this
   county, by which the differences which had previously appeared to
   exist between the astronomical and geodetical determinations of the
   latitude and longitude of Cambridge Observatory are greatly dimi

   of the infinitesimal method with the doctrine of projections.     Prof.
   Sedgwick and other members then communicated some observations

  this is the lower chalk without flints, which runs from Reach to
  Cherryhinton and Haslingfield. Below this is a thin bed, which re
  presents the upper greensand, and which, though not above a foot
  and a half thick, is remarkably continuous in the neighbourhood of
  Cambridge, being found at the Castle Hill, Barnwell, Ditton, Coton,
  and Modingley. Under this are the blue galt and the “lower green
  sand” of geologists, which may here be called the red-sand.        The
  red-sand runs from Gamlingay and Caxton, by Conington, Long
 stanton, Cottenham, and Upware. But the junction of the galt and
  red-sand is covered up on the west of Cambridge by a large diluvial
 patch of “brown clay,” which is full of rounded nodules of chalk.
 This brown clay forms an upland, which extends from Bourne, by
 Toft and Hardwicke, to Dry Drayton, after which it soon drops
 into the plain; but the junction of the strata in the plain is still co
 vered up with ferruginous gravel as at Okington. Below the red
 sand occur other clays, easily confounded with the galt, but iden
 tified with the Kimmeridge and Oxford clays by their fossils; these
 are found at Gransden, Cottenham Fen, and Ely. It was stated
 that the relations of the successive formations are very obscurely
 exhibited, in consequence of the strata and their junctions being
 masked by diluvial masses.
     Dec.8,-Prof. Airy, V.P., in the chair. Prof. Miller read a memoir
 on the position of the Optical Axes of Crystals.       Prof. Henslow
noticed some newly observed localities of the (upper) green-sand
in the neighbourhood of Barton and Haslingfield.        He then made
some remarks on De Candolle's rules for determining the age of
trees, and mentioned some instances which he had noticed during
the preceding summer, in which they did not apply in the case of
the yew. He conceived that these rules, when applied to several
well known yew-trees in Britain, must give the age considerably too
great. Prof. Airy mentioned the echo which is returned by the open
end of the tall chimney recently erected at Barnwell gas-works. Prof.
Cumming then gave a statement of Melloni's discoveries on the
transmission of heat by radiation through glass and crystallized
bodies, illustrated by apparatus and experiments.

    ON  THE OCCURRENCE         OF FRAGMENTS     OF GARNET IN THE
            MILLSTONE-GRIT.        BY w. c. TREVELY AN, ESQ.
 To  the  Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal of  Science.
      GENTLEMEN,
   About the year 1826, I found dispersed rather abundantly in parts
of the millstone-grit rock of Shaftoe in this neighbourhood, small,
angular, transparent fragments of garnet: since that time I have met
with them in similar rocks of the coal-fields near Kirkstall in York
shire, and Stirling in Scotland, and think that on further exami
nation they may be more extensively observed, as it is probable
that these rocks have been formed from the detritus of others, which
are known sometimes to contain garnets in great abundance, as well
as the other parts of which the millstone-grit is composed, among
which I have also occasionally found small rolled fragments of
hornblende.
   I shall be glad if you think this notice worth printing in your
Journal, for the purpose of drawing the attention of geologists to
the subject:                           And remain, Gentlemen,
                                        Your most obedient,

      GENTLEMEN,
   I shall  be obliged by your inserting the following mineralogical
notices in the next Number of your Journal.

vol.x.   p. 190, that zurlite and wollastonite are the same substance,
a mistake into which I was led by having observed several speci

bearing no resemblance to wollastonite, or to any specimen       have                                            I
before observed.
   The late Mr. Phillips, in his Elements of Mineralogy, gave a
figure of a supposed crystal of the flexible silver of Bournon, dif
fering altogether from Bournon's figures. The specimen from which
that crystal was taken was said to be Bournon's mineral; it      how                                         is,

 XI. On     the  Practicability of alloying Iron and Copper.           By

          To Richard Phillips, Esq., F.R.S. L. & E. &c.
       SIR,
       perusing the other     day Dr. Lardner's third volume on
 INmetals”,      I met with   the following unqualified assertion:
“As to     alloying  copper  with iron, the notion not only appears
absurd, but      unsupported     by evidence.” As at the present
moment Dr. Lardner's publication may be considered a text
book of popular instruction, such a statement might lead to a
settled conclusion that to alloy iron and copper is under all
circumstances impossible.         Now the contrary is the fact; and
having considered this operation for many years as one which,
if happily effected, would materially contribute to the perfec
tion of many of our mechanical contrivances, I hope shall be    I
excused for entering on the subject somewhat particularly.
                          I
    In the first place, see no primá facie reason why it should
be absurd to expect that iron should unite with copper as
well as it does with other metals.          Then as to the evidence,
I think that most chemical works state the fact as a matter of
course, never doubting the practicability of the measure; and
                                          I
in your own Magazine, vol. xlix., find some experiments on
the union of iron with copper; which shows that the subject has
not been recently altogether overlooked.               The uncertainty
which    prevails  upon   the subject  arises from the want of accu

racy in defining the nature and quality of the iron which has
been the subject of the union. Most of the books entirely over
look the various states of iron, and fail to distinguish whether
the subject-matter of the experiment was cast iron, or steel,
or iron in a state of malleability. The same remark applies to
the experiments of Mr. P. N. Johnson as above, who, though he
states that he effected an union between iron and copper, yet
leaves it doubtful whether the iron was not steel or cast iron
instead of pure or malleable iron. The well-known affinity
of iron for carbon precludes the possibility of malleable iron
being heated and melted in contact with a large dose of char
coal (as was the case in his experiments,) without                  passing             its

in which estimated at from 5 to 70 per cent. of the weight
of the copper. Beyond 5 or 7 per cent, of iron, no chemical
union took place; and as the quantity of iron revived, was in
proportion to the charcoal added, so in the same proportion did
the separation of the two metals from each other take place.
From this it was inferred that malleable iron (i.e. iron contain
ing the least possible quantity of charcoal,) would unite and
form a proper alloy with copper, but that steel or cast iron
would not do so. To try the validity of this reasoning, a new
series of experiments was instituted, having for their object the
direct union of a portion of copper with iron in the various
states of cast iron, steel, and malleable iron, the general re
sults of which I will state as briefly as possible, without go
ing into a detail of the various experiments.
     Pure malleable iron may be united with copper in any pro
portion, until it equals, or even exceeds, the weight of the cop
per; the intensity of the copper colour increases,               the quan  till
tities are equal; and the fracture then becomes paler,             propor       in
 tion as  the quantity       of
                            iron exceeds that         the copper. With

                        find that it exhibits the same general type of
structure with that of the Mammalia, consisting of head, neck,
body, limbs. The head, as in the foregoing class, is the seat of
the organs of sense, furnished with and terminating in a bill, by
which the individual picks up and breaks        food. The form        its
of  the bill differs much     different species, and serves

the brightest and most brilliant colours. The neck assumes
the circular form, and often displays peculiar beauty,

culations.  They  are distributed into the three following
classes: The Vermes, or worms, in which the body is without
 any external organs of locomotion; the Crustacea, in which
 the body is covered with a shell; and the Insecta, or insects,
 in which the body is divided by deep indentations into four
 principal parts, the head, the corselet, the chest, the ab
domen.

any external and distinct organ, whether                    hearing          of                       or   of

several    sources        I    found acid containing only 1.4 per cent.
These samples I procured from the several shops personally,
and asked for Scheele's strength. They were assayed within
24 hours after they were in my possession, both by the nitrate
of silver and the oxide of mercury method, and the results in
no cases varied more than Tºth of a grain from each other
Now it is true we have no fixed standard, and therefore it is
impossible to say whether Allen and Co.'s is too strong or
the others too weak; but thus much is certain, that if a me
dical man were pushing the exhibition of hydrocyanic acid
gradually to a maximum dose, the prescriptions being carried
to a shop where the acid had only 1.4 per cent, and then by
some accident er other cause taken to where Allen's acid was
used, a sudden and I fear a fatal increase would be the result,
for more than a triple quantity would be taken. For the pos
sibility of a fatal accident,                  I
                                     need only refer to the case of

himself laying hold                of,
                             and using one acid, &c., for another
when the mind         also
                         is    work?at
   (10.)   I have made many trials                 the practicability
                                                           as   to                            of
applying the cyanide            silver and dilute hydrochloric acid
                                     of
for  procuring    medical  hydrocyanic     acid. The cyanide          silver            of
presents many advantages:              perfectly stable, being neither
                                           it  is
affected   by light nor moisture;         purity can its   very easily as be

            of uniform Strength from Cyanide of Silver.                                         103
certained, and every five grains of it will yield one grain of acid.
It can be procured by conducting the vapour from the process
described in section (6.) of this paper, into a pint of water, hold
ing 255 grains of nitrate of silver, washing and drying at 212°.
It yields 201:6 grains of white cyanide. I should recommend
that the bottle containing this salt be accompanied by a small
stoppered phial with dilute hydrochloric acid of such strength,
that 1 minim will exactly decompose 1 grain of the cyanide:
thus, suppose one corked phial having 200 grains of cyanide
with one #-oz. stoppered bottle with hydrochloric acid of
specific gravity 1.129, this would be enough to make 5 fluid
ounces of dilute hydrocyanic acid of the Dublin strength, if
the following formula be followed.           Into a phial capable of
holding rather more than 1 fluid ounce, put 40 grains of the
cyanide, add 7 fluid ounces 20 minims of water, and 40 mi
nims of the dilute hydrochloric acid; cork closely, shake se
veral times for the first quarter of an hour, set aside to allow
 the chloride of silver to fall, decant the clear liquid into ano
 ther bottle to be preserved for use: every fluid drachm will
 contain l grain of real hydrocyanic acid.
    The only objection I had d priori to this process was the lia
bility of a little free hydrochloric acid remaining in the solu
 tion, since     all
                 books echo that the presence             minute quan of  a
tity   ofthe mineral acids very much hastens the decomposition
of  this acid;     statement perfectly opposite

damental equations (12.), and thus obtain expressions involv

But even without actually going through this process at length,

out of the form which we shall at once see certain parts of the

 XVIII.        On the Eristence             of Titanic Acid in           Hessian Crucibles.

          GENTLEMEN,
 WHILE    repeating some experiments lately published on
    the presence of titanium in organic matter, especially in
 the renal capsules”, we observed that when an alkaline car
 bonate was exposed to heat in Hessian crucibles, a fused mass
 was obtained, which was yellow while hot, but white and opake
 when cold; on dissolving this fused mass in dilute hydro
 chloric acid and mixing the solution with hydrosulphuret of
 ammonia, a deep olive green precipitate was obtained, which,
 when dried and ignited, yielded a white powder, insoluble in
 the dilute acids. These reactions so exactly resembling those
yielded by titaniferous substances, we were induced to sus
pect the presence of titanium in the clay of which the crucibles
were formed. To determine this with accuracy we undertook
an analytical examination of the several varieties of Hessian
crucibles usually met with, and we found them                 consist          all   to
of  (in variable proportions) silicic acid, titanic acid, alumina,
and peroxide            of
                     iron, with traces      magnesia and manga

forms of titaniferous sand we at first were inclined               to believe
the presence     of titanium was      owing,  this opinion      appearing     to
be corroborated by our noticing that in those crucibles in
which the black specks (above referred to) were most nu
merous, the quantity of titanium appeared to be the greatest.
The source of that metal in these crucibles must still remain a
question.
   We subjoin an outline of the process we followed in the
analysis of these crucibles, as we believe that the (hitherto
unlooked for) presence of titanium in these articles of che
mical research to be of some importance in analytical che
mistry.

solution with an excess of muriate of ammonia for some time:
the resulting gelatinous precipitate

peroxide of iron were separated, contained traces of magnesia
and manganese.

  In   a very few specimens we have found the titanic acid to
be present in very minute quantities, and in one or two only
we could not succeed in detecting any. It is a very difficult
matter to free the titanic acid from the peroxide of iron, the
last traces of which adhere exceedingly obstinately to the acid;
the process recommended by Berzelius, viz. adding tartaric
acid to the acid solution of the mixed oxides and the subse
quent precipitation of the iron by hydrosulphuret of ammonia,
by no means succeeding perfectly. The use of oxalic acid for
the purpose of precipitating the titanium and leaving the iron
in solution is not more efficient, as the precipitate is found to
be contaminated with a considerable quantity of peroxide of
iron. The following is the process we prefer for the purpose
of obtaining the titanium, free from iron. Ignite a mixture
of carbonate of potass and powdered Hessian crucibles;
digest the mass thus obtained in warm water for some
time: this aqueous solution yields a very slight grass-green
tinge with hydrosulphuret of ammonia. Dissolve the portion
insoluble in water in hydrochloric acid, with the assistance
of a gentle heat; dilute and filter the acid solution and wash
the residue on the filter; when the acid has almost entirely
passed the filter, the washings become opaline. The filtered
fluid is then to be nearly neutralized with ammonia, and hy

when zinc, platina, and dilute sulphuric acid are used, it is
the union of the zinc with the oxygen of the water which de
termines the current; and though the acid is essential to the
removal of the oxide so formed, in order that another portion
of zinc may act on another portion of water, it does not, by com
bination with that oxide, produce any sensible portion of the
current of electricity which circulates; for the quantity of elec
tricity is dependent upon the quantity of zinc oxidized, and in
definite proportion to it:              intensity         its

   not electrolytic, might answer as the third substance between

   are no bodies of this kind except those substances and charcoal.

in the solution by a plate of platina, hydrogen is evolved on
the surface of the latter metal, and the zinc is oxidized exactly
as when immersed in dilute sulphuric acid (863.).   accord                                 I
ingly repeated the experiment before described with weighed
plates of zinc (864. &c.), using however solution of potassa
instead of dilute sulphuric acid. Although the time required
was much longer than when acid was used, amounting to three
hours for the oxidizement of 7:55 grains of zinc, still I found
that the hydrogen evolved at the platina plate was the equiva
lent of the metal oxidized at the surface of the zinc.             Hence
the whole of the reasoning which was applicable in the former
instance applies also here, the current being in the same                                                 di
rection, and          its

                  alkali had been used (868.).

    Mr. Nordenskiold received specimens of this mineral last

burg in Siberia; and it occurs in large crystals from one to two
inches in diameter, which are generally composed in the same
manner as is shown in fig. 38, plate vii., of the second volume
of Mohs's Mineralogy. Mr. Hartwall is at present engaged in
analysing the mineral, the result of which we shall communi
cate as soon as it reaches us. Mr. Nordenskiold, however,
has ascertained that                    its

   The change of colour which is exhibited by looking through
the mineral in day- and in candle-light, arises from two causes:
1st, from there being an ercess of red and a defect of blue rays in
the light of a candle compared with the light of day; and
2ndly, from the substance employed having a greater dispo
sition to transmit one kind of rays in preference to another, or,
what is the same thing, being more transparent for one kind
of rays than for another kind, when their intensity is the same.
    In the present mineral      colour    green; but when we ana

 which, with practice, 4th of a degree may always be observed,
 and even minuter quantities occasionally estimated. ' These
 divisions are not necessarily proportional to the intensities of
 the currents which produce the corresponding deviations.
 The coils of wire, extending a long way on each side of zero,
 prevent the effect from diminishing so rapidly as if they were
 concentrated there; and M. Melloni has described, in his
 paper in the Annales de Chimie for May 1833, a simple and
 satisfactory method of estimating the relative values of de
 grees, at different points of the scale.           He states, however,
 that, under 20° of deviation, he found them quite uniform.
 In the following experiments, the deviations were generally
 under 15°, and in almost no case exceeded 20°. I have there
 fore assumed the forces to be as the deviations. Besides, no
change of importance would take place from a deviation from
 this law by a small quantity.

                                        have obtained repeated differ
ences, not exceeding half or even a quarter of a degree of the
multiplier (observed without a telescope), which, by the promp
titude with which the needle was repelled or attracted at the
instant that the change of circumstances to be considered was
 effected, left as little doubt in my mind as if the numerical
 result had been many times greater.

 thought of applying it to detect the heat of the moon's rays in
 a more unexceptionable manner than, I am persuaded, it has
 ever been attempted.          This curious question had not escaped
 MM. Nobili and Melloni when they first constructed the                                                              in

inches, whence we may compute the size of the lunar image
to be a circle 0-38 inch in diameter. Comparing this with
the dimensions of the intercepted cylinder of rays, we shall
find the concentration to exceed 6000 times.                But even if we
admit that half the rays are reflected, dispersed and absorbed,
we shall have still an effective increase of 3000 times.
    12. My experiments were made on the 16th December
 1834, between 9 and 11 o'clock, the moon being only 18 hours
past full, and (towards the close) less than 2 hours from the
meridian.     She was also particularly high, having a declina
tion of 25° north. The thermal pile, which was particularly
commodious for the experiment, had one extremity elevated
to the proper angle, and being placed accurately in the focus
of the mirror, the moon's image was brilliantly thrown on the
extremity of the pile. The sky was on the whole very pure,
though an occasional milkiness was perceived, but the best
observations were made at the clearest moments, because then
the air was also most still; for though the instrument was
placed in a most sheltered spot, the faintest breeze was indi
cated by a deflection of the needle, and with such promptitude,
that I generally could perceive in this way
                                                                          so its

quantities of heat upon this and another instrument. For this
purpose I employed two air thermometers of great delicacy;
one was the photometer of Leslie, having one ball covered
with lamp black, and exposed to the same source of heat as
the pile, whilst the other ball was shaded.             The other instru
ment was a vertical differential         thermometer,     having a hemi
spherical reflector, intercepting a cone of rays 2:50 square
inches in section.               I
                             found it impossible to operate with small
degrees of heat, which could not be reckoned accurately on
the air thermometers, owing to their tardy action; but, from
several experiments, I concluded that the same quantity of
heat falling on the photometer ball and on the pile, moved
the liquid of the former through 19, and the needle of the
multiplier through 4°-2.              The degrees of the photometer
being 10ths of 1° cent., one centigrade degree would corre
spond to 42° of the galvanometer (assumed of equal value
throughout the scale). The experiment with the differential
thermometer, being similarly conducted, gave for the effects
of equal quantities of heat, 1° cent. to 62° of the multiplier.
If  we assume from these experiments that a quantity of heat
which raises an air thermometer by one fiftieth of a centigrade
degree, affects the galvanometer by                    1°,
                                                     since    quarter a               of  a

he had not succeeded in obtaining numerical results.            He
found, however, that the refrangibility of the rays diminished
with their temperature.         I
                               also obtained a slight refraction of
non-luminous heat through a glass prism.
   17. But if heat be capable of refraction by the ordinary
agents, an important question arises, Is the phaenomenon of
double refraction common to heat and light? Rock-salt,
the only substance yet discovered which transmits dark heat
in large quantity, does not possess this power. To attempt it
with Iceland spar would certainly be fruitless, from the very
small transmitting power, which it possesses, besides some
other practical difficulties which suggest themselves.     It must
be by more refined processes that we can detect this property.
Such will be stated in the sequel.

    1834.        PAPER was read, entitled, “On the Determination
 Nov. 20.-        of the Terms in the disturbing Function of the
fourth  Order,  as regards the Eccentricities and Inclinations which
 give rise to secular inequalities.”   By   J.W. Lubbock, Esq., W.P.
and Treas. R.S.
    The author observes, that the magnitude of the terms of the fourth
order in the disturbing function, relating to the inclinations, in the
theory of the secular inequalities of the planets, does not admit of
being estimated a priori; and consequently the amount of error
which may arise from neglecting them cannot be appreciated. The
object of the present investigation is to ascertain the analytical ex
pressions of these terms; and the method adopted for this purpose
is derived from principles already explained by the author in a for
mer paper. He has bestowed great pains in putting these expres
sions into the simplest form of which they are susceptible; and has
finally succeeded, after much labour of reduction, in obtaining ex
pressions of remarkable simplicity. He exemplifies their application
by the calculation, on this method, of one of the terms given by Pro
fessor Airy as requisite for the determination of the inequality of
Venus; and arrives, by this shorter process, at the same result. The
same method, he remarks,       is,
                                 with certain modifications, applicable
to  the development      the disturbing function

                  this communication       toshow how far the author
has been successful in  establishing the true theory        of

most recent observations; namely, those recorded        the “Funda

menta Astronomiae” of Bessel, and the “Tabulae Regiomontanae.”
of the same author. This comparison is made by taking the first
and second differences of the series of the logarithms of the refrac
tions in each table; from which it results that these differences, de
rived from the numbers in Bessel's tables, are very irregular; but
that their mean very nearly coincides with that of the numbers given
in the tables of the author.

Journal kept at the Royal Observatory, Cape of Good Hope, from
the 1st of February to the 31st of May, 1834.” By Thomas Maclear,
Esq. Communicated by Captain Beaufort, R.N., F.R.S.
    The tables of meteorological observations which compose nearly
the whole of this paper are preceded by a short notice of the instru
ments, namely, one barometer and two thermometers, with which
the observations were made. The author announces his intention to
forward, in a future communication, the results of a comparison be
tween his barometer and that of Sir John Herschel.            The obser
vations are taken at sunrise, at noon, at sunset, and at midnight.

    At the Anniversary Meeting, December 1, 1834, which was held
on that day in consequence of St. Andrew's Day falling on a Sunday,
John William Lubbock, Esq., M.A., V.P. and Treasurer, in the Chair,
the Treasurer stated that he took the Chair on the present occa
 sion in consequence of the unavoidable absence of His Royal Highness
the President; from whom he had received the following letter:
       “Dear Sir,
                “May I request of you to express to the gentlemen as
 sembled    this day at the Royal Society Rooms, my extreme regret
 that the   state of my eyesight should prevent my attending in my
place on   the present occasion, as it would otherwise have been both
 my duty   and pleasure to have done       Under these circumstances I
 must rely upon that kindness which I have ever experienced at their
 hands since presiding over the interests of the Royal Society, to ex
 cuse this involuntary absence on my part.         Should the gentlemen
kindly vote me again into the Chair, aware as they are of my present
infirmities, I can only accept the proffered honour upon an under
 standing that should I not be better at this period next year, I may
be now considered as giving them notice that I shall consider myself
bound in duty to resign an office, the duty of which I am no longer
able to perform.       I regret much being deprived of the pleasure of
conferring the medals this day, and particularly the one which has
been so properly adjudged to you, for whom I profess the highest
consideration, and with which sentiment I subscribe myself,

 tion which deprives the Society of His Royal Highness's attendance
 at the Anniversary Meeting, and confidently hope that his health
 will be speedily and completely restored.
    The Secretary read the following List of Fellows deceased since
 the last Anniversary.
     On the Home List.—Sir Gilbert Blane, Bart., M.D.; John, Mar
 quis of Breadalbane; John Caley, Esq.; Rev. James Stanier Clarke,
 LL.D.; Captain James Franklin; William Wyndham, Lord Gren
 ville; Philip, Earl of Hardwicke; George Harvey, Esq.; John Jebb,
 Lord Bishop of Limerick; Rev. Daniel Lysons; William Taylor Mo
 mey, Esq.; John Sharpe, Esq.; Thomas Snodgrass, Esq.; William
 Sotheby, Esq.; George John, Earl Spencer; Thomas Telford, Esq.;
 Right Hon. Charles Philip Yorke.
     On the Foreign List.—Don Felipe Bauzà and Professor Karl Lud
 wig Harding.
    The Secretary stated that of these only two, namely, Sir Gilbert
 Blane and Mr. George Harvey, have contributed papers to the Royal
 Society.
    Sir Gilbert Blane was the author of a paper, entitled, “An Ac
count of the Nardus Indica, or Spikenard,” which was published in
 the Philosophical Transactions for 1790.
    In this paper, Sir Gilbert, then Dr. Blane, establishes the identity
 of a species of grass, found in great abundance in a wild unfre
 quented part of India at the foot of the mountains north of Lucknow,
and held in great estimation by the natives as a febrifuge, with the
plant denominated by ancient writers the Nardus Indica, and which
Arrian states was found in great quantity by the armies of Alex
ander during their marches through the deserts of Gadrosia, border
ing on the Persian Gulf, and forming part of the modern province
of Mekran.       An account of the medicinal properties of this plant
occupies the remainder of this paper.
    In the year 1788, Sir Gilbert Blane was appointed to read the
Croonian Lecture, in which he enters into a general account of the
nature of the muscles and of the theory of muscular motion.         This
paper was not published in the Philosophical Transactions.           The
portion of it chiefly deserving notice is that which relates to the ex
periments made by him with a view to determine whether the spe
cific gravity of a muscle is the same in its two states of relaxation
and contraction.      For this purpose he compared equal portions of
the muscular flesh taken from the opposite sides of a fish, one of
which had been contracted by crimping, and the other had remained
relaxed; but he was unable to detect any sensible difference in their
specific gravities.     This conclusion was corroborated by the result
of  experiments   on  living eels, inclosed in vessels filled with water,
and   terminating   above in a tube of small diameter: the bulk of the
fluid was observed to be unaffected by muscular contractions pur
posely excited in the fish, as appeared from the height of the column
in the tube remaining unchanged during the most violent actions of
the eels.     In caoutchouc, on the other hand, Sir G. Blane found
that extension produced a diminution, and retraction an increase, of
density.

                                          Royal Society.                                    14.5
    Mr. George Harvey was the author of         paper entitled “Expe
                                                                  a
rimental Inquiries relative to the Distribution and Changes of the
Magnetic Intensity in Ships of War;” and of another “On the
Effects of the Density of Air on the Rates of Chronometers;” both
of which are published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1824.
In the first paper he enters into a detail of experiments made on
board several vessels for the purpose of determining the influence of
the iron in the ships upon the mariner's compass in different situa
tions and under different circumstances. In the second paper he as
certains that the rate of chronometers is accelerated by being placed
in air of diminished density; and that it was, on the contrary, retarded
when they are subjected to increased atmospheric pressure; the arc
of vibration being, in the former case, increased; and in the latter,
diminished.
   The Secretary then read the Report of the Council, from which
the following are extracts; the Report being given entire in the
“Proceedings” of the Society.
   On the subject of the Library the Council have, in the first place,
to report that the manuscript of the classed Catalogue is now very
nearly completed, and that the printing of it will be very soon com
menced.
   The Council beg, in the second place, to congratulate the Society
on their having, after so much delay, at length obtained possession of
the apartments lately occupied as the Exchequer Office, and granted
by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury, on the re
presentation made to them by His Royal Highness our President,
to the Royal, conjointly with the Astronomical, Society. The apart
ments retained by the Royal Society are four in number: the first
is a room adjoining to the upper library, from which a door has been
opened into         it,

on Mineralogy and Geology, to Charles Lyell, Esq. The first is for
Mr. Lubbock's highly valuable Investigations on the Tides, contained
in his papers published in the Philosophical Transactions.
   The second is awarded for Mr. Lyell's work, entitled “Principles
of Geology,” on the following grounds, the Council at the same
time declining to express any opinion on the controverted positions
contained in that work.
   First, The comprehensive view which the author has taken of the
subject, and the philosophical spirit and dignity with which he has
treated it.
    Secondly, The important service he has rendered to science by
specially directing the attention of Geologists to effects produced by
existing causes.
   Thirdly, His admirable descriptions of many tertiary deposits;
several of these descriptions being drawn from original observations.
    And lastly, The new mode of investigating tertiary deposits,
which his labours have greatly contributed to introduce; namely,
that of determining the relative proportions of extinct and still ex
isting species, with a view to discover the relative ages of distant
and unconnected tertiary deposits.
    The Council, being unable to propose any specific Prize-Question
for the Royal Medal in Physics for the year 1837, propose to give
one of the Royal Medals for that year to the most important unpub
lished paper in Physics, communicated to the Royal Society for in
sertion in their Transactions, after the present date and prior to the
month of June 1837.
   The Council propose to give the other Royal Medals for the year
1837 to the author of the best paper, to be entitled “Contributions
towards a system of Geological Chronology, founded on an examina
tion of fossil remains, and their attendant phaenomena.”

this mountainous    country  and  directing  his course south-westward,
Mr.   Cunningham    entered  upon  a less elevated region, composed of
clay slate; and in lat. 29°he arrived at a deep gorge similarly con
stituted, and traversed by a rapid stream, in the bed of which he
noticed large boulders of the gray granite.         During the next 40
miles the  only  rocks noticed were reddish    granite  and fragments of
basalt. In lat. 29° 26' large masses of a fine   quartzose conglomerate
occurred, and they were afterwards found to be very generally scat

     A paper was next read, entitled “An Account of Land and
 Freshwater Shells found associated with the Bones of Land Quad
 rupeds beneath diluvial Gravel, at Cropthorn in Worcestershire,”
 by Hugh Edwin Strickland, Esq., F.G.S.
     On two former occasions Mr. Striekland laid before the Society
 brief notices of the discovery, near Cropthorn, of the bones of extinct
 quadrupeds associated with shells of existing species, and the pre
 sent paper contains the result of his continued researches. The
 deposit in which they were found is situated on the main road from
 Evesham to Pershore, and on the east side of the small rivulet which
 flows from Bredon Hill towards the Avon. In May 1834 the deposit
 presented a section about 70 yards in length and 8 feet 6 inches high
 in the middle. The lower part of it consisted of lias clay, on which
 rested a layer of fine sand, containing 23 species of land and fresh
 water shells, with detached fragments, more or less rolled, of bones
 of the Hippopotamus, Bos, Cervus, Ursus, and Canis. The sand pas
 ses upwards gradually into the gravel, which extends to the surface,
 and differs in no respect from the other diluvial beds in the neigh
 bourhood. The gravel is composed principally of pebbles of brown
 quartz, but occasionally contains chalk flints, and fragments of lias
 Ammonites and Gryphites. The bones, though most abundant in the
 sand, are interspersed through the gravel; but the shells are entirely
 confined to the sand. Lists are given of the bones and of the species
 of the shells, two of which are considered to be extinct. The au
 thor from these phaenomena assigns the deposit to the newer plio
 cene era; and from the fluviatile habits of some of the shells, he con
 siders that it occupies the site of an ancient river-bed, and not of a
 lake. In the course of his paper he points out the inferences which
 may be drawn from the deposits respecting the greater change
 which has taken place in the mammifers of this island than in the
 molluscs, since the era when the gravel was accumulated; and the
 little change which the climate appears to have undergone since the
 same epoch.      In conclusion he notices the published accounts of
“similar deposits at North Cliff, near Market Weighton, and at Cop
 ford, near Colchester, and his having been informed when at Bath,
 that freshwater shells had been discovered under gravel in sinking
 for foundations in the lower part of the city.
     A notice was afterwards read, “On the Bones of certain Animals
 which have been recently discovered in the calcareo-magnesian Con
 glomerate on Durdham Down, near Bristol,” by the Rev. David
 Williams, F.G.S.
     The author commences by observing, that the calcareo-magne
 sian conglomerate of the neighbourhood of Bristol      has hitherto been

singularly deficient in organic remains; and by stating that he is of
opinion that their absence may be accounted for by the conglomerate
indicating a period of turbulence and agitation.       He then alludes
to the recent discovery of bones in this deposit on Durdham Down,
and to Dr. Riley and Mr. Stuchbury's having determined that they
belong to Saurians.    These bones, he says, are angular as well as
the associated  fragments   of mountain limestone, and are so inti
mately incorporated with the latter as to constitute a bone-breccia.
He says he has ascertained that the remains belong to at least
three animals, varying in their proportions from the Dracaena of
Lacépede to the lesser varieties of Monitors and Safeguards.         He
afterwards describes a fragment of a small jaw found by himself,
which exhibits six distinct alveoli separated by bony partitions. One
of the alveoli contains a young tooth, which had cut         way     the                            its           to

    Mr. Hodgson then enumerates the Mammalia which have been
observed in Nepal, adopting in their arrangement the system of
Cuvier, and noticing as regards each the region in which it occurs.
He adds occasional remarks as to their habits; and notices many
which appear to him to be undescribed. An abstract of this portion
of his communication is given in the “Proceedings;” from which
the following are extracts.
   Felis Moormensis, Hodgs., belong to the central region; as does
also an undescribed and beautifully marked species.
   Felis viverrinus, Benn., is confined to the Tarái.
   Lutra, Linn. Of this genus Mr. Hodgson conceives that no less
than seven species are found in Nepal, five of which differ from the
two which inhabit the plains of Hindoostan.                Four of these he re
gards as new, differing materially in length, in bulk and propor
tions, and in colour; one of them is yellowish white                    over; the  all
rest are brown, more             or
                               less dark, some having the chin and throat
or  under surface paled nearly                     yellow.

   Mr.    Hodgson     suggests   that there are two        varieties,      perhaps      or
rather   species,      of
                        the Indian   Elephant,    the  Ceylonese      and that                          of
the Saul forest. The Ceylonese has               smaller lighter head, which
                                                      a
is  carried more elevated;            has also higher fore-quarters.
                                          it                                    The
Elephant      of the Saul forest has sometimes five nails                its hinder    on
feet.
   The Rhinocéros goes with young from seventeen                          eighteen     to
months, and produces one               at

     Specimens were exhibited of several Reptiles, which were accom
 panied by notes by Mr. Gray.       These notes were read.
     Mr. Gray regards the Testudo Spengleri, Walb., as the type of
 a new genus of Emydidae, having, like the fresh-water Tortoises ge
 nerally, the toes lengthened and covered by a series of shields, but
 these members, instead of being webbed as in the other genera of the
 family, are quite free from each other; the legs, moreover, are de
 stitute of fringe along their outer edge.    This structure of the feet
 and limbs indicates habits less aquatic than those of the Emydidae
 generally ; and Mr. Gray states that such appears to be the case
with the Em. Spengleri, for though he has watched for a consider
able time the specimen now living at the Society's Gardens he has
never observed it to enter the water.
    From the beautiful figure of the animal of Em. spinosa given
by Mr. Bell in his ‘Monograph of the Testudinata,' Mr. Gray is
inclined to believe that this species belongs to the same genus with
Em. Spengleri, the toes, especially those of the hind feet, being
represented in the figure as quite free. The shells of the two species
agree in being of a pale brown colour above, and in being sharply
toothed on the margin; in both which respects they differ from the
                                                                   -

  A   new genus        of   Geckotidae     is   characterized by   Mr. Gray under
the name of

ple, and compressed, instead of being more widely dilated, and
with the lastphalana affixed along the upper surface. The body is co
vered with small uniform granular scales, and the belly with larger
flat scales; the tail is ringed with square scales, those of the under
surface being the largest.

    The collection of the British Museum contains a specimen, much
discoloured,   of what appears to be a second species of this genus.
Another species is contained in the Muséum d’Histoire Naturelle at
Paris.
   A living specimen was exhibited of the Red Viper of the Somer
setshire Downs.     It had been sent from Taunton to Mr. Gray, who
states that he has compared it very attentively with the black and
with the common Viper of England, and that he cannot discover the
slightest difference between them except in the shade of the colour.
They       all
          agree     having the upper lip shield white, with brown
                           in                                                                                   or

Daud.

    A Report, read last year, on the Progress and Prospects of the
Society, warmly advocated the importance of this measure, as a
means of training up a succession of working Members to supply
the places of those who are from time to time removed by various
casualties:—and the anticipation of such losses has been fearfully
realised during so short an interval.             Mr. Giddy, who so long and
 ably filled the office of Curator, is no more!—and several distin
 guished Members,                   all

 half of the Members presented to Dr. Boase the piece of plate,
voted at the last meeting, as a testimonial of his long and valuable
services in promoting the objects of the Society.         In a compli
mentary address he alluded to Dr. Boase's late publication on Pri
mary Geology, and expressed his opinion that, whether the views
 therein advanced should be ultimately substantiated or not, the
 discussion to which it will give rise cannot fail to prove beneficial
 to the progress of the science of geology.

of borate of soda; wash the precipitate slightly, and calcine it also
slightly.   Mix one part of this borate of cobalt with one or two
parts of fused phosphate of soda, and heat the mixture to redness
in a crucible. Phosphate of cobalt may be used instead of the borate,
and a fine blue will be obtained.    The phosphate of soda may be
replaced by the arseniate
    Borate of cobalt may be prepared as follows: Add an excess of
borate of soda to a solution of a salt of cobalt, and a solution of
carbonate of potash or soda, as long as a precipitate is formed. Wash,
filter, and calcine slightly. Another blue may be formed by mixing
twelve parts of phosphate of cobalt slightly calcined, twelve parts of
fused phosphate of soda, two parts of fused borax, four parts of cal
cined alumina; and there may be added, if preferred, three parts of
calcined carbonate of soda. Mix them intimately in a mortar, and
heat to redness in a crucible.    By this process a very fine blue is
obtained.—Journal de Pharmacie, Sept. 1834, p. 536.
ON   THE INFLUENCE OF ELECTRICITY IN GERMINATION. BY M.
                         CHARLES MATTEUCCI.
   Although the effect produced by electricity upon vegetation has
long been a subject of inquiry, the greatest uncertainty still exists
as to the nature of its action and the true influence which it exerts.
The most recent work on this subject is by M. Becquerel, in which
it is stated, that the act of germination always produces acetic acid.
As, however, it is well known that the fecula of the cotyledons of le
guminous and other grains undergoes changes analogous to those
which it suffers by exposure to the air, it becomes a subject of in
terest to multiply the experiments on a great number of grains.
Grains of wheat, hempseed, and lentils, &c., were made to germinate
in well washed carbonate of lime. In a very short time acidity was
developed; but the germination was allowed to go on for ten or
twelve days. The carbonate of lime was then washed, the aqueous
solution evaporated and treated with alcohol.           The spirituous so
lution by evaporation yielded acetate of lime, muriate of soda, a
saccharine substance, and gluten partly altered, in the greater num
ber of cases: the hempseed alone gave a small quantity of acetate of
lime only.     It appears from this, that independently of the chemi
cal action exercised by the gluten on the starch, in the simple act of
germination there is always acetic acid developed. Regarding then,
with M. Becquerel, the embryo and                 all
                                            that surrounds              elec
                                                                       it   as   an
tro-negative system which retains the bases and rejects the acids                       in
the same manner                   as
                         the negative pole       pile,  of
                                                         a  experiment was
                                                                  an

       to of or to
made                  if    it         the aid
assist          contravene germination. With this view
                     to                                         pile   a  ten     of
pairs       zinc and copper was prepared, and the positive pole was
made       touch some lentil seeds, moistened with water, and the nega
 tive pole touched some others. Germination, indicated                 by
                                                                acidity,was
soon perceptible       the grainsin        of
                                     the negative pole, while      those    in          at
 the other pole     did not begin until long after. This result led
                           it                                             the     to

               FALL OF A METFORITE IN MORAWIA.
   At a quarter past six in the evening of the 25th of November
1833, M. Reichenbach witnessed the fall of a meteoric stone, ac
companied by a brilliant light and a noise like thunder, in the neigh
bourhood of Blansko in Moravia. On account of the woody na
ture of the country he was unable to discover the principal mass; he
succeeded, however, in finding some fragments, weighing about half
a pound. These fragments resemble the stones that fell at Benares,
L'Aigle, Berlongville, &c., so closely that they cannot be distin
guished from them.      According to Berzelius, 100 parts of the
stone contain 17-15 meteoric iron separable by the magnet, con
taining small quantities of nickel, cobalt, tin, copper, sulphur, and
phosphorus; 42.67 silicate of magnesia and protoxide of iron, in
which the silica and base contain equal quantities of oxygen, toge
ther with some sulphuret of iron; 39.43 silicate of magnesia and
protoxide of iron, mixed with silicates of potash, lime, and alumina,
in which the silica contains twice as much oxygen as the bases;
0-75 chromate of oxide of iron mixed with oxide of tin. These propor
tions are subject to some variation in different portions of the stone.

     XXV.                on the supposed Achromatism of the Eye.
                 Observations
                 By Sir DAVID BREwsTER, F.R.S., &c.
     IN Baden
           a paper “On the Achromatism of the Eye,” by the Rev.
                Powell, just published by the Ashmolean Society
     of Oxford, he has endeavoured to refute the opinions and
     statements   of different authors who have maintained that the
     eye is not an achromatic instrument. . As Mr. Powell has re
     ferred to opinions and experiments of mine upon this subject,
     I feel myself called upon either to renounce them, if they are
     wrong, or to endeavour to explain and support them if they
     are correct.
        The experiment on the marginal dispersion of my own eye,
     quoted by Mr. Powell, is admitted by him to be so far de
     cisive of the question as to prove “that the principle of                                         its
     achromatism        (if
                          exist) must    such        be

     notwithstanding this, the eye may                         be

         In  order     establish this opinion, Mr. Powell discusses
                       to
     some very decisive experiments                       of

162              Sir David Brewster’s                 Observations              on
the same focus as parallel red rays. In support of this opinion
I  may adduce the experimental testimony of Dr. Wollaston
and Dr. Young. In order to prove “the dispersive power of
the eye,” Dr.Wollaston “looks through a prism at a small
lucid point, which of course becomes a linear spectrum. But
the eye cannot so adapt itself as to make the whole spectrum
 appear a line; for if the focus be adapted to collect the red
rays to a point, the blue will be too much refracted, and ex
pand into a surface; and the reverse will happen if the eye be
adapted to the blue rays; so that in either case the line will be
 seen as a triangular space.”        To this interesting observation
Dr.   Young   adds the    following    experiments.       “The observa
tion is confirmed     by  placing   a small concave speculum in                                     dif
ferent parts of a prismatic spectrum, and ascertaining the
utmost distances at which the eye can collect the rays of
different colours to a focus. By these means                  find that the      I
red rays, from a point at 12 inches' distance, are as much                                          re
fracted as white or yellow light at 11. The difference is equal
 to the refraction of a lens 132 inches in focus*.”
    In a subsequent paper, “On some cases of the Production of
 Colour,” (Lectures, vol.           638,) Dr. Young informs
                                     ii.   p.                           that                  us

he has confirmed his previous observations                 the dispersive
 powers    ofthe eye:       “I
                             find,” says he, “that          the respective
 distances of 10 and 15 inches the extreme red and the extreme
 violet rays are similarly refracted, the difference being
            by
                                                                                                    ex

 servation already described.                   I     do
                                              not know that these                                   ex

    When Dr. Wells,             quoted
                                    as                by
                                             Mr. Powell, states “that
 the  eye has    no

                the supposed Achromatism           of the Eye.                     l63
 right in his argument, if his         facts were correct.      The refractions
 are not all performed one way. The vitreous humour acts
 as a concave lens, and the rays are refracted from the axis in
 passing from the capsule of the crystalline into the vitreous
 humour, and, as Mr. Powell justly observes, this case is pre
 cisely the same in principle as the construction for achroma
 tic microscopes which I have given in p. 408 of my Treatise
 on New Philosophical Instruments.    But in practice it is very
 different. The refractive and  dispersive powers of the cry
 stalline and vitreous humours are such that an achromatic
  compensation is impossible.
      But there is another point of view in which I would beg to
  submit this subject to Mr. Powell’s consideration.              have         I
  elsewhere stated, (and Mr. Powell has quoted the passage
 without pursuing the idea which it contains,)“that no provi
 sion is made in the human eye for the correction of colour,
 because the deviation of the differently coloured rays is too small
 to produce indistinctness of vision.” If the last of these two
 propositions be true, the first will be instantly admitted; for
 it is inconceivable that the all-wise Author of nature, who never
 works in vain, should have made the eye achromatic when it
 was not required for the purposes of vision.
     The idea that the eye would answer the purposes of vision
 more perfectly if it were achromatic, seems to be founded on
 a hasty analogy. Because an achromatic telescope, or micro
 scope, or lens, is preferable to the same instruments when
 they are not freed from colour, it is conceived that an achro
 matic eye should have the same superiority: the two cases,
 however, are considerably different. In using the telescope,
 &c., the eye views in succession every part of the image which
 they form, in every part of the object within the field of view;
but there is no eye behind the retina to view in the same man
ner the image which is formed upon that membrane. In point
of fact, the eye is incapable of seeing any object distinctly unless
it is situated in or near aris, and hence
                            its                         no importance
                                                       at it   of
                                                       a is
whatever    to   render the image distinct          distance from the
axis. Whenever the          eye wishes       to
                                            examine       object,
                                                                an                 or   a
part  of   an  object, minutely,      instantly directs
                                       it                     the axis
                                                                     to   it
of   its vision, and from the rapidity        of   its
                                                movements, and the
duration    of  the impressions        of
                                     light,    thus obtains the most

its minutest parts.
     Now   in  order   toobtain distinct, and      sensibly colourless

I     DO       not know that            it   has ever been remarked, that,                             on   di

separation         of
               the divided segments uniformly occurs, and that
this separation continues until the stem withers and dies
from the loss of its moisture.

 too much room                   be here inserted.
    Divergence being thus proved           exist very generally

                         in                       learn something       to
 of its nature and cause.
    After carefully considering                       all
                                      the observed facts,   am led                 I
 to  conclude, that they must depend, either        physical elasti         on
 city,      or    on
              that vital contractile power which      called irrita          is
 bility.      No other known principle suggests itself   which                         to
      can   reasonably ascribe them. The following facts prove,
I Ithink, very clearly that the phaenomena             divergence are       of
 not due      elasticity.

      1.The woody parts                         of
                                  trees, and even the rattan cane,
 which are   certainly    some                  of
                                    the most elastic vegetable sub
 stances, never exhibit divergence          division*.      on

      2.                         of
                          many plants which         their recent and   in
 growing state are divergent                           on
                                         division, lose this property
 when they become dead and dried, although they are               the                       in
 latter case much more elastic than before. For example, the
 stem       of
           the Common Teasel (Dipsacus fullonum), which                                          is
 strongly divergent                       its
                              recent green state, loses this property
                                     in
            botanical friend suggests the inquiry whether Dr. Johnson has ever

entirely when it has become dry and weathered (as geologists
would say) by exposure in our hedges through the winter.
But, in the latter case, it is most certainly much more elastic
than when alive and growing.
    3. Lastly, Poisons destroy the power of divergence, which
they would not do if it were dependent on a mere physical
cause such as elasticity.           This fact I state on the authority
of   very   numerous      experiments,     which it seems needless to
relate circumstantially.
    I  infer, then, from the preceding facts and arguments, that
elasticity is not the cause of divergence.                I proceed, in the
next    place,  to state the     experiments      and observations which
lead me to conclude that it is a vital property.
    1. It is most active in those parts of plants which exhibit
other vital properties and functions in the greatest perfection.
                                           I
For instance, whilst, as have stated above, it does not exist
in dead wood, and ceases as a plant loses                    moisture,            its                     it   is
found        stems, and flower- and leaf-stalks when
             in                                                    their most                in
vigorous and healthy state.
    2.   If the opinion, that this property                    vital nature,is    of
were correct, thought                          destroyed       poisons, and             bya

    168          Dr. H. Johnson       on a Property   in Plants.
   that they become curled up in circles or spiral coils. Every
   one has seen an instance of this sort in the case of common
   celery when dressed for the table.          More remarkable proofs
   of stimulation are, however, afforded in the following experi
   InentS.
      Exp. 5. Several pieces of the          stems    of different plants
   were divided, and, in a state of divergence, were immersed in
  hot water.       The divergence was at first increased in all, but
  in a few minutes they entirely collapsed; and their divergence
   was totally destroyed.
      Earp. 6.      I procured a young and
  vigorous flower-stalk of the Common
  Dandelion          (Leontodon Tarawacum)
  which curved considerably to the left
  side, fig. 3. Several notches (a, a, a, a,)
  were then made in the concave side, ex
  tending towards the axis of the flow
  er-stalk.    The latter instantly became
 erect!     and,   on cautiously applying a
 red-hot     poker     near to the entire side,
  the fibres in the latter appeared to be
 contracted, and the stem was now drawn
 towards that side (i.e. to h), the right;
 namely, the opposite to that to which
 it inclined at first.
     Having concluded from the arguments above stated (pp. 166
 and 167,) that divergence is the result of a living or vital action,
 we learn, from Experiments 3 and 4, that it is entirely de
 stroyed by poisons, which is what might be expected to take
 place if this supposition were well founded.             If  to this any
 one should object, that even physical properties such as elas
 ticity, that of a quill for example, may be destroyed by poi
 sonous liquids which have also chemical effects; I answer,
 that the objection has been already foreseen, and is in my
 opinion completely refuted, by the fact, that similar effects
 are produced by laurel-water, and even by sulphuretted hy
drogen gas, which have little chemical activity.
       here can be no doubt, therefore, that poisonous liquids
act on plants as vital agents in the same way as that in which
they would act on the living system of animals”. When it is
proved, also, by Experiments 5 and 6, that stimulants act on
parts endowed with this property, just as they would do on
    * It appears from Dr. Christison's Work on Poisons, that it occasionally
happens when these agents are taken into the stomach that the contracti
lity of the muscles is destroyed.

    946. There is no point in electrical science which seems to
 me of more importance than the state of the metals and the
 electrolytic conductor in a simple voltaic circuit before and at
 the moment when metallic contact is first completed.                                                       If
 clearly understood, I feel no doubt it would supply us with a
 direct key to the laws under which the great variety of voltaic
excitements, direct and incidental, occur, and open out va
 rious new fields of research for our investigation.
    947. We seem to have the power of deciding to a certain
 extent in numerous cases of chemical affinity, (as of zinc with
 the oxygen of water, &c. &c.) which of two modes of action of
the attractive power shall be exerted (996.).            In the one mode
 we can transfer the      power   onwards,    and make it produce else
 where         its

                                           similar but opposed state.
Whilst this state           retained,
                                  is                    no
                                           further change occurs; but
when           relieved,
              it   is            completionby      the circuit,  of  which                     in

             State   of Tension   between the 2inc and Water.            175
case the forces determined      in opposite directions, with respect
to the zinc and the     electrolyte, are found exactly competent
to neutralize each    other, then a series of decompositions and
recompositions takes place amongst the particles of oxygen
and hydrogen constituting the water, between the place of
relief and the place where the zinc is active; these interven
ing particles being evidently in close dependence upon and
relation to each other. The zinc forms a direct compound
with those particles of oxygen which were, immediately be
fore, in divided relation to both it and the hydrogen: the
oxide is removed by the acid, and a fresh surface of contact
between the zinc and water is presented, to renew and re
peat the action.
    950. Practically, the state of tension is best relieved by
 dipping a metal which has less attraction for oxygen than the
 zinc, into the dilute acid, and making it also touch the zinc.
 The force of chemical affinity, which has been influenced or
 polarized in the particles of the water by the dominant attrac
 tion of the zinc for the oxygen, is then transferred, in a most
 extraordinary manner, through the two metals, so as to re
 enter upon the circuit in the electrolytic conductor, which can
 not convey or transfer it without decomposition as the metals
 can; or rather, probably, it is exactly balanced and neutralized
 by the force which at the same moment completes the combi
 nation of the zinc with the oxygen of the water. The forces,
 in fact, of the two particles which are acting towards each
 other, and which are therefore in opposite directions, are the
 origin of the two opposite forces, or directions of force, in the
 current. They are of necessity equivalent to each other. Being
 transferred forward in contrary directions, they produce what
 is called the voltaic current: and it seems to me impossible to
 resist the idea that it must be preceded by a state of tension
 in the fluid, and between the fluid and the zinc.; the first con
 sequence of the affinity of the zinc for the oxygen of the water.
     951. I have sought carefully for indications of a state of
  tension in the electrolytic conductor; and conceiving that it
  might produce something like structure, either before or du
  ring its discharge,   Iendeavoured       to

 the bubbles of gas rising from them did not obscure the cen
 tral parts of the liquid.
    952. A saturated solution of sulphate of soda was put into
 the cell, and the electrodes connected with a battery of 150
 pairs of 4-inch plates: the current of electricity was conduct
 ed across the cell so freely, that the discharge was as good as
 if a wire had been used. A ray of polarized light was then
 transmitted through this solution, directly across the course
 of the electric current, and examined by an analysing plate;
 but though it penetrated seven inches of solution thus sub
ject to the action of the electricity, and though contact was
 sometimes made, sometimes broken, and occasionally re
 versed during the observations, not the slightest trace of
 action on the ray could be perceived.
    953. The large electrodes were then removed, and others
 introduced which fitted the ends of the cell.               In each a slit
 was  cut,  so as to allow the      light  to pass.     The course of the
 polarized ray was now parallel to the current, or in the direc

facts, and the known specific heat of air, we can calculate the
weight of water m' which would be converted into vapour by
the heat which a given weight of air would evolve in cooling
from t, the temperature of the atmosphere, to t, that of the
moistened bulb; and we can also calculate the total quantity

   To   this solution the following objections may               urged:                         be
     1st,That the air which         cooled                             by
                                                  contact with the moist

proof       to   be
                saturated with moisture.
   2nd, That the caloric             elasticity   of steam       1129° only of                 is
at 50°.
   3rd, That the specific heat               air       267 only under
                                                                 of          is                                        a

   4th, That the medium which                cooled from                 not                         to        is

                                                                                               t          tº

                         a                     air and vapour.
   5th, That the caloric which,               the temperature           con                                t',

the air          by
                contact, but partly also             radiation from sur     by
rounding bodies.
   With respect          the first objection,
                                 to                 have only       observe I                        to

bad conductor          heat, and that                                 is,
                                                 therefore, very unlikely

by  actual contact with the moistened bulb. But                   such con                          if
tact    beestablished       the case  in                    of

     Inreference       the second objection
                             to                       must,       course, be it                 of

                               1129 cannot give rise          any material
error.
     The third objection    one    considerable weight. The spe

made for this variation. But what         the law which this latter   is
observes?     Upon    this point different opinions would appear
to      entertained. According, however,

Berard, (whose views, if not rigorously exact, are sufficiently
so for my present purpose,) for small variations of pressure,
such as occur to the natural atmosphere, the differences of
specific heats under a constant volume are proportional to
the differences of pressure. And the same philosophers
have shown that for pressures in the ratio of 1 to 1:3583,
•3583 : 2396 : :             ;
the corresponding capacities are 1 and 1.2396.

under a constant volume at 30, and r that at p; a propor
tion from which we deduce a = (-0223 p + 3312) c.
   But the specific heats under a constant volume, divided by
the densities, give the specific heats of equal weights. And
as the densities vary as the pressures directly, and as the tem
peratures +448 inversely, and are therefore to each other

temperature, the quantities of caloric which it loses and gains in
a given time are perfectly equal.    This requires no demonstra

the water into vapour; but the whole of the acquired caloric is
not necessarily derived, though this is assumed to be the case,
from the air cooled by contact with the bulb of the instru

cool  body  placed in a warm medium, and it must consequent

amount of caloric than it imparts to them in virtue of the

 (38.), when t is increased by                     #,           Thus, then, adopting the

     Manganese, and of analysing the Minerals which contain
     Manganese and Iron, &c. By THoMAs EveRITT, Esq., Pro
    jessor of Chemistry to the Medico-Botanical Society, &c."
                   had occasion for some pounds of pure salts of
  HAVING manganese for experiments on dyeing, my attention was
 turned to consider the convenience and oeconomy of those
 processes     prescribed in our systematic works.        The process
 of   Faraday    by hydrochlorate    of  ammonia,    is easy of execu
  tion, and perfect as to the results, but expensive; that of
  Turner, “by mixing the oxide left after procuring oxygen gas
  by heat with one sixth of charcoal, and exposing to a white
  heat for half an hour in a covered crucible, dissolving in
  hydrochloric acid, evaporating to dryness, and keeping the
  mass in perfect fusion for a quarter of an hour, &c.” yields also
  good results, but is tedious in the execution, and expensive, if
  time and trouble be considered; moreover, by the first igni
  tion, although we subsequently save a little hydrochloric
  acid (none being lost as chlorine) by reducing the manganese
  to protoxide, we also at the same time render the iron in such
  a state that on dissolving in hydrochloric acid, we have a
  protoxide, which is more difficult to get quit of by the second
  ignition than it would have been as a peroxide.
      As I possessed a large quantity of hydrochlorate of man
  ganese and iron, the accumulated solutions from preparing
   chlorine by hydrochloric acid and ordinary oxide of man
  ganese, I was induced to make a variety of trials on this          li
   quid with the view of separating the iron from the man
   ganese; the results of which trials being entirely satisfactory,
   I venture to request a place for a short account of them in
   the London and Edinburgh Philosophical Magazine.
      Method, No. I.-Depending on the circumstance that when
   a solution of hydrochlorate of iron, strictly perovide (which is
   always the case in the above liquid), is evaporated to dryness,
   and the heat afterwards slightly elevated, a small portion sub

     The clear decanted or filtered liquid, generally acid and of
 a dark colour, is to be evaporated to dryness in a porcelain
 dish, when a mass of small bright yellow crystals will be ob
 tained. The heat of the sand-bath is now to be considerably
 increased, when, by constantly stirring the mass, taking care
 to heat the sides as well as the bottom of the dish, it soon ac
 quires a gray ashy aspect; and if the operation be continued
 till hydrochloric acid gas ceases to rise (this to be ascertained
 by holding a rod dipped in ammonia over it), we obtain, on
 pouring water on it and filtering, a colourless liquid, contain

  While    making some further observations           the presence                     on

had not been overlooked. For that purpose the following
experiments were made.         portion     incinerated blood was
                                                  A                     of

ture: the solution so formed was decanted from the insoluble
residue, which consisted      granular white particles
                                               of            admix                                 in

The decanted solution was evaporated        dryness. Very dilute         to
sulphuric acid was next boiled        the dry mass for      few mi

washed with distilled water, dried, and heated to redness in a
platinum crucible; it became of a dark colour, and when cold
had a distinct reddish hue, owing, doubtless, to a portion of
phosphate of iron in admixture, as that substance does not
redissolve with the dried chloride. The mass was therefore
boiled in aqua regia, when a light coloured powder was left
undissolved: this, on being examined before the blowpipe on
a platinum support, gave a yellow bead (becoming colourless
when cold) in the outer flame; and a yellow bead, becoming
reddish while cooling, and purple inclining to blue when
cold, if the inner flame was directed on                    it.
    A  second portion        incinerated blood was similarly treated,
                                   of
excepting that the dried chloride was (as several digestions
with aqua regia were had recourse to) each time washed away
from the mass           the vessel used for the digestions. By this
                             in
means    a  residual mass was procured,           white colour inclin

produced yellow colour when heated, becoming nearly white
                 a
when cold. Distilled water was boiled on the fused mass,
when    a light flocculent white precipitate was seen floating                                in
the  liquor,   and       heavier fawn-coloured powder (which gave
                             a
the reactions         titanic acid before the blowpipe) appeared
                       of                                                                     at
the bottom           of
                   the vessel.    The flocculent precipitate was col
lected and dissolved          cold dilute muriatic acid: the solution
                                   in
gave   a dark green coloured precipitate when neutralized with
ammonia and tested with hydrosulphuret                ammonia, and
                                                                  of of

reddish brown         precipitate   with infusion      galls; the sul
phuret when collected and ignited behaved                   titanic acid   as
before the blowpipe.             every specimen

muriatic acid has been used as solvent: this insoluble matter
in every instance has been              white    a a

   21. Having obtained these decisive results, proceeded to                       I
operate with other sources of heat, and with different tourma
lines.  Anxious to avoid the interposition of glass, I had a
pair of tourmalines of large size cut without any support. But
the best kind will not bear this, and they polarized imperfectly.
Only fifteen sixteenths (approximately) of the light in the
bright position was stopped in the dark, whilst with the tour
         A and B every vestige of the brightest gas flame was
excluded.      With these tourmalines (which may be called C
and D) I verified the general conclusions.               was unable to           I
get sufficient effect from non-luminous heat to verify the law
in that case.
    22.      I
           had two very fine tourmalines cut and mounted on ex
tremely thin glass. These we may call E and F. With them
I  was enabled to extend and verify the law of polarization even
to the case of non-luminous heated brass, (whose temperature
when warmed by alcohol, M. Melloni estimates at 390° cent.
 = 7.84° Fahr.) And it is worthy of observation that among
twenty-nine pairs of comparative observations, made with three
 sets of tourmalines, and heated from the following sources,                                                   Ar

      I cannot, therefore,             entertain any doubt on the polarization
of heat by tourmaline, notwithstanding the opposite result
which M. Melloni (and I also at first) obtained.
   25. Some very curious considerations arise from the study
of  these facts.   Since 84 per cent. of the heating rays of an
Argand lamp pass through the second tourmaline in the case
where the light is entirely stopped, we must adopt one of two
conclusions: either that the heat which necessarily accompa
nies light is excessively small, or else that radiant light during
 its instantaneous passage through        medium,       capable
                                                        a                       is              of
 being converted into radiant heat.             The latter supposition we
 have     no  analogies strong enough                warrantto           adopt,  us   to
 though were heat really not polarized                    by
                                                       tourmaline, we must
 have done so. All our experiments point                   the first, namely,
                                                                  to
 that heat, though intimately partaking                      of

                                  is           of
                                            almost complete separation
from    of it others. Thus, almost                  all
                                                 the heat      stopped     is                 by
plate      alum, which transmits nearly the whole light, whilst
           in                                                                               a a
second plate        tourmaline stops the whole light, but transmits
a  large share      of of
                      the heat.
    26. The tourmaline affords precious method a                       investi       of
gating the influence              of
                               light, since the quantity            matter       of

                     is                                               be

independent of the nature of the accompanying light.
    29. The only fact which appeared to militate against this
view, so far as coloured media were concerned, was the case
of green light. It appeared probable that this arose from some
peculiarity in the absorptive nature of the material, not from                                            its
colour.    To investigate this point, tried the relative trans

the plane of incidence corresponded with one of the neutral
sections of the mica-plate, (the section used was that perpendi
cular to the principal plane,) so that the transmitted pencil
would be polarized exactly similarly to that refracted through
glass or any singly refracting medium.

ten plates, whilst the others (C and D) were only half the
thickness, and contained but half as many reflecting surfaces.
I  found that these plates, placed at the proper angle, polarized
light very satisfactorily. On applying them to heat, I had the

   36.  I  fitted up two other bundles of mica-plates, in square
pasteboard tubes of the kind described, which were marked
E and F, the other plates being occasionally substituted, in
order to verify the results, and to show that no accidental pe
culiarity of the plates could account for the differences ob
served.     My experiments were usually made thus. The tube
E was fixed to the pile; the tube F, containing the other
plate, had an index, which pointed to 0° when the two plates
were parallel, to 90° when they were at right angles, &c. Five
observations were taken; at 0°, 90°, 180°, 270°, and again at
0°. The mean of the first and last were taken; then the
mean of this, and the indication at 180°, and the difference
between this and the mean at 90° and 270°, was considered
as the polarizing effect. An example will best illustrate this:–

I  was able, by the improved method of observing the galva
nometer, art. (5), (6), to establish completely the polarizing
effect. One series of six comparisons (conducted as in (20),)

with the quantity of light polarized, which was derived from
some rude photometrical experiments, which agreed pretty
nearly, we get the following approximations to the degrees of
polarization, by a given combination, and depending on the

 ing, in comparative detail, the history of the subjects more summarily
treated    of in the text or Catechism itself.
     In the preparation of the present edition, it is stated by the editor,
 Mr. Brayley Jun., in his “Advertisement," that it has been his pur
pose to introduce every new fact in Chemistry, possessing a degree
of general importance entitling it to notice in a popular elementary
work, which had been discovered since the date of the preceding edi
tion (1826), and to adapt the Chemical Catechism to the actual con
dition of the science; but at the same time sedulously to preserve that
character and general arrangement, which had acquired, for the pre
vious editions, a popularity so extensive and so lasting. He has endea
 voured, therefore, he states in continuation, to treat every new sub
ject in the manner in which       the Author would himself have treated    it;
 and in those cases in which the Author's original remarks were af
fected by the progress of science, he has been careful rather to make
 them valid, by giving them a correct turn, than to omit or materially
 to alter them. Where also, in former editions of the Work, a parti
 cular statement has been made upon an important subject, which sub
 sequent discoveries have impugned, the Editor has frequently retained
 the statement, adding the requisite corrections, instead of expunging
 it; in order that readers who have derived their views on the subject
 alluded to from former editions, and who may refer to it as treated
 in the present, may observe the correction, and be thus informed of
  the truth as now known. The same course has been pursued, he             in
 timates, in other instances, for the sake of preserving a notice of the
 history of the science on the point in question.
     The principal subjects now introduced into the Chemical Catechism
  for the first time, or the history of which, it is stated, has been so mate
  rially improved as to render them virtually new, appear to be the fol
  lowing:—the phaenomena of the Conduction and Radiation of Caloric;
  the new earth Thorina, as now recognised by Berzelius; the Vegeto
  alkalies; the new mineral alkali, Lithia; Bromine, Fluorine, and
  Boron; the Metals of the Earths, as obtained and described by Ber
  zelius, Wöhler, Oersted, and Bussy; and the new metal more re
  cently discovered, Vanadium.         A Table of Chemical Equivalents has
  also been added to the “Chemical Tables” at the end of the volume;
  and the higher temperatures mentioned in the “Table of the Effects
   of Heat,” have been corrected, agreeably to the pyrometrical re
  searches of Mr. Daniell.       A variety of other subjects are also noticed
  for the first time in the  present   edition, but more briefly than the for
  mer, and chiefly in notes, in connexion with the history of the sub
  stances or principles to which they relate.        Among these we observe
   Saussure's   experiments  on the variations in the proportion of carbonic
   acid contained in the   air;  the identity of gases and vapours as shown
  by Mr. Faraday; the present state of our knowledge respecting the
   proportions of oxygen and nitrogen in atmospheric air; the true
   nature of glass; the use of alumina in the form of clay in retaining
   subterranean waters, and throwing them up as springs to the earth's
   surface; the geological history of common salt; the management of
   Dr. Wollaston's test for potash; the history of the supposed amalgam

   The author enumerates eleven species of this genus, the whole of
which, except one from Mexico, are from California and the regions
bordering on Columbia River, where they were discovered by Mr.
Douglas. The Lotus sericeus of Pursh and several other species with
solitary flowers, formerly referred by the author to Hosackia, he now
considers as more naturally associating with Lotus than with that
genus. His amended character of Hosackia is as follows: Calyx tu
bulosus vel subcampanulatus, 5-dentatus.          Verilli unguis a caeteris
distans. Ala vexillum subaequantes, patentes. Carina submutica.

of this importance.  Under these circumstances, a representation
of the                        Lords Commissioners of the Admi
         case was laid before the
ralty, who immediately ordered a fair copy of the observations to
be made; and the same was by them presented to this Society in
December 1832. It was in consequence of this gift that the author
was induced to draw up the present memoir.
   Mr. Baily first gives an account of the number and state of the
instruments at the Observatory, the clocks, &c.; and it appears that
for four years, at least, after Dr. Halley was appointed to his situa
tion, he had only a 53-feet transit instrument wherewith to carry
on his observations. This is the first instrument of the kind erected
there, and is described as “a curious telescopic instrument, fitted
to an axis, and adjusted with screws to revolve in the plane of the
meridian.” It is evident, therefore, that Halley could at that period
take nothing but transits.     On the erection of the mural quadrant,
however, in 1725, he was enabled also to take the zenith distances
of the stars. He made observations likewise with two or three move
able telescopes with which he was furnished. And much confusion
occurs, in the manuscript books, from the circumstance that the ob
servations with      these different instruments are recorded exactly
                            all
alike,   so
          that there    nothing    guide the reader

observation of Polaris, above and below the pole, on the same day.
There are eight occultations recorded; together with five solar, and
four lunar eclipses.      And amongst the usual observations there are
three transits of the two singular stars 36 Ophiuchi and 30 Scorpii,
remarkable for their great proper motion—journeying together
through space, although upwards of 13' distant from each other.
Flamsteed has only one observation of 30 Scorpii, and Bradley did
not observe it at          all
                          right ascension. These observations, therefore,
by                           so in
     Dr. Halley are       far interesting and satisfactory, that they con

actly six o'clock. It consisted of several groups of vertical beams of
pale yellowish light on both sides of the north star, extending nearly
to equal distances in the western and eastern directions. These
beams presented the strongest light at their bases, and grew gra
dually fainter, to their superior extremities, where they softened
and gently glided into the most attenuated light, and were lost at
various altitudes, some of which were near to the zenith.        These
streamers soon faded, and gave place to a few straggling vertical
coruscations, displayed in various parts of the northern sky, which
in their turn were again succeeded by the finest streamers         ever                      I
beheld. It was now five minutes past six. These splendid streamers
were of the same tint as the former, and extended from the black
nucleus near the horizon to the zenith in nearly the same manner;
but the refulgence of these far exceeded that of the former.
These streamers consisted principally of two parallel groups, one on
each side of the north, and with some considerable distance between
them. Smaller streamers were, however, playing in the intermediate
space, and also on their outer horizontal skirts.      The horizontal
boundaries of the aurora, at this time, seemed to be the Milky Way
on the west, and near to the planet Mars on the east.        From this
time the aurora gradually diminished in splendour, and about seven
was nearly lost; it occasionally, however, brightened with a few
faint flashing momentary streamers till between ten and eleven, at
            I
which time discontinued my observations.
   During the display of the fine streamers, which first presented
themselves about five minutes past six, I hurried home to adjust a
magnetic needle. It was about half-past six before had my mag                  I
                  its fit
netic apparatus      for observation, and the splendour      the aurora            of
had now    passed     meridian.     diligently watched the needle and
                                          I
the aurora till half-past ten, but observed nothing      the motions     in                         of
the former that could possibly                be

   CARBONATE OF STRONTIA DISCOVERED IN THE UNITED STATES.
      The following letter on this subject is contained in Silliman's
   Journal for October last.
      “I   embrace an early opportunity of stating, through the medium
   of the Journal of Science, the discovery of the carbonate of strontia
   in this country.       So far as my knowledge extends, this mineral has
   not, until the present time, been observed in the limits of the United
   States, and it is even considered rare in Europe.             This fact makes
, it peculiarly interesting        to our mineralogists.       Perhaps I ought to
  make a reserve in pronouncing it pure carbonate of strontia, as the
   mineral may contain other elements besides carbonic acid and
  strontia. The following are some of                        its

nitric or muriatic solution of these oxides sufficient to saturate them ;
ammonia is to be poured into the solution, which occasions a pre
cipitate, which is redissolved by excess of ammonia.          The liquor
assumes a   greyish blue or violet tint, according to the  proportions   of
the two oxides.     Exposed to the air in an open vessel, this solution
loses the excess of ammonia, and becomes turbid.             The deposit
formed consists of a double     paraphosphate   of nickel and ammonia,
at first of a greyish colour,  and then of a fine green.     When the                                                    li
quor becomes clear, the solution is of a fine rose colour.       If it con
tains no nickel, it may be evaporated without becoming turbid, to
the consistence of a syrup.      The two salts being thus isolated, the
paraphosphoric acid is to be separated either by the hydrosulphuret
of ammonia or by carbonate of soda.
SEPARATION OF Oxi DE OF CADMI UM AND OXIDE OF BISM UTH.

while paraphosphate of cadmium dissolves readily in it as long as
there is excess of ammonia.                      If,

When strong sulphuric acid is poured upon these crystals, they
yield water to it and become opake, without effervescing.
   The aqueous solution of these crystals is colourless, and contains
protoxide of iron. Nitrate of silver does not throw down any chlo
ride; but after some time metallic silver is precipitated.   There is
therefore no muriatic acid in these crystals, and they act like sul
 phate   of iron and ammonia.             -

        PEROXI DE OF IRON       AS AN   ANTIDOTE TO ARSENIOUS ACID.
       The following letter, addressed by Dr. Bunson to M. Poggen
   dorff, is translated from the Journal de Pharmacie for October
   last.
                                                    Gottingen, May 1, 1834.
       It is  long  since I   observed,  that a solution of arsenious acid is
  so completely precipitated by pure hydrate of iron recently preci
  pitated, and suspended in water, that a current of sulphuretted hy
   drogen gas passed into the liquor after filtration, and the addition
  of a small quantity of muriatic acid, does not indicate the presence
  of the smallest portion of arsenious acid.
       I have also found, that if a few drops of ammonia be added to
  this substance, and it be digested in a gentle heat, with arsenious
  acid reduced to fine powder, a subperarsenite of iron, which is per
  fectly insoluble, is quickly formed. A series of experiments, foun
  ded upon this observation, has firmly persuaded me that this sub
 stance combines the most favourable properties for serving as an
 antidote to arsenious acid, both solid and in solution. Dr. Berthold
 consented, at my request, to assist me in examining this subject in
 all its bearings, and to submit it to the most rigorous experiments.
 The results of this examination have much exceeded our expecta
 tion, and have confirmed us in the persuasion that perhydrate of
 iron is a better antidote for arsenious acid, both solid and in solu
 tion, than albumen is for corrosive sublimate.
      Two    young dogs, scarcely 12inches high, had four to eight grains
 of arsenious acid given to      them in fine powder, and theoesophagus was
 tied to prevent vomiting; they lived more than a week without ex
hibiting the slightest symptoms of poisoning by arsenic, either du
ring life or on examination after death. The excrements voided were
in very small quantity, for the animals were deprived of food and
drink, and they contained almost the whole of the poisonous sub
stance in the state of subperarsenite of iron.
      We satisfied ourselves, by experiments upon animals, that a quan
tity of perhydrate of iron, equal to four or six drams of the peroxide
of this metal, with sixteen drops of ammonia, is sufficient to trans
form in the stomach eight or ten grains of well-pulverized arsenious
acid into insoluble arsenite. It is besides easy to see, that in cases
of poisoning by arsenic,         this substance, with or without ammonia,
may be exhibited in much larger quantity, either by the mouth or
as an enema; for the perhydrate of iron being a body totally inso

    THE LOND. AND EDINB. PHIL. MAG. FOR NOVEMBER 1834.
    BY MIR. FRANCIS WATKINS.
              To Richard Phillips, Esq., F.R.S., &c.
      MY DEAR SIR,
   On looking over your valuable Journal for the last year, I was
somewhat surprised to find in the November Number a letter from
Mr. Sturgeon detailing the results of some experiments which he
made in magneto-electricity the 28th of August 1834, with the large
steel magnet belonging to the proprietors of the Gallery of Practi
cal Science, Adelaide Street, Strand.
    I take the liberty of calling your attention to the fact, that
many months previously to the date of Mr. Sturgeon's experiments,
(namely, on the evening of the 14th of November 1833,) I had the
pleasure conjointly with Mr. Saxton (the projector and maker of
the large and splendid magnet exhibited in Adelaide Street,) of                     il
lustrating in the presence of yourself, Messrs. Faraday, Lardner,
Turner, Daniell, Cooper, Moseley, Pepys, and a host of other sci
entific gentlemen assembled at the Gallery, the mechanical, physi
cal, and chemical effects of electricity developed by steel magnets.
   You will, no doubt, recollect that on the evening in question
I superintended a large magnetic machine which was very kindly
lent at my solicitation by the Count de Predevalle, and constructed
for that nobleman by the ingenious artist M. Pixii of Paris, while
on the same evening Mr. Saxton displayed the splendid powers of
the instrument contrived and made by himself.
    There is nothing in these observations intended to underrate the
 merits of Mr. Sturgeon; indeed, I feel assured, had that gentleman
been aware of what had been already done, he would not have for
warded his letter for insertion in your Magazine.       Mr. Sturgeon
I  well know to be an ardent and zealous labourer in the field of
physical science, and I hope you will allow me here to record, that
I  have received many friendly and valuable hints from that gentle
 man. Yet in justice to Mr. Saxton and myself, I could not        the         let
opportunity pass    bringing
                       of         your recollection what had been
                                              to
achieved and experimentally illustrated months before the date                      of
Mr.   Sturgeon's experiments.
  Should you consider      worth while
                                    it                   to
                                           insert these remarks                     in
your Miscellany, your readers will                 be
                                     apprised that what Mr. Stur
geon brings forward    new     as
                               magneto-electricity
                                         in           August 1834, in
had been noticed       it by
                    Mr. Saxton, myself, and others, many months
previously. And     may here                  be
                                 observed, that notices   polar de      of
composition       by
                 magneto-electric agency were published       some           in
French journals about the latter      end     the year 1832.

244         Mr. Brayley             on the Distribution                 in the Animal Kingdom
  Among Fishes, in which we approach the first sensible ter
mination of the function of animal heat, on advancing towards
the passage from the vertebrated to the invertebrated animals
by means of the intermediate group of Annelida, we first ob
serve among the Vertebrata a decided tendency to the pro
duction or development of animal light; without, however, that
power being actually attained until we come to the Annelida
themselves, constituting the next group:-the proofs of these
facts requiring much explanation and discussion, are neces
sarily reserved for the Memoir itself.     Corresponding phaeno
mena are observable among the Coleopterous insects forming
part of the Annulosa.
   These facts indicate that the extreme terms of the animal
heat series, including (so far as our present knowledge extends,)
Birds, Mammalia, and certain Fishes, and those of the ani
mal-light series, including genera or species belonging to every
great group of Invertebrata, and to two, at least, of the inter
mediate or osculant groups (viz. Annulosa, Radiata, Acrita,
and Mollusca;-Annelida and Tunicata)—the terms of ap
parent evanescence of each power—are connected together by
a gradual transition and exchange of functions. Thus the ge
neral result to which these facts lead          that, regarding the      is,
entire animal    kingdom,    we  may  observe,    commencing with
the maximum      point     animal  heat,--a

   3rdly. It follows as a necessary and mathematical conse
quence that an eye may be perfectly achromatic for direct
centrical pencils, though not for excentrical and oblique pen
cils, which appears also to accord with observation.
   These positions, I believe, will be found to stand quite in
dependently of Sir D. Brewster's remarks, which may yet be
perfectly correct in reference to the particular cases examined,
and I should be among the first to acknowledge their value
as bearing those marks of excellence which characterize                                                all

 The large conical signal, regularly built of limestone rock,
was based on a piece of verdant level ground 365 feet south
west, and 3 feet below the level, of the extreme summit of the
moor (and of the entire ridge).                On the crown of Warton
 Crag, a limestone knoll* situated between Warton (seven
miles north of Lancaster,) and the eastern shore of the bay of
Morecambe, stands a large boulder rock, on which was raised
a tall but slender pile of stones.              Clougha Pikes, two noted
landmarks five miles E.S.E. of Lancaster, stand on the ruins
of a building which marked the boundary between Wyersdale
and Lunesdale at the abrupt termination of a grit ridge ex
tending in a westerly direction from Bolland Forest. The
eastern pike was considerably reduced in height to avoid
mistaking it for the other, which was formed conical, but with
an axis unavoidably so much inclined as to render it very
difficult of accurate bisectiont. Principally to obtain the
height of Lancaster church tower above the canal, a few ob
servations were made at the bridge one mile from Lancaster,
on the road to Kirkby Lonsdale, and at a station 64% feet to
the south-east, on the towing-path of the canal near the aque
duct across the Lune.
    A   few observations on the identity of site of my signals
with those of Colonel Mudge at such of his stations, &c., as
were adopted as a basis for the triangulation may not be im
properly introduced here. At the Calf, five miles north of
Sedbergh, the highest ground or nearly sof of the Howgill
(clayslate) Fells, the turf signal stands precisely where were
found wooden stakes, numerous loose stones, &c., the usual
vestiges of the Colonel's stations.            From the regular figure
and   great   size of the   pike  on Black Comb, it forms, no doubt,
although apparently not placed on the highest part of the fell,
one of the numerous signals erected a few years ago at Co
lonel Mudge's stations in the Lake district by the party en
gaged in extending his survey into Scotland and Ireland. As
the diminutive pike seen from Hest-bank and other low
situations at some distance to the left of the other, is invisible
from elevated ground, it is most probably placed as a guide
on the side of the crest of the hill. Rossal Landmark, a lofty
   * On Warton      Sands dull-red grit, horizontally bedded, rises a few feet
 above the level  of high-water  mark, and abuts(?) against the western flanks
 of the Crag.
   + Cylindrical signals are much superior in this respect to those of a
 conical figure.
      When the telescopic level, resting on a stone about a foot high,
 pointed at a knoll nearly a mile to the southward, the bubble stood be

252          Mr.   J. Nixon     on the Trigonometrical                  Height
for the greater certainty, oblique to the horizon, and on the
repeating principle.    As the new data, although partially
explanatory of the previous discrepancies, proved unsatisfac
tory in some minor respects, the principal angles were re
measured the following year by my repeating circle, recently
fitted up by Mr. Lealand with new axes, Ys, and telescope.
    The theodolite is identical in construction with the one
figured at page 8 of Mr. Simms's Treatise on Surveying-In
struments, and would measure horizontal angles by repetition,
as described at pages   15–16 of the same work, were not the
tangent screw of elevation so powerful as to disturb the feeble
clamping-apparatus of the two circles. When the multiple of
an oblique angle is required, adjust the upper circle and the
line of collimation to be parallel to the horizon, and conse
quently to each other. The circle must then be got into the
plane of the two signals by the two pair of screws of the pa
rallel plates; and when this is effected the telescope will bisect
in succession both signals as the upper plate moves about                                 its
axis, and the process           of
                            repetition may        conducted   be every               in
other respect precisely the same         for horizontal angles. The

  ground apparently quite firm, a certain angle was satisfactorily
  repeated to the fifteenth time, when it was discovered that my
  moving two or three feet to the right caused the telescope to
  swerve in azimuth.          On repeating the measurement at the
  foundations of the old building, the previous one proved to be
  nearly 15” in excess *.
     The Ys being constructed of equal height, (as was proved
 by the reversed telescope pointing at the previous mark on
 turning the circle half round in azimuth,) the line of collima

 it to bisect the same distant mark during a revolution of the

   Remarks.-In the triangles I. to VI, the distances to Ingle
borough derived from the first base line agree to a foot with
those obtained by the second, and give the distance from the
Calf to Rossal Landmark (nearly 38 miles,) equally correct.
With regard to the distance to Lancaster Church tower, of
which my measurement appears to be 24 feet in excess, it may
be viewed either as a base of verification, proving my distances
to be in excess at the rate of 1 in 4000; or, if my signal is
placed 5 feet too much to the northward, and the Colonel has
observed the north-east angle of the church tower, then will
the error be reduced to 3% feet”.

initial arbitrary discontinuity of the motion. The general
proposition proved above renders it unnecessary to have re
course to this method.
   To complete this subject it will be proper to determine
what takes place when the propagated motion reaches the
fixed extremity of the chord.       Suppose two propagations to
take  place in opposite directions, being exactly like in every re
spect excepting that the ordinates in one are of a contrary
sign to those in the other. The point where the opposite
propagations meet, being affected by equal and opposite mo
tions, will remain constantly at rest.    Nothing will be altered
if this be supposed a fixed point, and the portion of the chord
on one side be removed. We have then the case of a pro
pagation reflected from a fixed extremity of the chord, and
the manner in which it will take place is easily inferred from
these considerations. This proposition being proved, the prin
ciples advocated in this paper, suffice for solving       the ques                all
tions commonly proposed respecting the vibrations            elastic                    of

neath that degree at which the elements of water, unaided by
any secondary force resulting from the capability of combina
tion with the matter of the electrodes, or of the liquid sur
rounding them, separated from each other.
   971. It may be supposed, that the oxygen and hydrogen
had been evolved in such small quantities as to have entirely
dissolved in the water, and finally to have escaped at the sur
face, or to have reunited into water.           That the hydrogen
can be so dissolved was shown in the first vessel; for after
several days minute bubbles of gas gradually appeared upon
a glass rod, inserted to retain the zinc and platina apart, and
also upon the platina plate itself, and these were hydrogen.
They resulted in this way. Notwithstanding the amalgama
tion of the zinc, the acid exerted a little direct action upon                                     it,
so  thata  small stream        hydrogen bubbles was continually

and these at last completed the metallic communication;       and
at the same time that   they transmitted a more     powerful cur
rent than the fused chloride, they proved that electro-chemical
decomposition of that chloride had been going on. Hence it
appears, that the current excited by dilute sulphuric acid be
tween zinc and platina, has an intensity above that required
to electrolyze the fused chloride of silver when placed between
platina electrodes, although it has not intensity enough to de
compose chloride of lead, under the same circumstances.

currents      of  less  intensity  than this, the water, whether pure
or   acidulated, has equal conducting power. An apparatus,
fig. 12, was arranged with dilute sulphuric acid              the vessel         in                    A,

278 Dr. Faraday's Experimental Researches in Electricity.
and pure distilled water in the vessel B.              By the decomposi
tion at   e, it appeared     as if water was a better conductor than
 dilute sulphuric acid for a current of such low intensity as to
 cause no decomposition.           I am inclined, however, to attribute
 this apparent superiority of water to variations in that peculiar
condition of the platina electrodes which is referred to further
on in this Series (1040.), and which is assumed, as far as I can
judge, to a greater degree in dilute sulphuric acid than in
pure water. The power, therefore, of acids, alkalies, salts,
 and other bodies in solution, to increase conducting power,
 appears to hold good only in those cases where the electrolyte
 subject to the current suffers decomposition, and loses                   in                          all
fluence when the current transmitted has too low                    intensity                   an

 Ozodicera for a genus of Tipulidae for which in the same memoir I had pro
posed the name of Hemicteina. The specific names of several of the in
sects described in the same memoir will also sink into synonyms, Mr.
Walker having published a description of them in the Entomological Maga
zine for January 1835.         In like manner my Aschiphasma annulipes will
sink into a synonym of Perlamorphus hieroglyphicus of Mr. G. R. Gray's
 monograph upon the Phasmidae, just published.             The great convenience
 arising from the publication of scientific works at short intervals, such as
 the Philosophical Magazine, is thus especially evidenced.

282        Mr. D. Griffin                on an unusual Affection              of the Eye.
shall feel gratified if I can learn whether it has ever been ob
served by others.
    One day in the early part of last July, after having spent a
considerable time in looking at various land objects through
a telescope, I perceived a very great indistinctness of vision
after I had left off, which I soon found existed entirely in the
left eye. I had kept this eye closed while I was at the tele
scope; and having often observed before that some indistinct
ness of vision occurred in the same circumstances,               attri                      I
buted it to the weakness of       sight that would   naturally  follow
from having kept that eye unemployed while using the other,
and did not mind it much at first.         It seemed now, however,
so great that              I
                   covered the right eye to examine the state of
the other more     particularly.
      I
      then found, with some surprise, that it gave more than
one image, and on directing it towards a box on the chimney
piece, about eight or nine feet from me, on the front of which
were some large and extremely well printed letters, I per
ceived that there were three distinct images of those letters
placed vertically one above the other. The lowest, which                                              I
 shall call the true image, was undisturbed from                proper                  its
place. The dislocation           the second image was just
                                                 of              great                      so
 as   to
       make      overlap more than the upper half
                      it                                      the last                 of
 mentioned, and       light was scarcely,
                                its               all, inferior    that
                                                                    if   at                     to
of    the true one.              The light            of
                                      the third was much more faint
than that         of
               either     the others, and
                                    of                             its
                                               displacement was such
 as    allow
      to          still slightly
                      it             overlap the true image
                                                      to                                         at   its
upper edge, where the combination              the three images proof
duced      dark line   along  the letters  exactly similar      appear                 in
           to a
ance      overlying shadows. There was not the least displace
ment towards either side, unless           changed my head from
                                                            I                                         an
erect   position;   and      could not find any trace
                                      I                           fourth               of   a
image           by
              the closest examination.        This affection lessened
gradually       the course
                     in         the evening, the false images slowly
                                            of
descending            to
                  their true  place,   and next day that eye was                                      as
perfect         as
             the other.
 I    was for some time puzzled           account for this strange ap

pearance.         seemed difficult
                      It                 suppose that any functional
derangement          the retina could give origin
                           of                             three images          to
 so distinct and   separate;   and  though      double image      some

such   complaints.      The cleanness and good definition            the                         of
images seemed          indicate some optical change; and besides
                               to
this, the distortion occurring                         all

   The      effect, however, produced        was such as would result
from a distortion or       bending    back of the upper part of the
crystalline lens, producing an effect not exactiy like spherical
aberration, but like what would arise from the axis of that
part of the lens losing          parallelism its    the axis      the centre
                                                                          to                   of
               parts,                                            image   pro

the axis lay.
     In  order that      correct idea may

of   the  displacement,         necessary
                                        it   is   mention that the letters
                                                                      to
which looked
       I                         at,   at
                            the distance       three yards, and      of which                        of
the different inages were separated                 the degree mentioned  to
above, were about #ths               inch     height and about the same
                                             of    an            in
in breadth.
     The only thing that occurred                 me that could produce
 such  a   distortion was the    pressure        the upper eyelid     of tothe                             on
 eyeball, which was very considerable and long continued.
 That the distortion was           the lens alone seems probable, be
                                                 in

 duce the three images above mentioned                  must have had two          it
 sudden     bendings   backwards;      one somewhere near the middle,
 and the other near the         upper    edge.     The lower half, which
I     suppose      have been undisturbed, would

 bent backwards           some degree, would have formed

 lower      onthe retina, and therefore higher               the perception              to

         THE   analogies which have hitherto guided us from the
           laws of light to those of heat, suggest that it is far from
improbable that the influence of crystallized bodies upon pola
rized light, which produces the most splendid and most varied,
but, at thesame time, amongst the most determinate phaenomena
of optics, may have a counterpart in the science of heat. The
simpler of these, of course, it is our object first to verify: and,
to a certain extent, this is           that       all
                                                 necessary,  is order                  in          to

                                                                  in

                                               to             the case           in                of

sequent effects.             If
                          we find that heat       undergoes    the same
changes under the same circumstances,                             so

sive on this point.       I  employed the piles of mica for polarizing
by transmission, and interposed successively two plates of mica
so arranged that the Principal Section was in the one parallel
(or perpendicular), and in the other inclined 45° to the plane
of Primitive Polarization.           These were cut from the same
piece, and precisely of the same thickness; but I afterwards
employed one and the same piate, inclined alternately in two
positions.     By the first experiments with dark heat (tempera
ture about 700°) the polarizing mica plates (E and F) being
crossed, the ratios of heat transmitted, when the principal sec
tion coincided with the plane of polarization (when the depo
larizing effect was nothing), and when it was inclined 45°
(when the depolarizing effect ought te be a maximum), were
the following:
        100 : 120          100: 110       100 : 122         100 : ] 25
With different polarizing and analysing plates, viz. C and D,
the following ratios were obtained also for dark heat:
       100 : 118          100  : 120      100 :  120       100 : 113
   51.   We   have seen that the heat       of Incandescent Platinum is
highly polarizable;        it is also powerfully depolarized, as the
following    proportions obtained with polarizing mica plates,
and the same interposed films as before, indicate, as the prin
cipal section was inclined 0° or 45:
            100   :  126          100  : 138          100 : 138
   52. There were two distinct interposed plates employed for
these experiments; their thickness was such as to transmit the
red of the second order of the Newtonian Scale, when viewed
by polarized light, analysed at right angles to the plane of po
larization.     To show that no appreciable difference existed in
their   power    of stopping common or unpolarized heat, and to
point out the accuracy of such determinations, I may quote
the following experiment on the transmission of unpolarized         -
non-luminous heat through the two plates.

   65. That the same law holds in the case of heat, the expe
riments, of which the following is a brief summary, seem to
indicate.  The coincidence has generally been more perfect,
as the steadiness of the source of heat admitted of more accu
rate comparison.   The indications in the same line are alone
intended to be compared, as they are expressed in degrees of
the multiplier, the absolute amount of which would vary in
different experiments.   The interposed film of mica No. 1.
is that mentioned in (54), as giving a red of the second order
when placed between the polarizing and analysing plates
crossed; the film No. 2. gave a plum red of the first order
under the same circumstances.

position of the subject of classification would render this series of
papers still more valuable to the class of readers for whom it is de
signed.     The third article is a paper by Mr. Samuel Stutchbury,
the very efficient and meritorious Curator of the Bristol Institu
tion, read before the Philosophical and Literary Society in March
1832. It embodies, in a popular form, an outline of the history
of coral reefs and islands, derived in part from various published
authorities, but corroborated by the results of the author's personal
observations made among the islands of the Dangerous Archipe
lago, and others of the Southern Pacific Ocean.

 of a former elevation of the sea, from the presence of littoral shells
 of the same species as those now found in the Baltic. Certain plants,
 as the Glauca maritima and the Triglochin maritimus, which naturally
 inhabit salt marshes bordering the sea, flourish in a meadow to the
 south of Upsala; a fact which corroborates the supposition that the
 whole of the lake Maelar and the adjoining low lands have, at no
 very remote period of history, been covered with salt water.

   of the disturbed configurations of a system by the rules of undisturbed
  motion, if only the initial components of velocities be changed in a
   suitable manner.    Another manner of extending rigorously to dis
   turbed, the rules of undisturbed motion, by the gradual variation of
   elements, in number double the number of the coordinates or other
   marks of position of the system, which was first invented by Lagrange,
   and was afterwards improved by Poisson, is considered in this second
  essay under a form rather more general; and the general method of
  calculation which has already been applied by the author to other
  analogous questions in optics and in dynamics, is now applied to the
  integration of the equations which determine these elements. This
  general method is founded chiefly on a combination of the principle
  of variations with those of partial differentials, and may furnish, when
  matured, a separate branch of analysis, which may be denominated
  the Calculus of Principal Functions. When applied to the integra
  tion of the equations of varying elements, itsuggests the consideration
 of a certain Function of Elements, capable of being variously trans
 formed, and which may be either rigorously determined, or at least
  approached to, by a corollary of the general method. With a view to
 illustrate these new principles, and more especially those connected
 with problems of perturbation, they are applied, in this essay, first,
 to a very simple example, suggested by the motions of projectiles,
 the parabolic path being treated as the undisturbed; and secondly, to
 the problem of determining the motions of a ternary or multiple
 system, with any laws of attraction or repulsion, and with one pre
 dominant mass. This latter problem, which was touched upon in the
 former essay, is here resumed in a new manner, by forming and           in
 tegrating the differential equations of a new set of varying elements,
 entirely distinct in theory (though little differing in practice) from
 the elements conceived by Lagrange; and having this advantage,
 that the differentials of all the new elements for both the disturbed
and disturbing masses may be expressed by the coefficients of one
disturbing function.

  rent is also manifested by the occurrence of a shock, at the same mo
  ment, to a person who grasps with wetted hands the two ends of the
  wire; whereas no such effect, nor even any sensible impression on the
  tongue, is produced by the electromotor, when a short wire is em
  ployed.
     All these effects of exaltation are produced at a time when the ac
  tual current of electricity from the electromotor is greatly diminished;
  as the author shows by many experiments on the ignition of a fine
 wire, and the deflection of a galvanometer.       He also proves that the
 effects of the spark and the shock, at the moment of disjunction of a
 long wire, are due to a current far more powerful than that which
 passes through the short wire at the same instant; or indeed than
 that which passes through either the long or the short wire at any
 other instant of time than when the disjunction takes place.
     That this extraordinary effect is not due to any species of inertia,
 is shown by the fact, that the same wire will produce it in a greater or
 less degree, under circumstances incapable of influencing any effect
 depending on inertia: thus, if 100 feet of wire, when extended,
 produce a certain effect, a greater effect will be produced by coiling
 the same wire into a helix, and a still more powerful one by employ
 ing it as the helix of an electro-magnet.
     The author ultimately refers these phaenomena to an inductive ac
 tion of the current, analogous, or perhaps identical, with that described
 in the First Series of these Experimental Researches : for he found
 that when a second wire was placed parallel to the long conducting
 wire, the ends of this second wire being connected together so that a
 current of electricity could circulate roundit, then the spark and shock
 did not take place at the first wire at the moment of disjunction, but
 a current was induced at the second wire, according to the law ori
 ginally described in the First Series. The moment the current in the
second wire was interrupted, the spark and shock appeared at the
 first. These and many other experiments were adduced to prove
that these effects, namely, the shock and the spark, result from an     in
ductive action of the original current, producing, at the moment it is

which serves to convey the original current.
    The author, lastly, considers the reverse effect produced upon mak
ing contact; and concludes his paper by some general views of the
consequences resulting from this inductive action in various cases of
electric discharge; pointing out the important influence it must have
in magneto-electrical machines of the ordinary construction.
    The reading of a paper was then commenced, entitled, “Geome

Stephens Davies, Esq., F.R.S., &c.
    February 12.-Mr. Davies's paper, entitled “Geometrical Re
searches     concerning Terrestrial Magnetism,”       was resumed and
concluded.
    The object of this paper is to exhibit methods of conducting the
mathematical inquiries which are applicable to the magnetism of the
earth, by the aid of the coordinate geometry of three dimensions.

is concerned, must remain open till satisfactory data can be obtained:

of carefully executed geometrical constructions; employing for that
purpose the descriptive geometry, which has the advantage of bring

   Among the circumstances which are here recorded, and which are
 not very usually mentioned, if indeed they are known at all, are—that
of Halley's appointment to the mint above mentioned—his having
drawn up a synopsis of Newton's system for the use of James II., at
the desire of the latter—that his first voyage, by express direction,
was meant to be one of discovery in the Southern Ocean—and that
his acquaintance with Newton began about 1684.

of Platypus imposed on it by Shaw.       He remarks on the distor
tions to which the exceedingly loose integuments are liable in the
hands of stuffers unacquainted with the characteristic features of
the animal, and gives the general result of his measurements, in the
recent state, of fifteen specimens shot and captured alive, as aver
aging in the males from 1 foot 7 to 1 foot 8 inches, and in the fe
males from 1 foot 6 to 1 foot 7 inches, in total length.   One male
specimen, shot near the Murrumbidgee River, measured 1 foot 11+
inches; and a female, shot in the afternoon of the same day in the
 same part of the river, measured only 1 foot 4 inches. In these spe
 cimens the relative proportions of the beak and tail were subject to
 considerable variation.
    Mr. G. Bennett's observations were commenced on the 4th of
 October 1832, at Mundoona in the Murray County, on a part of the
 Yas River running through the estate of Mr. James Rose. The
  Water-Moles (as these animals are called by the Colonists,) chiefly
 frequent the open and tranquil parts of the stream, covered with
 aquatic plants, where the steep and shaded banks afford excellent
situations for the excavation of their burrows.        Such expanses of
water are    by  the Colonists called  “ponds.”     The animals may be
readily recognised by their dark bodies just seen level with the sur
face, above which the head is slightly raised, and by the circles made
in the water around them by their paddling action. On the slight
est alarm they instantly disappear; and indeed they seldom remain
longer on the surface than one or two minutes, but dive head fore
most with an audible splash, reappearing, if not alarmed, a short
distance from the spot at which they dived. Their action is so rapid,
and their sense of danger so lively, that the mere act of levelling the
gun is sufficient to cause their instant disappearance; and it is con
sequently only by watching them when diving, and levelling the
piece in a direction towards the spot at which they seem likely to
reappear, that a fair shot at them can be obtained.         A near shot is
absolutely requisite; and when wounded they usually sink immedi
ately, but quickly reappear on the surface.
    A male specimen was shot, and brought out by the dog, on the
following morning. In a few minutes it revived, and ran along the
ground, instinctively endeavouring to regain the water, but did not
 survive more than twenty-five minutes.        On this individual Mr. G.
Bennett made various experiments, with the view of ascertaining
 the truth of the reports so extensively circulated of the injurious
 effects resulting from wounds inflicted by the spur. In no way,
 however, could he induce the animal to make use of             its
                                                                  spurs as
 weapons   of   offence; although    in   its
                                          struggles   toescape, his hands
                             he by
 were slightly scratched       the hind claws, and even,   in consequence
 of  the positionin   which     held  it,   by
                                            the spur also. The result  of
 several subsequent repetitions      ofthe experiment with animals not
 ina   wounded state was the same. The natives, too, never seem fear
 ful  ofhandling the male Ornithorhynchus alive.
     On the evening   of  the same day female was shot, which died
                                            a
 almost immediately    on   being taken out      of
                                                the water.  In  this speci

men the mammary glands were scarcely observable on dissection;
but the left uterus was found to contain three loose ova of the size
of swan-shot.     The right uterus was less enlarged, exhibited less
vascularity, and contained no ova.    Preparations of the generative
organs of this individual, and of two other impregnated females
which were subsequently obtained, were forwarded by the author to
Mr. Owen, by whom they have been particularly described in the
‘Philosophical Transactions’ for 1834, p. 555*.
   The next day three other specimens were shot: a male and two
females. In the former the testes were found not to be larger than
very small peas, and the same fact was observed in a specimen after
wards shot in the Murrumbidgee ; whereas in that first obtained,
they were nearly of the size of pigeons' eggs. For this difference
at the same season it seems difficult to account.    The left uterus
 of one of the females was found to contain two ova, and that of the
 other a single ovum, of the size of buck-shot.    As before, no ova
 were found in the right uterus.
    On the morning of the 7th of October, Mr. G. Bennett pro
 ceeded, in company with a native, to the banks of the river to see
 the burrow of an Ornithorhynchus, from which the natives had taken
 the young during the previous summer. The burrow was situated
 on a steep part of the bank; and              its
                                      entrance, concealed among the
 long grass and other plants, was distant rather more than       foot           a
from the water's edge.         Its whole extent was not laid open, the
natives   contenting    themselves with digging down upon                      at
                                                                           stated

the burrow of       a stick which indicated its direction.                took

and strewed with      dry  river-weeds,   &c. From this nest the native
stated that    he  had taken        the previous season (December) three
                                    in
young ones, about six          oreight inches        length, and covered with
                                                      in
hair.  In   addition     to
                          the entrance above     spoken    of, the burrows have

  part of the food; but Mr. George MacLeay informed the author
  that in a situation in which water-insects were very scarce he had
  shot Ornithorhynchi with river-weeds in their pouches.
      Similar excursions were made on the 8th and 9th of October;
  and on the latter day one of the burrows was explored. The entrance
  of this burrow was situated on a moderately steep bank, abounding

Bennett determined to return to the interior and renew his investi

where he found that the river had fallen greatly, and sought in vain
 for the Water-Moles in the spots in which they had a few weeks be
fore been so abundantly seen.          Some burrows were also examined,
but without success.          On the 21st he proceeded to Gadarigby, on
the Murrumbidgee, where his exertions were more successful, seve
ral specimens being obtained; but the only female shot was young
 and unimpregnated. On the 27th he returned to Mundoona, where
a female had been shot the previous day, the uterine organs of
which afforded evidence that the young had been just produced.
The abdominal glands were large, but no milk could be expressed
from them; the fur still covered the portion of integument on which
its  ducts terminated; and there was                appearance  no     projecting            of

remain quiet, huddled up with her young ones; but at night she
became very restless, and eager       to escape.   The little ones were
 as frolicsome as puppies, and apparently as fond of play: and many
of their actions were not a little ludicrous.       During the day they
seemed to prefer a dark corner for repose, and generally resorted to
the spot to which they had been accustomed, although they would
 change it on a sudden apparently from mere caprice. They did not
appear to like deep water, but enjoyed exceedingly a bathe in shal
low water, with a turf of grass placed in one corner of the pan:
they seldom remained longer than ten or fifteen minutes in the water
at one time. Though apparently nocturnal, or at least preferring
the cool and dusky evening to the glare and heat of noon, their
movements in this respect were so irregular as to furnish no grounds
for a definite conclusion.   They slept much, and it frequently hap
pened that one slept while the other was running about, and this
occurred at almost      periods         all

much expedition       the top. Their food consisted

  He afterwards compares these results with those obtained by
Dr. Marcet from water procured from the middle of the South At
lantic; and from the great difference in the saline contents, infers
that the water of the island of St. Paul is not merely the water of
the neighbouring ocean in a state of dilution, or altered simply by
mechanical filtration.
    A paper “On the chalk and flint of Yorkshire, compared with the
chalk and flint of the southern counties of England,” by James Mit
chell, LL.D., F.G.S., was then read.
    The chalk of Yorkshire, Dr. Mitchell states, is distinguished from
that of the southern counties by                               its
                                                  great hardness,               being            by   its

and   by   its containing veins       calcareous spar. He says, that

also distinguished               by
                            the upper part being always destitute offlints,

     The flints of Yorkshire are shown                 differ from those of the

    In   conclusion the author points out the following resemblance
 between the Yorkshire chalk and that              the N.E.      ofIreland, namely, of
 the great hardness          both, and the common occurrence

stricts of Brora in Scotland, and of Boll and Banz in Germany.
Some of the sinkings produced small pieces of jet or lignite like that
of Whitby ; others nearer the escarpment went through the lias, and
reached brine springs in the subjacent red marl.
   Having proved that this basin of lias reposes upon the new red
sandstone, the author adverts to the almost unfathomable thickness of
strata by which it must be separated from the coal-measures. Three
fourths of this tract of lias are covered with thick accumulations
of gravel, sand and boulders, the nature and origin of which will be
pointed out on a subsequent occasion. With this sketch is connected
an account of a new base line of the lower lias which the author
has laid down upon the Ordnance map between Gloucester and Wor
cester. It crosses to the right bank of the Severn in the neighbour
hood of Tewkesbury, by Forthampton and Bushley, the lias occu.
pying Longden Heath as an outlier.      The lowest strata of the for
mation are described as graduating into inferior green marls and
white sandstone of the new red sandstone at Combe Hill, Bushley,
Longden, Ripple, and Boughton Hill; the characteristic strata a
little above the line of junction being thin, flag-like beds of blue
limestone and shale, characterized by Modiola Hillana, Ostreas,
Spines of Echini, Gryphaea gigantea, &c. &c. This clear escarp.
ment of the lower lias is of value, because the same strata are not
well exposed in the coast sections at Whitby and Lyme.

                                                                      a

 brine springs, both        these counties and
                            in                        Salop and Cheshire,

of England, occurring rarely, and in thin stripes. There is no trace
of the “muschelkalk” beneath these marls, and they uniformly
graduate downwards into sandstone.
   II. “Red Sandstone and Conglomerates."—The country north of
Shrewsbury affords the largest development of thick-bedded sand
stones, of grey and reddish colours, in the hills of Hawkstone, Wern,
Grinshill, Nesscliff, &c.     Ores of copper and manganese, with
sulphate of strontian, and chalcedony are of partial occurrence.
This group extends into Staffordshire and the east of Shropshire,
where it contains many bands of quartzose conglomerates, the dis
integration of which gives a wild and sterile character to large tracts.
In other parts, particularly north and south of Kidderminster, where
the pure sandy beds prevail, are large districts of rye land, which
exhibit an agricultural character quite distinct from that of any
of the groups either above or below. In the southern parts of
Worcestershire these red sandstones and conglomerates are con
cealed by a thick covering of gravel, and in Gloucester they are re
duced to a very narrow band.        The division into thick beds, false
lamination, and want of cohesion, are the characters of this group.
   III. “Calcareous Conglomerates.”—In North Worcester and Salop
calcareous conglomerates, forming natural escarpments and dipping
beneath the above sandstones, are supposed to occupy the place of
the dolomitic conglomerate of the south-west, or magnesian lime
stone of the north-east, of England.       They are largely burnt for
lime to the east of the Lickey and Clent Hills, where they are of
irregular thicknesses. These strata are repeated at Enville, the
Bowells, and at Coton, &c., between Kidderminster and Bridg
north.
   The chief imbedded fragments are of limestone, which at Coton
and the Bowells being sometimes oolitic, are supposed to have been
derived from Orelton and the Clee Hills. Fragments of old red sand-.
stone, quartz, and coal grits with impressions of plants, occur in
the impure beds which pass into calcareous grits.          This calca
reous conglomerate can only be partially detected in the red sand
stone of Apley, Nedge Hill and Lilleshall terraces, which form the
eastern boundary of the coal-field of Coalbrook-dale; and similar
slender bands, around the Dudley coal-field, may possibly be com
posed of the same conglomerate. In the west of Shropshire these
strata swell out into a distinct ridge of about two miles in length,
extending from Cardeston to Alberbury, where they have been
mentioned in previous abstracts by Professor Sedgwick” and by the
author, and where they put on many of the characters of the
dolomitic conglomerate and contain nests lined with crystals of
dolomite.
   IV. “Lower New Red Sandstone.”—In Worcester and Salop the
natural escarpment above alluded to exhibits sandstone and argilla
ceous marls, sometimes of great thickness, underlying the calcareous
conglomerate. As these are seen in several places to pass down con
formably into the coal-measures, the author identifies them with the
                    * Geol. Proceedings, vol. i. p. 345.

                              Geological Society.                                  317
lower new red of the North of England, which Professor Sedgwick
has shown to be the equivalent of the rothe todte liegende of German
geologists.    Such relations are seen in the eastern parts of the
Lickey Hills, on the southern and eastern face of the coal-field of
Coalbrook-dale, and in parts of the Shrewsbury coal-field.
    At Cantern bank near Bridgnorth and along a part of the bed
of the Severn, these strata dip away conformably from the under
lying coal-measures. Similar relations are seen at Wellbatch near
Shrewsbury, and still better at Coedway near Alberbury, where
the red sandstones and shales graduate upwards into the dolomitic
conglomerate, and downwards into coal-bearing strata. On the
whole this subformation, containing sandstone, shale, and grits,
has in some parts much the external appearance of the old red
sandstone, and in others of the coal-measures, and impressions
of plants have been found in it near Lilleshall and at Wellbatch.
 As coal has been extracted in many parts of the North of England
from beneath sandstone of this age, the author speculates on the
 probability of similar success attending well-regulated enterprises
in Salop, Stafford, and Worcester.          He alludes to a great sinking
 now going on between the edge of the Dudley coal-field and Bir
mingham, the shafts of which he believes are passing through strata
of this age.
    The author has defined the whole of the base line of the new red
 sandstone from May Hill in Gloucestershire to the Oswestry coal
 field, and has made some changes in              direction, particularly
                                                        its                          in
 the  country  between Newent and the Malvern Hills, and between
 Kidderminster and Bridgnorth. He further describes the occur
 rence of  several conglomerates along this base line, the most notable
of   which are Hafield Camp near Ledbury, Rosemary Rock near
 Knightwick bridge            on
                             the eastern flanks         the Abberley Hills,

  merates have been observed in inclined positions, and at some height
  above the adjoining plain.    At Great Malvern they adhere in one
  spot to the steep flank of the sienite in a dislocated form, dipping
  east at an angle of 30° to 35°. This fact not having been previously
  noticed is considered to be worthy of record, as leading to the in
  ference, that this chain of trappean hills may have undergone a
  movement of elevation subsequent to the deposit of the new red
  sandstone.

is deposited on cooling in the form of scales: the solution in alcohol,
with the addition of animal charcoal, is to be repeated.
   Cantharidine thus obtained has the following properties: It is ino
dorous; when heated to 400°Fahr. it melts; and if the heat be con
tinued, it is converted into white vapours, which condense in small
crystals on the sides of the vessel.
   Concentrated and boiling sulphuric acid dissolves cantharidine; the
solution has a light brown colour ; when diluted with water, it depo
sits cantharidine in small needles.
   Boiling nitric acid dissolves it without any change of colour; the
solution deposits small crystals on cooling, and the same effect is
produced by muriatic acid.
    Potash and soda dissolve cantharidine; and if concentrated acetic
acid be added to these solutions, the cantharidine is deposited in small
crystals. Ammonia has no action on cantharidine.

   N the second part of the Philosophical Transactions for
    1834, is a memoir by Dr. Ure, on the Moira brine spring
at Ashby-de-la-Zouch", which he states to contain in the gallon
the following saline ingredients:                                 Grs.

   As the author has not alluded to the paper published by
me in the Transactions for 1830, “On the occurrence of iodine
and bromine in certain mineral waters of South Britain,”
(where he would have found the Ashby waters specified as
containing the latter principle,) he does not notice the great
discrepancy between the results of his own analysis of this
spring, and those of the one I had quoted in my table on the
authority of Dr. Thomson of Glasgow.

322 Prof. Daubeny on the Moira Brine Spring, and on the
   As my    own experiments were limited to ascertaining the
proportion   of bromine present in the water,        have no right                I
to give an  opinion as to which analysis deserves a preference;
indeed, I   should rather regard the want of correspondence
between the two as corroborating an idea        have long enter            I
tained, that the saline impregnation of mineral springs often
undergoes very considerable variation in short intervals of
tlme.
   In the autumn of the year 1828, examined a mineral water    I
then recently discovered at Willoughby, in Warwickshire,
which smelt strongly of sulphuretted hydrogen, and which
appeared to contain in the gallon no less than 16:9 cubic
inches of that gas.    In the April following, by the same me
thod of operating,              I
                       could detect only 12.65 cubic inches, a
difference which I was then disposed to attribute to the greater
dilution of the water by the rains that had fallen during the
winter.    On reexamining the same spring, however, in Sep
tember of last year,                I
                         could discover only 5-2 cubic inches of
sulphuretted hydrogen in the gallon, and I ain therefore,
driven to the conclusion that a difference in point of strength
has actually occurred within the period of four or five years.
Nevertheless, as even at present the spring appears to be more
strongly impregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen than any
other in the midland counties, I am glad to take this oppor
tunity of announcing                its
                          existence, for the sake    those invalids               of
who   may  find   inconvenient

   The same supposition will account for the entire want                                                of
correspondence between the results            my analysis       the  of                          of

      Proportion of Bromine in the Waters of different Seas. 323
gives in the gallon 72 grains of sulphate of lime, and 128
grains of sulphate of soda; the second by Dr. Thomson,
which represents the same quantity as containing only 34
grains of the former salt, and 20 of the latter”; whilst the
latest of all, that of Dr. Ure, states the entire absence of all
sulphuric salts whatsoever. The quantity of saline matter is
also stated very differently by the three analysts.
   With regard to the quantity of bromine present, my estimate
in 1829 was 4.68 grains in the gallon, Dr. Ure's in 1834,
6 grains, which is perhaps as near a correspondence as, un
der   allthe circumstances, can         expected.             be

on a creamy appearance. When cold, the surface of the ingot
thus obtained was less coppery-metallic than the surface of
the ingot in the first experiment, where charcoal was used,
from which it may be inferred that, owing to the absence of
charcoal, a certain degree of refinement had taken place. The
fracture possessed more of the red grain of good copper; the
striae were less distinct and less crystalline; and the surface
instead of being convex, as in the first experiment, was con
CaVe.
    Earp. No. 3. Some of the pure shotted copper was fused in
 a black-lead crucible with an equal bulk of charcoal, and the
 resulting ingot presented a more clean and perfect mass of
 copper than the ingots obtained in Experiments No. 1 and
 No. 2. The fracture presented a series of brilliant striae ar
 ranged from surface to surface, breaking off easily in the                              di
rection of the perpendicular fibre; a structure which seems
wholly incompatible with extension and malleability.

before the cementation; though, compared with                fracture         a
the same     copper    that had not been     cemented,   the grain was
redder, the colour more brilliant, and the metal more ductile.
The bar from Experiment No.                was covered with

but the quantity or depth of grain was nowise altered, al
though the metal cut softer, and was covered with a thin crust
of shining oxide.      From these details it may be presumed
that cementation opens the grain, renders the bar less dense,
but does not change the peculiar form of the arrangement.       In
each case the copper after cementation was softer, a change
which seems favourable to rolling cold. The impure or rough
copper appears to be alloyed with another metal (no doubt
tin), which prevents that oxidation which pure copper in the
same circumstances would undergo.
   Besides the above, several bars were made from the rough
copper by a slower fusion, and with a longer exposure to the
charcoal; and it was observable that the longer the exposure,
and the slower the fusion, the more yellow and refined was
the copper in the bar.
   Some of the bars produced in the course of these experi
ments were attempted to be rolled; but the success was va
rious. Of those made from the pure copper, some rolled better
and others worse than any made from the rough copper: one
or two bars of the latter were equally malleable with the
former; but none rolled well either hot or cold. In those
bars in which the striated arrangement was most perfect, the
capacity for rolling was least, and those in which the minute
granular fracture prevailed, generally rolled the best. It cer
tainly does appear that this tendency to crystallize, so de
structive to malleability, is peculiar to English copper made
from the crucible.    There are occasions, no doubt, when, the
proper temperature being hit upon, the bar would roll; but
these occasions are so rare and uncertain that English copper
made in this manner could not be relied upon in the manipu
lations connected with manufactures. There is no question that
the arts in this country suffer from the peculiarity of English
copper.    For in consequence of it the malleabilization of that
metal is necessarily confined to the original process of refining
practised on the great scale by the copper smelters. It is very
                                                     I
different with Swedish and Russian copper, which have seen
melted in considerable quantities in large crucibles, cast into
cakes or thick sheets, and afterwards rolled into boiler plate
and thin sheet copper.     This subject requires and deserves a
scrutinous  examination,  with a view to discover the cause of
the uniform tendency of English copper to crystallize; and
that cause may, perhaps, be found in the process employed
in this country for the smelting of copper ores, a process
which, however oeconomical and well calculated to overcome
quantity, has never yet produced pure copper.

  atoms most precisely.      This in fact is an exact method of ob
 taining the definite sulphate of water with saline water; which
 may be kept at 380° or 390°, without sustaining any further
 loss. I have observed a close approximation to the same pro
 portion of water, even in the case of a dilute acid concentrated
 at a temperature not exceeding 300°.           But at 400° or 410°,
 this hydrate begins to be decomposed, and a portion of it is
 apt to distill over with the water expelled.       When, however,
 this hydrate is distilled in vacuo, at the last-mentioned tempe
 rature, it loses nothing but water for some time.
    In one experiment, a small quantity of dilute sulphuric acid
 was found to concentrate down to three atoms of water, at a
temperature not exceeding 212°, at which it was sustained in
vacuo for not less than forty hours. . It consisted of 100 parts
dry acid united with 68-07 water, while three atomic propor
tions of water are 67-32 parts.
    The concentrated acid of commerce, which is a definite sul
phate of water, without the saline atom, does not freeze at a
temperature so low as –36°, according to Dr. Thomson.               To
sulphuric acid of sp. gr. 1:78, I added water in the proportion
of two, four, and six atoms; but                                all

single atomic proportion, when the salt is dried in vacuo over
sulphuric acid, at a temperature not exceeding 78° Fahren

effect of neutralizing the acid reaction of sulphate of zinc, ac

in the same proportion to the quantity of metal dissolved from
any one zinc plate, as was given in the experiment with a
single pair (864. &c.). It was therefore certain, that, just as
much electricity and no more had passed through the series
of ten pair of plates as had passed through, or would have
been put into motion by, any single pair, notwithstanding
that ten times the quantity of zinc had been consumed.
    992. This truth has been proved also long ago in another
way, by the action of the evolved current on a magnetic
needle; the deflecting power of one pair of plates in a battery
being equal to the deflecting power of the whole, provided the
wires used be sufficiently large to carry the current of the
single pair freely; but the cause of this equality of action
could not be understood whilst the definite action and evolu
tion of electricity (783. 869.) remained unknown.
    993. The superior decomposing power of a battery over a
single pair of plates is rendered evident in two ways.      Elec
 trolytes held together by an affinity so strong as to resist the
 action of the current from a single pair, yield up their ele
 ments to the current excited by many pairs; and that body
 which is decomposed by the action of one or of few pairs of
 metals, &c., is resolved into              its
                                    ions the more readily                                  as    it    is

amalgam of zinc in the manner recommended by Mr. Kemp",
or the use of the amalgamated zinc plates of Mr. Sturgeon
(863.), who has himself suggested and objected to their appli
cation in galvanic batteries; for he says, “Were it not on ac
count of the brittleness and other inconveniences occasioned
by the incorporation of the mercury with the zinc, amalgama
tion of the zinc surfaces in galvanic batteries would become
an important improvement; for the metal would last much
longer, and remain bright for a considerable time, even for
several successive hours; essential considerations in the em

sensibly decompose the water of dilute sulphuric acid, but
still has such affinity for the oxygen, that the moment a metal
which, like copper or platina, has little or no affinity, touches
it in the acid, action ensues, and a powerful and abundant
electric current is produced.         It is probable that the mercury
acts by bringing the surface, in consequence of                fluidity, into

dilute sulphuric acid, is active only whilst the electrodes are
connected, and ceases to act or be acted upon by the acid the
instant the communication is broken.
    1001. I have had a small battery of ten pairs of plates thus
constructed, and am convinced that arrangements of this kind
will be very important, especially in the development and                              il
lustration of the philosophical principles of the instrument.
The metals I have used are amalgamated zinc and platina,
connected together by being soldered to platina wires, the
whole apparatus having the form of the couronne des tasses.
The liquid used was dilute sulphuric acid of sp. gr. 1:25. No
action took place upon the metals except when the electrodes
were in communication, and then the action upon the zinc was
only in proportion to the decomposition in the experimental
cell; for when the current was retarded there, it was retarded
also in the battery, and no waste of the powers of the metal
was incurred.
    1002. In consequence of this circumstance, the acid in the
cells remained active for a very much longer time than usual.
In fact, time did not tend to lower it in any sensible degree;
for whilst the metal was preserved to be acted upon at the
proper moment, the acid also was preserved almost at                   first    its

described, fig. 18, are connected metallically through the
galvanometerg, then the whole represents a battery consisting
of two pairs of zinc and platina plates urging a current for
ward, which has, however, to decompose water unassisted by
any direct chemical affinity before it can be transmitted across
the cell iii, and therefore before it can circulate.        This de
composition of water, which is opposed to the passage of the
current, may as a matter of convenience be considered as
taking place either against the surfaces of the two platina
plates which constitute the electrodes in the cell iii, or against
the two surfaces of that platina plate which separates the cells
ii and iii, fig. 19, from each other. It is evident that if that
plate were away, the battery would consist of two pairs of
plates and two cells, arranged in the most favourable position
for the production of a current.        The platina plate therefore,
which being introduced as at a, has oxygen evolved at one
surface and hydrogen at the other (that            the decomposing     is,

meter.          This current       I believe
                                 to be due to electricity reduced
in intensity below the point requisite for the decomposition of
water (970. 984.); for water can conduct electricity of such
low intensity by the same kind of power which it possesses in
common with metals and charcoal, though it cannot conduct
electricity of higher intensity without suffering decomposition,
and then opposing a new force consequent thereon. With
an electric current under this intensity, it is probable that in
creasing the number of interposed platina plates would not
involve an increased difficulty of conduction.
    1018. In order to obtain an idea of the additional interfer
ing power of each added platina plate, six voltaic pairs and
four intervening platinas were arranged as in fig. 27; a very
feeble current then passed (985. 1017.).       When one of the
platinas was removed so that three intervened, a current
somewhat stronger passed. . With two intervening platinas a
still stronger current passed: and with only one intervening
platina a very fair current was obtained. But the effect of
the successive plates, taken in the order of their interposition,
was very different, as might be expected; for the first re
tarded the current more powerfully than the second, and the
second more than the third.
    1019. In these experiments both amalgamated          and un
amalgamated zinc were used, but the results generally were
                      -
the same.
    1020. The effects of retardation just described were altered
altogether when changes were made in the nature of the liquid
used between the plates, either in what may be called the ex
citing or the retarding cells. Thus, retaining the exciting
                                                                                        in for
force the same, by still using pure dilute sulphuric acid
that purpose,        iflittle nitric acid were added

                                                       the current was
very much facilitated.         For instance,     the experiment with
                                                          in

               Retardation produced by interposed Plates.                                           347
few minutes the current almost entirely ceased.                                        This       effect
  appears due to the surfaces taking up that peculiar condition
  (1040.) by which they tend to produce a reverse current; for
  when one or more of the plates were turned round, which
  could easily be effected with the couronne des tasses form of
 experiment, fig. 18, then the current was powerfully renewed
 for a few moments, and then again ceased.            Plates of platina
 and copper, arranged as a voltaic pile with dilute sulphuric
 acid, could not form a voltaic trough competent to act for
 more than a few minutes, because of this peculiar counteract
 ing effect.
     1031. All these effects of retardation, exhibited by decom
 position against surfaces for which the evolved elements have
 more or less affinity, or are altogether deficient in attraction,
 show generally, though beautifully, the chemical relations and
 source of the current, and also the balanced state of the affi
 nities at the places of excitation and decomposition.          In this
 way they add to the mass of evidence in favour of the identity
of the two; for they demonstrate, as it were, the antagonism
of the chemical powers at the electromotive part with the che
mical powers at the interposed parts; they show that the first
are producing electric effects, and the second opposing them;
they bring the two into direct relation; they prove that either
can determine the other, thus making what appears to be
cause and effect convertible, and thereby demonstrating that
both chemical and electrical action are merely two exhibitions
of one single agent or power (916. &c.).
    1032. It is quite evident that as water and other electro
lytes can conduct electricity without suffering decomposition
(986.), when the electricity is of sufficiently low intensity, it
may not be asserted as absolutely true in           cases, that whenall
ever electricity passes through           electrolyte, an  produces           it                     a

    In theseries above marked (B.) it is plain that if we stop
at the term involving A", we shall obtain an inferior limit to
the sum S, and if we take in the term immediately following
we shall get a superior limit.
   Now, to narrow these limits, we must observe, that since

a superior  limit will be obtained by adding to the inferior
limit the quantity

half the last number 284 to the preceding, half the sum to

ignited and cooled under mercury, and pounded glass washed
in hot alkali and acid and then repeatedly in distilled water,
when introduced into curved tubes containing oxygen and
hydrogen in the proportions constituting water, did not induce
the silent union of the gases, until the tubes were heated to
near the boiling-point of mercury. All these substances acted
nearly at the same temperature.
                                      § I. Copper.
  1. Oxide of copper, obtained by calcination of the nitrate,
was exposed in a green glass tube to a current of hydrogen,
issuing from dilute sulphuric acid and zinc. The temperature
was gradually raised by a spirit-lamp to a low red heat, when
the process of reduction commenced, and the bright incan
descence, described by Berzelius, was observed to spread
along the powder, in the line of reduction, even after the lamp
had been withdrawn.          The metallic copper thus obtained
was light and spongy, and underwent no change in the atmo
sphere at ordinary temperatures.
   2. A portion of this copper, exposed to the air in an open
capsule, was heated on a sand-bath to upwards of 500°
 Fahrenheit, and a stream of hydrogen made to flow constantly
over       its
          surface. The gas was not inflamed, but the metal
itself became rapidly tarnished, and was finally reconverted
into black oxide.     Precisely the same change was effected                           by
simply heating the metal without the presence           hydrogen.            of

358       Dr. C. Henry's Experiments on the Action of Metals
ness, the powder became incandescent and was converted into
an oxide. A stream of hydrogen directed upon it in this state
supported the incandescence for an unlimited period, without
the aid of external heat.
   2. Protoxide of cobalt was reduced in a tube by hydrogen
at a low red heat, without exhibiting incandescence.         During
reduction the colour of the powder changed from black to
ash-grey.    Small portions of the reduced metal, when scat
tered on   paper,   ignited spontaneously, as in the experiment
of Magnus, and inflamed the paper. The rest of the powder
was quickly transferred from the reducing tube to a platina
dish, upon which a current of hydrogen had been previously
directed. The metal instantly became incandescent, and con
tinued to glow as long as hydrogen gas issued in sufficient
abundance.     No external heat was employed. The substance
left at the conclusion of the experiment was in             respects                    all
analogous     the  original

incandescent   considerably  below visible    redness,  and con
tinued so as long as hydrogen was supplied.
   The action of nickel differs, then, in no respect from that of
cobalt, but consists in a similar succession of oxidations and
reductions. It is therefore entirely distinct from that of pla
tina and       its
             congenera"; yet nickel has been placed         Döbe                                 by

the force      of cohesion restrains                  the affinity
                                                   of the metal for
oxygen, and thus enables the hydrogen to exert, at a tempe
rature of about 650° Fahrenheit, that stronger attraction for
oxygen which, when directed upon a finely divided metal or
oxide, it does not manifest below an incipient red heat.
   Finally, it appears probable that the particles of oxygen
and hydrogen are brought within their combining distances
on the surface of iron or copper as well as on that of platina,
but that on the oxidizable metals their combination is pre
vented by the stronger affinity of the contiguous atoms of
metal for oxygen.
   Another argument, in favour of the view which has been
taken, is the inactivity of platina itself, noticed by Dr. Faraday,
when introduced into mixtures of hydrogen and chlorine,
gases which are so much more readily combinable by other
means than hydrogen and oxygen. This inactivity is most
probably due to an interfering affinity of platina for chlorine,
—an electro-negative which manifests far more energetic affi
nities for the metals than oxygen exerts, and is indeed, the
only solvent of gold and platina, when presented to them, in
 itsnascent state,     aqua regia.

 affinities of carbonic oxide and hydrogen for oxygen was ob
 served in their slow combination at atmospheric temperatures,
 “The oxygen which had united with the carbonic oxide was
 to that which had combined with the hydrogen as about 5 to

    From the foregoing facts it may be inferred that when
 either carbonic oxide or hydrogen gas is condensed with oxy
 gen on the surface of platina, it is brought within the range
 of     its
         combining affinity, and unites with oxygen, the latter
rapidly, the former with such extreme slowness                give evi                             as   to

rapid union of sulphuretted hydrogen and oxygen, as identi
cal in character with that of platina on other gaseous mix

platina exerts no appreciable action on pure hydrogen or pure

tion hitherto proposed of this class of actions. As regards
the statical relations subsisting between gases and their bound
ing solids, it is perfectly accordant with the analytical deduc

lids, inducing gaseous condensation on their surface, many
analogous facts assembled by Mitscherlicht may be added to
the numerous illustrations supplied by Dr. Faraday himself.

dicularity of the mica plates employed to polarize, a circum

sum of the two is always = F.                                   -
   69. Now the quantity o              –
                                e may always be known by re
ferring to the retardation, which produces the corresponding
tint in Newton's rings, and which is equal to twice the distance
between the plates in that experiment.       For example, with
the thin mica film mentioned in     (56), which polarized light
circularly, the tint produced (between crossed polarizing and
analysing plates) corresponded (by Newton's table) to an                                 in
terval of about five millionths of an inch between the surfaces
of glass, or to a retardation, (0–e), of .00001 inch. The
film, marked No. 2, which gave plum-red of the first order (65),
gives a retardation of .00002. The film No. 1 (65), gives
-00004 inch.     From these data, then, having the value of E”
(68), it is clear that we may calculate the value of A, or the
length of an undulation of heat”.

But in an experiment we must not use the direct indication of
the multiplier, when the polarizing and analysing planes are
parallel, for the total quantity or Fº; for a large proportion of
the heat is not completely polarized, and in order to compare
the values of E° and F*, we must determine the value of each

   73. Similar effects might be expected to occur in the case
of heat. But we must recollect that it is even more difficult
to obtain homogeneous heat, than homogeneous light, and that
we shall have portions of heat differently depolarized by the
same plate, (in consequence of the different character of re
frangibility, indicating a different length of undulation,) exactly
as when we operate upon white light.             We know that heat of
various   degrees  of refrangibility   constitutes the solar heat, and
probably          all

firming the general fact, that obscure heat has longer undu

   1. Heat, whether luminous or obscure, is capable of polari
zation by tourmaline.
  2. It may be polarized by refraction.
  3. It may be polarized by reflection.
  4. It may be depolarized by doubly refracting crystals.
Hence,
  5. It is capable of double refraction, and the two rays are
polarized. When suitably modified, these rays are capable
of interfering like      of light.
                              those
   6. The characteristic law of depolarization in the case of
light holds in that of heat, viz. that the intensities in rectan
gular positions of the analysing plate, are complementary to
one another.
   7. As a necessary consequence of the above, confirmed by
experiment, heat is susceptible of circular                          and elliptic     polari
Zation.
   8. The undulations of obscure heat are probably longer than
those of light. A method is pointed out for deducing their
length numerically.
   78. Of the evidence for these conclusions I have enabled
the reader to judge, by specifying numerical results. But I
must further add, that         the principal conclusions were ar

   Feb. 4.—A paper was read, “On certain Coal Tracts in Salop,
 Worcestershire and North Gloucestershire,” by Roderick Impey
 Murchison, Esq. V.P.G.S.
   Pursuing the inquiry in descending order, commenced at the last
Meeting, the author calls attention to certain undescribed carboni
ferous districts, the outlines of which he has laid down upon the
Ordnance Maps.
I. “Shrewsbury or upper Coal-measures with freshwater Limestone.”
   The author takes this opportunity of showing, that the coal
measures near Shrewsbury, which he formerly described” as con
taining a subordinate band of lacustrine limestone, pass up con
formably into the lower member of new red sandstone, and are thus
proved to constitute the uppermost portion of the carboniferous
series. He has this year discovered this freshwater limestone (with
the same minute Planorbis, &c.,) in a thin zone of coal-measures
extending from Tasley near Bridgnorth to Coughley near Broseley,
where the strata, like those near Shrewsbury, also dip conformably
beneath the lower new red sandstone. Mr. Prestwich has ascertained
that some of the great beds of coal of the Broseley and Colebrook
dale field are worked beneath this limestone.
                     II.  Western Coal-field of Salop.
   The   Oswestry   coal-field, lying on the western borders of Shrop
shire, is completely separated from that of Shrewsbury, and is the
southern termination of the carboniferous zone, which extends from
Flintshire by Ruabon and Chirk. It is of small extent, and little
productive, containing only one bed of good coal.         The millstone
grit, which rises from beneath it on three sides, is remarkable for
containing beds of cherty breccia, courses of sandy, encrinital lime
stone, and in the lower portion strata of thick-bedded, red sandstone,
in parts undistinguishable from the new red sandstone. The carbo
niferous limestone beneath this red sandstone, is exhibited on a very
large scale in the fine escarpments of Llanymynech, Porth-y-wain
and Treflach. The upper part is somewhat magnesian, and con
tains few fossils, with thin veins of copper ore; the lower is a fine
subcrystalline limestone, in which are found Producta hemisphaerica,
the large basaltiform Coral, and many other fossils characteristic of
the formation.     Faults are numerous, and in the principal one run
ning from north by east to south by west, the coal is upcast 180
yards.    These dislocations increase as they rise upon the hill sides,
and decrease as they range towards the plains of Shropshire.
           III. “Central and Southern Coal-fields of Salop.”
   The author mentions that he has accumulated many new facts
respecting the coal-fields of the Clee Hills, since his communications
in 1832, the principal of which are, That at the Titterstone Clee, the
new works established by Mr. Lewis, have proved the existence of
productive coal seams under the Hoar Edge, on the western side of

the great basaltic dyke. He corrects the observation formerly made
that some of the faults which affect the elevated tract of the Brown
Clee Hills are the fissures of eruption of the basalt which crowns
their summit. These faults, running from north to south and tra
versed by others trending from east to west, are           upcasts, and                               all

coal-field cannot be detected. The great fault at Stanley, near
Higley on the Severn, has been caused by an upcast of the old red
sandstone, which there occupies both banks of the river, abruptly
cutting off the coal-measures.    Allusion is then made to a short no
tice” of this tract, in which concretionary calcareous rocks are de
scribed as being subordinate to these coal-measures, but Mr. Mur
chison shows that these rocks are nothing more than protruding
masses of cornstone of the inferior old red sandstone.        He further
describes, in detail, a section extending from one of these masses of
concretionary limestone near Kinlet to Prescot Bridge.        In this sec
tion there is a full development of the superior group of the old red
sandstone, which although incoherent and of a yellow colour, and
therefore unlike the prevailing rocks of that formation, is seen to
pass upwards into a conglomerate, and dip under the true carbo
niferous limestone of Orelton.     It is this tract of old red sandstone
which separates the stinking-coal-fields of Bewdley Forest from the
productive coal-fields of the Clee Hills.
          W. “Coal-field of Newent, North Gloucestershire.”
   The carboniferous strata are here so little developed as scarcely
to entitle them to the name of a coal-field, being composed of merely
a few carbonaceous beds, interposed between the new and old red
sandstones.   In the vicinity of the town of Newent, where the
formation is most expanded, four thin seams of coal were formerly
worked, which were separated from each other by only a few yards
of shale. In some cases the coal was extracted from beneath the
new red sandstone. The extension of these carbonaceous strata is
cut off in the south and south-west by the transition rocks of May
Hill; while to the north they gradually taper away, and are abso
lutely seen to thin out between the escarpment of new red sand
stone and the argillaceous marls of the old red; hence the author
concludes that the Newent coal strata were originally deposited upon
old red sandstone, in a similar manner to those of the Brown Clee
Hills, the Forest of Wyre, &c. &c.
   In concluding his reports upon these detached coal-fields, the
author gives the following as the positions which he has attempted
to establish:
   1st, The existence of a younger zone of coal, which contains a
peculiar freshwater limestone, and passes upwards into the oldest
strata of the new red sandstone, (Shrewsbury coal-field.); and down
wards into the inferior coal strata of Coalbrook Dale.
   2ndly, That the inferior coal strata were deposited in some parts
upon mountain limestone and in others upon the old red sandstone
and transition rocks.
   3rdly, That the Clee Hill fields exhibit only the lower system,
graduating down in two situations to mountain limestone, and in
others resting upon old red sandstone.
   4thly, That in the Brown Clee Hills, the Forest of Wyre, and at
Newent, the carbonaceous matter was originally deposited upon the
old red sandstone.

   5thly, That in some of the poor and ill-consolidated coals, particu
larly in the upper zone, the traces of vegetable organization are so
distinct, that even the generic and specific characters of the plants
can be recognised in the coal itself.
   Lastly, That wherever the mountain limestone has been inter
polated between the bottom coal grits and the old red sandstone, it
can invariably be traced to thin out and disappear within a very
small area; and hence it is inferred, that as calcareous matter ap
pears never to have been elaborated in these regions, except at wide
intervals and in minute quantities, mighty convulsions are not me
cessary to account for the absence of the mountain limestone through
such large carboniferous tracts.
   The coal-field of Oswestry is not included in the application of
these inferences; for, like the great coal basin of South Wales, it
has been deposited upon a thick girdle of carboniferous limestone.

to the Society.   These birds were brought under the notice of the
Meeting by Mr. Gould, who, at the request of the Chairman, pointed
out the most interesting among them, both as regarded the Society's
collection, and with reference to their novelty or the peculiarities of
their form. As, however, Mr. Hodgson himself purposes to describe
at length the characters and habits of the several species in his pro
posed ‘Zoology of Nepal,” Mr. Gould abstained from entering more
particularly into those topics.                 -
   A paper was read “On Clavagella, by W. Broderip, Esq.” It J.
was accompanied by drawings illustrative of the new species de
scribed in it.
   The author commences by a history of the genus from the time
when Lamarck established it for the reception of four fossil species,
two of which he had previously referred to his genus Fistulana. A
recent species was subsequently described and figured by Mr. G. B.
Sowerby, in his ‘Genera of Recent and Fossil Shells,” under thename
of Clav. aperta; and a second recent species, Clav. Australis, has
since been described and figured by the same conchologist; M. Au
douin has noticed another recent Shell which he refers to this ge
nus; and    some details have been published by M. Rang of an ad
ditional recent species, his Clav. Rapa. The collection of Mr. Cum
ing furnishes another recent species, the anatomy of which formed
the subject of a paper read by Mr. Owen at the last Meeting of the
Society; there exists yet another in that of Mr. Isaac Lyon Gold
smid; and another in those of Mr. Cuming and Mr. Miller.
   A close examination of the recent species which he has observed
has convinced Mr. Broderip that although one valve of the shell is
always fixed or imbedded in the chamber formed in the hard sur
rounding substance, the tube is not necessarily continued into a com
plete testaceous clavate shape, and that consequently the character
assigned by Lamarck to the genus requires emendation. The fixed
valve is in all these species continued on to the tube.              In Mr.
Cuming's the perforated shelly plates are situated not far from
the throat of the tube, one on either side; while in Mr. Gold
smid's the perforated plate is single, and seated at the anterior or
greater end of the ovate chamber, being in the smaller individual
joined laterally to the anterior ventral edge of the fixed valve, and
in the larger one wholly isolated from                it.   In
                                                      all the specimens the
anterior edge    of the fixed valve      surrounded by the naked wall
                                            is                                            of

                                       of
 Broderip proceeds      suggest the following distinguishing characters.

                                                                        as
 distinct species:
   CLAvAGELLA ELoNGATA.              Clav. camerd elongato-ovatá            ;    valvá liberd

      intiis nitente ; umbone acuto.
   Hab. in Oceano Pacifico º
   Mus. Goldsmid.
   The wall of the coral chamber against which the free valve rested
gives as exact an impression of the external rugosities of that valve
as if the valve had been applied to a surface of wax.
  CLAvAGELLA LATA.       Clav. camera rotundato-ovatá ; valvá liberd
    latiusculd, subtrigond, subconverd, externe concentrice rugosd,
    intils nitente ; umbone subrotundato.
  Hab. in Oceano Pacifico.
  Mus. Cuming.
   Both valves are nacreous internally; and the muscular impres
sions, especially in the fixed valve, are very strong.
   CLAvAGELLA MELITENSIs.        Clav. testá subrotundatá, rugosd, intiis
      subnitente; tubo longitudinaliter corrugato.
   Hab. ad Melitam.
   Muss. Cuming, Miller.
   It is not impossible, from its locality, that this may turn out to
be M. Audouin's species, if that should prove to be a true Clavagella.
M. Sander Rang's remarks, however, go far to show that a Sicilian
Shell referred to this genus, has been incorrectly so referred, in as
much as it has no fixed valve. The one described above has the
fixed valve continued on to the shelly tube as in the other recent
species of the genus Clavagella.
   Mr. Broderip conjectures that Clavagella may be in its very young
state a free Bivalve, floating at large until it arrives at some vacant
hole that suits     it,
                    when     attaches one valve

  All the specimens examined having these external depressions proved
 to be males, with the testes in the abdomen very obvious: those
  without external depressions proved to be all females, internally
 provided with two lobes of enlarged ova. The males of this species,
  when taken by Mr. Yarrell from the sea, had one ovum of the size
  and colour of a mustard-seed fixed in each cup-shaped depression,
 but time and the effects of a long journey had removed them. Dr.
  Fleming in his ‘History of British Animals,” page 176, states the
 length of Syngn. Ophidion at about 5 inches: some of Mr. Yarrell's
  specimens   measured  9 inches.
    Mr. Yarrell further stated that the     males of Syngn. Acus carry
  their living young in the anal pouch, even after they have been
 hatched there.     He had been frequently told by fishermen that on
 opening them they had found the living young within the pouch,
 which they called the belly; and that if these young were shaken out
 into the water over the side of the boat, they did not swim away, but
 when the parent fish was held in the water in a favourable position,
the young would again enter the pouch.
    It was observed by M. Agassiz, that the fact of the males of cer
 tain species of the genus Syngnathus carrying the ova in a peculiar
 abdominal pouch, after their exclusion by the female, had been no
 ticed on the Continent by Eckström, Retzius, and Marcklin; and
 that he had himself made the same observation.
    M. Agassiz exhibited drawings of several species of Lepisosteus,
 together with some of the details of their internal organization; and,
 at the request of the Chairman, explained his views with regard to
 their systematic arrangement and structure, as well as to their rela
 tions with various genera of fossil fishes, and the coincidence of some
 parts of their internal anatomy with that of Reptiles. He described
 two new species observed by him in the British Museum, taking his
 characters principally from the form and sculpture of the scales, the
 presence or absence of the short rays at the base of the caudal and
 other fins, and the variations in the form and disposition of the teeth.
 In reference to their internal structure, he particularly called the at
tention of the Meeting to the large and regular slit by which the
 swimming-bladder communicates with the pharyna ; which he re
garded as bearing even a closer resemblance to the entrance of the
trachea of the pulmoniferous Vertebrata in general, than the aperture
by means of which the lungs communicate with the pharyna in the
Perennibranchiate Amphibia. He conceived, therefore, that the ana
tomy of these fishes offers a conclusive argument in favour of the
theory, long since proposed, that the swimming-bladder of Fishes is
analogous to the lungs of the other Vertebrata. He spoke of the num
ber of the caecal appendages as greater in Lepisosteus than in any
other fish which he had dissected; and referring to certain fossil bo
dies by which geologists have long been puzzled, and which have
been regarded as fossil worms, he stated his opinion, from the close
resemblance between the two, that they are in reality the caecal ap
pendages of the fossil fishes, in whose company they are generally
               -
found.

    Mr. Gray exhibited young shells of Argonauta Argo and Arg. hi
 ans, with the view of calling the attention of the Society to a new
 argument in favour of the opinion that the animal (Ocythoë) found
 in the shells of this genus is parasitic. This argument is founded on
 the size of what Mr. Gray has termed the nucleus of the shell, viz.
 that original portion of it which covered the animal within the
 egg, and which is usually found to differ in surface and appearance
from the remainder of the shell formed after its exclusion from the
egg. In the specimens exhibited Mr. Gray described the nucleus as
blunt, rounded, thin, slightly and irregularly concentrically wrinkled,
and destitute of the radiating waves which are common to the adult
shells of       all
                  the species        this genus. These waves

of        shell,  and covered the embryo                    of     the period
                                                                                                                 of of

sionally seen; from which                         it may         be inferred that each species breeds
in distinct haunts. Occasionally two or three varieties of the Diom.
erulans, Linn., the large wandering Albatross, attended the ship, but
 they rarely remained beyond the day.                Diom. erulans varies very
 much in plumage; generally, however, the head, neck, back, and
 wings are more or less mottled grey, and the breast, abdomen, vent,
 and uropygium snowy white; the bill is horn-coloured and the feet
yellow.—We saw a bird that might be referred to M. Lesson's Diom.
 epomophora, if that is really a distinct species.—Another of very large
 size was near us for two days, which, with the exception of the back
 of the wings and tips of the under side of the pen feathers and ex
 tremity of the tail being black, was of a snowy white colour.”
    Capt. P. P. King transmitted with his Letter characters and de
 scriptions of three of the species of Albatross observed by him,                                                    in
cluding those which he regarded as the Dionm. spadicea and chlo
rorhynchos; together with drawings of these two species.                  The de
 scriptions were read, and the drawings exhibited. The former agree
 essentially with the descriptions from the same specimens, recently
published in his “Wanderings in New South Wales,’ &c., by Mr.
 George Bennett, who was a fellow voyager with Capt. King. The

    November 25.—A Letter was read, addressed to the Secretary by
 Keith E. Abbott, Esq., and dated Trebizond, June 20, 1834. It re
ferred to a collection of skins of Birds made by the writer in his
immediate neighbourhood, and presented by him to the Society.
The number of species contained in the collection is twenty, one
only of which was comprised among those previously transmitted by
Mr. Keith Abbott, and exhibited to the Society at           Meeting            its                on
June 24, 1834. Mr. Abbott states that         proposes

    Mr. Gray also exhibited a specimen of the New Holland Ibis of
 Dr. Latham, for the purpose of directing the attention of the Meet
 ing to the spatulate form of the feathers of its neck; a form of
 feather which he believes not to have been previously recorded as oc
 curring in any Grallatorial Bird. In this instance they are elon
 gated, lanceolate, and bear some resemblance to straws. The spe
 cimen was obtained from the neighbourhood of Macquarrie River.
    Mr. Gray subsequently exhibited adult specimens of the Geoemyda
 spinosa and Emys platynota, two species of fresh-water Tortoise re
 cently described by him from young individuals at the Meetings of
 the Society on June 24 and August 26 (present vol. p. 152).           He
 pointed out in detail the peculiarities of the adult animals and shells,
 which he is about to describe in his ‘Synopsis of Indian Animals’;
 and demonstrated on the specimen of the former the existence of those
 characters on which he had founded the genus Geoemyda, and which
 he had previously had occasion to observe in Ge. Spengleri alone,
 —his knowledge of the animal of Ge. spinosa having at the time of
his proposing the genus been limited to the figure published by Mr.
 Bell.
    In the adult individual exhibited the sternum was concave; and
 Mr. Gray, in calling particular attention to this point, took occasion
 to remark on it as evidencing, in an additional character to those
 already adverted to by him, the affinity of Geoemyda to the Land
 Tortoises, that genus and the genus Cistuda, Say, being the only ge
nera among the Emydida that possess the concavity of sternum which
is common to most of the species of Testudinidae.
    A Paper was read “On Nycteribia, a genus of wingless Insects, by
 J. O. Westwood, Esq., F.L.S., &c.”
    The author commences by remarking on the existence of certain
 groups of animals, generally limited in extent, which exhibit in their
 organization, with reference to the groups to which they naturally
belong, such anomalies as have constantly proved a source of per
plexity to the systematists who have endeavoured to assign to them
their real place in the system of nature. In many instances the ano
maly involves the transition from the structure of one group to that
of the adjoining ones; such instances constituting the osculant groups
of Mr. W. S. MacLeay in his “Horae Entomologicae". Of these os
culant groups some exist between the great divisions of the animal
kingdom; others among the classes of which each of these great
divisions is composed; others again between the orders, the fami
lies, and the minor subdivisions.        The genus Nycteribia is thus os
culant not between the families or even the orders of a class, but
between two of the classes themselves of the Annulose Sub-kingdom
—the Arachnida and the Haustellata. It is remarkable, moreover, for

         Mr. Westwood                         on the osculant genus Nycteribia.                                     393
being exclusively confined to a parasitic existence on that equally
anomalous group, the Chiroptera among the Mammalia.
   Notwithstanding the comparatively unattractive appearance of the
insects of this genus, the singular peculiarities of their structure have
drawn upon them the attention of Latreille, Hermann, Dr. Leach,
M. Léon Dufour, and Mr. Curtis, who have severally contributed
much to the general stock of information respecting them. But the
minuteness of the objects themselves, their unfitness for accurate ex
amination when dried and shrivelled as specimens usually are in cabi
mets, their comparative rarity, and other causes, have rendered the
 descriptions of those distinguished entomologists in some instances
unsatisfactory; and it is with the view of fully elucidating the or
 ganization of the genus and of adding to            history such factsits                                          as   he

   A meeting of the Philosophical Society of Cambridge was held on
Monday evening, March 2, Professor Airy,Vice-President, in the Chair.
Various presents of books and other objects werelaid before the Society.
A Memoir, by the Rev. R. Murphy, of Caius College, was read, con
taining the conclusion of his Researches on the Inverse Calculus of
Definite Integrals; also a Memoir by R. Stevenson, Esq., of Trinity
College, on the solution of some problems connected with the theory
of straight lines and planes, by a new and symmetrical method of
coordination.    A communication was likewise made by W. Hopkins,
Esq., on Physical Geology, in which he showed, on mechanical prin
ciples, that forces of elevation, acting on extended masses of nearly
horizontal strata, would necessarily produce a double system of
fissures, one in the direction of the beds, the other at right angles to
that direction.   In a discussion which took place afterwards, Prof.
Sedgwick pointed out several districts which illustrated the truth of
Mr. Hopkins's theory, viz. Flintshire, Derbyshire, the mining districts
of Cumberland, &c.
   March 16.-The Rev. Prof. Clark, V.P. in the Chair. A paper was
read by Mr. W. W. Fisher, of Downing College, (illustrated by co
loured drawings,) on the nature, structure, and changes of Tubercles.
The conclusion at which the author arrived was, that tubercles are
organized or organizable products, that they consist, in general, in an
alteration of the structure of the organ in which they occur; and that
the changes which they undergo are essentially due to inherent vital
action, the process of softening being frequently marked by the de
velopment of a new order of vessels in the diseased structure.
   Afterwards Mr. Willis gave an account of his views respecting the
progress of Gothic architecture, especially with reference to the for
mation of tracery. He noticed that Romanesque architecture differed
from classical in the employment of compound arches, (instead of ar
chitraves,) several arches being placed under each other so as to form
successive orders of openings. As a next step, the sides of these
arches are decorated with shafts; but these are different in the North
and South of Europe. In the former (as in Norman architecture) the
shafts replace the edges of the openings, and are called edge shafts;
in Italian Romanesque the shafts are placed in the square recesses of
the sides of the openings, and are nook shafts. When the successive
orders of openings become of different forms,(as two arches under one,
or trefoils under simple arches,) there is an approximation to tracery;
 and when the mouldings which bound the openings form bars, we have
 actual tracery. Hence the mullions and bars have mouldings which
 follow a series of subordination

ings, and this subordination is clearly exhibited to the very latest
period of good Gothic architecture.
   March 30.—The President (the President of Queen's) in the Chair.
A paper by Augustus de Morgan, Esq. of Trinity College, was read,
containing remarks on the memoir of M. Abel relative to the alge
braical expression of the roots of equations which are connected by
the law of periodic functions.—Afterwards     Mr. Whewell exhibited
and explained a new Anemometer, the object of which is to measure
the whole amount of the wind which blows in each direction in a given
time; and thus to make measures of the wind in different times and
places comparable with each other. He pointed out also how such
measures might be employed so as to compose a type of the annual
course of the winds at each place, and thus to solve several important
problems in meteorology.

I FEEL       confident that the cause of Science might be promoted if
       those who are interested in the various departments of Geology,
Natural History, &c., were acquainted with the different local Socie
ties in the different counties of England. Should this, therefore,
meet the eye of any of the secretaries or others superintending esta
blishments of this description, they would perhaps have the goodness
to send to you, free of postage or other expense, a brief outline of
the objects pursued, notices of their museums, or any other details
they may think requisite, with an address by which a correspondence
could be carried on, on points equally interesting, and in many cases,
I should anticipate, equally beneficial to parties. all

such fractions.    It is only when we take into account the great vo

power of time, that we are able to discover the magnitude of the ope
rations of this silent but unceasing agency. In the absence of more
accurate data for my calculations, for the sake of showing how large

 FALL OF A METEORITE IN INDIA, ON THE 8TH of JUNE 1834.
    We extract the following from the Proceedings of the Asiatic So
 ciety of Bengal, as given in the Journal of that Society, No. 32, for
August 1834:—
    “Read the following extracts of a letter from the Reverend R.
Everest regarding the fall of an aérolite at Hissar.
    “‘Having seen in the possession of Mrs. Metcalfe of Delhi a frag
ment of meteoric stone, which she informed me had lately fallen near
Hissar, I wrote to Capt. Parsons, Supt. H. C. Stud there, for parti
culars, and have now the pleasure of sending his answer to you. The
fragment I have seen bears the usual external characters of meteoric
stone, has the same specific gravity, viz. 3-6, and affects the magnet.
There can therefore be no doubt of the fact.         Rob. EveREs.T.

    REGRET that from various causes I should have been
    prevented from sooner replying to Mr. Carter's paper con
tained in the number of your Magazine for October last”.
   In consequence of the time which has elapsed since that
paper was written, I think it right thus briefly to refer to the
original subject of discussion between us. In the number of
your Magazine for August 1833+,                      I
                                      suggested that the word
npä (gópher) was probably identical with         (köpher); and   nº
as the meaning       of the latter word is                 “pitch,”     I inferred               that
the   nºlºgy       (hatzégépher) of Gen.                   vi.   14,-in      the transla
tions called Gopher-wood, but literally trees   gopher,<-were         of
“pitch-trees.” Mr. Carter,    your Magazine for March 1834f,
                                     in
admits  it   to“highly probable” that gopher
                  be                                   suggest,        is,   as
                                                                             I
identical with kopher; but     thinkshe very  questionable
                                                         itthat
kopher means “pitch,” and        consequently denies my con
                                          he
clusion that the hatzé-gópher were pitch-trees.

       The question, then, in reality, is not                                 so much between                  Mr.
Carter and myself individually, as between that gentleman
and philologists and biblical critics generally, who (I believe,
with the single exception to which     have formerly alluded”,)    I
be in all
   concur      regarding the meaning
                      in                   kópher,     the passage      of                in
   question,        pitch, whatever differences
                          to   be                     opinion may                        of
   entertained among them          the interpretation
                                                    as    the word

gópher.      seems useless, therefore,
                     It                     prolong      discussion      to                   a
                        attended with any satisfactory result; and
                                                                                              º

I will  consequently    only repeat my original suggestion—in
which,    fact, Mr. Carter himself coincides,
                in                              that       (gopher)
is     identical with           np:       (köpher), whatever the correct transla

404      Mr. Beke         on the    Historical Evidence of the Advance             of
and after an elaborate investigation of the subject he thus                        re
cords his own opinion:                   “I
                               have no hesitation in subscribing
to the stadium of 51 toises assigned to the journal by D'Anville,
whether it be considered as a Greek or Indian standard *; ”
to which he subsequently adds,                       “I
                                          am convinced that no
other stadium known in Greece will apply to the journal of
Nearchus; and if it be not a Greek stadium, I know not what
measure it can be, unless it be derived from India or Arabiaf.”
   Upon the united authority, then, of D'Anville and Vincent,
the stadium of Nearchus is to be taken as one of sixteen to a
mile English; whence it results that the 3300 stadia which
Babylon, in that navigator's time, was distant from the sea,
must be equal to two hundred and six miles and a half.
   Strange to say, however, Dr. Vincent, in a note upon the
passage from Arrian in his Voyage of Nearchus (p. 65), after
remarking that “ 3300 stadia make little more than 200
miles English, [whilst] the real distance by the river is more
than 400,” actually offers the conjecture, in direct opposition
to his own conclusion, “May not Nearchus calculate this di
stance by stadia of eight to a milef ?”    Now, it appears to me
that any  mode of  getting   over the  apparent  difficulty,+even

and comment upon it; upon which the writer of the criticism in the
Quarterly Review remarks (p. 505), “On this doubt of a most erudite geo
grapher, so fatal to his theory, Mr. Beke observes, that “the accuracy of the
mode thus adopted by the learned translator, and by geographers generally,
of reconciling apparent discrepancies in the works of ancient writers, by
       §.
varying the standard of measurement, may legitimately be questioned.’              Is,
then,      Beke prepared        to

by ancient writers?       or   to

perplexed and often baffled the D'Anvilles, the Gosselins, the Rennells, and
the Mannerts    of modern days?” Had the reviewer understood the ground
of my objection      toDr. Vincent’s conjecture,          he
                                                       would have spared himself

one adopted by the learned translator, which has the effect of
altogether invalidating the previous conclusion (so positively
expressed,) of D'Anville and himself. And, in fact, Dr. Vin
cent appears to have entertained a feeling of this kind, when
in another place he says,                      “I
                                      object to all measures of this sta
dium taken where Nearchus himself did not navigate, and he                                                        I
sitate about the measure of 3300 stadia from the mouth of the
Euphrates to Babylon, stated as the assertion of Nearchus *.”
    These objections, although in reality they cannot be main                        let
tained, are in themselves not unreasonable:                 see how they             us

 intervening period of 2160 years; and as the distance in a
 straight line may be taken at about #ths of the measurement
 along the course of the river, the advance of the land, (as de
 termined by this one authority,) may be computed at about
 150 miles.
      We have now                         to consider the passage from                                   Pliny respect
 ing Charax *; which,       upon investigation, will be found to
harmonize entirely with the inference which has thus been
drawn from the statement of Nearchus.          Two different mean
ings may be attributed to this passage.         The first         that                                             is, “

assertion of the facts themselves, may not have committed some
error in the reduction into Roman miles of the actual mea
surements reported to him, similar to that which he is shown
to have fallen into with respect to Nearchus's statement of
the distance from Babylon to the Persian Gulf; in which case,
the difference between the two distances of Charax from the
sea in the times of Alexander and Pliny respectively, would
have to be reduced yet further.            But be this as it may, it is
indisputable that in Pliny’s time so considerable an advance of
the land upon the sea had taken place since the period when
Charax was first built, as to make it a subject of particular
observation, and to call forth from that intelligent and obser
vant investigator of the phaenomena of nature the pointed re
mark, that “in no part of the world had the land gained so
largely or so rapidly upon the sea”.”
     n the whole, then, the fact of a very considerable advance
of the land at the head of the Persian Gulf must be consi
dered as established beyond dispute; and if the distances men
tioned by Nearchus and Pliny be at                          all
                                                  near the truth, and

approximately only, we are still enabled              form      tolerable
                                                                    to        a
idea of how extensive that advance must have been. In the
present state, however,              of
                                  our information upon the subject,
it   isadvisable that no      hasty  conclusion       come        be  the     to   as   to
precise extent       of
                      the advance,       determine which,

doubt,     be  necessary that extensive local investigation should
take   place+.

LXIII.             Remarks on some curious Facts respecting Vision de
     scribed       in the Lond, and Edinb. Phil. Mag. for 1834.    By
     LEwis Ton NA.
                  To   the Editors    of the Philosophical Magazine.
          Gentlemen,
I HAVE       just seen a letter from K. relating to “some cu
    rious facts respecting vision,” which appeared in your
Journal for November 1834. I will not trespass further on
your pages than to state that for the last six years a similar
difference in power of vision has existed in my eyes.     By al
tering the axis of vision of the two eyes, and thus producin
a double image of any object, the image offered by the left
eye is even less than half the size of the one presented by the
right eye.   There is also a slight indistinctness in the image,
independently of the reduction in size. This affection came on
gradually, and was not produced by any disease, either con
stitutional or local, that I am aware       Whether am right     of.
                                                                                           of I

    the left eye, similar                 to
                              that habitual   old age,   know               to                    I

and imperceptible exertion           the brain that the images

        In                               producing      ofcoincidence             a                        of
images            of
            different magnitudes      causes     general indistinctness

sity of the current, the strength of the pile, the time of action,
and especially with accidental discharges of the plates by in
advertent contacts or reversions of the plates during experi
ments, and must be carefully watched in every endeavour to
trace the source, strength and variations of the voltaic current.
Its effect was avoided in the experiments already described
(1036. &c.), by making contact between the plates P' and Pº
before the effect dependent upon the state of the solution in
contact with the zinc plate was observed, and by other pre
cautions.
    1041. When an apparatus like fig. 26. (1017.) with several
platina plates was used, being connected with a battery able
to force a current through them, the power which they ac
quired, of producing a reverse current, was very considerable.
     1042. Weak and exhausted charges should never be used at
the same time with strong and fresh ones in the different cells of
a trough, or the different troughs of a battery: the fluid in                                   all
the cells should            be

be made to pass through the instrument for given portions of
time in succession. The whole of the battery evolved 0-9 of
a cubic inch of oxygen and hydrogen in half a minute; the
 forty plates evolved 4-6 cubic inches in the same time, the
 whole then evolved 1 cubic inch in the half minute; the ten
 weakly charged evolved 0-4 of a cubic inch in the time given:
 and finally the whole evolved 1-15 cubic inch in the standard
 time. The order of the observations was that given: the results
 sufficiently show the extremely injurious effect produced by
the mixture of strong and weak charges in the same battery*.
     1045. In the same manner associations of strong and weak
pairs of plates should be carefully avoided.             A pair of copper
 and   platina   plates   arranged    in accordance with a pair of zinc
 and   platina  plates in dilute    sulphuric   acid, were found to stop
 the action of the latter, or even of two pairs of the latter, as
effectually almost as an interposed plate of platina (1011.), or
as if the copper itself had been platina.
                                                                       It,

rections and extensions of the theory of electro-chemical de
composition, given in the Fifth and Seventh Series of these
 Researches.    The expressions I would now alter are those
which relate to the independence of the evolved elements of
the poles or electrodes, and the reference of their evolution to
powers entirely internal (524. 537. 661.).    The present paper
fully shows my present views; and I would refer to para
graphs 891. 904. 910. 917. 918. 947. 963. 1007. 1031. &c., as
stating what they are.    I hope this note will be considered as
sufficient in the way of correction at present; for I would
rather defer revising the whole theory of electro-chemical de
composition until            f
                      can obtain clearer views of the way in
which the    power  under consideration can appear at one time
as associated with particles giving them their chemical attrac
tion, and at another as free electricity (493. 957.).— M. F.

LXV.        Notice     of some Experiments which         show a repulsive   Ac
   tion    between  heated Surfaces and certain pulverulent Bodies.
   By R.        ADDAMs, Esq., Lecturer on Chemistry and Natural
   Philosophy”.
THAT     caloric possesses a repellent force is assumed from
  the effects it produces upon matter in general: but there
are those who do not allow that we have any unequivocal
evidence of calorific repulsion between independent bodies,
such, for example, as two separate masses of heated iron; in
deed, the question whether caloric does not act repulsively
at sensible distances, has recently been made the subject of
experimental investigation by the Rev. Professor Powellt,
who, in the Philosophical Transactions for the last year,
has given an account of an elegant and refined mode of
testing the repulsion between two heated lenticular masses of
  lass.
    The following description of some experiments which seem
to bear upon the question may not, therefore, be unacceptable
to those who are interested in this branch of inquiry.
    Exp. 1. A small quantity of silica (prepared by precipitation
from      its
          alkaline solution) was heated upon        platinum cap
                                                             a

tion between the metal and silica was so trifling that the latter
would often remain stationary, whilst the former slid beneath
it; and when the capsule was moved, by the hand, circularly
in one direction, the powder would revolve the contrary way.
The effect ceases almost instantly by a removal from the lamp,
and is renewed as often as it is reheated.               Whilst subjected to
the flame of the lamp, if touched with a cold body, as a metallic
wire or glass rod, it would sometimes lose                 peculiar freedom  its
to  glide about, and then rest upon the platinum vessel slug
gish and immoveable otherwise than with the vessel itself.

  The quantities of the powders which I have hitherto em
ployed have been too small, (not exceeding 30 or 40 grains,)
to decide upon their electrical states in a satisfactory manner.
   Before I conclude the present communication, I will ad
vert to a simple experiment, which is familiar to many, I have
no doubt, and which bears upon the subject under considera
tion.
   Thus: take up a small portion of tallow at the end of a
wire; hold the latter inclined to the horizon and with the hand
uppermost; thrust the tallow into the flame of a candle, and it
will be seen to react from the heat and run up the wire, in a
melted state, to the distance of an inch or more.        Professor
Stevelly alluded to this experiment in reference to the repul
sive agency of heat, at the meeting of the British Association
in Edinburgh.

Sulphate   of Copper with Sulphate of Soda : CuSONaS) + H+.
                  Sulphate of Copper and Soda.
   Like the other double salts of sulphate of soda, this salt
cannot be formed directly, being decomposed by water. Even
when it is attempted to form it by double decomposition from
the bisulphate of soda, in general a large quantity of sulphate of
soda and of sulphate of copper are separately deposited before
the double salt appears.       It is then deposited in a crust, con
sisting of small but distinct crystals, which are slightly deli
quescent, and appear to contain two proportions of water.
This salt is easily made anhydrous, and thereafter fuses at an
incipient red heat without loss of acid, and remains of a blue
colour when cool. The fused salt does not split into thin
scales in the progress of cooling, as the corresponding sul
phate of copper and potash does.

   The water in this salt      was found to be reduced from five
atomic proportions to little more than one, by drying the cry
stals in open air at 238°, while one entire atomic proportion
was retained at 410°. Flesh-coloured crystals, dried in vacuo
in warm summer weather, without artificial heat, lost some
what more than three proportions of water.

   A  crystalline crust of sulphate of manganese, deposited from
a warm solution, was found to contain three atoms of water.
It is likewise known to be deposited from a boiling solution
with only one atom of water, namely, the saline atom. We
have, therefore, sulphates of this class with no water of cry
stallization, and with two, four, and six atoms.
   The sulphate of manganese and potash did not crystallize
on mixing   the solutions of    constituents.   its

    In drying gypsum, to make plaster of Paris, a third or a
fourth of the water of the salt is allowed to remain, by which
it sets more strongly.        But the salt may be made quite anhy
drous,    I find, and yet retain the power of recombining with
two atoms of water, if dried at a temperature not exceeding
270° Fahr. ; although the hydrate which results on slaking in
the last case is rather pulverulent.             When gypsum has been
dried at a      higher    temperature,       as at 300° or 400° Fahr.,
it refuses    entirely  to combine with water, and is technically
called burnt stucco. The anhydrous sulphate of lime which
occurs in nature exhibits the same indifference to water.                           In
 anhydrite we have, I believe, the true or absolute sulphate of
 lime in a crystallized state. The body which results from ex
 posing hydrated sulphate of lime to 270°, although composed of
 nothing but sulphuric acid and lime, should be viewed as the
 debris of the hydrated sulphate of lime, and not confounded
 with the absolute sulphate of lime, which last has no disposi
 tion to combine with water. The first, which we may call
 “ anhydrous gypsum,” is an imperfect body. We know sul
 phate of lime in four states, which may be expressed symbo
 lically as follows:
           Gypsum     ..............................         CašH+ H
           Gypsum dried at 212°           ............         CašH
           Anhydrous gypsum (dried at 270°) Caš—
           Anhydrite ..............................           CaS
  Here we distinguish the imperfect body, anhydrous gypsum,
  from anhydrite, by placing the minus sign after the former.

   The view which is given in this paper of the constitution of
the sulphates, must not be hastily generalized and applied to
other classes of salts. From investigations not yet completed,
I am satisfied that each class of salts has       peculiarities,                                 its

Druinbrugh on the 18th of December 1833, the other in the

in this neighbourhood, yet we have some reason to believe
that a few visit the hilly districts in this county almost an
nually, at least more frequently than is generally supposed.

  180.   Long-tailed Duck (Clangula vulgaris).-The only spe
cimen of this species that has been detected in this vicinity, to
the best of our knowledge, was killed about the 1st of Novem
ber.   It was a very young bird, but most fortunately proved
to be a male, so that we had the gratification of examining
the very singular trachea of this species, which Montagu has
figured with great accuracy in the Supplement to the Orni
thological Dictionary.
   204. Razor Bill (Alca Torda).-A specimen of this bird
was killed on the 1st of January, in a rather singular locality,
namely, on the moors in the parish of Bewcastle, at no great
distance from the situation where the Turnstones above al
luded to were seen. This bird was, no doubt, on          passage                  its

Faraday, he kindly suggested the trying the effect of a piece
of wetted paper placed between the forehead and the con

tion additive for the semidiameter of the wire.                    As the arcs are
not fixed exactly parallel to each other, the dot does not make
precisely half a revolution downwards on inverting the tele
scope, and therefore cannot come to the previous perpendi
cular distance from the axis of the cylindrical telescope by a
quantity (too trivial, however, to be regarded,) equal to this
distance multiplied by the versed sine of the deviation of pa
rallelism of the arcs.         It may be remarked also that when the
cross wires are properly adjusted, the perpendicular one, from
a defect in the stop, cannot be set quite parallel to either arc.
This was first noticed on observing the dip of the sea, the
horizontal wire being slightly inclined to the edge of the sea
when either arc was vertical; but the deviation is not of a na
ture to vitiate the measurements.                  The reversing point” of
neither of the       great   levels,  but   particularly       of that marked G,
proved so constant as heretofore; the seasoning which the
levels had gradually acquired from repeated shocks in travel
ling, and by exposure to extremes of temperature, having been
disturbed by dismounting them on commencing the survey
and by frequent alteration of the adjustments, never in the
course of any campaign, but during the intervening winters.
As the fluctuation must have taken place chiefly on trans
porting the sector from one station to another rather than at
the time of observation, the angles cannot have been materially
affected in consequence.            A register of the reversing points
for each level is      subjoined     in a notet. Generally the sector

LXX.    On a Decimal System of Monetary Calculation, founded
  on the present Denominations of Money and Coins in Great
  Britain. By Mr. SAMUEL READ, Member of the School of
  Naval Architecture.
  To     the   Editors of the Philosophical                             Magazine and Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,
W HILST     everybody admits
   spect of a decimal system
                                         the superiority in every re
                                          of calculation in regard to
weights and measures and money, and at the same time can
only regret that the habits we have imbibed prevent the exe
cution of such a desirable measure as the introduction of a
decimal graduation of our monetary scale, I have not seen or
heard of any attempt to develop such a system from the pre
sent money table, which, remarkable as it may appear, con
tains a decimal graduation perfectly available in                  money                          all
calculations, and with          very slight expense might
                                                a                                                       be    in
grafted        on
               our present coinage.
    Assuming the shilling        the unit, and having one copper coin
                                                as
of   a new   value,   the whole        our present coinage may
                                                         of                                                    be
adapted        the decimal scale, which
               to                               shall presently deduce
                                                                 I
from the money table now            use.    We shall not have
                                                        in            for                               to
get any        of
              the present   denominations        money,                 of
                                                                interfere                 or     to
with deeply rooted habits and prejudices,               put the country      or   to
to  any other but       very trivial expense
                                     a             effecting the altera     in
tion.
    Taking, therefore, the shilling          the unit,    conceive as                 I                  it    to
 be  divided into ten   parts,  each                          of
                                          which cannot perhaps have
a  more    significant   name than       “tenth";       “tenth" sup
                                                             a                    a                    I
 pose also          to       be
                      divided into ten parts, each          which, from                of
 being the rºndth            shilling, may very properly
                                      of   a                      called                          be           a
 “cent”; hence the decimal graduation we have just now                                                        in
 dicated only wants       step above the shilling
                                       a                complete      and         to                    it,
 that we most fortunately have ready           our hands      the “halfto                  in
 pound.”      The money table for calculation may therefore                                                    be
 thus  simply   constructed:
                         10 10 10
                    cents equal ......      tenth,               1
                    tenths ............     shilling,              1
                                    shillings .........            1   half-pound:
      From consideration
               a           the above table therefore appears
                                                of of                            it

442                  Mr.      Samuel Read on a Decimal System
penny in excess of two “cents”; the cent being of course an
imaginary denomination, and only necessary for the purpose of
calculating by an uniform scale. In the same way the present
halfpenny would be only rán or 3% of a penny in excess of four
cents; and lastly, the present penny-piece would be ºr of a
penny in excess of eight cents.     We see, therefore, that the
wear of the present copper coinage would soon cause, if it have
not already caused, an equality, or a very near approximation
to equality, between the present penny and 8 cents, between
the present halfpenny and 4 cents, and between the present
farthing and 2 cents. The comparison may, however, be bet
ter exhibited at one view as in the following table:

   In the first instance was inclined to attribute the inde
structibility of the unrefined copper in the acid partly to the
effects of the charcoal in the cementation, seeing that the effect
produced by that operation was much greater upon unrefined
than upon pure copper.        Whatever advantages may belong
to the proper use of charcoal in the reduction and cemen
tation of copper, (and                    I
                            consider them not unimportant,) the
addition of a small   portion  of tin will be sufficient to account
for the superior resistance to waste which this alloy presents in
the muriatic acid, over that of the common refined copper of
this country. This incapacity to rapid oxidation which is
presented by the alloy of tin with copper, suggests many useful
hints to the artist and the manufacturer, of which advantage
has already been taken in forming ship-sheathing and other
articles. .

                  Th;I. Mr.following communications were made:
                                  Sheepshanks exhibited a small clock, on
   Fraunhofer's principle, for giving motion to an equatorial, and ex
   plained the construction and use of a moveable piece to be applied to
   the eye-end of the telescope, for the purpose of micrometrical mea
   surements.
       Mr. Sheepshanks also exhibited a telescope fitted up as an equal
    altitude instrument, similar to that drawn in Plate XIII. of Dr. Pear
   son's “Introduction to Practical Astronomy,” except that it has
    straight radii at the base instead of a claw stand. The purport of his
    remarks was to point out the various objects to which such an instru
    ment might be applied in the hands of a traveller or amateur able
    and willing to calculate his observations. Such an instrument is evi
    dently a tolerable theodolite and level, as well as a very firmly
    mounted telescope for common purposes, occultations, eclipses, &c.;
    and if the cross axis be made with care, it would suffice as a transit
    for the moon and moon-culminating stars in ordinary cases.               But it
    is chiefly valuable as an equal altitude instrument, which it is made by
     an excellent level attached to a small quadrant on one side of the
    telescope. Further particulars of Mr. Sheepshank's communications
    on both subjects are given in the Monthly Notices of the Society.

The muscles of bodies dissected at Saint Bartholomew's Hospital
had been more than once noticed by Mr. Wormald, the Demonstrator
of Anatomy    at that establishment, to be beset with minute whitish
 specks; and this appearance having been again remarked in that of
 an Italian, aged 45, by Mr. Paget, a student of the hospital, who
 suspected it to be produced by minute Entozoa, the suspicion was
found to be correct, and Mr. Owen was furnished with portions of
the muscles, on which he made the following observations.
    With a lens of an inch focus the white specks are at once seen to
be cysts of an elliptical figure, with the extremities in general atte
nuated, elongated, and more opake than the body (or intermediate
part) of the cyst, which is sufficiently transparent to show that it con
tains a minute coiled-up worm.        On separating the muscular fasci
culi, the cysts are found to adhere to the surrounding cellular sub
stance by the whole of their external surface, somewhat laxly at the
middle dilated part, but more strongly by means of their elongated
extremities. When placed on a micrometer, they measure ºoth of an
inch in their longitudinal and rºwth of an inch in their transverse di
ameter, a few being somewhat larger, and others diminishing in size
to about one half of the above dimensions. They are generally placed
in single rows, parallel to the muscular fibres, at distances varying
from + a line to a line apart; but sometimes a larger and a smaller
cyst are seen attached together by one of their extremities, and they
are occasionally observed slightly overlapping each other.
   If a thin portion of muscle be dried and placed in Canada balsam,
between a plate of glass and a plate of talc, the cysts become more
transparent, and allow of the contained worm being more plainly seen.
Under a lens of the focus of 4 an inch, the worm appears to occupy
a circumscribed space of a less elongated and more regularly ellipti
cal form than the external cyst, as if within a smaller cyst contained
in the larger: it does not occupy more than a third part of the inner
space. A few of the cysts have been seen to contain two distinct
worms; and Mr. Farr, who has paid much attention to the subject,
exhibited a drawing of one of the cysts from this subject, containing
                                   all
three distinct worms,              nearly equal size.

456             Coological Society:    Mr. Owen    on the
    Mr. Owen enters at some length into the question of the origin
of the cyst, and after comparing its structure and connexions with
various more or less analogous productions, he states his opinion that
the cyst is adventitious, foreign to the Entozoon, and composed of the
cellular substance of the body infested, morbidly altered by the irri
tation of the worm.
    The reading of the paper was accompanied by the exhibition of
drawings showing portions of the infested muscle, with magnified
representations of the cysts and of the worms contained within them;
and specimens of the objects themselves were also placed upon the
table for examination with the aid of Mr. Pritchard's microscope,
lent by him for that purpose.
    Mr. Owen also read a Paper “On the Anatomy of Linguatula
 Taºnioides, Cuv.”    After referring to the observations on the anato
mical structure of this highly organized Entozoon, published by Cu
vier and Rudolphi, he proceeds to state the results of his own dis
section of a fine specimen, 34 inches in length, for which he was in
debted to Mr. Langstaff.     The whole body is invested with a smooth,
transparent, rather fine cuticle, which, from maceration, and proba
bly slight decomposition, had become detached. In this epidermis
there exist no marks of an annulate structure; but the cutis, or mus
cular parietes of the body, is distinctly divided into segments slightly
overlapping each other, and most obvious on the sides of the body,
which are its thickest and most muscular portions. The dorsal and
ventral parietes, on the contrary, are so transparent as to allow of the
contained parts being readily seen through them.
    The most essential difference between Linguatula and the Cestoidea,
among which it was first placed by Chabert, consists in the genera
 tive organs being androgynous, with the oviduct continued from one
 end of the body to the other.      Rudolphi, uncertain with regard to
the structure of the digestive organs, placed it among the Trema
toda ; but the specimen under examination affords conclusive evi
dence of the justice of Cuvier's removal of it to the Nematoidea. The
alimentary canal commences at the central foramen, or true mouth,
and runs straight to the opposite extremity of the body, terminat
ing immediately above the orifice of the genital tube; the aesophagus
being +rd of a line in length, and opening into a suddenly dilated canal,
which continues with little variation of diameter to the anus.
    At the distance of a line posterior to the mouth, on the ventral
aspect of the body, the narrow extremities of two elongated vesicles,
3 lines in length and more than + a line in diameter, adhere firmly
to the integument, the remainder hanging freely in the abdominal
cavity.     These Mr. Owen considers to be analogous to the impreg
nating glands of the hermaphrodite Rotifera, &c. The ovary, which
is distinct from the tube so called by Cuvier and Rudolphi, is a nar
row, elongated, minutely granulated body, extending along the me
sial line of the dorsal parietes of the body for the extent of its two
anterior thirds: about ; an inch from the head it gives off two slen
der capillary tubes, which unite below the origins of the lateral
nerves, and enter the commencement of the oviduct.            The com
mencement of this tube, formed by the junction of the two ducts

460                    Zoological Society:       Mr.    Owen on the
 characters of the teeth; and observes particularly on the modifica
 tions in their arrangement and relative position consequent on the
 preponderating development of the cuspidatus.      He also points out
 the more important deviations which occur in the disposition and
 development of the different bones of the face in connexion with the
 same influential condition of the organs of mastication; and then
 continues his description of the skeleton of the Chimpanzee by pass
 ing to that of the trunk.
      Thenumber of the vertebrae is the same as in Man; but an addi
 tional rib subtracts one from the lumbar to be added to the dorsal
 series.   The spines of the cervical vertebrae are simple and elon
 gated; that of the third being the shortest, with the exception of
 the atlas, which, as usual, is without spine. The bodies of the lum
 bar   vertebrae are proportionally smaller than in Man; a difference
 easily accounted for by the necessity of affording a basis for the
 support of the latter in the erect position; and the same recession
 from the Bimanous type is manifested in the narrow and elongated
 form of the sacrum. In the adult animal, but less conspicuously in
 the young, the iliac bones rise on either side of the last lumbar ver
 tebra, and are partially attached to            it.The coccygeal are anchy
 losed   together,   but not with the     sacrum;    three are distinctly visible
in   the   young.     Of the sacral vertebrae       only   the two superior are
 united     tothe iliac bones. The pelvis differs from that              Man     of             in   all
 those particulars which characterize the Quadrumana, and which re

 tion.    The iliac bones are long, flat, and narrow, the anterior sur
 face stretching outwards almost parallel with the plane                    of

Chimpanzee with those which had replaced the deciduous teeth in
the older specimen. The resemblance in point of size and figure was
exact, and left no room for doubt as to the point in question.                  The
succession takes place precisely as in the human subject, but the per
manent teeth, and especially the incisors and canines, are proportion
ally longer. The particulars of their form and arrangement are
given at length.
   This portion of the paper was accompanied by an extensive series
of admeasurements of the different parts of the skeleton in the adult
and young Chimpanzee, compared with those of the young and adult
Orang; and was further illustrated by numerous drawings, and by
the exhibition of Mr. Walker's skeleton of the Chimpanzee, lent by
him for the purpose.
   The second portion of the paper commences with the remark
that the opportunity which the rare and interesting skeleton of the
adult Chimpanzee, in the possession of Mr. Walker, had afforded of
tracing the changes of structure occurring in that Ape, in                progress          its

Comparative Osteology of the Orang Ulan and Chimpanzee.                                      468
adult skull. That between the ala of the sphenoid bone and the
descending angle of the parietal, by means of which the frontal
and temporal are kept separate, and which offers one of the few
osteological differences in which the Orang has a closer approxima
tion to the human structure than the Chimpanzee, is among those
which continue to be marked even in the adult. The occipital fora
men approaches in figure, position, and aspect, nearer to that of
the lower Mammalia; the occipital condyles are more closely ap
proximated anteriorly; the anterior condyloid foramina are double
on each side; and the carotid foramen is situated more posteriorly,
and is relatively smaller, than in the Chimpanzee.        The petrous
portion of the temporal bone is smaller, while the glenoid cavity
forms a much larger proportion of the base of the skull. This cavity,
if such it may be called, presents a quadrate, almost flattened sur
face, slightly concave in the transverse, and slightly convex in the
 antero-posterior direction, affording an interesting correspondence
 with the structure of the molar teeth, and indicative of the vegetable
 diet of the animal. The styloid and styliform processes are want
 ing, as in the Chimpanzee; the mastoid is represented by a protube

466                 200logical Society:—Mr. Owen on the
mion being narrow and claviform, and in the absence of the flattened
and over-hanging margin of the spine.         Other differences exist in
the comparative dimensions and features of the supra- and sub
spinal fossae, in the inclination of the coracoid process, and in the
direction of the glenoid cavity.      But the principal feature in the
organization of the Orang, and that in which it differs most from
the Chimpanzee, consists in the relative length of the upper and
lower extremities, the arms in the former reaching to the heel. The
articular surface of the head of the humerus forms a complete hemi
sphere; and in some specimens that bone is perforated between the
condyles.     The principal peculiarities in the fore-arm consist in the
large space between the radius and ulna, occasioned by the outward
 curve of the former, and in the absence of the acute margin on                                                            is
