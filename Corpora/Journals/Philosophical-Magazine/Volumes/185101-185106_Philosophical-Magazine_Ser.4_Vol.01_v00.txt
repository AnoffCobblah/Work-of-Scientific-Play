the motion of fluids lateral communication of the motion takes
                                     a

establish           an
              experimental basis for this view, which has since
been favoured with manifold recognition.    There are two expe

not constant; and that if the diameter of the orifice be increased,
that of the tube de must increase, not in the same but in a less
ratio. This is probably to be referred to the more violent mo
tion imparted to the fluid in A by the application of a stronger jet.
   8. The experiment was so modified that a vertical jet was
projected upwards into a vessel with an aperture at the bottom,
in which a vertical tube was fixed. To prevent, in this arrange
ment, the outflow of the water, the ratio of the diameters of
the tube and orifice must be considerably smaller than in the
former case, perhaps that of 1 to 2. This is doubtless owing to
the fact, that the motion of the fluid exerts here a more dis
turbing influence than in the experiment with the horizontal
tube.
   9. These phaenomena connect themselves immediately with
those made known by the excellent investigations of Felix Savart
on the deportment of a water-jet projected against an immove
able plane”.   The same investigations inform us of what takes
place when two water-jets meet each other from opposite direc
tionst.   I  have repeated these beautiful experiments.   When
two  jets of equal diameters and equal pressure meet each other,
so that they have a common tangent, the water moves in a plane
perpendicular to this tangent, and forms an almost circular
transparent disc, fig. 4, which is surrounded by a circular trans
parent rim, the latter being evidently caused by the water form
ing itself into separate masses, which are driven out radially in
all directions.
   When the axes of both jets are parallel, but not in the same
straight line, that is to say, when one of them is a little higher
or lower than the other, the water moves unaltered in a plane
inclined to the tangent of the jets.
   If the cross sections of the jets remain equal as before, and if
one of them move with greater force than the other, the plane
changes into a curved surface, the concavity of which is turned
towards the side from which the weakest jet proceeds. When
the difference of pressure is greater, the surface closes up; and
the greater the difference, the greater will be the curvature at the
place where the jets meet each other.     When the cross sections
are different and the pressures equal, a curved surface is also
formed, the concavity of which is turned towards the side of the
smaller jet. But when both the diameters and the velocities—
that is to say, the pressure under which the jets are projected—
are different, and when the pressure of the jet with the least
diameter is greater than that of the other, a curved surface is
also formed, the apex of which, however, as long as the ratio of
the diameters of the jets does not exceed that of 1 to 4, lies close

 to the orifice of the larger jet.  For a greater ratio there is no
 result given by Savart.
    When the difference of the pressures is sufficiently great, and
when the ratio of the diameters is as 1 to 4, or something greater,
the smaller jet penetrates quite into the wider orifice.
    10. In the experiments described in § 7 this takes place. Two
jets, as it were, act against each other; for the water in the cy
lindrical tube may be regarded as a wider jet under a small
pressure.     Evidently a curved surface would in this case also be
formed, did not other circumstances come into play, by which,
instead of one large surface, a number of smaller ones are formed;
to these is due the foaming already alluded                                         to.

jet to issue in a perpendicular direction from a vessel through a
 tube, and brought the surface of the water which the jet was to
 enter almost into contact with the end of this tube.    Here air
bubbles were also formed in the interior of the fluid; but in this
case the short space of air through which the jet had to pass,
about 1 millim., could not possibly have a motion imparted to
it by friction sufficient to cause                                it to penetrate deep under the
surface of the water.
    18. Savart has asserted, that a jet of fluid up to            maximum                              its
contraction forms        single continuous
                                     a        mass;    but from this point
forwards portions are detached, which, owing                   the frequent                      to

motion is imparted to the fluid, and in this case the air is ob
served to enter sometimes with extraordinary violence.           A fun
nel-shaped whirlpool is seen to form round the jet, through
which the air passes downwards with a rotatory motion.             This
is observed when the jet issues under a pressure of a column of
water 10 feet high, and is received into a vessel 2 feet wide.
From this it appears to me that there can be no doubt as to the
correctness of the explanation given in § 19 with regard to the
manner in which the air penetrates the fluid.

pours into another of a similar nature through an orifice placed

the plate, up to a length of 150 millims, increased with the
distance from the orifice. A similar result was obtained from
all the experiments.   Not one (and several have been made which
are not here described) showed    decrease within the distance

 was situate, that the direction                of the jet, even through this short
 distance, remained unaltered.
       29. To avoid this insecurity, the experiment was so modified
 that the jet was vertical, and moved against a horizontal plate.
 The plate was attached by three fine wires to one end of the
balance.           The balance, however, was so placed that it could slide
up and down, the middle of the plate being preserved perpendi
cular beneath the orifice through which the water was to pass.
      The plate was suspended in water contained by a vessel 3 feet
in diameter and 2 feet high, the level of the water being kept
constant. The orifice through which the stream issued opened
at a depth of 4 inches underneath the surface.
      In these experiments, also, a similar increase of the action
against the plate was exhibited, both when the descending jet
was exactly vertical, and when it struck the centre of the plate at
an angle of 10°, as appears from No. 13 of the following table:—

                                shall return to the explanation of
the fact, that the action of the water against the plate increases
with the distance.    It appeared to me to be of interest to ascer
tain, in the next place, the manner in which the water of the jet
mixes with that into which it is projected.
   For this purpose                    I
                         permitted the water to pass horizontally
through an orifice from 2 to 3 millims. in diameter, and under
a vertical pressure of 7 feet, into a vessel two of whose sides
were glass, and separated from each other by a distance of onl
0.5 of an inch. As the jet entered the vessel through the middle
of       its
       small side, and hence could only spread itself upwards and
 downwards, there was reason         hope that the inconsiderable
                                                       to
thickness      the water would permit
                        of                     exact observation  of      an                                  of

                         unsteady and violent, that exact observation
was   impossible.      Another phaenomenon, however, was exhibited
in   this experiment,     which, although        might        immediately                be

           shall now apply myself to the explanation of these phae
             Unhappily in the present state of science a strict
nomena.
mathematical treatment of the question is not possible.        I believe,
however, the following considerations will furnish a complete
explanation of the action observed.
   Suppose a fluid to enter another of a similar nature contained
in a vessel of unlimited size, through an orifice situate at a suffi
cient depth beneath the surface. The jet, thus entering widens
continually, that is to say,                      its
                                  cross section becomes greater, while
 itsvelocity decreases                     as
                            the distance from the orifice increases.
Both these results are easily observed.

unnecessary that the tubes AA, fig. 13, should reach under the
surface of the water in the drum CC.
   These experiments show that a similar action takes place here
to that which we have so often an opportunity of observing when
a fluid is poured into a glass, in which case also bubbles are
carried downwards. This action has however becn sufficiently
explained in § 18 to § 20; and I introduce the water-bellows
here merely to show                 its
                          intimate connexion with the results

DURING
   an account       of which was read before the Royal Society
on the 18th of  April 1850,                               I
                               had frequently occasion to observe
that when a quantity of wet sea-weeds was laid together in a
heap in a warm situation for any length of time, it soon began
to undergo a species of fermentation.       This, I am aware, is a
circumstance which has been not     unfrequently  observed; but as
no one has hitherto been at the trouble to examine the nature
of the acids generated during this fermentation,      was induced                                         I
to investigate the matter a little more closely.
   At the ordinary temperature of Scotland, even during the
summer months, the fermentation of sea-weeds proceeds very
slowly, requiring from three to four months for                completion;
but when the weeds are         kept          temperature       from 90°

from time      time, to           keep the mixture slightly alkaline.

    tinuous mass is distinguished from that of a collection of indefi

    quired for expressing that the motion is subject to this limitation,
    which is not necessarily involved in the equation (2.), because
    the motion of a collection of discrete atoms might be such as to

teeth are not joined together like those of the maxillaries, but
are fixed separately to the membrane beneath.    It is easy to
          by the manner in which this sphincter oris acts, that
 y their rasping action these teeth must materially assist the
maxillary organs in the comminution of food+.
  The papillae are generally of a conical shape; those situated
among the folds are simple cones fixed to the membrane, and
about Tºndth of an inch in height; others at the angles of the
lips are compound, consisting of an agglomeration of simple
papillae disposed around a common stem.            The exterior of each
papilla is formed of a zone of ciliated, globular or prismatic cells.
   The interior of the papilla presents numerous transverse lines,
apparently constituting septa, dividing the part into compart
ments or cells. The cellulated part is generally limited at the
summit of the cone by the external zone of epithelium; but in
some cases the cone is truncated, and the cellulated portion

The growth is the most rapid in dry hot weather, and in a dusty
room.      The lines are quite opake; when breathed on, however,
they become swollen, and, from the moisture imbibed, semi
transparent; after the moisture is dried up, the lines no longer
have their original sharpness.
     Ihave called these figures electrical, because             conceive their               I
growth is chiefly due to the different electrical states of the par
ticles of dust floating in the atmosphere and the glass. This suppo
sition        is,
            however, insufficient, since have never seen these figures

                                        in

     I
     could not be entirely satisfied by that theoretical contemplation
of the nature of diamagnetism which you, and after you Messrs.
Reich, Poggendorff, Weber, and Plücker have entertained 4.
This theory requires the hypothesis, that in every molecule of a
magnetic substance subject to external induction the magnetism
is so distributed, that to the inducing south pole is directed an
induced north pole, and to the inducing north pole an induced
south pole; but that in diamagnetic substances the distribution
takes place in such a manner, that in every molecule, to the in
ducing south pole an induced south pole, and to the inducing
north pole an induced north pole is directed; or what is the
same thing, that the currents of the theory of Ampère in magnetic
substances are in the contrary direction to those in diamagnetic
substances.                I
                 tried rather to explain to myself the phaenomena
by an hypothesis which M. van Reest had advanced; conse
quently         I
             suppose that in magnetic, as in diamagnetic sub
stances, the polarity of the molecules have the same direction;
so that         all
           the north poles are turned      the south pole, and         to                                  all
the south poles     the north pole    the inducing magnet; only

two manners; either from the ends to the centre, or from the
centre to the ends.
  A. The excitation from the ends to the centre is done when a
bar is suspended between two magnet poles.
   1. When the coercive power is such that the effect of the mole
cules on each other may be neglected, then every particle that is
nearer to the magnet pole will be more strongly excited than the
neighbouring and more distant particle.
        If
      we observe two such neighbouring particles near the exter
nal south pole, then will the more near repel a south pole with
the intensity s; the more distant will turn to a north pole with
the intensity     but      suchn', manner that n'-s.

Introduction.—In surveying the principal localities of those re
markable vents of hot vapour in the Tuscan Maremma, called                     “La
goni,” “Fumacchi,” “Fumarole,” “Soffioni,” “Mo<U+017F>etti,” and even
“Volcanit,” I perceived that their issue took place upon ancient
parallel lines of fracture, along which serpentinous and other eruptive
rocks had been emitted.      As I am not aware that this coincidence in
lines of eruption, acted upon at epochs so remote from each other, has
been previously adverted to in any geological account of Tuscany,                   I
will first call attention to the phaenomenon.    I shall next take this
opportunity of expressing my opinion respecting the origin of the
“gabbro rosso” of the Tuscans, a rock intimately associated with
serpentine; and, after a brief allusion to recent earthquake shocks
along the same lines, the memoir will be terminated by glancing at
the simultaneous production of great divergent elevations in Italy and
in the Alps, after the deposit of the nummulitic eocene formation.
   Hot vapour rents.-If the intensely hot vapour gusts which have
issued for centuries from cavities in the rocks of the Tuscan Maremma
had been as well known to Dante, as they were to Targioni Tozzetti
their graphic describer in the last century, the great poet would

acids have already been described by Mr. Babbage in Murray's
‘Hand-book of Central Italy, and subsequently they have been
connected with a geological sketch of other parts of Tuscany by Mr.
W.     J.Hamilton, Sec. G.S.t     In order, however, to render my own
view clear, I must offer a slight outline of the chief phaenomena.
   In addition to other substances, the hot vapours of Tuscany are
charged with boracic acid, known only elsewhere in the active vol
cano of Stromboli. For the extraction of this last-mentioned substance,
the extensive works of M. Lardarel have been entered upon at the
following nine localities: viz. Lardarello or Monte Cerboli, Lustig
nano, Monte Rotondo, Sasso, Il Lago, Castel Nuovo, St. Federigo,
and St. Ippolito.      These places are       situated      that elevated all              in

of  the Cecina. Thence the affluents           that river (the Pavone,    of
Posera, Trossa, and Sterza) flow northwards; whilst the Cornia and
 its feeder the Melia run down        the Mediterranean     to    westerly                       in   a
and southerly direction.     The tract, penetrated      intervals      the            at                     by

 are both of jurassic age, the Ammonites Conybeari, Sow. and A. cos
 tatus, Schlth. occurring in them.
    All these sedimentary rocks, from the jurassic to those of the eocene
 group inclusive, have been penetrated, and for the most part much
 altered, by igneous or plutonic rocks, the greater number of which
 have a serpentinous character, their prevailing direction being equally
 N.W. and by N., S.E. and by S. Upon entering this elevated tract

from the north, I found that its chief town, Pomarancia”, was si
tuated on a plateau of shelly, tufaceous, yellowish, sandy marlstone
 —in parts a travertine. This band                     overlies the subapennine
 marls of the adjacent hills and valleys on the north, in which the
 rock salt and springs of Wolterra occur, and is probably of the same
age as the uppermost yellow marine “panchina’ of Tuscany, or as
                                                                    I

in a previous memoir t.
    The rock is disposed in horizontal masses, and denuded into abrupt
escarpments,      which in the middle ages formed the natural defences
of the old feudal town.           This tertiary deposit occupies the tract
between the picturesque heights of Rocca Sillana on the east, the
hot springs of S. Michele on the west, and Monte Cerboli on the
south, where rocks of serpentine and gabbro rise up through strata
of whitish grey alberese limestone and some contiguous schists and
sandstone. It is near the junction of the intrusive rocks of serpen
time with the depositary strata, which are there much contorted and
broken, that certain hot springs appear; four of which, at Monte
Cerboli, have recently been made known and their contents analysed
by Professor Targioni Tozzettit.              His observations and analysis
are of    geological    importance,     inasmuch as they show that those
springs which appear at intervals between Monte Cerboli (Mons
Cerberus?) and Lardarello, where the vapours issue, define a line, as
he says, from N. to S. (but accurately N. and by W., S. and by
E.), and that essentially the springs contain, though in different
proportions in each, the same ingredients as the lagoni or vapours
to the south of them. Thus, exclusive of organic and bituminous
matter, all the wells contain chloride of sodium, carbonate of

reader will find indications that the vapours of boracic acid had no issue in the
beginning of the sixteenth century.     See also notice of this tract by the early
geological traveller Targioni Tozzetti (Viaggi), whose descendant, the living Pro
fessor of Chemistry in Florence, has also published analytical descriptions of the
waters of Mont Alceto, Rapolano, Monte Catini, Castrocasa, Cimiano, and Casale.
   Since writing the memoir     I  have been informed by Dr. Daubeny that the
boracic acid vapours contain nitrogen gas — thus sustaining his views on the
origin of volcanic action. [M. Payen in his interesting account of the manufacture
of boracic acid in Tuscany gives the following as the composition of the non-con
densed gases in 100 parts:–carbonic acid, 57-30; nitrogen, 34-81 ; oxygen, 6'57;

  The noises and reverberations in the
  caverns, which he compared to the beat
  ing of a hundred fulling-mills, were
  doubtless much more overpowering for
  merly than now, when the apertures
  are so much closed in, and the issue so
  regulated. We learn, however, from the
  above-mentioned faithful historian two
  points of importance in the considera
  tion of these forms of volcanic action:
  —1st. That although the lagoni were
  then said to be increasing in number,
  one of the orifices, at Monte Cerboli
  and another at Castel Nuovo, had ceased
  to act in his time. 2ndly. That flames
  were said to issue by night*.
      That a connection exists between the
 Soffioni and the former geological erup
 tive agency of Tuscany is apparent, the
 moment we collate the present and the
 former phaenomena.         The inference is
 indeed determined by an appeal to the
 very line under consideration (see fig.2).

the connection alluded to becomes much more interesting; for, as
before said, four hot springs boil up in the same linear direction, and
it is important to remark, that of these, the spring which is nearest
to the lagoni partakes most of their boracic character. In short, the
springs and the Soffioni charged with sulphuric, carbonic, and boracic
acid, issue upon the very same line; and in following this line a little
further to the S. and by E., we reach Bagni a Morbo, where hot
sulphureous springs issue from fissures in rocks similar to those of S.
Michele and Monte Cerboli.              Still further to the S.S.E. the boracic
acid fumes reappear in a remarkably picturesque cleft of the rocks of
macigno, at Castel Nuovo, where the linear direction of the vents is
very striking”.
     We have thus along a distance of about six or seven English miles
from N. and by W. to S. and by E., the clearest possible evidence
that the present hot springs and vapours issue upon a line of fissure,
 in the alberese and macigno formations, which was formed in very an
                           I
 cient times, i.e., as believe, between the eocene and miocene periods;
 the production of such fissure having been accompanied by the out
 burst of great bosses of serpentine and other plutonic rocks.
                   º

      By extending this observation perceived that the other “Soffioni”
 of this tract exist under similar conditions, showing either the actual
 outburst of hot springs and vapours along such line of former erup
 tion, or the close parallelism of the two lines of phaenomena.            Thus,
 in my journey to the miocene coal tract of the Maremma before de
               I
 scribedt, found the little town of Monte Rotondo to be built upon
 a junction of                  with the sedimentary strata it had traversed;
 and in     looking    from that spot to the N. and by W.,          I saw the va
 pours of the Soffioni, which bear the same name, issuing, like those
 of Lardarello, from a valley encased in flanking ridges of the same hard
 rocks. Again, the sulphureous lake, about two miles west of Monte
  Rotondo, having a major ellipse of north and south, is distinctly a
    rolongation of one of the numerous cracks extending thence to the
     . and by W. towards Lustignano, by which boracic acid escapes.
      In mentioning these “Soffioni,” Professor Pillat has specially de
  scribed those of Sasso, and although he has not noted the coincidence
  on which      I
                  º    so much stress, any one who refers to his woodcut
 representing the issue at Sasso, will see that the line of vapour issuing
 from cavities is parallel to the main direction of the encasing ridges $.
  Now, these ridges of alberese and macigno have either a dominant
  direction from N. and by W. to S. and by E., or are perforated
  along such line by the serpentime, granitone (greenstone), or other
  eruptive rocks, including gabbro, to which           I shall afterwards advert.
  Hence it appears, that the ancient lines along which nature ex
 pended some of her grandest emergies in this region, are also those
  along which she still manifests the present escape of hot springs and

 calcareous shale is baked by the intense heat into brittle porcelain
 rock of a red colour. But I would here observe, that in these recent

here exhibited, it is certain that this eruption of “gabbro’ took place
after the consolidation of the alberese and macigno formations, i. e.
after the younger chalk and older eocene.       It is also further evident
that another movement of elevation occurred after the miocene pe
riod; for not only is the limestone associated with white marls (d) to a
great extent loaded with alabaster, which some persons might infer
was altered limestone, but the whole of this mass has been considered
to be miocene, simply because it dips away from the alberese and
gabbro in inclined strata, and is thus placed in striking contrast with
the subapennine or pliocene marls of the valley (e) which surround
a boss of “gabbro rosso” in perfectly horizontal and unbroken layers.
The altered     alberese at Civita Castellina has here and there serpen
tinous soft bands, and bears a metamorphic aspect, with a slickenside
surface, accompanied by cracks and numerous veins of arragonite,                                                     all

“gabbro.” Copper veins, however, either traverse the alberese                                                        or

which evolved the “gabbro rosso,” and are contemporaneous with
that rock, whilst other authors contend that they are posterior

this rock, which is the “gabbro " proper, and plays the same part in

latter was erupted.        For it is plain that the                         gabbro (as

 logy which         I
                  supposed were long ago set at rest. We may in that
 way be led to abandon many conclusions at which we had arrived, in
 refuting the doctrine respecting certain rocks of Cornwall, Norway,
 and other tracts which were believed by some authors to prove trans
 itions from granites to slates, and thus to indicate a common origin
 of these two classes of rock!                If
                                          this method of reasoning be again
 entertained (as it seems to me it is by M. Savi), then many of the
 inferences which geologists have drawn concerning the posterior in
 trusion of granite and other igneous rocks amid depositary strata
 will be invalidated.      For, although there are numerous examples of
 such phaenomena, which no sceptic can assail, still there are frequent
 cases where it is impossible to define the precise limit between the
 erupted molten matter and the altered rock. It is indeed in the very
 nature of the phaenomenon that such should happen, and the time of
 practical geologists can be better employed than in disputing upon
 such points.      Some persons may indeed argue, that many varieties
 of traps and amygdaloids were to a great extent evolved from the
 melting of the pre-existing strata in the crust of the globe, and I am
 quite ready to admit that such may have been the case.                  But this
 admission by no means removes them from that class of true erup
 tive rocks which, in the eye of the geologist, have acted mechanically
 and chemically upon the strata they have penetrated; for even some
 of the lavas of Vesuvius may be, in great part, fused and melted
 materials, formerly accumulated as marine sediment, which have
 been transmuted by intense heat under pressure. The practical point,
 therefore, for which I contend                   is,
                                             that the amorphous and sphe

Sir R. I. Murchison                   on the Vents            of Hot Vapour in Tuscany.                     63
the ridges above described as penetrated by serpentine, gabbro, and
other eruptive rocks,                 I
                           was struck with the fact, that the most pow
erful vibratory  disturbance occurred in the low hills and hillocks of
incoherent materials along this very line.       The shocks from north
to south being most powerful in this parallel of longitude, it was na
tural that they should produce the most disastrous effect in that
portion of the tract where edifices were placed on slightly coherent
marl that rises into hillocks void of lateral support.     The buildings
which rested on the     adjacent  harder rocks of  alberese, gabbro, ser
pentine, and greenstone were comparatively unaffected, whilst those
which stood on marl had fallen or were much shattered.          It is fur
ther  worthy  of  notice, that in the  deepest denudations   amongst   the
hillocks of marl, particularly near Lorenzana, where the earth opened
into chasms, subterraneous waters which had been hitherto impri
soned rose suddenly to the surface; just as if artesian wells had
been sunk, and that the overlying crust of a basin had been broken
through. Spouting forth sand and mud, these jets of water so threw
out solid contents, that when dried up they resembled so many
molehills with radii; the centre or box of each wheel-shaped body
being composed of concentrically laminated sands, marking the point
at which the water issued. These appearances not only served to
explain the origin of the larger muddy bosses of similar form,
                                               ºl
common in the incoherent subsoils of Calabria, which have been so
frequently subject to great earthquakes, but may also be viewed as
another link which connects the present small disturbances of the
surface, with the former                subterranean energy proceeding
from igneous and gaseous development we have been considering.
   Thus, in reference to my preceding memoirs and in reasoning by
analogy, we are led to infer, that the great evolution of molten mat
ter in former or plutonic times, accompanied by so much heat and
its gaseous attendants           metamorphose whole mountain chains,

 Sir R. I. Murchison                  on the Vents             of Hot Vapour in Tuscany.                      65
north of Parma, seems to have been the grand centre of serpentine
eruption, from whence such lines radiate, as marked by the protru
sion at intervals of igneous rocks and the bands of metamorphosed
strata which constitute the loftiest ridges of Italy (see fig. 6, p. 67).
In this way, the serpentime bosses of the Apennines, between Bologna
and Florence, that trend from N.W. to S.E.-i. e. from the region
of chief eruption—though divergent from the line of the Apuan Alps,
and Tuscan Maremma, are exactly coincident with the major axis of
the Apennines or great back-bone of Italy, the culminating points
of which, as at the Gran Sasso d’Italia, 9530 feet above the sea, are
composed of eocene (nummulitic) and cretaceous rocks reposing on
Jurassic.
    Again, if we turn from the east and look to the other great band
of eruption to the west of the coast of Italy, as marked by serpentines
.
protruding through the cretaceous and eocene deposits of Corsica,
we see (as graphically laid down by Pareto") that it marks nearly
a meridian line.    Looking then at Italy on the great scale, the geo
logist may, I think, satisfactorily connect        dominant physical fea       its
 tures with former causes      upheaval.    He sees that,

         convulsed and broken-up region where the Apennines bend
 round  to  become confluent with the Alps, the greatest masses                                                  of

 grand focus,         he

Vicentin and other tracts. The Apennines, on the contrary, offer
proofs, particularly on their western shores, not only of recent os
cillations, but also of copious volcanic eruptions.           Thus, as was re
cently shown, subaqueous volcanos were intensely active during the
penultimate period, along a band parallel to and flanking the Apen
nines, which had been raised at a former epoch.               After these fires
were spent and their dejections raised up into the western lands of
the Papal and Neapolitan States, we have no proofs of subacrial
volcanicity until Vesuvius burst forth, save the case of the volcano of
Latium *, whose period of activity is lost in the maze of time, and
the notable examples among the early Greek settlements in the Bay
of Naples.                                      -       -

be shown by the gauge as soon as the magnet was rendered active;
but whatever gas was employed, or whatever power of magnet used,
not the slightest change was produced.
   Thinking it possible that there might be expansion in one di
rection and contraction in another, the gases were then examined as
to the production of any currents in them, but no traces of such
appeared.
    From these results, the conclusion was arrived at by the author,
that the motions of magnetic and diamagnetic bodies in each other
do not appear to resemble those of attraction or repulsion of the ordi
nary kind, but to be of a differential action, dependent perhaps upon
the manner in which the lines of magnetic force were affected in
passing from one to the other during their course from pole to pole;
the differential action being in ordinary cases between the body
experimented with and the medium surrounding it and the poles.
A method of showing this action with the gases is described, in
which delicate soap-bubbles are made to contain a given gas, and
these, when held in the magnetic field, approach, or are driven further
off, according as they contain substances, magnetic or diamagnetic,
in relation to air.   Oxygen passes inwards or tends towards the mag
netic  axis, confirming  the results formerly described by the author in
his account of his investigations of flame and gases.
   Perceiving that if two like bubbles were set on opposite sides
of a magnetic core or keeper cut into the shape of an hour
glass, they would compensate each other, both for their own dia
magnetic matter and for the air which they would displace; and
that only the contents of the bulbs would be virtually in a difier
ential relation to each other, the author passed fron bubbles of
soapy water to others of glass; and then constructed a differential
torsion balance to which these could be attached, of the following
nature:–A horizontal lever was suspended by cocoon silk, and at
right angles, at the end of one arm, was attached a horizontal cross
bar, on which, at about 1% inch apart, and equidistant from the
horizontal lever, were suspended the glass bubbles; and then the
whole being adjusted so that one bubble should be on one side of
the iron core and the other on the other side, any difference in their
tendency to set inwards or outwards from the axial line caused them to
take up their places of rest at different distances from the magnetic
axis; and the power necessary to bring then to an equidistant position
became a measure of their relative magnetic or diamagnetic force.
   In the first place, different gases were tried against each other, and
when oxygen was one of them it went inwards, driving every other
outwards.     The other gases, when compared together, gave nearly
equal results, and require a more delicate and finished balance to
measure and determine the amount of their respective forces.
   The author now conceived that he had attained to the long-sought
power of examining gaseous bodies in relation to the effects of heat
and the effects of expansion separately; and proceeded to an investi
gation of the latter point. For this purpose he prepared glass bubbles
containing a full atmosphere, or half an atmosphere, or any other
proportion of a given gas; having thus the power of diluting it
without the addition of any other body. The effect was most stri

king. When nitrogen and oxygen bubbles were put into the balance,
each at one atmosphere, the oxygen drove the nitrogen out power
fully. When the oxygen bubble was replaced by other bubbles
containing less oxygen, the tendency inwards of the oxygen was less
powerful ; and when what may be called an oxygen vacuum (being
a bulb filled with oxygen, exhausted, and then hermetically sealed)
was put up, it simply balanced the nitrogen bubble.                    Oxygen at
half an atmosphere was less magnetic than that at one atmosphere,
but more magnetic than other oxygen at one-third of an atmosphere;
and that at one-third surpassed the vacuum.                In fact, the bubble
with       its
         contents was more magnetic              proportion         the oxygen
                                                                      in                        to                  it
contained.     On the other hand, nitrogen showed               difference     this        no                 of

   The difference, it will    be observed, is very appreciable; and as
 the  analyses  were  performed  with M. Regnault's eudiometer, the
 author is of opinion that he can  -

    The existence of the larger quantity of oxygen in the air taken
 during the day, may perhaps be explained on the supposition that the
 sun, by heating the surface of the sea, occasions a disengagement of
 the air dissolved in the water, which air is richer in oxygen than that
 of the atmosphere. It may be conceived that from this cause the

  When a mixture of nitre and carbonate of potash is fused with                                                                        .
excess of wolfram, a product is obtained which is partially soluble
in boiling water, and deposits on cooling a brown gummy salt.
This salt, treated with hydrochloric acid, yields, when the solution is
evaporated with heat, large prisms with six regular faces, the com
position of which may be referred to a new type, which will be
W* O's M*.
    This new tungstate exhibits                              a very singular combination and                                pro

tained, which at first deposits crystals of paratungstate of ammonia

little by little with hydrochloric acid, becomes a thick mass of very
fine needles united in spheres; these contain tungstic acid, ammonia,
peroxide of iron, peroxide of manganese and water; but no reagent

    By ebullition with acids or alkalies, this ferri-mangani-tungstate is
decomposed, and then the presence of the acid, and of iron and man
ganese is readily ascertained.     It is also decomposed by drying at
392°, and it then redissolves readily in water; but, by evaporaton,
it gives a mixture of hexagonal tables of a deep rose-red colour, and
of white or slightly yellowish needles.
    With bichloride of platina, a precipitate of chloroplatinate of am
monia is obtained, and the solution, evaporated to the consistence of
a syrup, gives ferri-mangani-tungstic     acid.

   There certainly exists another ferritungstic type, for as already
stated, wolfram, treated with nitre and carbonate of potash, gave a
gummy salt. As this may be heated to ebullition with carbonate of
potash without depositing peroxide of iron, it must belong to a dif
ferent type from that to which it gives rise, by the influence of acids.

                ON DULCOSE.        B.Y. M. A. LAURENT.
   The author   states, that some months since he presented to the
Academy a memoir on a new kind of sugar, to which he gave the
name of dulcose, and to which he gave the formula C*H* O”--3Aq,
which makes it an homologue of glucose.        At the last sitting of the
Academy, M. Jacquelain communicated a memoir on the same sub
ject, and gave to dulcose the formula C"H"O".
   M. Jacquelain having inadvertently compared his results with M.
Laurent's calculation of dulcose, supposed to be anhydrous, and having
thereby found differences which were too great, sent to M. Laurent a
very pure specimen of dulcose, requesting him to repeat the analysis.
   The following are the results of M. Laurent's fresh analysis, com
pared with that of M. Jacquelain, and the theoretic results of both :

   If M. Jacquelain's formula were correct, it must be admitted that
in the 10 analyses which were made, 2 to 3 thousandths less of
hydrogen were obtained than by calculation, which is contrary to
what happens in    all   analyses.

                                          Meteorological Observations.                                                                               79
   As the theoretic results closely approximate, there is a very simple
method of arriving at the truth, which is to determine the atomic
weight of dulcose; this M. Laurent states he has done by analysing
the barytic compound which crystallizes very well and contains
C*H* Ba' O'44-14 Aq. M. Laurent expresses a hope that M.
Jacquelain will repeat this experiment, and confirm the results which
he has observed.— Ibid.

XII.      On   the Phosphorescence         of Bodies. By John W. DRAPER,
      M.D., Professor of            Chemistry and Physiology in the University
      of New York+.
A BELIEF          in the existence of the Carbuncle, a stone supposed
        to have the property of shining in the dark, appears to
have been current from the very infancy of chemistry.            It gave
rise to   many  legends  among    the  alchemists;  and  early travellers
relate marvellous stories respecting self-shining mountains and
gems.      Thus, it was said, that the king of Pegu wore a carbuncle
so brilliant, that if any of his subjects looked upon him in the .
dark, his countenance seemed as though it was irradiated by the
sun; and that, in some part of North America, there was a moun
tain which illuminated the country for many miles, and served
by      its
         rays    guide the Indians
                to                       night.   These traditions were
                                                    at
passing into discredit, when Vincenzio Cascuriola,           shoemaker,        a

In               of this theft, Kunkel succeeded in discovering
             consequence
what the substance was, and made known the method of       pre                                                     its

   The particular condition under which these preparations shine
in the dark was very quickly perceived        the same    the old                 to   be                     as
authors had   recognised.   Isidore    Seville,  speaking     the       of                                         of
“lightning-stone,” says, “si sub divo positus fuerit fulgorem
rapit sidereum.” That condition        previous exposure      the       is                                         to

drew the attention                      of the cultivators of natural science to this
singular property; and under the names             sunstones, light                     of
magnets, noctilucas, &c., various shining bodies were introduced.

          piece of fluor-spar, polished on both sides, was placed
     A flat
in a polariscope, and a pair of blunt iron wires connected with a
Leyden jar were adjusted very near and in front of it; so that
when the spark passed, a brilliant glow ensued in the spar, which
was simultaneously viewed through the analyser of the instru
ment. But though the experiments were made both by daylight
and lamplight, no kind of effect could be detected.
   These experiments were first made by using as the analyser,
a doubly refracting achromatic prism; they were, however, re
peated with a Nichol’s prism, in which the eye is not disturbed
by a bright image, as in the other case.    Having fixed the plate
of polished spar in the polariscope, it was readily perceived that
it possessed naturally a kind of structural arrangement, because
there were cloudy spaces or lines in it which contrasted with the
faint white light which passed in the adjacent parts.       It was
also seen that this structural arrangement could be deranged, in
a transient manner, either by pressure or unequal warming, as
is well known of other bodies; but when a powerful electric
discharge  was passed near to the spar and a brilliant phospho
rescence took place, no change whatever could be discovered.
Even when the iron wires were made to rest on the spar and
the explosion passed over                      its
                              surface, nothing was perceptible
except along the line between the ends     the wires, where the             of

surface of which was finely polished, was made to phosphoresce
brightly along a given line, determined by the blunt ends of two
iron wires, which served as a discharger, and were placed near
to the polished surface.   The spar was forthwith suspended in
the mercurial box of a Daguerreotype apparatus, and kept there
for an hour. The mercury was found condensed upon it faintly,
in the manner it would have been on a Daguerreotype plate,
especially on and in the vicinity of those parts that were more
immediately exposed to the spark. This, therefore, seems to
prove, that there is in these cases a molecular modification of the
shining surface.

When the spark was made to pass, there was a great movement
in the index-tube, as in the instrument known as Kinnersley’s

   4th. Is phosphorescence accompanied with           a    development          of
electricity?
  It  has already been stated, that the experimenters of the last
century paid    a good deal of attention to this point.     Dufay
established the   fact, that though in many   cases of phosphores
cence there is a development of electricity, there are many others
in which the light seems to be wholly unattended by any dis
turbance of that kind.
  I have   repeated some of these experiments, and with the same
results, if proper care be taken to avoid friction, and other ob
vious causes of electric excitement.  Thus a flat piece of chloro
phane, phosphorescing powerfully, was put on the cap of a very
delicate gold-leaf electroscope, but no disturbance whatever was
perceptible.
   A large crystal of fluor-spar was made to phosphoresce bril
liantly along a line about half an inch in length, by passing the
spark of a Leyden jar between two blunt iron wires, the ends of
which were that distance apart, and resting on the face of the
crystal. Over this line of blue light, which was pretty sharply
marked, and which lasted for several minutes, a delicate hair
was held.    This would have been readily attracted and repelled
by the feeblest excitation on sealing-wax, but in this case it
wholly failed to yield any indication whatsoever.
  In   connexion with the foregoing experiments             I
                                                   may mention
some miscellaneous    facts,  I made some   attempts   to deter
mine whether phosphorescent bodies, in the field of a powerful
                .
electro-magnet,   would exhibit any change of property.     Six
Grove's   pairs were made to  magnetize a good  electro-magnet;
the power they could give to it would enable the keeper to sup
port about      a ton.   Between               its
                                      polar piece, chlorophane,
Canton’s phosphorus, &c., which had been made           glowto    ex       by
posure  to  aLeyden spark, were placed.        But whether the mag
netism was      on  not, there was
                     or                    no

   Determination    of the    absolute quantity    of Light    emitted by
                                    Phosphori.
   And now we may fairly inquire how it is with the light itself?
do we not deceive ourselves respecting it? We ought to recol
lect that it is barely perceptible in the open day, and that these
experiments require to be made in the dark. We should also
recollect the great sensibility of the eye, and how feeble a lumi
nous impression it can detect.       Impressed with these facts, I
have endeavoured to compare the absolute quantity of light given
by the most brilliant phosphori with some well-known standards.
The result of those experiments, now to be presented, puts a new
view on the whole subject.
   The first attempts    I
                        made for this purpose were conducted on
the  principle of comparing the stains formed on a Daguerreotype
plate by the phosphorus under trial and by an oil-lamp, receiving
the rays from each on the polished concave mirror, eight inches
in diameter and fifteen in focus, of a reflecting camera-obscura.
For this purpose there were set, side by side, a small oil-lamp,
a piece of white paper illuminated by the lamp, and a piece of
chlorophane, arranging things in such a way that the stone
might be illuminated by rays coming from a contact-breaker
worked by two Grove’s pairs. The contact-breaker was kept in
rapid action for fifteen minutes; and them, to prove the sensi
tiveness of the plate, the lamp was moved for one minute to a
new position, and the experiment closed.
   On mercurializing, it was found that the impressions of the
lamp had solarized, both that of fifteen minutes and that of one,
proving that such a light in one minute is amply sufficient to
change the plate to     its
                          maximum.     Also the electric spark       the     of
contact-breaker was solarized, and the image            of
                                                    the piece      white    of
paper beautifully given,       clear white; but the phosphorescing
                               of
                                a
spar had made      noimpression, except from one portion, where                   it
reflected the rays  of the spark.
    Suspecting that the spark from the contact-breaker might not
have been powerful enough,          repeated the experiment, using
                                    I
 sparks from Leyden jar. The oil-lamp was exposed
             a                                                  front  in         of
the camera one minute and then removed; then ten strong
 sparks were passed over the spar, each           of
                                              which made        emit   it         an
 emerald light; but during the moment              of

 reflecting camera and sensitive plate.
    On mercurializing,     was found,
                          it              before, that the lamp was
                                            as
 beautifully depicted, but the spar invisible.

the light from chlorophane is incomparably less intense than
that from a common lamp.             For there can be no doubt that
each of the ten discharges gave a light which lasted brilliantly
for      six
         seconds, and upon the whole was equal           duration     the                  in                    to
light     the lamp; yet the latter had changed the plate
           of                                                                                                        to   a
maximum, while the former had not made the smallest percep
tible impression.
   As the foregoing attempts          obtain photographic effects had

glass tube     quantity a                      of
                              chlorophane was placed,        coarse frag                         in

                                      to                   length     the                      in               of
tube.    The reflecting camera was placed               proper position,             in   a
accommodated with            sensitive silver plate. When everything
                                            its
was arranged,        spirit-lamp was applied
                                 a                    the chlorophane,               to
which soon emitted       superb emerald light, and continued
                                           a                                                                     to       do
so  for about two minutes. As the light began               decline, the                        to
spar splintered                   by
                      decrepitation, but      the  process went forward   all
ina      very satisfactory                     way.
     As soon    this was complete,
                         as             placed     oil-lamp  I  front             an                       in         of

     So  appears that the splendid green light emitted when the
spar    heated,        least twenty-four times less intense than the

requires that one light should be sixty times as intense as the
other; it follows, therefore, that at those distances the illumi
nating power of the lamp is fifteen hundred times as intense as
the illuminating effect of the spar.
   But the quantity of spar used in this experiment exposed a
surface much greater than that of the flame,            it was estimated
at least twice as   great.   This,  therefore,   would bring us to the
conclusion, that the intrinsic brilliancy of the chlorophane is not
spºndth part of that of the lamp.                                        -
   This experiment was several times repeated. Thus it was
found that the lamp extinguished the shadow from the spar when
their relative distances were 1:4. The lamp at 4 was therefore
sixty times as luminous as the spar at 1; that            their illumina                   is,

1st, phosphorescence produced by insolation; 2nd, by heat.
An example of this is offered in the standard work on chemistry
by L. Gmelin.
   A division of this kind brings the whole subject into confusion.
It assigns different causes for things that are essentially allied.
It leads to the inference, that, as under certain circumstances
the sunlight or an electric spark can make bodies glow, so under
other circumstances heat will produce the same effect, and this,
wholly independent of incandescence.
   But what are the facts? If a yellow diamond, placed upon
ice, is submitted to the sun and then brought into a dark room
the temperature of which is 60°, for a time there is a glow, but
presently the light declines and dies out. Let the diamond now
be put in water at 100°; again it shines, and again       light dies                                    its

XIII.     The solution          of the      Problem       of Sound, founded                on the   Atomic

    ISAAC                 NEWTON, investigating
                                          the expression for the
SIRvelocity of sound in air, found  that it was represented by
 MgH, where g = force of gravity =32-19 feet, velocity per
second, and H is the height of the homogeneous atmosphere.
His method is objected to, but no other expression for the velo
city of sound has hitherto been established in place of his formula.
It was, however, found that the value given by the formula Vyh.
was smaller than the velocity given by experiment by about one
sixth part; and the first who succeeded in giving an explanation
for this discrepancy was the illustrious mathematician Laplace,
who maintained that the sensible heat developed in the sudden
condensation of air was sufficient to account for       Calculations                 it.

reading, forcibly impressed on his mind the necessity of consi
 dering the change in the distances of the centres of the atoms of
gases during their condensation and rarefaction, when the elastic
force and the heat and cold developed were the subjects of study.
 Such teaching could never be forgotten by a mathematician
studying the equations of fluid motion; but the method of
bringing the force of mathematics to bear on the subject was
not so evident, whilst still in the dark, though abundantly simple
when once known.

geneous fluid, with a cubical arrangement of         atoms, and that                    its

    A convenient way of making the above experiment is with a
syringe-bottle, such as that used by chemists for washing out
precipitates, the pressure of the breath being used instead of the
  ressure of the steam.    The experiment was also modified in the
 ollowing manner:—A cylindrical tin vessel, about 10 inches in
height, had a circular hole punched through           bottom. When                  its

     If
     we neglect the small quantity of alumina and magnesia as
non-essential elements, we find the oxygen in the other three
constituents to be nearly in the proportions of 6, 2 and 3, and
the mineral is consequently a hydrated silicate of lime represented
by the formula
                         2(CaO,                        SiO2)   +3HO.
     The analysis shows a slight excess in the amount of lime, and
deficiency  in the silicic acid and water required for the formula;
but the latter is probably due to partial efflorescence, as I have
found that gurolite loses water with great facility.        11-201 grs.

     earliest observations on bebeerine were made
           of Demerara, in the year 1834. He discovered it
in the bark of a tree known in that colony by the name of Be
beeru, which has been since described by Sir R. Schomburgk,
and named Nectandra Rodiei in honour of its discoverer.
   A more minute investigation, both of       chemical and medi                   its
cimal properties, was published    Dr. Douglas Maclagan        by

   The analyses of the platinum salt, taken in conjunction with
those of the base itself, leave no doubt that the formula C*H*INO6
is the correct representation of the constitution of bebeerine, and
that the difference in the results obtained by Maclagan and Tilley
must depend on the imperfect purification of the material em
ployed in their analyses.      The formula which they have given is
in itself improbable,   although    it was that adopted for morphia
at the time  they  wrote.     The more recent investigations of Lau
rent have given for that base the constitution C*H* N 0°, which
has been confirmed by the analyses of Mr. How in this labora
tory; and though Maclagan and Tilley's analyses approximate
to this formula also, the difference is too great to admit of                                             its
being received         as

120                     Mr.    J. J.   Sylvester's Enumeration                        of the
the theory of the contacts of loci not transcending the limits of
vulgar space, by which I mean the space cognizable through the
senses+, and shall accordingly be almost exclusively concerned
in determining the singular cases of conjugate systems of qua
dratic forms of two, three, and four letters respectively.
   In order that the reduction of any such system, say U and V,
to a pure quadratic form may be possible (as it generally is), it
is necessary that none of the roots of the complete determinant
of U + XV shall be equal; if any relation of equality exist be
tween these roots, the general reduction is generally no longer
possible; under peculiar conditions, however, as will hereafter
appear, in spite of the equality of certain of the roots, the irre
ducibility in            its
                   turn will cease, and the ordinary reduction                                                      be

seem     give but two species

that there are            no
                   less than four species     contact possible be            of

       Contacts          of Lines and Surfaces of the                Second Order.             125
   Here only one distinct pair of lines can be drawn to contain
the intersections, showing that three out of the four points come
together.
  This may be termed “Proximal Contact.”                                    The number of
affirmative conditions to be satisfied is two, and the contact                         is
therefore entitled of the second degree.
   The tangent at the point of contact is y=0, and the four                                     in
tersections become
                                        wa0 y=0

                                        ar=0         z=0.
   These may be obtained from the equation W-au=0, which
gives y=0 or z=0; the former implying concurrently with
itself a”=0, and the latter y2=0.
   Thus we obtain three systems,
                                          wa0 y=0,
and one

corresponding to three consecutive points and the single distinct
One.
   The determinant of (U+\V) being only of the third degree
in A, we have exhausted the singularities of the system U, V
dependent on the form of the complete determinant of U+AV.
   Let now the first minors of U + XV have a factor in common;
§.
this will indicate that U+AV may be made to lose two orders
by rightly assigning X, in other words, that the intersections of
        W are contained upon a pair of coincident lines.  Here it
is remarkable that the original forms of U and V reappear, but
with a special relation of equality between the coefficients: we

therefore to express that three quadratic functions of A have a
root in common.      This implies the existence of two affirmative
conditions; the contact of the two conics taken collectively may
therefore be still entitled of the second degree, although the
contact at each of the two points where it takes place is simple,

   In this case the two points of intersection of the curve of the
third degree, and the right line on which the surfaces intersect,
come together, so that the right line becomes a tangent to the
curve. The number of conditions to be satisfied is three: there
is but one point of contact which may be considered as the union
of two which have coalesced, and the species may be defined as
confluent-unilinear contact.
  If we throw the equations to the conoids having an unilinear
contact into the form
                                     w(a  +y)+2t=0

   The curve of the third degree, in which the two given conoids
intersect, may thus be defined as their common intersection with
the new conical surface defined by the third of the above equations.
   More generally, it is apparent that the three conoids,

some other more general form, is incapable of being expressed as

    Ipass now to the singularities which arise from the first minor
determinants of U+AV having a factor in common, the second
minors being supposed to be still without a common factor.
   When this common factor is linear in respect to X, let it be

     wo of the cones containing the intersection of U and V then
become coincident, and degenerate each into the same pair of
crossing planes.    This may be termed biplanar-contact. The

                                      y=0        z=0 a”=0.
      This, therefore,            I
                       call confluent-biplanar contact; the two
conics constituting  the complete intersection, instead of cutting,
touch and at their point of contact the two conoids have a con
tact of a superior order.   The conditions to be satisfied for this
case are three in number.                       -
   Next suppose that the common factor of the first minors enters
only twice into the complete determinant, but that the remaining
two factors became equal.
   Here the analytical characters of unilinear and biplanar con
tact are blended; in fact, the intersection consists of a conic and
a pair of right lines meeting one another and the conic.       The
characteristics are
                                  U=a^+y^+2°4-2t
                                  V=aa”--ay”--b2°-H czt.
     The intersection is contained in the two planes
                                 z=0 (b-a)2        + (c—a)t=0,
and consists of the two lines z=0, 2°4-y”=0, lying in the com-                         |

                         (a–c)a”--(a-c)/*-i- (b-c)2*=0 }
  There are three points of contact, viz. the point was 0, y=0,                        |
z=0, where the two right lines cut, and a "+y”=0, t-0, z=0,
where these lines meet the comic.       This, then, is a case of triple
contact.   I distinguish  it by the name of bilinear-contact.      The
number of conditions is still three.

This   Icall confluent-bilinear contact.               It    requires the satisfac
tion of four conditions.                                     +
   Next let us suppose that the two distinct factors are common
to each of the first minors. This will imply the existence of
four affirmative conditions.
   The complete determinant will of necessity contain each of
these factors twice, so that no additional singularity can enter
through this determinant. The characteristics assume the form
                        U=     r^4-y”.4-2°4       tº
                        W    = aw” + ay” +bz”--bt”.
The two surfaces will meet in four straight lines, forming                           a    wry
quadrilateral, whose equations are
                              wit   M-1/=0
                              zit w/-It-0.
These intersect each other in the four points
                      w-0         y=0     z*-i-   tº   -0
                      z=0         t-0     w”   +y”-0,
each of which     will be a distinct point.            This      I term   quadrilinear
contact.
   Now let the two factors common to each of the first minors
become identical ; so that a squared function, instead of an ordi
nary quadratic function of X, is now their common measure.
   The factor which enters twice into each of the first minors
will enter four times into the complete determinant; the number
of conditions to be satisfied is one more than in the preceding
case, namely five, and the characteristics become
                   U=a^+ y” +wz-Hyt
                     V= aw”--by”--cre--cyt.
   Here arises a singularity of form in the intersections utterly
unlike anything which has been remarked in the preceding cases.
For it will not fail to have been observed, that the intersection
in the nine preceding cases was always a line or system of lines
of the fourth degree, so as to be cut by any plane in four points.
   But in this case, the fact of the first minor having a factor in
common, shows that the intersection is contained in two planes
(which is of course to be viewed as a degenerate species of cone);
                                                                                   its
                                                                          of all
and the fact of the complete determinant having                  roots
equal, shows that there       but one system
                               is                   pair     of
                                                            planes
                                                                 a                         in
which the intersection      contained, and
                             is                more.        no
    Sothat the two   pairs     of
                              planes, into which the wry quadrila
teral was divisible    the case immediately preceding, now become
                      in
a single pair. This can only         be

134               Mr. J.   J.   Sylvester's Enumeration             of the
another, but still not coinciding in the same planes; so that the
actual visible or quasi-visible+ intersection will be in three right
lines, of which the middle one meets each of the two others.
   This will further appear by proceeding regularly to solve the
equations
                                   U=0         W   = 0.
V—cL =0            gives   y= + Ka,      where     K=             #,          and therefore
az-i-kart—0,           or wa–ket   =0;whence we see that the complete
intersection       is represented by the lines
                   (w-0         y=0); (2 + kt–0              y—kw=0)
                   (w-0         y=0); (2—kt=0                y+     ka-0),
showing that there are but three physically distinct lines,                                   as
already premised.
   This, then, may be considered as derived from the preceding
case of a wry quadrilateral intersection, by conceiving two oppo
site sides of the quadrilateral to come indefinitely near, but
without coinciding.
   Let these two lines be called P and P'; take any point in P
and any two points in P' indefinitely near to one another and the
point first taken, then this indefinitely small plane will be com
mon to both surfaces, and consequently they ought to touch
along every point in the line P. This is again confirmed by the
forms given to U and V.       For at any point where the coordi
nates are 0, 0, 8, 6 the equations to the tangent planes to the
two surfaces respectively are
                                     {r+ 6/ –0

that is to say, are identical.
   Whilst, therefore, certain grounds of geometrical, and still
stronger grounds of analytical analogy, might seem to

contact, in which there is no contact, except only at two points of
the right line forming part of the complete intersection.
    I believe that this kind of contact, which forms a natural
family with two others about to be described, and which will close
the list, has never before been imagined, and would at first sight
have been rejected as impossible.
   Having now exhausted the cases of the first class, in which
the minors have no factor in common, and the two sections of
the second class, in which the second minors have no common
factor, but the first minors of U + XV a linear or quadratic func
tion of A in common, I descend to the third class, in which the
second minors, which are quadratic functions of A, are supposed
to have a common factor.
   This common factor must enter twice into each of the first
minors by virtue of the law previously indicated, and cannot enter
more than twice, as otherwise the first minor of U + XV could
only differ from one another by a numerical multiplier, which is
obviously impossible, except when U+AV is of the form (k+x)|U,
i. e. when the two surfaces coincide.
    Again, the common factor of the first minor must enter three
times into the complete determinant; but there is no reason why
it may not enter four times, and thus two cases arise. In the
first, the characteristics take the form
                             U= r^4-y?--2°4               tº

   It may not be uninteresting, under an euristic point of view,
to state that the above theory, which, as well in what it accom
plishes as in what it suggests (the author cannot but feelconscious),
constitutes a substantial accession to analytical science, arose out
of a theorem which occurred to him as likely to be true, in the
act of reviewing for the press his paper “On Certain Additions"
in the last November Number of this Magazine, and which he had
only then time to throw into a foot-note as a probable conjecture.
   Wishing to subject it to an analytical test, he found it necessary
to obtain the condensed forms which serve to characterize the
confluent contact of conics.       In this way he became aware of
the great utility of these condensed forms, and of the desideratum
to be supplied in obtaining a complete list of them applicable to
of all
     varieties     of
                contact.   The happy thought then occurred        him                                to

about eight statute miles of Limerick.  The meteor was followed
by a long tail of light, and apparently sparks of fire.   It was
visible for about three seconds; was first observed near the
zenith, moved slowly horizontal (with a slight dip, however,) in
a north-easterly direction, was of a reddish colour, and became
extinguished apparently a short distance eastward of Limerick.

a second, and moved through 2°, and directly towards the horizon.
   At 10h 25", a meteor, similar to a star of the third magnitude,
moved from a point near & Coronae Borealis, and passed a little
to the north of 8 Serpentarii.   It moved through about 20° in
about 2 seconds.
    On August 6, at 10h 36", a meteor, which equalled if not
surpassed Arcturus in brightness, passed about 2° below a Coronae
Borealis, and 3° below 8 Serpentarii.     It left a brilliant train,
which extended over about      15°;     path                 its

XIX.   On the alleged necessity             for   a new General             Equation in
  Hydrodynamics.              By G. G. Stokes, M.A., Fellow of Pem
   broke College,     and Lucasian Professor                 of   Mathematics    in the
   University   of   Cambridge.
   To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,
Th;       last Number of your Magazine contains a communica
      tion from Professor Challis, which appears to be the com
mencement of a series of articles devoted to the establishment
and application of a new general equation in hydrodynamics. It
is now several years since Professor Challis first published this
equation.     I have hitherto refrained from entering into any con
troversy on the subject, though, having had occasion to refer to
Prof. Challis's investigations in a report “On recent Researches in
Hydrodynamics”,” I expressed my dissent from Prof. Challis's
views, as I felt bound to do, in consequence of the thorough convic
tion which I felt that the equation was inadmissible. The subject
has recently been taken up by others, who have attacked the new
equation, but I must confess that I have seen nothing in the
replies of Professor Challis that has tended to shake my original
conviction.
   The points on which I entertain an opinion more or less op
posed to that of Professor Challis are so various, that, were    to                I
enter fully into them all, the controversy thence likely to ensue
would occupy in your pages a space altogether unreasonable, and
would probably come to nothing from                    its
                                              very unwieldiness.                       I
                      conduct the controversy      which, with your
                                                                  on

 158             Mr. G. G. Stokes                 on the alleged necessity                      for
permission,          I
              now enter, on the following plan: to notice only
one important  point at a time; and if a question should arise
which Professor Challis and                        I
                              both regard as of vital importance,
but on which we cannot agree, to leave off the discussion.
   The form which Professor Challis has given to his last com
munication, by commencing at the beginning of the subject,
dispenses with the necessity of referring to previous publications
or controversies, and I shall therefore proceed at once to the
discussion.
    The first five propositions in Professor Challis's paper contain
 only what is generally admitted by mathematicians, and which
I   admit among the number. On this part of the paper                    will                              I
only make three remarks.           First, that although the equality of
pressure in          all
                    directions follows          similar manner from the

                                                                       a
fundamental principle assumed                the ordinary theories        hy                               of
 drodynamics and hydrostatics,               not conceive that the funda

                               is  accurate,   experimentally,       the two                      in
cases; secondly, that        consider
                                I           clearer and more correct
                                                           it                                                    to

though not by itself, by mere composition with a motion of
translation may be made to pass into one for which uda-H &c. is
not integrable even by a factor, it follows that motions of the
former kind do not possess any physical characteristic by which
to distinguish them from their fellows of the class for which udw-H

This  silicate is found with the emery of Gumuch-dagh, and
  occurs on specimens of magnetic oxide of iron.  It is of a
pearly-white colour, and lamellar in structure; cleavage difficult.
It scratches glass easily, and has a specific gravity of from 3:15 to
3.20.    Heated before the blowpipe it becomes milk-white, but
does not fuse.    At first sight it might be taken for white dis
thene.    It is decomposed    with great difficulty by carbonate of
soda even with the addition of a little caustic soda.    The alkalies
were separated by means of hydrofluoric acid.

  This mineral, which resembles pholerite in composition, has
been found with the emery of Naxos associated with emerylité.
It is white, lamellar, and somewhat crystalline, sometimes gray.
It is soft to the touch like steatite, infusible before the blowpipe,
and when heated with nitrate of cobalt becomes strongly coloured
blue.   It is scratched with the nail, and has a specific gravity of
2-564. Its composition is identical with the pholerite of Guil
lemin, also with the mineral forming the gangue of the diaspore
of Schemnitz.     It was decomposed with carbonate of soda. It
afforded—

    4. The proportions of the helices were approximately tested;
 though much remains unsettled yet upon this important point.
    5. The advantage of keeping up the magnetism in the axial bar
 was most satisfactorily tested.
    6. Various modes were tried of reversing the motion of the en
 gine, and with success.
    7. Various kinds of cut-off (which is the most critical and im
 portant point in the construction of the engine) were tried.
    8. The operation of closed circuits and secondary currents was
 tested by a number of experiments, requiring great care and ac
 curacy.
    9. The best working velocity of this engine, and its absolute
 power with a given battery, was fully tested.
    10. The ratio of the increase of power, with an increase in the
 quantity of the current.
    11. The values of different kinds of metal in forming the cut-off.
    12. Various mechanical points of construction, supposed to have
been incompatible with the exhibition of this power, were put to a
 practical test.
    Various other minor points also were the subject of experiment,
which will be communicated hereafter.
    A second model, of small size and somewhat rude construction,
 was also made, with a view of testing a new arrangement of the
axial bars.
    Experiments were then commenced upon a larger scale, with a
view to determine whether the same proportion of power could be
obtained from large as from small engines, this being the principal
question in view at the time of the grant of the appropriation.
    With a view to facilitate the construction of helices of large size,
a machine which had long been in contemplation was made at a
considerable expense. The work was done at the Navy Yard in a
creditable manner, and the machine performed its work well, turning
out entire helices of copper wire, of large size, from straight bars.
But before I had proceeded far, a discovery was made in reference
to the helix which rendered the machine useless, for the present at
least.
    A number of large helices were then constructed of various sizes,
and suitable bars of soft iron prepared, corresponding to the helices.
Hollow and solid bars were prepared, from two inches to eight
inches in diameter, and generally three feet in length.      Some bars
of four and five feet in length were also prepared. The bars were
all worked at the Navy Yard, and at a considerable expense, as they
were required to be of homogeneous metal, accurately turned and
bored.
   With these bars and helices a multitude of experiments were per
formed and recorded, and these were kept up day after day for
about two months.       My official duties as Examiner in the Patent
Office left me    only the evening of each day for operation; and,
under such   circumstances,  you will readily appreciate the difficulties
and disadvantages under which I have laboured.        My own zeal has

led me beyond my strength; but I have been richly rewarded by the .
most flattering results.
   The experiments here were not such as could be performed upon
the laboratory table; but were with large masses of iron, weigh
ing in some cases 300 pounds, and helices
                                       -    sometimes twice that
weight.
  Adhering to the     same size of battery through a long series of ex
periments, and varying the coils and bars, I found, to my great gra
tification, that as I increased the dimensions of each, a corresponding
increase of power was exhibited, and the consumption of material,
or cost of the power, in some proportion diminished.        These results
were encouraging and stimulating in the highest degree, and fully
justified the undertaking at once of an engine upon a much larger
scale than any hitherto tried.
    This engine, the framework of which was principally built at the
Navy Yard, was an upright engine of two-feet stroke; and in order
to have facilities for comparative trials and experiments, it was ne
cessary that a double engine should be made, the two parts exactly
corresponding. Two bars of soft iron, six inches diameter and three
feet in length, were the prime movers, and these were balanced by
means of connecting rods and cranks upon a fly-wheel shaft.           The
balance-wheel and shaft together weighed 600 pounds.                When
this engine was first tried, with the same battery which had before
given me one-fifth of a horse power, with a smaller engine, it pro
duced only one-third of a horse power.       By careful attention to the
adjustments, and particularly to the cut-off, which was a very dif
ferent thing now from what it had been in smaller engines, the en
gine soon yielded one-horse power.        Here was a gain of eighty per
cent. as measured merely by the size of the battery.           But it was
much more; for the cost was found to be less for one-horse power
than it had been before for one-fifth of a horse power in a smaller
engine; how much less has not yet been ascertained.
    A great variety of experiments were continued with this engine,
to be hereafter detailed, each having a definite object; and, I am
happy to say, each resulting advantageously; so that finally, by little
daily increments, I obtained from this engine, by a trifling addition
of battery, a full two-horse power.
    By way of giving a practical character to the engine, it was geared
to a circular saw ten inches in diameter, the turning lathe and grind
stone of the workshop, all of which it worked simultaneously, as
witnessed by a number of visitors, and, if I mistake not, by your
predecessor in office, in company with Lieut. Maury, of the Na
tional Observatory.
    After many satisfactory trials with this engine it was taken down,
and   all   its
             available parts usedin  the construction  of the single hori
zontal   engine  which I    had the honour  latelyto   exhibit before the
Smithsonian Institution. This change was made for the purpose         of
dispensing with the dead weight   of   oneof  the driving-bars, and more
particularly for introducing the important feature     of keeping up the
magnetism         of
                the  driving-bar.   As soon as  this new form was com

pleted and tried, a gain of one-half horse power was at once realized,
and by the addition of a few more feet of battery surface, the power
was found to be above four horse.        Further addition of battery
would still augment   the power,  and I see no reason why ten-horse
power might not be obtained from this engine by the addition of
more battery; but whether it would be oeconomical to increase
power by this means alone, and to ascertain the point, for this and
every other engine, beyond which ceconomy would cease, by                                                    in
creasing the battery alone, are matters to be determined by experi
Inent.
      The next most important point to                                   be determined was the expense
of this power. Much to my own surprise          and gratification, the expense
was found to be less than the most expensive steam engines; al
though recently, in Europe, it has been decided by experimenters
and men of science, and generally conceded, that it was fifty times
the cost of the dearest steam-engines.            It is still, however, consi
derably dearer than the cheaper sort of steam-engines; but this is
no obstacle to its introduction, considering             immense advantages      its
in  other respects. Moreover,            thus much has been done
                                                          if                the                        in

 a few pence, and of which various modifications may be adopted.
 And the application of this discovery will not only preserve him
 from the fire-damp, but enable him to apply it to use and to destroy
 it at the same time that it gives him a useful light." A month after
 the invention Sir Humphry informed the Society that his cylinder
 lamps had been used in two of the most dangerous mines near New
 castle with perfect success.
    “On the Meteorology of the Lake District of Cumberland and
 Westmoreland, with a continuation of the results of experiments
 on the fall of Rain at various heights, up to 3166 feet above the
 Sea-Level.”    By J. F. Miller, Esq., F.R.A.S. Communicated by
 Lieut.-Col. Sabine, R.A., For. Sec. R.S.
    In this communication are given the results of the observations of
 the quantity of rain which has fallen during the year 1849 at twenty
stations in the valleys, and six mountain stations, varying in altitude
 above the sea from 500 feet to 3166 feet.        There is also given a
table of the   temperature    at Seathwaite in Borrowdale during the
year 1849.
    With reference to the mountain gauges, the author observes that,
on the whole, the results are similar to those of the three preceding
years, but, as might be looked for in a dry year like the past, the
quantities of rain deposited at the various stations are more nearly
equal than usual. With respect to the temperature, he observes that
the statement he made in his last communication, that “the inhabit
ants of the Lake District valleys enjoyed a milder and more equable
climate than the residents in the open country, and particularly in
the winter months," is confirmed by the thermometrical results of
the present winter (1849–50).
    “On   the relation of the Air and Evaporation           Temperatures
to the    Temperature     of the    Dew-Point,   as determined by Mr.
Glaisher's   Hygrometrical     Tables founded on the factors deduced
from the Six-hourly observations made at the Royal Observatory,
Greenwich.” By       J.  F. Miller, Esq., F.R.A.S. Communicated by
Lieut.-Col.   Sabine,  R.A.,  For. Sec. R.S.
    After pointing out the importance of the hygrometer, both in a
scientific and a practical point of view, the author goes into the
question of the advantages and disadvantages attending the use of
Daniell's hygrometer, and the relative merits of this instrument
and the dry and wet-bulb thermometers.          Although satisfied of the
accuracy of Mr. Glaisher's Tables (founded on the Greenwich Ob
servations), which show at once the relation of the temperature of
evaporation to that of the dew-point, he was unwilling to abandon
the use of Daniell's apparatus for that of the wet and dry-bulb ther
mometers, slight as is the trouble of observing them, without personal
experience of the correctness of the tables from which the dew-point
was to be deduced.      He therefore instituted a series of perfectly com
parable observations by the two methods, and in this communication

                        Intelligence                 and Miscellaneous                   Articles.                      169
gives the results obtained from them during a period of twenty
months.    From a comparison of the dew-points determined by the
two methods, he concludes that the results show in a striking man
 ner the extreme accuracy of Mr. Glaisher's Tables, and afford ad
ditional testimony to the value of the Greenwich Hygrometrical
 Observations, and the resulting formula on which those tables are
founded.
   The author then refers to the subject of evaporation, and gives
the results of his own observations at Whitehaven during six years,
viz. from 1843 to 1848 inclusive.     From these he states that the
 mean annual amount of   evaporation  is 30-011 inches; and the mean
quantity of rain for the same period being 45.255 inches, the depth
of the water precipitated exceeds that taken up by evaporation, on
the coast in latitude 54°, by 15:244 inches.

be raised at pleasure.   By heating this stove to 300° C., and at the
same time passing a current of dry air deprived of carbonic acid, all
the water which the magnesite contained was removed with cer
tainty; but at the same time carbonic acid was disengaged, which
it was requisite to collect and estimate. For this purpose the cur
rent of air was directed, at its exit from the tube, into two vials con
taining perfectly transparent barytes water. The carbonate of barytes
collected at the conclusion of the drying was estimated in the state
of sulphate; and the quantity of carbonic acid, which the weight of
the sulphate represented, was added to that obtained by the follow

   The residue which remained in the tube, after being weighed, was
calcined at a strong red heat; the loss of weight indicated almost
the whole of the carbonic acid contained in the mineral; the cal

with the mercurial trough.    The tube is slightly heated, commencing
at the closed end. The    methyliac  gas displaced by the lime is dis
engaged plentifully, and is received in the jar filled with mercury.
The very simple apparatus described allows of very easy regulation
of the evolution of the gas, which is never mixed with much air, the
tube being almost entirely filled with the mixture.
   Thus prepared, methylamine is a non-permanent gas. At some
degrees below 0 C. it condenses into a very mobile liquid, which
does not solidify in a mixture of solid carbonic acid and aether.

of water. Its odour is strongly ammoniacal, and sometimes, when
it is not perfectly pure, the smell of stale fish may be detected with

XXIV.   On the Theory of Magnetic Induction in Crystalline and
  Non-crystalline Substances. By WILLIAM Thomson, Professor
  of Natural Philosophy in the University of Glasgowº.
Poiº          in his mathematical theory of magnetic induction,
      founded on the hypothesis of “magnetic fluids” moveable
within the infinitely small “magnetic elements” of which he
assumes magnetizable matter to be constituted, does not overlook
the possibility of these magnetic elements being non-spherical
and symmetrically arranged in crystalline matter; and he re
marks, that a finite spherical portion of such a substance would,
when in the neighbourhood of a magnet, act differently according
to the different positions into which it might be turned with                                            its
centre held fixed.     But “such       circumstance   a not having yet
been observedt,”

                         excludes the consideration       the structure         of

178         Prof. Thomson on                              the    Theory       of Magnetic Induction
out a mathematical theory of magnetic induction is obvious. On
the other hand, in the present state of science, no theory founded
on Poisson’s hypothesis of “two magnetic fluids” moveable in
the “magnetic elements * could be satisfactory, as it is generally
admitted that the truth of any such hypothesis is extremely
improbable.     Hence it is at present desirable that a com
plete theory of magnetic induction in crystalline or non-crystal
line matter should be established independently of any hypo
thesis of magnetic fluids, and, if possible, upon a purely experi
mental foundation. With this object, I have endeavoured to
detach the hypothesis of magnetic fluids from Poisson’s theory,
and to substitute elementary principles deducible from it as the
foundation of a mathematical theory identical with Poisson’s in
 all substantial conclusions.         the present communication     In
shall state these   principles, and point out what modifications                                                              of I

    1. The determination of the conditions of magnetic induction
in a body of any kind in any circumstances may be made to
depend on a knowledge of the state of magnetization induced in
a homogeneous sphere of the same substance, placed in a uniform
field of magnetic force.
   2. A homogeneous sphere of any substance placed in a uniform
field of force becomes uniformly magnetized in parallel lines with
an intensity which is independent of the radius of the sphere.

      Mr. Boole, in noticing the interpretation of the former of these
    expressions            (Phil. Mag. vol. xxxiii. p. 279), observes that                                          a   qua
    ternion w:i-iv-Hjy--kz, whose constituents do not satisfy the
    condition w”--a”--y”--2*=1, is not directly interpretable in
    geometry.       This, however, is certainly not true with reference
    to interpretation by means of the rotation of lines; for in that
    case the quaternion aq (where q does satisfy the above condition,
    and a is a numerical coefficient) represents (as I have shown) the
    rotation of a radius vector, combined with an alteration of                                                              its

   In the   negative wave    of translation, which is generated by the
abstraction of a quantity of water from the Channel, and which
is a hollow instead of a swell, the translation of the particles is
in the direction contrary to the motion of the wave. Hence the
crest of the wave moves, during the vertical oscillation of a

      EN   years ago Lenz and Jacobi of St. Petersburg published
        their celebrated investigation on the action of electro
magnets.     The thoroughness of that investigation seemed to
leave little hope that future experimenters could add anything to
its results, and this consideration appears    have repelled phyto
sicists from engaging      the further working
                                 in                  what might       of                         be

way where the head of the nail joined the stronger magnet. In
1848, M. Dub of Berlin instituted an inquiry into the lift
ing power of electro-magnets with reference to the form of the
attracted mass.  This inquiry proves that the term “lifting
power” can convey no definite idea, inasmuch as a mere change
of form in the mass attracted will cause the energy with which
the magnet grasps it to vary between the limits of 1 and 10, or
perhaps between even wider limits.
   The apparatus used by Dub was a steelyard, from one end of
which a bar of soft iron “submagnet.*” was suspended vertically,
a weight being moved along the opposite arm until the bar was
torn from the magnet underneath.       As early as 1833, Dal Negro
had asserted that the attraction of the magnet increased with
the weight of the submagnet; the first query which Dub applied
himself to was, to ascertain whether, when the mass of the latter
remains constant, the attraction remains constant also.   Ten cylin
drical bars were chosen,         the same  weight, butall

202         Dr. Tyndall on the Progress of the Physical Sciences:
excited.  But the quantity that remained was very small; so
small, indeed, that the magnetic needle, which was placed 600
millims. distant, deviated under the influence of this remaining
magnetism from the magnetic meridian scarcely one-tenth of a
degree.
     The following are the dimensions of our iron cylinders:—
         No.   1.    108 millims. long and 55 millims, diameter.
         No. 2.      131         ---       38        ---
         No. 3.      131         ---       19        ---
         No. 4.      200         ---        9        ---
   The spiral which belonged to No. 1 was 86 millims. in length,
and consisted of 90 windings; 8 windings found space on every
10 millims.   The thickness of the wire was 4 millims.
   For Nos. 2, 3 and 4, a spiral 110 millims. long and of 560
windings was used.     In this case, therefore, we have about 43
windings to every 10 millims. of the core. The thickness of the
wire was 2 millims.
  The tangent instrument had two rings. According as the
greater or the less was used, the tangent of the angle which the
current caused the needle to make with the magnetic meridian
must be multiplied by 31-62, or by 63:24, to reduce it to the
unit chosen by Müller.
   Finally, to reduce the magnetizing force to the same unit, the
force of the current must be multiplied by 8 or by 43, according
as the bar No. 1, or one of the three remaining bars, was used.
   A glance at the following table will show that the magnetizing
forces used by us, not only far exceed those of Müller in absolute
value, but that they were also more widely varied.    Our weakest
stream was 3.3, our strongest 231-6.
   The letters at the head of the table have the following signi
fications:—
     $  expresses the angle which the tangent needle, when acted
          upon by the stream, makes with the magnetic meridian.

which the experiments have been made.
   The writers support this conjecture by a number of experi
ments made with defective iron and unhardened steel, wherewith
they are able to produce divergences quite similar to those ob
served by Müller.   The latter, however, retorts that his cylinders
were made of the best possible iron; and that the reason why
Buff and Zamminer’s results differ from his     that their greatest       is,
galvanic power was applied     their thick cores,  tocomparatively                  a

 motion in    a fluid,  I now proceed to discuss the equations for the
 general case, and maintain their accuracy on the following grounds
 in addition to the theoretical reasons given above:-first, the ordi
 nary expressions which are deduced from the old theory, and
 admitted as accurate, arise on proper considerations from my
equations; and secondly, the properties of diverging streams of
fluid and of vibratory motion, which could not be deduced from
them, arise almost as simply as the others from my general
formulae.
    It  is almost with regret that one sees the beautiful deductions
from the equation of continuity to be unnecessary; and had      I
formerly thought that the ordinary equations required only the
                                                  -
substitution of an equation of form in place of the equation of con
tinuity, which would have expressed the tendency in the atoms
to resume the cubical arrangement after a displacement, in virtue
of their mutual repulsions. No such equation would, however,
render the theory correct in passing from the ordinary equations
of equilibrium to those of motion. As far as the equilibrium of
fluids is concerned, there is no need to refer to their intimate con
stitution, although with more complexity the same results might
be obtained by considering the mutual pressures of the atoms.
    In hydrodynamics, however, we must commence with the cir
cumstances of the motion of the most elementary portion which
is capable of separate motion, or with those of an ultimate atom.
The mathematical expression for fluids in a state of equilibrium
not being based on atomic considerations, the equations of fluid
motion cannot be derived from them; but an especial application
of D'Alembert’s principle must be made, and then the principle
of virtual velocities becomes available.

      Proposition.
                 To apply the expressions to the case of a diverging
stream of air in Roberts's eageriment (often called M. Clement's
experiment).
   This interesting case of a diverging stream of elastic fluid is
discussed experimentally, and a popular explanation of the cause
of the results given in a paper in the fifth volume of the new
series of the Transactions of the Manchester Literary and Phi
losophical Society, by Mr. Hopkins.
   Mr. Hopkins shows that the rarefaction is a consequence of
the first law of motion, by which every particle of                                           air

   The following process for purifying the above crude product
was, after numerous and very tedious experiments, considered
the best.                         -

alcohol of 75 per cent. by continued boiling, and the solu

mained upon the filter. The solution was                          very intense of       a
green colour, and gelatinized with great consistency when cooled.

was capable          being cut with
                      of                    blunt knife without yielding.

   1. In cold water.—A quantity of apiine was dissolved in boil
ing distilled water, and the solution allowed to cool to about 60°F.
and filtered.   98 grims. of the filtrate were evaporated in a pla
tima basin, and the residue dried in the water-bath; there re
mained 0-012 grim. after deducting the ash. Therefore 100 parts
of water at 60° dissolve 0.0122 parts of apiine, which is equivalent
to 8500 times       weight     its

    0.346 grim. of pure apine was dried in a water-bath until no
 further loss of weight was observed. It then weighed 0.332 grm.,
 giving a loss of 0.014 grim.         It was now exposed to the air for
 several  hours,   when it was found to have regained                  original                 its

   1. Effect of long boiling with water.
   About 0.3 grm. of apiine was dissolved in 4 or 5 oz. of hot
water, and the solution was kept boiling during about six hours,
the solution being made up with water from time to time as it
evaporated.   The product, when carefully brought to dryness in
a water-bath, was of a much darker colour than the pure apine,
being of a light olive-brown tint; otherwise, it did not appear to
be much altered, although the gelatinizing power was perhaps
not so great.
   A combustion of this substance gave the following results:—

   Three different portions of apiine were converted into this
substance    at different times and under varied circumstances.
The mode of operation in each case was nearly as follows:—
   From 0.5 to 1 grim. of apiine was boiled from two to five hours
with several ounces of a mixture of one part sulphuric acid, and
from ten to twenty parts of water, the bulk being occasionally
made up with water.       The solution was then poured into cold
water, on which a precipitate formed of a yellow colour.            This
was collected on a filter, and washed perfectly tasteless with cold
water, during which the yellow tint disappeared, and it assumed
what may be called a dirty-white colour. The filter and             con                                    its

has no connexion with the water-carbon series.
   An attempt was made to prove that grape-sugar was formed
during the action just described, but without success, or at least
the indications were so imperfect that no reliance whatever could
be placed in them.       The sulphate of copper test could not in
this case be   employed,   since apiine itself acts like grape-sugar
in reducing the oxide of copper to suboxide.

acid, a large quantity of water added, and the whole boiled for
some time. The solution was poured into cold water, and the
curdy precipitate which formed collected on a filter, washed

 appearance and in            its

   5 Action of peroxide of manganese and dilute sulphuric acid.
   Pure apine was heated in a small distilling apparatus with
peroxide of manganese and dilute sulphuric acid.      A liquid and
a gas   were the products.
   The gas was conducted through lime-water, on which a tur
bidness instantly ensued, showing the presence of carbonic acid.
   The liquid which distilled over was clear and transparent, and
had the odour of formic acid.     Its reaction was intensely acid.
Mixed with solution of nitrate of silver and gently warmed, the
oxide of silver was immediately reduced, a small quantity of gas

        same time escaping, indicating the presence of formic
      portion of the liquid was mixed with excess of oxide of lead,
and  digested for some time, after which the reaction of the clear
liquid was decidedly and powerfully alkaline, showing the for
mation of a basic salt of lead, and being a probable indication of
acetic acid. To render this more certain, a portion of the liquid
was taken, in which the formic acid was completely decomposed
by peroxide of mercury: it was then filtered, and the filtrate
mixed with sulphuric acid and alcohol and boiled, when the
characteristic odour of acetic aether was strongly manifested,
proving beyond a doubt the presence of acetic acid.
   In explanation of the decomposition, the following formula
may be given:—

   6. Action of chlorine on a solution of apiine.
   Chlorine gas was passed into a hot solution of apiine in water:
a precipitate fell. When this was collected, washed and dried,
and heated on a knife, the odour of hydrochloric acid was per
ceptible. Boiled with water some gas seemed to be evolved,
which was not chlorine; perhaps it was oxygen.
   Possibly this may be a feeble combination of apiine with chlo
rine, resembling the iodide and bromide of starch, which boiled
with water decomposes          it,
                            forming hydrochloric acid and libera
ting oxygen. Braconnot mentions this substance, and states that
picric acid   formed during

                VIII.          Compound with hydrochloric                     acid?
     As apiine when dissolved in hydrochloric acid and precipitated
by being thrown into cold water acquires a yellow colour, we
thought it probable that a combination was formed which was
decomposed by washing with water.
   There not being any definite compound of apine with a base
                of its                                                a be

considered     the  highest importance   that     combination with
hydrochloric acid should,      possible,    if

                             experiments   were   interesting, they

                                                  in          bright                   ofa
golden yellow colour, just like when the solution        strong hy                in
drochloric acid was poured into cold water.       Two experiments
gave the following results:—
  I.  0.4030 grim. absorbed 0.0206 grim. hydrochloric acid,                                        or

   It also appears that the mean of Mr. Glaisher's 24-hour cor
rections, instead of being zero, is a variable quantity.  For if
hourly observations be made and the mean taken, this would give
the mean daily temperature; but if the former were corrected
singly, there would result a mean daily temperature differing
from the other by the last line in my results. The diurnal for

   This result shows that the value of s does not change in pass
ing from one point to another of a given surface of displacement
at a given time.     Hence if A and B be any two points, either at
a finite, or indefinitely small distance from each other, on one of
a series of surfaces of displacement of which the liness are ortho
gonal trajectories, then the trajectories terminating at A and B
are equal to each other.     So also the parts of the same two tra
jectories terminating at the points a and b of another surface of
displacement are equal to each other.        Consequently the parts
Aa and Bb between the two surfaces are equal.       Now this cannot
be the case for any two points A and B unless the surfaces be
parallel and the trajectories be rectilinear.     Consequently the
liness drawn in the direction of the motion are at each instant
rectilinear.
  We have thus arrived at a particular circumstance       of the
motion by assuming ude--vdy-H was to be integrable indepen
dently of the nature of the disturbance. But the circumstances
of the motion, which are independent of the disturbance, relate
to the mode of action of the parts of the fluid on each other.
We may therefore conclude, that the parts of the fluid act upon
each other in such a manner that the orthogonal trajectories of
the surfaces of displacement are either instantaneously or per
manently straight lines, if that action be such as to satisfy the
condition of making ude--wdy + wilz integrable.   But we have no
right to say that the mutual action of the parts of the fluid on
each other always satisfies that condition.
   To carry on the investigation of the law of the motion, so far
as the motion is independent of the nature of the disturbance, it
will next be required to solve the following problem.
   Proposition VIII. To obtain a general equation which shall
express at once that the motion is consistent with the principle
of constancy of mass, and that the directions of motion are nor
mals to continuous surfaces.
   This may be done in two ways; either by independent ele
mentary considerations, or by means of the formulae already ob
tained, which, being perfectly general, ought to suffice for this
purpose.    For the sake of illustration       I
                                             shall first make use of
the former method.
   Conceive two surfaces of displacement to be drawn at a given
instant indefinitely near each other, and so that one of them
passes through a point P given in position.         On this surface
describe an   indefinitely  small  rectangular area having P at    its
centre, and having   its sides    planes

  It  may be remarked, that this equation rests on the principle
of constancy of mass, and on the axiom that the directions of
motion are normals to continuous surfaces; but on account of
the disappearance of a and 8 in the investigation, it does not
involve the same consideration of continuity as that which con
ducted to equation (3.).
   The other mode of investigating equation (7.) is given by
Professor Tardy in the Number of the Philosophical Magazine
for March 1850, p. 173. It will only be necessary to exhibit
here so much of the process as will convey an idea of the prin

 the impressions at the vertical boundaries of the fluid being given.
 Or, it may be conceived to move between a series of such sur
faces; in which case, if the pressures at opposite points of the
 separating surfaces be made equal by properly adjusting the
 disturbances, the surfaces may be removed without affecting the
 motion; and we shall thus have the case of a mass of fluid, im
 pressed in a known manner so that the resulting motion at any
point is given by the equations ui-mar, v=-my.
     In the next communication I propose to apply to compressible
fluids considerations analogous to those which have here been
 given to incompressible.

                             [To be continued.]
    The Article by Professor Stokes in the last Number of the
Philosophical Magazine requires from me a few words of no
tice.     I am quite willing to enter upon a discussion of any of
the new principles or propositions in hydrodynamics of which I
am the author, and I approve of the course which Professor Stokes
proposes to adopt, viz. to notice one important point only at a
time, and to discontinue the discussion if it be found impossible
to agree on a question of vital importance.
    Before proceeding to the consideration of the two arguments
                                           I
directed against my second axiom, must correct a misappre
hension into which Professor Stokes has fallen, probably from
want of explicitness on my part, with respect to the remark I
made after enunciating the axiom.           The remark is unimportant,
and forms no part of my argument.             I meant to say, that a col
lection of indefinitely small discrete atoms may move so that the
lines of motion at a given point of space may intersect each other
at finite angles of inclination, and at the same time the equation
of constancy of mass be satisfied, but that the condition expressed
by the axiom excludes such motion.           It was not my intention to
assert, that in cases to which the axiom did not apply, the mo
tion could only belong to a set of discrete atoms.

   The “first argument” is merely a particular instance of the
second, and does not require to be considered separately.
   The following is the “second argument.”       the axiom that                              If

is divided          by
               the anterior columns into two distinct horns, which

rection, transverse and longitudinal.    Of the transverse, there are
two orders, the antero-posterior and latero-transverse.
   The antero-posterior are continuous with the posterior roots     the                            of
nerves, and probably with the anterior roots. The latero-transverse
stretch between the opposite sides                       of

blance to the sympathetic fibres or caudate processes. These fibres
are found through the rest of the gray substance, but in smaller
numbers; immediately below the gelatinous substance, however,
they form a remarkably dense band.
   Changes in the form of the gray substance are observed on ex
amining the cord from below upwards.              The posterior mass is gra
dually divided into two, and the gelatinous substance is interrupted
in the middle line. Two vesicular masses gradually appear at the
sides of the spinal canal, traversed by fibres from the posterior
nerves, and from the transverse commissure. The anterior horns
also undergo certain changes, become club-shaped in the lumbar
region, and contain large groups of caudate vesicles. In the middle
of the dorsal region the posterior horns have again coalesced, and
the gelatinous substance again crosses the middle line.                The ante
rior horns are straight and narrow, and their vesicles are scattered
through them irregularly. In the cervical enlargement the posterior
gray substance has become again divided to                 greatest extent intoits
two  horns,   and the   gelatinous    substance      again   interrupted is   the                  in

    A  paper was read, entitled, “On the Action of Nitric Acid on
various Vegetables, with a more particular examination of Spartium
scoparium, Linn., or Common Broom.”            By John Stenhouse, Esq.,
F.R.S. Received November 18, 1850.
    This paper is a continuation of a series of investigations intended
to elucidate the nature of vegetables by means of chemical reagents.
A preceding paper contained an account of the effects produced
by the action of sulphuric and hydrochloric acids on the matière
incrustante of several plants belonging to different great classes of
vegetables. The effects of nitric acid upon a variety of vegetable
groups are now described; the researches having been undertaken
in the hope that by means of this powerful reagent some light might
perhaps be thrown on peculiarities in their respective constitutions.
     The first plant experimented on with this view, was the Populus
balsamifera, as representing the numerous family of the Poplars. A
quantity of the smaller branches of this tree, cut into pieces, was
exhausted with boiling water. The dark-coloured bitter-tasted liquid
which it yielded was evaporated to the state of an extract, which
was digested for nearly twenty-four hours with dilute nitric acid.
 This strongly acid solution was evaporated to dryness on the water
 bath, the dried residue was dissolved in a considerable quantity of
 hot water, and the solution after cooling was carefully filtered. The
 clear liquid, after concentration to a very moderate bulk, was exactly
 saturated with carbonate of potash.       A yellow crystalline sediment
 quickly appeared. It consisted of nitropicrate of potash, and the
 potash salt of a new acid, to which the author has given the name of
 nitropopulic acid.     The mixed potash salts were then collected on a
 filter, dried by pressure, and were treated with a cold solution of
 dilute carbonate of potash, which readily dissolved out the nitro
 populate of potash, while it left the nitropicrate of that base unacted
 on. The two salts were then separated by filtration, the nitropi
 crate remaining on the filter, while the nitropopulate was dissolved
 in the alkaline liquid. The solution was next slightly supersaturated
 with hydrochloric acid, when the nitropopulate of potash precipi
 tated as a compact crystalline powder, which was purified by re
 peated crystallizations out of hot water.        When pure, the potash
 salt, which crystallizes in small lemon-yellow prisms, is boiled with
 a considerable excess of hydrochloric acid, and, on the cooling of
 the solution, the nitropopulic acid is deposited in silky needles,

   The principal aim of the present communication was to point out
the proportion of the vertebrate animals in which the metapophysis,
anapophysis and hypapophysis were present, their principal modifica
tions, and their title to the distinct appellations bestowed upon them.
   The metapophysis is noticed by Monro, in 1726, as a small rising
between the roots of the superior oblique and transverse processes;
and both this and the anapophysis appear to be defined in similar
terms, as sometimes characterising the lumbar vertebrae, by Soem
mering.    The author of the present paper commences his compara
tive anatomy  of both processes by describing them in the European,
Polynesian and Australian varieties of the human race.           He then
passes to the Quadrumana,      and traces their modifications and pro
 gressive development in the Chimpanzee, Orang-utan and Gibbon,
 in the Cercopithecus ruber, Semnopithecus entellus, Macacus rhesus,
 Macacus niger, Macacus nemestrinus, Papio mormon, Ateles panis
cus, Ateles Beelzebuth, Cebus capucinus, Callithrix sciureus, Lemur
nigrifrons, Lemur Catta, Lichanotus Indri, and Stenops gracilis.
    In the order Carnivora, the same processes are described in the
Lion, Hyaena, Wolf, Fox, Civet, Genette, Otter, Sable, Kinkajou,
Mydaus, Badger, Bear and Seal. The presence of anterior articular
processes (pre-zygapophyses) is demonstrated in         these Carnivora,   all
in the anterior dorsal  vertebra;  and their apparently  greater produc
tion  in the succeeding  vertebrae    shown         due is   the gradual
                                                                 to   be           to

transference of their articular surfaces upon the metapophyses, which
are processes distinctly superadded.
   In the Rodent Order, the modifications of the metapophyses and
anapophyses are described in the common and Malabar Squirrels,
the Marmot, the Hydromys, the Rat, the Cape Jerboa, in which the
anapophyses attain their maximum of relative size; in the Beaver,
the Porcupine, the Coypu, the Paca, the Capybara, and in the Hare.
The distinction between the metapophyses and the pre-zygapophyses
is particularly strongly marked in the Capybara.
   In the Insectivora, the Hedgehog is an instance in which metapo
physes are developed but not anapophyses. The modifications of
both processes are traced, in the Marsupial Order, in the Thylacine,
the Dasyure, the Wombat, the Perameles, and in two species of
Kangaroo. The diapophyses being developed from the last as well
as the antecedent dorsals in these marsupials, renders the homology
of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae unmistakeable :
but the diapophyses of those vertebrae are lengthened out by anchy
losed pleurapophyses, of which those of the first lumbar vertebra in
the Wombat, compared by the author, had not completely coalesced.
In the Ornithorhynchus paradorus the metapophyses are double in
some of the anterior dorsal vertebrae, but become single in the sixth
dorsal, and gradually increase to the twelfth. The anapophyses are
rudimental.
   In the Ruminant Order, the accessory processes are described in
the Elk, the Giraffe, the Gnu, the Equine Antilope, the Ox, the
Aurochs, the Camel, the Vicugna, the Memmina, and the Musk-deer.
The anapophyses are rarely, and then only very feebly developed;
the metapophyses are constant; they appear as tubercles above the
diapophyses in the anterior and middle dorsals, and pass upon the
zygapophyses in the penultimate or last dorsal. The author records
a peculiarity in the skeleton of a musk-deer (Moschus moschiferus).
In the pair of ribs attached to the thirteenth dorsal vertebra the
tubercle is wanting, and the diapophysis is obsolete, as in the last
dorsal vertebra of other Moschidae; but in the following vertebra,
answering to the first lumbar in other Moschida, the rib is developed
with a head and a distinct tubercle, articulated to an equally distinct
diapophysis.    This plainly demonstrates the homology of the diapo
physis in the next vertebra, answering to the second lumbar in
other Moschidae.
   There are no anapophyses in the Hog-tribe and Hippopotamus :
the metapophyses resemble those of the ruminant artiodactyles.
 The perissodactyle Ungulates manifest some peculiarities.      In the
 Sumatran Tapir, e.g. the metapophysis is a very distinct process in
 the third dorsal, subsides in the four next dorsals, and reappears as
 a prominent process in those that follow, but does not attain the
 position upon the zygapophysis except in the last lumbar vertebrae.
 In the Horse and Rhinoceros, as well as the Tapir, although there
 are no proper anapophyses, the diapophysis of the last lumbar de
 velopes an articular surface on  itsback part which articulates with
a  corresponding surface   on   the sacrum.   In the vertebrae  of  the

Elephant a peculiarity is pointed out which is not adverted to by
Cuvier or De Blainville, and appears to have escaped notice, viz. an
accessory pair of joints between the metapophysis and anapophysis,
commencing between the seventeenth and eighteenth dorsals, and
continued to between the first and second lumbar vertebrae.     The
metapophyses have been undescribed, also, in the Cetacea, although
they are represented in the plates of the ‘Ossemens Fossiles'                        di
stinctly from the anterior zygapophyses, and exist in many vertebrae
after these processes with their articular surfaces have wholly dis
appeared: the modifications of the metapophyses, and their mode
and place of superseding the prezygapophyses, are described in the
Delphinus Tursio and D. Delphis : their modifications are also
pointed out in the Dugong.           But the most remarkable development
and complexity of the accessory exogenous processes is presented
by certain members of the Order Bruta or Edentata of Cuvier.
The author commences with a description of them in the Sloths,
and gives his reasons for considering the length of the neck in the
three-toed species to be due to the superaddition of two cervicals
 between the dentata and eighth vertebra, which, from certain cha
racters of    itscomplex transverse process,          regards   hehomologous
                                                                           as
with the sixth cervical vertebra                  of
                                          the two-toed species.
     Inthe Cape Ant-eater (Orycteropus capensis), both metapophyses
and anapophyses are present                      on
                                          the eighth dorsal vertebra; the
                                                  the tail, the latter subside

in  the last lumbar.          the armadillos the metapophyses commence
abruptly about the middle                   of
                                      the back, and progressively increase
until  they  equal  the  long   neural spines    height: they develope two

                                                       their base, another on
the outer side the latter articulates with the anapophysis, which
                   :                                                                 is
remarkable for          its
                      thickness, and developes second inferior articular

surface for the     parapophysis,     which, together with the diapophysis,
is  developed from             all
                           the lumbar vertebrae.        These complex joints
are illustrated         by
                      drawings     taken from two    species           of

 tions of the author, illustrated by a comparison with those of the
 Serpent tribe, he next enters upon the question of the precise nature
 and extent of this analogy, and shows that, although the complex
joints in both are comparable to the tenon-and-mortice joints in
 carpentry, they are produced by different processes in the Mammal
 and the Reptile.    The zygapophyses exist in both ; to these, in the
 Mammal, are superadded the joints developed on metapophyses and
 anapophyses, which are below the zygapophyses; but in the Serpents,
 the superadded joints are on parts which the author terms the ‘zygo
 sphene' and ‘zygantrum,' and are above the zygapophyses.            Some
 characteristic differences are next pointed out in the Ophidian ge
 nera Coluber, Hydrus, Naja, Crotalus, Python, and the extinct
 genus of large serpents from British eocene strata called Palaeophis.
 The author also points out that the tenon-and-mortice joints are not,
 as was supposed, peculiar to the Ophidian reptiles, but exist in the
 Iguana, where they are likewise due to the superaddition of zygo
 sphenal and zygantral articulations.
    The author finally enters upon the comparative anatomy of the
 ‘hypapophysis,' that name being applied to the process, commonly
 exogenous, from the under or ventral surface of the centrum, rarely
 autogenous from the same aspect of the capsule of the notochord.
 The modifications of the hypapophysis are exemplified in the Hare
 and Rabbit, the Cape Jerboa, the Hydromys, the Phoca graenlandica
 and Leptonya serridens, in the Hippopotamus, the Megaceros, the
 Musk-deer, the Camel, the Giraffe, and other Ruminants.            In the
  Ornithorhynchus the atlas is remarkable for a pair of hypapophyses,
 like the first vertebra in the Sudis or Arapaima gigas: but the most
 remarkable instances of the development and modification of the
 hypapophysis are to be met with in the class of Birds. It is there
 well-marked in the anterior cervical vertebrae, especially in the den
 tata, and reappears in the lower cervicals as a pair of processes, which
 defend and sometimes encompass the carotid arteries, forming a
 quasi-haemal arch, as in the Pelican.     The still more extraordinary
 developments of the hypapophysis in the Aptenodytes and Sphaenis
 cus are specially described and illustrated by figures.      The modifi
 cations of the same process are pointed out in some extinct Reptilia,
 as e.g. the Crocodilus basifissus, the Mososaurus, the Iguanodon and
 the Ichthyosaurus: in the latter the hypapophysis is exogenous in
 the neck, as in some Lizards, and forms the so-called ‘wedge-bones:"
 the part usually called “body of the atlas' is serially homologous
 with these; the true centrum of that vertebra being the so-called
 odontoid process.     The memoir concludes with a demonstration of
 the serial homology of the hamal arches of the tail, sometimes called
 chevron-bones, and the essential distinction of the hypapophyses from
 the haemapophyses, and at the same time from the parapophyses, with
 which the hypapophyses co-exist in the cervical and anterior thoracic
 regions of the Crocodile.

     “On the Results of Periodical Observations of the Positions
and Distances of Nineteen of the Stars in Sir John Herschel's Lists
of Stars favourably situated for the investigation of Parallax con
tained in Part III. of the Phil. Trans. for 1826, and in Part I. for
1827.”   By Lord Wrottesley, F.R.S. &c. Received November 14,
1850.
     In Sir John Herschel's papers above referred to, he shows that if
a double star occupy a certain position with respect to the ecliptic,
and one of the components be supposed to be very much nearer to
the earth than the others, a considerable periodical and parallactic
change will take place in their angle of position, and that the maxi
mum variations from the mean position will occur at two opposite
seasons of the year, which indicate the best times of observation of
the parallax of the star.    Sir John gives a list of stars thus favour
ably situated, with the coefficients of the maximum parallactic varia
tion of the angles of position, and the times of their occurrence
subjoined.
   Lord Wrottesley having erected at his seat in Staffordshire an
observatory provided with a good equatorial, determined to devote
the instrument to a good trial of the method, and the present paper -
contains the results of his observations and researches.
   The equatorial employed was that formerly belonging to Mr.
Beaumont.       Its
                  telescope        is   of
                                     feet  inches focal length, and the

size. The instrument         mounted according

10 inches square in the middle, having pivots at the ends of hard
bell-metal.      The Y" above and below are attached to massive stone
piers, supported by a very firm and large foundation of brick-work.
The steadiness of the instrument is not satisfactory, compared with
that of some recently-established equatorials. The observations were
made with a parallel-wire micrometer, containing one fixed and two
moveable wires, and the value of                        its
                                                 scale was well determined both
by Mr. Beaumont and Lord Wrottesley.                      The power usually em
ployed was 450.
   In   the progress          of
                              the observations         was found that they were

      In addition to this general notice there is nothing stated; the sub
ject, however, has now assumed such importance, that minute and
careful descriptions are desirable.    It is important to know the di
rection of the striae with reference, both to the points of the compass,
 and the bedding of the rock; whether they are parallel at remote
points, or divergent; and whether they coincide with or are trans
 verse to, the course of the valleys, and the great dominant faults.
The localities mentioned by Dr. Buckland are not embraced in my
paper; they were not known either to Mr. Wakefield or myself.
That of Fox Howe garden is of great interest owing to            peculiar                                   its

   Boracic acid cannot be estimated in the state of aqueous solution,
by a method similar to that employed for arsenic and phosphoric
acids; that is to say, by adding to the solution a weighed quantity
of oxide of lead recently calcined, evaporating the whole, and heating
the dried mass to redness. In fact, it is not possible to prevent the
volatilization of the boracic acid by adding oxide of lead. The same
happens when a solution of nitrate of lead is added instead of the
oxide.
     Even when              a   weighed quantity of tribasic phosphate of soda (3NaO
PO') is added, no quantitative result is obtained; for this salt does
not   possess the property of preventing the volatilization of boracic
 acid from            its
                  aqueous solutions.

    The best and most certain method of separating boracic acid from
bases, is that well known, of converting, by means of hydrofluoric
and sulphuric acids, the boracic acid into fluoride of boron, in order
to obtain the bases in the state of sulphates.                 By treating the bo
racic salt with     sulphuric   acid and    alcohol,    the boracic acid may like
wise be    completely    separated     in the form of boracic aether.
    This method is much inferior to that in which hydrofluoric acid is
employed to effect the decomposition, and ought not to be employed,
except when, for want of a platina retort, concentrated hydrofluoric
acid is not obtainable.              instead                If,

                XXXVI. On the Laws of Magnetism.
               By John TYNDALL, Ph.D., Marburg+.
                                   § 1.
           subject  of the present memoir is embraced by the   fol
THElowing        four propositions:—
    1. To determine the general relation between the strength of an
electro-magnet and the mutual attraction of the magnet and a mass
of soft iron, when both are in contact.
    2. To determine the said relation when the magnet and the mass
of soft iron are separated by a fived distance.
    3. A constant force being applied to the mass of soft iron in a
direction opposed to the pull of the magnet, to determine the con
ditions of equilibrium between this force and magnetism when the
distance between the magnet and the mass varies.
   4. To determine the general relation between force and distance,
that is to say, the law according to which the magnetic attraction
decreases when the distance is increased.
    The first of these propositions has engaged the attention of
i.
physicists from time to time during a considerable number of
          Experiments have been made and facts multiplied, which,
 however, are so disunited and contradictory as to render any
attempt to reduce them to a common law altogether hopeless.
    The most important experiments which have been made in
connexion with this subject are those of Lenz and Jacobi.       By
these experiments it was established, that the attraction between
two electro-magnets, or an electro-magnet and a mass of soft
iron, is proportional to the square of the magnetizing streamt.
Here, however, an interval of about ºth of an inch separated

 the attracted mass from the magnet.           The importance of this
 condition  appears  to have been overlooked by the discoverers of
 the law. It has been generally assumed, that if the defects inci
 dental to the modes of experiment hitherto adopted could be
 avoided, the same law would pronounce itself in the case of im
 mediate contact.    Were this the case, our two first propositions
 would be identical, the solution of the one would necessarily
 imply the solution of the other; it will be shown, however, that
the laws in both cases are entirely different.
   Two principal causes are assigned by physicists as giving birth
to the discrepancies alluded to—the incompleteness of contact,
and the peculiar shape of the mass of iron attracted. The question
naturally occurs, cannot these causes of divergence be removed ?
    1. To annul, as far as possible, the disturbances arising from
mere form, a number of regularly-shaped masses of good soft
iron were procured; they included cubes, cylinders, and spheres
of various diameters.     It is easy to see the practical difficulty of
experimenting with cubes and cylinders; indeed, to render such
experiments pure, conditions are required which it is almost im
possible to fulfill.    Conceive the cube suspended by a wire
attached to the middle of one of                      its
                                          faces, and laid with      op                              its
                                                                                           to let

                                                                        let be

                                be          necessary that

below by a crosspiece of iron.   Round the cylinders were coiled
360 feet of copper wire weighing nine pounds, and upon the top
of the cylinders two finely polished parallelopipeds of iron were
laid, between which the crystal was suspended.     In the present
case the crosspiece was removed, and the two cylinders were
tightly screwed together—an arrangement provided for in their
construction—and thus converted into a single powerful magnet,
9 inches long, 1.3 inch thick, surrounded by a helix containing
360 feet of copper wire.     The magnet was made fast in a block of
wood, and            set
                 vertically upright under one end                                            of

the experiments, the weight         the ball and      of

upon one        of    its
                  polished faces, and the sphere         soft iron always                of

 the poles    the battery two long bands
               of                              sheet copper ran side     of                                      by
 side, and passed thus under the door into the room which con
 tained the magnet.      After passing the door, they diverged; one
went    the magnet, and the other
          to                         the galvanometer     tangents,

needle coinciding with the centre of the ring.    The instrument
was so placed  that the plane of the ring was parallel to the mag
netic meridian; or, in other words, so that needle and ring were
in the same plane. When a current was sent round the latter,
the needle was deflected to the right or to the left, according to
the direction of the current, until a position of equilibrium be
tween the action of the latter and the earth's magnetism was
attained.   The angle which the needle then made with the mag
netic meridian could be read off on the graduated circumference
of the box, and it is easy to demonstrate that the tangent of this
angle is directly proportional to the intensity of the current. To
protect the needle from local disturbance by the stream, it was
so arranged that the copper bands to and from the instrument
ran close side by side, and thus annulled each other's action.
The current thus proceeded from the battery to one leg of the
tangent galvanometer, up this leg, round the ring, acting on the
needle in       its
              passage, down the other leg, thence      the magnet,               to

which was placed upon the same bench with the magnet.                 The

                              stonea cylinder   capable    being   turned       of

     5.   The following the method which was first pursued
                           is                                   the                             in
experiments,  and          in is
                        substance the same    that usually adopted    as
in  cases    this nature:–The iron ball being balanced
                of                                              the                             in
manner before described,     current was sent round the magnet;

scale-pan until the ball was torn away, the weight necessary                                         to

               Dr. Tyndall on    the Laws  of Magnetism.         269
effect this being taken as the equivalent of the attracting force.
Although every precaution was taken to secure accuracy, the
results thus obtained were not so satisfactory as might be desired;
for even when the current remained constant, the weight necessary
to separate the ball varied considerably in different experiments.
This was also the case when fine shot was poured upon the scale
pan. In the laying on of weights or the pouring in of shot, it is
scarcely possible   to avoid a vibration of the beam, which com
municates itself to the ball in a series of slight jerks directed
upwards. The weight upon the opposite scale-pan is ever ready
to take advantage of the slightest loosening of the ball occasioned
by these little jerks, and hence a separation may take place which
is not due to a fair overpowering of the magnet by gravity.
   6. A considerable number of experiments had been made in
this manner, when the thought occurred to me that the above
cause of disturbance might be removed by using a variable mag
net and fixed weight instead of a fixed magnet and a variable
weight. Hitherto       I had excited the magnet by a certain current,
and added weights until the ball gave way. The method which
now suggested itself was to lay a certain weight upon the scale
pan, and slowly to reduce the magnetic power until a separation
should take place.       By means of the rheostat I had this com
pletely in my power, and a few trials sufficed to demonstrate the
superiority of this mode of experiment over the former.
   The method of proceeding being thus determined, a friend in
whose skill and fidelity I could rely” took charge of the reading
of the tangent galvanometer.          I took up my place before the
magnet,   weighted    the balance, turned the rheostat, and observed
the moment of separation; at the same moment the turning of
the rheostat ceased, and the angle of deflection was called out.

Jacobi was composed of two separate wires. The two ends of
one of these wires were connected with the poles of the battery,
while the ends of the other were connected with a galvanometer.
On sending a current through the former, an instantaneous
stream was induced in the latter, which ran round the galvano
meter, imparting in       its

    23. Magnetic attraction, like the attraction of gravitation, is the
result of a reciprocated force.      The attraction of a sphere of soft
iron depends, not only upon the magnetism of the magnet, but
also upon that of the excited ball.      The attraction is equal to the
product of both. In operating with balls of different diameters,
two things are to be taken into account, which, in default of
better terms, may for the present be called quantity and intensity;
the former depending upon the volume of the ball, though not
proportional to it; the latter on the power of the magnet, to
which it is proportional.      According to this view, the intensity
of magnetism in a ball of     a certain diameter, placed at a certain
distance from the     magnet,  is the same as that of a ball of twice
or half the diameter placed at the same distance; but the quan
tities of magnetism are very different.         The attraction of the
ball depends upon both quantity and intensity. Thus the force
with which the sphere reciprocates that of the magnet may be
regarded as being made up of the two components q and i, the
former of which stands for the quantity, the latter for the inten
sity.   Let m be the magnetism of the magnet, then the attrac

  It has been already proved, that to hold a certain weight in
equilibrium, the ball No. 2, when in contact, requires 2:4 times
the magnetic power that No. 1 requires.     But I found this to
vary a little      small intervals existed between the ball and
magnet.     When a film of mica rºundth of an inch in thickness
was  placed  upon the pole, the above factor reduced itself to 2:3;
at a leaf thickness, or Trºndth of an inch distant, it was 2.25;
at g!gth of an inch distant it was 2.22; while at             of an                              ºth
inch distance it was nearly the same as in contact.        For our

     During the latter experiments each ball was separated by a
 fixed distance of g;nth of an inch from the pole. We see that the
 corresponding magnetic powers are nearly equal throughout, but
 that the corresponding weights are in the constant ratio of 5:1.

     24. There was some little difficulty in applying our mode of
 experiment in the present case.            Did we resort to the method of
 laying on weights or of pouring in shot, nothing could be appa
 rently easier than to determine this law. We should simply
 have to preserve the magnetic power constant; to place, by means
 of the interposed leaves, various intervals between the sphere and
 magnet, and to determine in each case the weight necessary to
 break the hold. We have, however, already stated our objec
 tions to this method.          The plan of proceeding will perhaps be
  rendered    plainer   by  reference to a method sometimes adopted to
  determine the       melting-point     of wax or fatty matter.        A little
  glass tube containing a portion of the matter is dipped into water
  of a known temperature—it does not melt. It is now dipped
  into water of a higher temperature—it melts.               It is evident that
  the melting-point lies somewhere between these two temperatures,
  and that by approximating the temperatures of the fluids, the
  exact melting-point can at length be obtained.              Our proceeding
  with the magnet was precisely similar.             A  magnetic power      due
     * Some little difficulty may be encountered in the attempt to separate
  the third proposition from the fourth.       This will vanish when it is con
  sidered, that in the former case a constant force (a weight) operated against
  the magnet, and the question was one between magnetism and distance; in
  the latter case, the magnetism is preserved constant, and the question is
  one between weight and distance.

to   acurrent of 25° was taken as a standard.         A certain weight
was laid upon the scale-pan, and a current somewhat greater
than 25° was sent round the magnet.             The ball was brought
down    upon   the leaf or leaves which measured the distance from
the pole, and the rheostat was slowly turned until the ball gave
way.     If this occurred at 25°, the right weight for the distance
in question    had been chosen.       Suppose, however, that the ball
preserved       its

   When we consider the disturbing action of the edges, and the
difficulty of preserving perfect parallelism between magnet aud
submagnet, we shall not be surprised at the deviations which ex
hibit themselves close to the poles. At a little distance the law
of action expressed above receives a good corroboration.
  The experimental portion of this investigation had been already
completed, when           I
                   learned that a series of experiments was made
in 1841 by M. Cramer, mechanician to the university in Kiel,
with a view to determine the influence of distance upon the lift
ing power of the magnet.    He experimented with steel magnets
of the horse-shoe form, placing, in each case, the unlike poles of
two magnets of the same size exactly opposite to each other.
The distances between the poles were measured, as in our case,
by leaves of paper. The result of M. Cramer's investigation, as
contained in vol.        302  lii.Poggendorff’s Annalen,

distances of the position of equilibrium from the respective poles
are directly proportional to the strengths of the magnets.
   29. This conclusion, however, would be altogether opposed to
the experimental results detailed in § 3. The error lies in the
tacit assumption, that the forces exerted at the unit of distance
are proportional to the strengths of the magnets.        With the
theoretic poles this assumption was correct, for there the mag
netism of the little steel ball was constant, and hence the attrac
tions between it and the respective poles at the unit of distance
were the products of a constant with the strengths of these poles,
these products being therefore in the ratio of the strengths.  But
with the sphere of soft iron every change in the magnet is ac
companied by a corresponding change in the magnetism of the
sphere, which circumstance puts the proportionality existing in
the other case entirely out of the question.
   30. It has been already proved (16.), that if one magnet have
twice the strength of another, and if the latter exercise a certain
force upon the iron ball at a certain distance”, the former will
exercise the same force at four times the said distance.    Hence,
adopting the disposition of the poles above described, if the ball
be placed at a leaf thickness distant from the weaker pole, to be
in equilibrium it must be four leaves distant from the stronger,
which is here supposed to be underneath the former; and in
general, if m and m' be the strength of any two magnets, and d
and d" the distances at which they exert cqual attractions upon
the sphere, we have           //l.    mn!

the squares       of the   strengths     of the   magnets.

what will take place if it be removed from the ninth plane to the
first plane, without altering the trebled power of the magnet. The
law established in section 6 replies, that at one plane distant it
will be attracted nine times as strongly as at nine planes distant.
But at nine planes distant it is attracted with the same force by
the treble power as at one plane distant by the single power.
Hence upon the same plane three times the magnetic power will
cause nine times the attraction; or, expressed generally, the
mutual attraction of the magnet and the sphere of soft iron, when
both are separated by a fived distance, is directly proportional to
the square of the strength of the magnet.
    We have thus arrived, by direct deduction from established
principles, at the well-known law of Lenz and Jacobi, which,
expressed in their own words, runs as follows:—
    The attraction between two electro-magnets, or between an electro
magnet and a mass of soft iron, is proportional to the square of the
strength of the magnetizing stream.
    We shall now bring the deduction to the test of experiment.
At the moment the ball gives way, the magnetic power, or,
what is the same, the strength of the magnetizing stream, is
º
expressed by tan S. The weight upon the scale-pan is the mea
sure of the force with which the ball is attracted at the same
moment.       According to the above law, therefore,       the quotient
    2
           must be a constant quantity, and hence also
                               tan 8=    const.

as in the former cases, are each the mean of four observations.

or positive according as the two poles are of the same or of op
posite names.   This may be called the fundamental law of mag
netism. We have already assumed the magnetism of the soft
iron sphere to be proportional to that of the magnet.  By aid of
this assumption, the law of Lenz and Jacobi can be immediately
deduced from the above fundamental principle.      Let mi be the
magnetism of the magnet, and mo the corresponding magnetism
of the sphere at a given distance. The attraction will be
                                                   m 1m0.
Supposing the power of the magnet to be increased n times, the
sphere will receive a proportionate increase, and the attraction
will then be

 from the latter law occurs.                       From this to absolute contact                       the
 passage from one law to the other is gradual.                -
   36. To demonstrate this  gradual  change,  it was necessary  to
 apply a film much thinner than the paper formerly used, and to
procure this was a matter of some difficulty.             Gold leaf was on
many accounts unsuitable. The following expedient occurred to
me on observing the extreme tenuity of a gun-cotton balloon.
It is well known that a solution of gun-cotton in sulphuric aether,
when spread thin and suffered to dry, forms a tough unyielding
film.    A layer of such a solution was laid, like a wash of water
colour, with a camel's-hair pencil upon the smooth flat pole.
The layer must have been exceedingly thin, for when dry it ex
hibited the colours of thin plates with great brilliancy.                The
ball was brought down upon this, weights from 300 to 900
grammes were laid upon the scale-pan, and the corresponding
magnetic powers determined. This done, another wash of the
solution was laid on, and the same process repeated.             The result
may be thus stated:—Through the interval between the surface
of the pole and the sixth layer no law is recognisable.              At the
lower limit of this space the attraction of the ball is directly propor
tional to the magnetizing stream; at the upper limit, and beyond                                       it,
the attraction      proportional
                      is            the squareto                 of

the opposite polarity implied by the fundamental law, the magnet
and the mass of soft iron must be a certain distance asunder.
The case of contact, in point of fact, reduces itself to the attrac

the threshold of            a subject   which will be better discussed in a

that they cannot be accounted for on the supposition of ‘lagging
magnetism.”     Let us imagine the ball placed at the sixth layer
of the   gun-cotton   solution.    From this downwards, as it ap
proaches the pole, we have a nearer and nearer approximation to
the law of simple proportionality. When a single layer separates
the ball from the pole, the law is nearly fulfilled; when this is
removed, the approximation is still nearer; but is the ball then
in contact     Will not the unavoidable roughness which remains
after rubbing with fine sand-paper and polishing with emery still
make some difference? If we lay a plate of glass upon a convex
lens of large radius, so as to produce Newton’s rings, a consi
 derable pressure is needed to render the central spot permanently
 black, or in other words, to establish perfect contact”.          How
 much more will such a pressure be required in our case, where the
 surfaces operated with are comparatively so defective | Besides
 this, the manipulation of the surface must alter in some measure
 the constitution of the thin outside layer, and render it different

 magnet and ball. An improvement of the contact would, accord
 ing to our reasoning, be accompanied by improved results. The
 contact might be made more perfect by mechanical pressure—
 with the hand, for instance; but on removing the             a shaking
 of the ball is unavoidable,    which  entirely  nullifies the previous

pressed in the foregoing pages has been heretofore established—
that of Lenz and Jacobi; and this, as we have seen, forms a link
in a chain of laws, or rather a deduction, which flows a priori
from the combination of the 3rd and 4th propositions. The
laws of magnetic action, at distances in comparison with which
the thickness of the magnet vanishes, have been long known.
But the complementary portion of the subject, which embraces
the laws of action at short distances where the thickness of the
magnet comes fully into play, has, so far as           am aware,     I
hitherto eluded the grasp of    experiment  and formed a subject of
mere puzzling conjecture.       The want here experienced it has
been the  object  of the present  inquiry to supply.
   The  principal  results may be summed up as follows:–
   1. The mutual attraction of a magnet and a sphere of soft
iron, when both are in contact, is directly proportional to the
strength of the magnet.
   2. The mutual attraction of a magnet and a sphere of soft
iron, when both are separated by a small fixed distance, is directly
proportional to the square of the strength of the magnet.
   3. The mutual attraction of a magnet of constant strength and
a sphere of soft iron is inversely proportional to the distance be
                                                    -
tween the magnet and the sphere.
   4. When the distance between the magnet and the sphere
varies, and a constant force opposed to the pull of the magnet is
applied to the latter; to hold this force in equilibrium, the
strength of the magnet must vary as the square root of the
distance.
    I                                             of the kind
        have, in conclusion, to express my deep sense
ness of Professor Knoblauch,   who, during  this investigation,
permitted me to occupy three of his rooms, and placed his ex
tensive and beautiful collection of apparatus entirely at my

to have supposed that Laplace’s explanation was equivalent                                                            to
this—that the condensation produced          the course    the motion     in                      of
causes         an
           elevation             of
                         temperature, and that therefore the velocity
of  propagation                                 the velocity increases
                                                                           of as

increase in the force of restitution of the piston, arising from the
alternate elevation and depression of temperature, is analogous
to the increase in the forces of restitution of the particles of air
arising from the same cause, to which corresponds an increase
in the velocity of propagation of sound.
  Another consequence     follows from the formula (13.), which
deserves to be noticed.   We have already seen that this formula
gives nu-' sec l’ for the value of V, the velocity of propagation.

If now         we take the case next               in order of simplicity,
                                                                           in which the
 motion is symmetrical about a centre, and put r for the distance
 of any point from the centre, we shall get for the determination
 of rs the same partial differential equation as (7.), with the ex
ception that a will be replaced by r. To obtain, therefore, the
integral corresponding to (13.), it will be sufficient to replace a
by r and divide the second member by r. This integral would
apply to the case of the disturbance produced by a vibrating sphe
rical body, in which the motion is supposed to be symmetrical
with respect to the centre.    And in the more general case of a
vibrating body of irregular form, or a musical instrument, or any
other source of sound, the conclusions would doubtless be the
same as to their leading features.
    There remains a more important point to be considered before
we apply the formula (13.) to the vibrations of air within a long
tube. At first sight it might seem that the radiation of heat
within a tube must take place in a manner altogether different
from that in which it would take place in free air.     But a little
consideration will show, I think, that such is not the case. Of
the heat radiating from any particle of                          air
                                            which has been slightly

                suppose the flux expressed         the sine    cosine  by                   or
of   anangle proportional     the time, the expression for the fluc

root of the period. In the present case, the period with which
we have to deal is that of a sonorous vibration, a time which
must be regarded as extremely small in questions relating to the
conduction of heat.    Hence, if T be the period of vibration, the
fluctuation of temperature of the tube will be a small quantity
of the order w/t  compared with the flux of heat.    Now if H, h
be the interior and exterior conductivities, v a normal to the inner
surface of the tube, drawn from the tube inwards, 6' the excess
of temperature of the tube above the mean temperature 66; and
if we suppose the surface to be plane, and to radiate into an                                                in
finitely extended medium at a temperature 60+6, where 6 is
supposed to be constant as regards space, but to be a periodic
function of the time, we must have at the inner surface of the
tube
                                       d6.
                                   H   dy     +h(6–6)=0.
Now, according to what has been already remarked, 6' is a small
quantity of the order vºt compared with
                                                                      º   ; and it follows from
the above equation, that                 º     is comparable with 6, and therefore
6' is a small quantity of the order w/T compared with 6.    Hence,
even in the case above    supposed, the fluctuation of temperature
of the tube at the surface would be very small. But in the
actual case, the tube radiates, not into an infinite medium, but
merely across the air contained within                          it,

face; and therefore the fluctuation        temperature     of
                                                           the inner                     of
            the tube will               be         the case supposed      in
         an so of
surface                        far smaller than

   From the account of M. Biot's experiments given by Sir John
 Herschel in art. 24 of his Treatise on Sound+, it would seem
that the diminution of intensity which we can by any possibility
refer to radiation must be very small, especially when we re
member that, in the case of these experiments, the intensity
would be diminished by a sort of reflexion at the bendings of the
tube, as well as by the friction of the air against the sides of the
tube, and the internal friction of the air itself. That the cause
last mentioned would produce a small but not utterly insensible
effect in causing a diminution of intensity,       I have shown in the
course of a     paper    “On the effect of the Internal Friction of
Fluids on the Motion of Pendulums,” recently read before the
Cambridge Philosophical Society. If we suppose, at a venture,
that a diminution of intensity in the ratio of 2 to 1 is the utmost
which we can attribute to radiation in the case of M. Biot’s ex
periments, putting N=2, and w=3120, the length of the tube
in feet, we get from (20.) q=0.834 for a superior limit of q.         If
we suppose q=0.834, we get for the ratio in which the tempe
rature of a small portion of slightly heated air would be dimi
nished in the course of one second, 1 to e-7, or 1 to 0°4343, or
7 to 3 nearly.     It is curious that it should, theoretically speaking,
be  possible  to assign    a superior limit to the velocity of cooling
of heated air   by  observations on sound; but I imagine that the
real value of q is a good deal smaller than any limit which it
would be practically possible to assign in this way.
   As the present communication is not exactly intended to be
controversial,   I refrain from criticising the strange process by
which Professor Potter attempts to obtain a new value for the
velocity of sound.

   P.S. The above paper was written and forwarded to the editors
before the publication of an article by Mr. Rankine, which has
appeared in the March Number, otherwise I should have con
tented myself by simply referring to Mr. Rankine's paper, so far
as relates to the point there discussed.

XLI.     Examinations of some Canadian Minerals.              By T. S.
   HUNT, Chemist and Mineralogist to the Geological          Survey of
    Canada +.

THEtoscience       of               in this          is much indebted
           the labours of Dr. Holmes of Montreal, and Dr.Wilson
of Perth, who have devoted       a good deal of time in exploring and
bringing into notice many interesting mineral species. Among
collections of those which were sent to Dr. Thomson of Glasgow,
this gentleman recognized several things which he described as
new species, but owing to an unfortunate want of precision in
his mineralogical descriptions, their identification has been diffi
cult, and mineralogical writers have been unwilling to admit
their claims to the rank of distinct species.         Having, through
the kindness of the two gentlemen above named, been put in
possession   of well-authenticated specimens of the minerals in
question,  I have submitted them to careful analysis and obtained
the results which are subjoined.
                                                         I
   Felspars.-The first one of this genus which shall notice
is the mineral described by Dr. Thomson, under the name of
Perthitet.     It is found in the township of Bathurst, and mixed
with quartz, forms an Eurite rock in which large cleavable masses
of the felspar are occasionally met with.            Form, apparently
monoclinic.     Hardness 6 (scale of Mohs.). Specific gravity
2.576–2.579.       Of a darker coloured fragment 2:583. Lustre
vitreous, inclining to pearly; colour light flesh-red, alternating
with reddish or pinchbeck brown, the two colours forming bands
from half a line to a line in width, coincident with one of the planes
T, often however interrupted and intermingled one with another.
The darker bands on the cleavage surface Texhibit, when viewed
perpendicularly, a golden reflexion like the variety known as
aventurine felspar.     The colours of the mineral become much
darker on exposure to the action of the weather.           The results
which follow were obtained from freshly-broken light-coloured
fragments, and the mineral reduced to a fine powder by elu
triation, was dried in one analysis at 300°F., and in another
at the ordinary temperature over sulphuric acid.           The earthy
constituents were determined          in the ordinary manner after
 fusion with carbonate of soda, and the alkalies by decomposing
the mineral by the aid of fluor spar and sulphuric acid.

   It is evident from these analyses, that the composition of the
mineral is precisely that of orthoclase, to which species it had
already been provisionally referred by Shepard*, Danat, and
myselff. The proportion of soda is larger than is generally met
with in this species; but Domeyko found 4 per cent. of this
alkali in an orthoclase from Chili, and Schnederman 10 per
cent. in one from Vesuvius, while various other specimens have
afforded 2 and 3 per cent.S
   The second species to be mentioned is that described by Dr.
Thomson under the name of Peristerite||, in allusion to the
beautiful play of colours, resembling that of Labradorite, which
it exhibits.
   The specimens furnished me by Dr. Wilson as duplicates of
those sent to Dr. Thomson, are composed of a mixture of quartz
grains readily distinguishable by their lustre, greater hardness and
want of cleavage, disseminated through a felspar, which still so
far predominates as to give distinct cleavages to the mass. Spe
cimens furnished me from the same locality exhibited the mineral
in fine cleavable masses free from quartz, occasionally passing
into the variety just described.
   Form triclinic; the cleavage forms gave apparently the angles
of those of albite, but did not admit of accurate measurement.
Cleavage perfect parallel with P and M, less distinct with T. The
surface P shows a fine play of colours like Labradorite, in which
a delicate cerulean blue predominates, occasionally passing into
light green and yellow. The face M is often marked with striae
parallel to P. The same play of colours and striation on alter
nate surfaces are distinguishable in the masses mixed with
quartz.

not hygroscopic, but belong to the chemical composition of the

   These specimens, although the latter differ somewhat from
the others in specific gravity, are nearly identical in composition
with each other and with the marmolite of Hermann, but differ
from that in not being foliated. The proportion of water which
they contain is intermediate between that of serpentine and of
the Deweylite of Emmons, from which latter they are separated
by their higher specific gravity. Dana has, however, in conside
ration of the wide latitude presented in the composition of this
class of minerals, united marmolite with serpentine, and it would
not we think be advisable to retain retinalite, which is only a
compact marmolite, as a distinct species.
   The presence of traces of alkali has not hitherto been generally
recognised in this class of minerals, but Ficinus has observed
from 50 to 1:33 per cent. of soda in the dermatine of Breithaupt,
and Schmidt 1.98 per cent. in an asbestiform serpentine from
Zöblitz+.
   Zircon.—This species is found in considerable              abundance at
Grenville, associated with tabular spar, calc-spar, sphene, py
roxene and plumbago.         The crystals are often half an inch in
diameter and an inch or more in length, with finely modified
terminations.     Specific gravity 4'602–4.625; colour brownish
red, passing into flesh-red and cherry-red.            Its analysis afforded

   The zirconia contained    a trace   of oxide of iron, which was not
separated.
   There are still among the known minerals of the province,
some imperfectly described species which            I purpose to examine,
and my results may probably form the subject of another com
munication.

       MY     DEAR               SIR,
      THINK.M.   Quetelet's observations so important that I hope
      you will publish them in the next Number of your Journal,
and I doubt not they will have their due effect in inducing many
to join the very small band of those who at present observe and
study the phaenomena of atmospheric electricity.

   My first memoir on the electricity of the                                                   contained the

them those     1849, 1850, and the beginning
                    of                           1851; you will
see them, probably, not without interest.  They confirm gene

pressure on the unit of left face to be due to the attributed cube

be pressed by the cube y, through an extent represented by (8))”.

     In order tocalculate the ratios sought by the formula of
Fresnel, I have adopted for the superficial index of the dark
glass the number 1425. According to the law of Brewster, this
number corresponds to an angle of polarization of 54° 56'.   In
determining directly the angle of polarization of the glass,                                                             I

patch of coloured bars, which are perpendicular to the flame passing
through the candle and the eye, normal to the looking-glass.       This
remark was communicated to M. Quetelet, and published by him.
Attention has recently been drawn to this observation, at the Con
gress of Swiss men of science, held at Aarau, in August of the pre
sent year. M. Mousson of Zurich pointed out, at that meeting, the
differences between the stripes noticed by Dr. Whewell, and the
rings on specula observed by Fraunhofer.       Among these differences
are, 1st, Fraunhofer's rings depend upon the first surface of the spe
culum, the stripes upon both ; 2nd, the rings are not produced except
the dust be particles of uniform size; the stripes are produced by dust
of irregular and various particles; 3rd, the rings depend for their size
on the size of the particles of dust; the stripes do not.
   Some discussion took place as to the manner in which these stripes
arise from the theory of interferences, and upon their relations to
Newton’s “colours of thick plates.”
  Dec. 9.—On the effect of the internal     friction of Fluids on the
Motion of Pendulums.      By  Professor Stokes.
   It has been acknowledged for some time that the results which
follow from the common theory of fluid motion relative to the effect
of a fluid on the time of vibration of a pendulum do not agree well
with observation. The volume of the Philosophical Transactions for
1832 contains the results obtained experimentally by the late         Mr.
Baily relating to the effect of air in altering the time of vibration of
a great variety of pendulums. The experimental results are exhibited
by the value of n, the factor by which the correction for buoyancy
must be multiplied in order to give the whole effect observed. With
pendulums composed of spheres suspended by fine wires, Baily found
n= 1.864 for spheres a little less than 1% inch in diameter, and
n=1.748 for spheres about 2 inches in diameter. The result which
follows from the common theory is n=1.5, as was first shown by
Poisson.     The value 1.864 was the mean of 16 pair of experiments,
giving a mean error 0.023, and 1748 was the mean of 12 pair, which
gave a mean error 0.014, so that the difference between the two re
sults, and between either of them and the common theory, is far too
large to be attributed to errors of observation.
   The chief object of this paper was, to apply to the calculation of
the motion of a pendulum the general equations of motion which are
arrived at when the internal friction of the fluid is taken into account,
and to compare the resulting formulae with the experiments of Baily
and others.      The general equations, simplified, first, by neglecting
the  square   of the velocity, secondly, by neglecting the compressibility
of the  fluid, the effect of which in the present instance is in fact quite
insignificant, thirdly, by omitting the external forces, the effect of
which may be taken into account separately, are

 The second and third of the general equations   are not written down,
 because they may be supplied by symmetry.       In these equations pis
 the density, p the mean of the normal pressures in the direction of any
three rectangular planes passing through the point of which r, y, z
are the coordinates; u is the velocity in the direction of r, t the time,
and w'a certain constant, depending upon the nature of the fluid,
which the author proposes to call the inder of friction.
   The author has succeeded in obtaining the solution of equations
(1.) in the two cases of a sphere and of an infinite cylinder.       The
latter may be applied to the case of a pendulum consisting of a long
cylindrical rod, by treating each element of the rod as belonging to
an infinite cylinder oscillating with the same linear velocity.      The
following is the solution in the case of a sphere, so far as relates to
the resultant action of the fluid on the sphere.
   Let : be the abscissa of the centre of the sphere, measured in the
direction of the motion, a the radius of the sphere, r the time of vi
bration, M' the mass of the fluid displaced, F the resultant force of
the fluid on the sphere, so that                   –
                                    F is the resistance; then

The effect of a fluid on the time of vibration depends on the term
which involves k ; the effect on the arc of vibration depends on the
 term which involves k'.
    The expression for F has precisely the same form (2.) in the case
 of a cylinder, but k and k' are certain transcendental functions of
 (w' r); a     (a here denoting the radius of the cylinder), which the
 author has tabulated.
    The value of u<U+017F> having been determined for air, or any given fluid,
 by one experiment giving the effect of the fluid either on the time of
 vibration, or on the arc of vibration, of any one pendulum consisting
 either of a sphere suspended by a fine wire, or of a long cylindrical
 rod, or of a combination of a sphere and a rod, the formulae which
 follow from (2.) ought to make known the effect of the fluid both on

sphere, the result was found to agree almost exactly with Bessel's
experiments on the time of vibration of a sphere swung in water.
   As a limiting case of the problem of a ball pendulum, the author
has deduced the resistance of a fluid to a sphere moving uniformly
under such circumstances that the square of the velocity may be neg
lected.   The resistance thus determined proves to be proportional,
not to the surface, but to the radius of the sphere; and therefore
the quotient of the resistance divided by the mass increases very ra
pidly as the radius decreases.    Accordingly, the terminal velocity of
a minute globule of water descending through the air depends almost
wholly on the internal friction of air. Since the index of friction is
known from Baily's pendulum experiments, the terminal velocity can
be calculated numerically for a globule of given diameter. The ve
 locity thus calculated proves to be so small, in the case of globules
 such as those of which we may conceive the clouds to be formed,
 that the suspension of the clouds does not seem to offer any diffi
culty. Had the pressure been strictly equal in         directions      air      all                   in      in

                 of                                 such globules would   of
 have been far larger, and consequently the quantity          water which                  of

    The object which the author proposed to himself was the deter
 mination of certain magnetic lines within the limits of the Survey:
the lines of no dip, and of the maximum horizontal component of
the earth's force; the minimum intensity of the total magnetic force;
and finally, the line of no declination.         He was also desirous of ob
serving the variations of the magnetic elements, and of ascertaining
whether the changes of the declination, of magnetic intensity, and
of the barometer, were uniformly similar over so large an area.
The fixed stations for this latter purpose were sixteen in number,
and the time employed at each station varied from a few days to
several months.       They were spread over an area of 28° of latitude,
and more than 40° in longitude, viz. from 16° latitude north to 12°
south, and from 80° to 125° longitude east. This part of the globe
coincides very nearly with the position of minimum total force. Of
the sixteen stations, nine were to the south of this line, three to the
north, and four in                   its
                           immediate vicinity.      Four stations were        the                         in
islands adjacent        Singapore; one
                                to             Borneo; one      in the island          in                      of

     At
      Singapore, the extreme westerly variation occurs in December
at 19 hours,  or 7 A.M.; in January at 20"; in February at 21*; in
March, or the month in which the sun passes the equator, there is a
slight retrogression; in April the extreme westerly variation is at
21"; in July and August at 23"; in September at 22"; in October
at 21", and in November at 20 hours.        In the winter the extreme
westerly variation is at 20 hours; in spring at 21 hours; in summer
at 23 hours, and in autumn at 21 hours; agreeing in this respect
with the spring curves, but differing very materially as regards the
progression of the needle eastward in the afternoon.   The oscillation
has much the greatest range during the winter months; autumn
comes next, and preserves an almost perfect parallelism with the
winter.   The spring and summer curves preserve their parallelism
during the afternoon.
   The mean curves of each of the three years have an almost perfect
resemblance.   There are two most decided maxima at 18" and at 3
or 4 hours, and one minimum at 21". There are besides two other
minima at 10" and '7", and another maximum at 14 hours, making
in all three maxima and three minima.    If we turn to the seasons,
we find in the winter only one strongly defined maximum and mini
mum. In spring two maxima, one minimum ; in summer and autumn
two maxima and two minima.           The amount of oscillation is greater
in winter than in summer. The sun is a longer time to the south
of the line of minimum force than to the north of                 Singapore                 it.                         is

   The next observations referred to are those of the horizontal
force at different seasons.    As the observations at the different
stations were made at different times of the year, it appeared ne
cessary, as in the case of the declination, to ascertain what changes
might take place in the different seasons at a station where an un
interrupted series had been observed for a considerable time.        Ac
cordingly, Singapore, where observations were made hourly during
three years, was chosen as the point to which        the stations     the            all                             of

time the instruments were observed at some of the stations; and for the
purpose of ascertaining whether this really was the case, the curves
of the barometer, corrected to 32° of temperature, were projected
at some of those stations where observations had been carried on for
more than a month, and likewise, in addition, corrected for tension
of vapour, thus giving the oscillation of the column of dry air.
There is certainly not the same regularity perceptible as in the oscil
lation of the barometer, yet there is considerable uniformity in the
oscillation of the pressure of the column of dry air, the maximum
generally occurring at 19 or 20 hours, and the minimum at 2, 3 or 4
hours. The range is likewise considerably greater.
   The tension of vapour was generally a minimum at 18 hours,
when it amounted to 0-8 of an inch.        It then increased to 2 hours,
when it    might  amount to 0-9 of an   inch,  and then gradually dimi
nished, having but one maximum and one minimum in the 24
hours.     In the islands of the Archipelago the air is nearly saturated
with   moisture,   and at Singapore the maximum difference between
the   dry  and wet bulb at 1 or 2 P.M. amounted to not more than 7°,
and then gradually and uniformly diminished till sunrise, when the
difference was rarely more than a degree. There appears to be
one maximum and one minimum of the dry and wet bulb thermo
meter, the former at noon or 1 P.M., the latter at 18 or 19 hours;
the greatest and least differences between the two thermometers oc
curring, as has been observed, likewise at these hours.
    In addition to the above, a standard thermometer by Newman
was observed ; one maximum and one minimum occur in the twenty
four hours, viz. at 2 and at 18 hours. The oscillation varies consider
ably; the smallest oscillation being observable at Singapore, where the
standard thermometer was placed inside the Observatory, and ex
posed to a current of air passing through the building. The range
was greatest at Moulmein and in Sumatra; but at these observa
tories, the instruments being under canvas, the direct influence of
the sun's rays was very great.      In addition to these thermometrical
observations, there was likewise in use a Solar Radiation Thermo
meter, the bulb of which was tinged of a dark purple colour, not
absolutely black; this instrument was placed on a table outside the
observing tent, and the bulb beyond the edge of the table exposed
to the sun.      This thermometer was read off from 19 hours to 4 or
5 hours    P.M., and the maximum of the day, with the time at which
it was    observed,  recorded.   The minimum thermometer (self-regi
stering) was placed at night, and in a similar manner, on the table
outside the tent, and the minimum read off in the morning.        These
observations have been recorded in the Tables, but have not been
deemed of sufficient importance to lay them down in curves.         This
completes that portion of the Survey which relates to the hourly
changes of the magnetical and meteorological instruments.
   The author next proceeds to the consideration of the absolute
determinations, which formed the principal object of the Survey,
viz. Latitude, Longitude, Dip, Horizontal Force and Declination.
The method adopted in making these observations was as follows.

On arrival at    a station, the tent was pitched, and the instruments
prepared.     These were a six-inch dip circle, a portable decli
nometer, an altitude and azimuth instrument by Robinson, and a
chronometer which had been long in use, and was scarcely trust
worthy for a fixed rate. Commencing the following morning, the
first instrument set up was the declinometer, and as the suspen
sion-thread was thicker than necessary, to obviate the necessity of
frequent renewal, the brass weight for removing the torsion was
allowed to swing for a couple of hours.           During this interval the
observations for    dip  were   completed,    and by 9 A.M. the collimator
magnet was in the box, the altitude and azimuth instrument in rear
of   it,

in the Magnetic Survey give the resulting equations at a                mean
latitude   of 0° 09' north,   mean longitude 104° 44' east, and mean
 dip 14°40'4 south; the isoclinal line running from north 86° 39'
 west to south 86°39'east; and the dip in the line at right angles to it
 increasing at the rate of 1"953 for each geographical mile.
     Nearly the same method has been pursued in laying down the
 lines of equal horizontal force.     In one group this line forms an
 angle of north 67° 48' west to south 67° 48' east with the meri
 dian, and the line perpendicular to it proceeds at the rate of
:000.8249 for each geographical mile, the central station being in
 latitude 0° 38'5 north, and longitude 102° 26' east. In another
 group at the central station 3° 40' south, and 106° 33' east, the
 line of equal horizontal force forms an angle of 60°57' with the
 meridian, and increases at the rate of 0005855 for each geographi
 cal mile on the perpendicular line.
    The lines of declination have been laid down with reference to
the declination at each station individually, the particular form of
the lines rendering the method of grouping inapplicable.

 the formula
 dip, and      the total force; and as the dip changes rapidly, but
 regularly, whilst the horizontal intensity changes slowly, but irregu
 larly, it is evident the lines of total force will follow in some de
gree the regularity of the intervals between the lines of dip.
     The total force for each station was determined by the above
 formula, and equations of condition, combined by the method of
least squares, determined the direction of the isodynamic line, in
 the mean latitude of 3° 05' south, longitude 106°47'; where the
 mean total force was 8.745.     The angle which the isodynamic line
 forms with the meridian is from north 85° 36' west to south 85° 36'
 east, and increases southerly at the rate of 001073 for each geogra
 phical mile. The line of least intensity, in the space over which
 the Survey was carried, appears to agree almost exactly with the line
 of no dip.
    To recapitulate briefly respecting the position of the principal
 lines. The line of no dip cuts the meridian at an angle approach
 ing a right angle, and near the parallel of latitude of 8° north in the
 longitude of Singapore; the rate of progression being almost exactly
two miles of dip to one mile of latitude.      The line of least total
force varies but little from the line of no dip, forming indeed a
somewhat larger angle with the meridian.        The direction of the
maximum horizontal force forms an angle of nearly 65° with the
meridian from north-west to south-east, but neither the maximum
horizontal nor the minimum total intensity appear to be, strictly
speaking, lines.   In taking two stations having the same value, the
one to the north and the other to the south of the position of
greatest horizontal intensity, and dividing the distance between
them, it might be supposed that this would be the position of the line
of greatest horizontai intensity; but the maximum horizontal intensity

derable distance on either side of this line; the value in this space
being 8:20. The minimum total force was 8-149; the station being
Madras, in latitude 13° 04' north, longitude 80° 16' east, dip
7° 34' north, horizontal intensity 8:078, and declination 0° 56' 09"
east.
   In addition to the above, observations were made at sea, consist
ing of temperatures of the air and sea; the dry and wet bulb, the
standard thermometer, and, whenever practicable, of the dip with a
Fox's Dip Circle. The author remarks that it is impossible to over
estimate the practical value of this instrument at sea in low lati
tudes. The dip changes two minutes for every mile of latitude.
The seas are generally smooth. When astronomical observations
cannot be taken, the dip circle becomes a truly valuable latitude in
strument, and in a few minutes, by day or by night, the latitude of
the ship can be correctly ascertained.
   The author concludes by remarking that he has found Colonel
Sabine's many works on magnetism of considerable use, more espe
cially “Lloyd and Sabine's Magnetic Survey of Great Britain and
Ireland.'

    When ammoniacal gas is made to react on perchloride of sulphur,
these substances undergo a series of transformations, respecting
which the authors state that want of space prevents dilating: there
is eventually obtained a powder of a pure yellow colour, which M.
Soubeiran erroneously considered as a peculiar substance, and which
he described under the name of biammoniacal chloride of sulphur.
    From this powder, the authors state, that, by means of solvents,
they were able to separate five substances; when it is treated with
sulphuret of carbon, it yields sulphur, and a product of a fine orange
yellow colour. When it is repeatedly washed cold, with small
quantities of sulphuret of carbon,                  the sulphur      all

354               Prof. Donkin on certain Questions relating to
whole theory is the following:—When several hypotheses are pre
sented to our mind, which we believe to be mutually exclusive and
exhaustive, but about which we know nothing further, we distribute
our belief equally amongst them.   I mean by these expressions to
imply, that the hypotheses not only eachaust the whole range of
possibility, but also that they exclude one another, so that one
must be true and all the rest false.   If n be the number of such
hypotheses,             and entire belief be denoted by unity, then                           ; is the
quantity of belief we give to each of them.      Moreover, if we
select a group of m   hypotheses out of these n, the quantity of
belief which we give to the complex hypothesis  that some one of
these m is true, is the sum of the quantities which we give to
each      of them, namely #.
     2.   This being admitted                       of the way in which we
                                              as an account
actually   do distribute our belief in    simple     cases, the whole of the
subsequent theory follows as a deduction of the way in which
we must distribute it in complex cases, if we would be consistent.
And as equal distribution is the only possible (because the only
intelligible) law in the case of hypotheses about which we have
no information, so the laws which are deduced from it as appli
cable to the cases in which we have some information (which con
stitute the complex cases occurring in practice), are also, in those
cases, the only possible laws; since any other mode of distribu
tion would be found, when completely analysed, to rest upon a
random preference of one hypothesis to another about which we
are equally ignorant. We must therefore either accept the theory
of probabilities with                 all   its
                                   developments,         we must abandon or

means     of balls, dice, &c., but also are enabled to keep more
 clearly in view the connexion between first principles and the
forms of solution in complex cases.     I propose now to illustrate
their use by deducing from them what may be called the three
fundamental propositions of the science.
    8. THEoREM I.—If P be the probability of a hypothesis H, and
p the probability that                  if
                            H be true another hypothesis h is true;
then the probability that H and h are true is Pp.
    For the whole quantity of belief which we give to the truth of
H is made up of the quantities given to the two combinations
H true and h true, H true and h false. The sum of the two
latter quantities is therefore P, and their ratio is the same as it
would be if H were discovered to be true, namely, p: 1–p.
Hence their values are Pp and P(1-p).
    This obviously includes the case in which H and h are entirely
independent, and P, p their respective probabilities.
    THEoREM II.-Let H1, H2, ... He be mutually exclusive and
erhaustive hypotheses, whose probabilities (relative to a certain state
of information) are Pi, P,       P. And       ...                        let

“common sense.”       This accordance is nowhere more conspicuous
than in those cases in which a numerical result cannot be obtained
with certainty, from the difficulty of assigning the actual values
of the quantities which appear in the formulae.        It becomes
apparent in such instances from a consideration of the forms of
the expressions, and of the effects of supposed variation in the
quantities involved in them, and particularly from an examination
of extreme cases. And the comparative conclusions which can
be thus arrived at are probably quite as useful and instructive
as any absolute result would be, supposing it attainable.

rity is allowed to rest upon principles, there can be little hope of
a settlement of any controverted question.   I now proceed briefly
to examine one or two other problems suggested by Professor
Forbes's paper.    And first let us see what account the mathe
matical theory can give of the impression which would be made
on a person’s mind by seeing several pieces placed in a particular
situation on a chess-board.
   21. We will state the problem as follows:—A person who
understands the game sees a certain number of pieces placed in
a particular situation on the board. What are to him the respect
ive probabilities,   (1), that the situation was actually produced
by a game; (2), that it was produced by some one who (ignorant
of the game) designed that situation; or (3), that the situation
was accidental (that                  is,
                           that the person who placed the pieces
of on
   the board did not intend     produce any particular arrangement
                                                 to
   them)?     Let       supposed, for simplicity, that only two hy
                           it    be
potheses are admissible; namely, that       game has been (wholly      a
or partly) played, and the pieces left undisturbed;         that the                             or
pieces were placed               by
                       some one who could have         reference                         no                      to

           be                                 priori) let        the         à                    p        be

    2. What is the nature of the impression made on the material
group, the decomposition of which ensues?
    These queries are of course connected with our theoretical
views of the nature of light, and of radiations generally.
    There are many facts, such as those to which attention has
been directed in the Philosophical Magazine (February 1848),
which justify the supposition that the parts of            material sub                all
stances are        in
                   statea                  of
                             incessant vibration.    To each particular
thermometric degree there belongs particular frequency               a                                 of   vi
bration.           As

refrangibility are       succession   evolved, and the temperature   cor
respondingly rises.       On the other hand, when these oscillatory
movements decline, the temperature             the body falls.        of
   These  principles   lead        ready  explanation
                                                to   a     the nature                  of                    of

body and those       two strings, one

    The atoms of the chemical elements differ in weight. We
 should not therefore expect that the aethereal vibrations would
 throw them into movement with equal facility, but some would
 yield more readily than others.            Is not this what we express in
 chemistry by the term specific heat                 a body the capacity of
which is     great,   requiring    a   prolonged      application of aethereal
pulses before a consentaneous motion is              reached,  and in its turn
impressing on the aether during cooling a correspondingly pro
longed series of motions.          And is not this the cause of that
 remarkable relation between the atomic weights of elementary
bodies and their specific heats, discovered by Dulong and Petit f
    These considerations may lead us to inquire whether the ge
neral cause of the decomposition of compound bodies by radia
tion is due to the circumstance, that                    the atoms        all
                                                                         which                   of

unequal facility.      Thus,         certain compound molecule             sub                        be

than before, and, the temperature rising, great effects are the
necessary result.
   But changes brought about by light are in a different predi
cament.    Here conduction is entirely absent, as is also loss by
currents in the air. The cumulative effects of a long exposure
give the same action as a highly concentrated ray furnishes in a
brief period of time.       In this case, therefore, everything will
depend on the absorptive power of the substance.
   When a piece of polished silver is placed in the focus of a
burning-lens, it remains quite cold, because of         high reflecting                 its

    But as with heat, so with light; there are two distinct qua
lities to be considered,—quantity and intensity.     A very brilliant
beam    may   possibly break  up  a  given  combination, which a far
greater quantity of light, acting through a long period, might be
inadequate to touch. There are cases of the kind on record:
thus Sir R. Kane states, that he with M. Dumas could remove
two atoms of hydrogen from acetone by the action of chlorine in
the sunshine at Paris, but in Dublin only one.

this part of the question in       true light. My first experiments

Putting aside those cases in which the change is obviously
brought about by the high temperature, I have not found that
the focus of the burning-lens can cause any change which the
unconverged sun-rays alone are incompetent to produce.        Its
action is merely to hasten the effect.
   As everything shows that the activity of a ray in causing de
composition depends on the absorption exerted by the changing
medium, I investigated the circumstances particularly in the case
of a solution of the peroxalate of iron, a substance remarkably
well-suited for such inquiries.
     In tube half an inch in diameter, solution of peroxalate of
          a
iron was confined over mercury, and surrounded on          sides                                    all               by
another portion contained      wider tube,     that  in  ray could
                                                          a                         so          no

                                               decomposition oc
               in its
going     absorptive action.   found that             I                             no
curred     the inner tube until the  surrounding    liquid was                                                        so
far advanced     change      in sensibly passing into the colour

of decomposition by radiation.   Thus a ray which has impinged
on a Daguerreotype   plate can no longer impress any change on
the surface of a second such plate, to which it may be reflected.
In bringing about a change in the ponderable medium, the ray
itself undergoes a change.              The same is observed when a ra
has    passed    through    a mixture of chlorine and hydrogen (Phil.
Mag., July 1844); it loses the power of acting on a second
portion of the same substance.               So, too, one which has passed
through a solution of bichromate of potash can no longer change
a piece of paper made sensitive by being soaked in the same
solution. And such instances might be indefinitely multiplied.
    To show that the ray absorbed is in reality the active ray, I
made an examination by the prism in the case of the peroxalate
of iron. For this purpose the rays absorbed by the solution
were first determined, and then those bringing about decompo
sition were ascertained.           They were found to be identical.

 of a body, we also interfere with                     its

were all failures, for the reason that is now obvious.
   The observations here made apply only to the case in which
the substance mixed leaves the original body unaffected.     Thus,
if a solution of oxalic acid be mixed with   peroxalate of iron, it
unites at once therewith, an entirely new body of a different
colour and of a different absorptive power arises, and the expe
riments are no longer comparable.
        I
     now pass to the second point of inquiry.
   2. To what extent, and in what manner, is the decomposition of
a compound body affected by the frequency of vibration of a ray?
   From the beginning of optical chemistry, investigations have
been made for the purpose of determining the action of rays of
different refrangibilities. Wollaston, Ritter and Scheele, recog
nised the action of the more refrangible rays, even those which
are extra-spectral.    To these the designation of deoxidizing rays
was given.      Almost a hundred years ago it had been shown, in
special cases, that there is an antagonism between the opposite
ends of the spectrum; thus the phosphorescence excited in Can
ton’s preparation by the violet end of the spectrum is extin
guished by the red. As respects coloured compounds, Grotthuss
showed that the active ray is very commonly of the complemen
tary tint.
    This branch of the subject has more recently been examined
to a great extent, and the behaviour of             kinds               all
                                                                substances               of
in   the solar spectrum made known.             From these inquiries                                      it
would appear, that       general the rays

and therefore        more   frequent
                             of         vibration,   betray the greatest
activity; though the cases are quite common                  which      the         in              all
other rays exhibit      effect.   an

film ; and in those parts where the chemical effect is at a maxi
mum, the incident and reflected rays have conspired?
      If
       any proof were required that the maxima or minima of
chemical effect arise from the superposition of similar or contrary
motions, it is found in the relative thickness of the bands which
have been acted or unacted upon. The second yellow film has
a thickness compared with the first as 2:1, the metallic gray
film which intervenes having a thickness of 13.
   But the experiment may be varied by employing a film of
iodide of silver of uniform thickness, and simultaneously permit
ting rays of different refrangibilities to act upon                This                                 it.

trum to have a positive result the want of effect may arise from
the intrinsic feebleness of the light, which on these points is just
ready to die away.       That there is no weight in such a criticism
is very  easily  shown,   by slightly modifying the conditions of the
experiment, and admitting a feeble daylight or skylight to act
on the plate while the solar spectrum is at work, the action
being kept up long enough to permit such a light to stain the

principles of interference here dwelt upon.
   The next point of inquiry is—
   3rd. In what manner is the decomposition of a compound body
affected by the condition of polarization of the disturbing ray?
   A beam of light passing through a circular aperture, one inch
in diameter, into a dark room, was received on the achromatic
lens of a camera-obscura, and then fell on a doubly refracting
prism, so placed as to give on the ground glass two circular
images of the aperture, #rd of an inch in diameter, and overlap
ping each other to a small extent.    In these images the light
was of course polarized at right angles respectively.
  When a paper rendered sensitive by being washed with per
oxalate of iron was placed so as to receive them, the light per
mitted to act nine minutes, and      effect subsequently broughtits
out      by
        chloride   gold, both images were found
                              of                     equal black                                 of
ness, and the lenticular space formed        their overlapping                    by                                 of
greater depth.
   This was repeated with several different compounds, and always
with the same result.       shows that plane-polarized light acts
                                             It

its intensity.
     Next,    disc a     quartz was placed immediately behind the
                                  of
double refracting spar,                 give two images

Thus, under the influence of the sunshine, plants can decompose
many bodies, such as carbonic, sulphuric and phosphoric acids.
    The nature of these changes may be best illustrated by tracing
the complete course through which any one of these substances
#.          The chief facts are best seen in the case of phosphorus.
  his substance, when freshly made, commonly exhibits a white
waxy appearance; but when exposed to the sunshine, it turns of
a deep mahogany-red.                If
                                  the exposure has been long continued,
or the effect hastened by the action of a burning-lens, the change
of aspect is very striking.        It is analogous to that which sulphur
exhibits when heated to 400° or 500°.                             I

  These considerations enable us to explain what takes place in

to be previously taken, in other words, which would be invalid
did u, v, w mean the components of the whole velocity parallel
to the coordinate axes. With respect to the new axiom, Professor
Challis has of course a right to use his own words in his own
sense, and he may restrict it to the residual motion.    But then
the enunciation is faulty, and it ought to be :—Let it be granted

    Let f(u,         U)
                  denote that, whatever

     N.B. Nothing              here                determined              asregards the order               of  the

to settle anything as regards this point.

thereby translated to BP': the
couple PP" is therefore that which            ------X                     ,    ...                       U
translates the point       application       of                           Prº

                        the product uu, where   denotes the line AB,

ously noticed is equally necessary, viz. that the directions of motion
in each element in successive instants must be normals to conti
nuous surfaces. The introduction of this principle gives the means
of treating hydrodynamical questions in an entirely new manner,

   I may   be permitted to add, that Professor Potter's determi
nation of the velocity of sound is also hypothetical.        Supposing
his method to   apply   to a continuous         such as  the air is con
sidered to be when treated hydrodynamically, it amounts to assu
ming, that, together with a motion of the fluid along a fixed
axis, there is a motion transverse to that axis.      By a certain rela
tion between these two       motions, an  elementary    portion of the
fluid situated on the axis may remain of a cubical form in two
successive instants, while it changes        size.   But      its
                                                              unlimited                  an

to think when he speaks of a cubical or spherical form, as the
actual form of an atom.            By the laws of mechanics, however, in
the case of such balancing forces as we have considered, we know
that when the atoms have freedom of motion, as in liquids and
gases, the only arrangement for equilibrium must be one of
symmetry, or what is meant by a cubical arrangement of the
atoms.      The supposition of equilibrium                   however, only ap      is,
proximate, because bodies are             perpetually     changing     their tem

         LIV.     On Poisson's investigation                       of the Theory of Sound.
ByW.J. Macquor N RANKINE, C.E., F.R.S.E., F.R.S.S.A. &c.”
         ROFESSOR POTTER+                          conceives that he has found a defect
     in the reasoning of Poisson’s investigation of the velocity of
sound in air, in the following respect.
   Poisson supposes, that when the density of a gas is changed
in the ratio
                              1+s,
s being a very small fraction, the pressure is changed                                        in the ratio
                                           1    +s + or ;
and remarks, “A cause de la petitesse des, on peut supposer
cette quantité a proportionelle à s, et faire
                                               a   = 8s;
A  étant un coefficient positif et indépendant des.”
   The proportionality of a to s is considered by Professor Potter
to be a pure assumption.      Poisson, however, gives a reason for
it,viz. “à cause        petitesse des;” and this reason
                             de   la                          suffi                            is    a
cient one.
   For      let
              and po         po   be   the pressure                and density          in   their   undis

    This mineral is therefore essentially composed of a sulpho
arseniuret of copper, in which the relation of the equivalents of
sulphur, arsenic and copper, is almost exactly as 8: 1: 6. Such
a relation, supposing the arsenic to be in the state of trisulphuret,
requires the rather complicated formula 8Cu S, As S*--2Cu°S,
As S*; but supposing the arsenic to exist in the state of penta
sulphuret, we have the more simple formula          3Cu2S--As S*.

    This mineral, which belongs to the family of micas, is lamellar
like mica; the plates are easily separated, and possess a little
elasticity.    Sometimes it is in the form of a mass composed of
very small pearly scales, which are very friable, resembling some
species of talc. The plates are commonly convex and concave,
grouped in such a manner as to form a triangular prism.            It is
 also found massive with a micaceous structure, but with an irre
gular fracture; the aspect of this variety is waxy: it comes from
 Gumuch-dagh.         The crystalline form is difficult to determine;
 but to  judge  from the streaks on the surface, and the imperfect
 cleavage in two directions, it would appear to belong to an
 oblique rhombic prism.
    Its colour is white and lustre silvery; the hardness taken on
 a specimen from the Island of Nicaria is from 4 to 4-5.            The
 specific gravity taken on ten specimens varies from 2:80 to 3:09;
 this difference is not remarkable in a lamellated mineral.        It is
 not attacked     by   acids; heated before the     blowpipe it emits a
 bright light, and melts with great difficulty on the edges, which
 assume a blue colour if touched with the nitrate of cobalt and
 reheated.     Heated in a tube it furnishes water, frequently having
 an acid reaction due to fluoric acid.
    The composition of several specimens subjected to analysis is

     object of this pamphlet
             to the invention     of the principle of construction em
ployed in the Conway and Menai bridges, and to ascribe it to Dr.
Guyot. It appears that this gentleman constructed a model of a
wrought iron bridge, on a new plan, in 1844 and 1845, or about
the time when Mr. Stephenson first suggested the idea of a tubular
bridge.   This model has no resemblance in        general form           its
                                                                                             of be to

 be    doubt that the French and English inventions were not only
      no

                                       in                                                                in

manner in which the

of the structure is ana
logous to the rectan-      ||
gular cells employed in
the construction of the    l
Conway      and     Menai  ||
bridges.     In the En- ||
glish invention,      thin lllll
wrought iron plates are arran
tendency which such plates have to crumple when subjected to a
compressive force; and in the French invention, comparatively thick
bars are arranged in the form of parallelopipeds, to resist the ten
dency which long bars have to bend under a compressive force.
    In mechanical structures generally, it is not surprising that some
common principle, in itself scarcely containing the element of no
velty, should be adopted by different persons about the same time.
In such cases the merit of invention chiefly consists in the mode in
which the parts of the structure are arranged and combined so as to
bring the common principle into a greater or less degree of effi
ciency.    Now the principle of cellular structure, taken in connexion
with that of the distribution of material for maximum effect, which
 the French and English inventions have in common with each other,
is not in itself new. Mathematicians have long known that the con
 dition of maximum strength, in a beam undergoing transverse strain,

is secured by having the material in the section accumulated, as far
as practicable, at the greatest distances from the neutral axis; and
as regards the cellular structure in the French invention especially,
Grubenmann erected a bridge at Wettingen, about the middle of the
last century, in which the timbers composing the roof of the bridge
were made to form the material resisting the force of compression.

may             be
          further  worthy        observation,  that Mr. Fairbairn never heard

of Dr. Guyot's model bridge until very recently.
       2.
       The two modes                      of
                             construction differ     their general form.—The          in
Conway and Menai bridges are straight tubes,                    least practically               by
                                                                                                  or
so, composed                   of
                     sheet iron connected      together       rivets and angle                    at
irons, through which railway trains pass. On the other hand, Dr.
Guyot's model                            an
                            arched bridge, composed
                                is                              iron bars chiefly                   of
bolted  together,   over the   top    which the line       railway
                                                           of           supposed               of               is
to pass.        the   English
                         In     invention,   the cells are  composed        conti                                      of

                       Notices respecting New Books.                           419
nuous    surfaces of sheet iron; whereas in the French invention they
 are formed of iron bars taking the shape of a series of parallelopipeds.
The top and bottom parts of Dr. Guyot's bridge are connected
 together by a series of pillars, so that the roadway seems to be
standing upon, and supported by, the arch beneath; whereas in the
English bridges, an unbroken surface of sheet iron connects the top
and bottom parts so perfectly as to render them portions of an                  in
tegral structure.
    3. The leading elements of strength in the two structures are not the
same.—In the French invention, the arched structure at the bottom,
composed of regular voussoirs, constitutes the main element of
strength, the top and sides being subsidiary parts of the construction;
and hence the forces of resistance to rupture mainly depend upon the
principle of the arch.      In fact, owing to the imperfect connexion be
tween the voussoirs at the bottom and the rectangular parallelopipeds
at the top, as well as from the want of a complete cooperation in the
forces of resistance at the top and bottom parts, these forces seem to
be acting, to a certain extent, independently of each other.           Now
in Mr. Fairbairn's model tube, the top cells constitute the distin
guishing feature of the construction; and the side plates, forming
a perfect connexion between these top cells and the plates at the
bottom, transform the whole structure into a perfect hollow beam,
subject to the ordinary laws of compression and extension.             Here
the resistance of the cells at the top to compression, and the re
sistance of the bottom plates to extension, were found alone suffi
cient, without the aid of any subsidiary or auxiliary force, to ensure
the stability of the structure.      In Dr. Guyot's bridge, therefore, the
cellular structure at the bottom forms the essential part of the con
trivance, whereas in the tubular beams the bottom part may be com
posed of simple plates *.
   4. The English tubular bridge has been for some time constructed

1.
           some remarks on Nitrification.”    By Henry Bence Jones,
M.D., F.R.S. &c.
   The author having shown, in a paper lately communicated to the
Royal Society, that the effect of tartrate of ammonia on the acidity
of the urine was totally different from that of tartrate of potash, and
that carbonate of ammonia, taken in very large quantities, did not
produce any alkaline reaction of the urine, but that, on the con
trary, the acidity was rather increased than diminished by such
doses, repeated the experiments with carbonate     of ammonia, hoping
to obtain more decided results. Although, from these experiments,
it was again apparent that no diminution of the acid reaction re
sulted from taking carbonate of ammonia, yet the fact of any great
increase in the acidity of the urine could not be determined. In his
former paper, the author suggested that an inquiry into the occur
rence of nitric acid in the urine would probably give the solution of
this unexpected effect of carbonate of ammonia: and he was led to
undertake the experiments described in the present paper with the
view of detecting the presence of that acid under particular circum
stances.
   The indigo test for nitric acid being more delicate than the pro
tosulphate  of iron test, it was chiefly employed; but a mixture of
starch with a drop or two of hydriodate of potash and hydrochloric
acid was found to be a far more delicate test than either.       Begin
ning with 10 grs. of nitrate of potash added to 10 oz. of urine, it
was found at last that as little as 1 gr. of nitre to 10 oz. of urine
could be detected with the greatest certainty and clearness when the
starch test was used; but this quantity could not be detected as
surely by the indigo test.
   Experiments are described in which carbonate of ammonia was
given, in doses varying from 40 grs. to 7 grs., to a healthy man in
whose urine no nitric acid could previously be detected; and the
urine was tested at intervals of several hours after each dose. From
these it appears that 10 grs. was the smallest quantity that gave de
cided evidence of nitric acid by both tests.
   Having satisfied himself that when carbonate of ammonia was
taken small quantities of nitric acid passed off in the urine, the
author made similar experiments with tartrate of ammonia, admi
nistered in doses of 60 and 40 grs.; and in each case the starch test
gave evidence of the presence of nitric acid in the urine some hours
after.   Similar experiments with the muriate of ammonia are next
described; and in these the presence of nitric acid in the urine was

readily detected three hours after the administration of the dose,
even when it was so small as 10 grs.
   From an experiment described in the paper, it was shown, that by
a simple combustion of ammonia out of the body, as well as in the
body, nitric acid was produced. From other experiments it appears
that urea, also, by oxidation, whether in the body or out of the body,
gives rise to nitric acid.
   Having found that nitric acid was produced more readily and fre
quently than had been supposed to be the case, the author was led
to try whether combustions in the atmosphere without ammonia
could not give nitric acid.     The presence of this acid was, in con
sequence, detected in the products of the combustion of alcohol, of
coal, of a wax candle, and of hydrogen.
   As this led to the supposition that nitric acid might exist in rain
water at all times, experiments were made on the rain-water col
lected on wet days in London, and the presence of nitric acid was
discovered by the starch and also by the indigo test.
   The conclusions the author comes to from his experiments are:—
   1. That the action of oxygen takes place in the body, not only on
hydrogen, carbon, sulphur and phosphorus, but also on nitrogen.
   2. That in          all

   He further remarks, that the production            nitric acid from am     of
          the body adds another        the many instances
                                                                                                in of

degenerate into filamentous tissue. No striped fibres can be de

moves the lens forwards.        The author then observes, that, as the
effect of the action of the choroid muscle is to separate the choroid
coat from the sclerotic, all pressure is taken off the choroid veins at
the time it is made upon the ciliary processes, and therefore that
every facility possible is afforded for the emptying of the vessels of
these processes.     He hence infers that the office of these processes
is to allow of the displacement of fluid when the lens is carried for
wards; and when the choroid muscle ceases to act, by the re-disten
sion of their capillaries, to carry the lens back into            place. The                            its

circumstances regulating this change, which have been observed and
experimented upon by the author during the last forty years, are
explained in the paper. In the year 1835, he adopted a method of
ascertaining the supply of subterranean water, by the use of a very
simple but effective instrument, contrived and used by the late
Dr. Dalton for that purpose; and he has supplied a series of
monthly observations, extending over fourteen years, both of the
rain falling on the surface, and of that which is found to percolate
through to a lower level for the supply of springs and rivers.
   From his observations—
                                                                                        inches.

Total  average    annual amount of              percolation     ........           . . .  . 10-23
The rivers and springs supplied from the chalk are generally found
to be in fullest flow about June, and to be most reduced in Decem
ber; and the cause of this variation is considered to be the time
that the descending rain requires to percolate through the crevices
and fissures of the lofty chalk hills, and to spread laterally in the
reservoirs till it reaches the outlet springs.
   The variation in the quantity of rain is found to range from 21° 10
inches to 32:10 inches. The variation in the amount of percolation
is found to be far greater, viz. from 3:10 inches to 1928 inches.
Consequently there is a variation in the springs, and in the flow of
the rivers, much greater than in proportion to the fall of rain. The
author shows that the season of the rain falling is the main incident in
the supply of these perennial springs; and that their outflow is pro
portional to the percolation which takes place during winter into
the lower beds, the summer rains being evaporated or taken up by
vegetation.
    He gives it as his opinion, that it is possible to drain off, by arti
ficial means, great part of any river flowing out of the chalk; such
rivers being truly the natural drain and outlet of the subterranean
reservoir therein.    He shows, by precise measurements and care
fully recorded observations, that the subterranean water has a move
ment, with a declivity of 13 feet 6 inches to the mile, in the direc
tion of the dip of the strata and of the fall of the streams; and he
states that the crevices or water-channels in the chalk are larger in
the neighbourhood of a stream.         He therefore assumes that if a
large and deep well were sunk in any such locality, and the water
in    it,   by
          being pumped off               by
                                  steam-power, were brought down                              to

                  lower
                      a  level,   deep-seated
                                         a     artificial vent being thus
 formed, the water would be                so
                                   drained off from the reservoir that
the springs would       dried up, and the river

double compound with alumina soluble in boiling water, and that a
mixture of the two in the proportion in which they exist in this

changes in chemico-molecular constitution.
   M. Pasteur has carried forward this inquiry into a new channel by
tracing a connexion between this property in substances, of circularly
polarizing light, and their crystalline character.
   But as it would be impossible to explain the nature of his investi
gations, or their results, without a preliminary knowledge of the
meaning of the terms “circular polarization” and “hemihedrism,”
it was necessary first to enter a little upon the explanation of them.

having no relations to space which differed from each other in direc
tions perpendicular to        length.            its

It was shown,   however, that another specimen exhibited these colours
in the reverse order of red, orange, green, blue, plum-colour, red;
in which order the former specimen of quartz produced these colours
when the tourmaline was turned in the opposite direction.          Hence
these are termed right- and left-handed polarizations.      The whole of
these phaenomena were attributed to a complicated set of movements
of the light within the crystal, the resultant of which was practically
a rotation of the plane in which the ray was capable of being re
flected, so that the thicker the crystal, the further round the tour
maline had to be turned to permit the ray to pass                eclipsed,            it,   or

in which not every similar edge or angle               was modified, but where
every alternate similar edge or alternate similar angle was so. This
circumstance was then illustrated by the actual truncation of some
models; and it was shown that such alternately developed or hemi
hedral crystals may be right and left, the upper terminal modification
being to the right in the one case, and the corresponding and similar
lower terminal modification being then to the left, while in the other
case they are exactly the converse. Hence, one crystal                        Pasteur                      is,

 taric acid.      Yet when mixed they formed again the paratartaric
 acid, which, like the amethyst,             without any action

showed that here the acid must be supposed capable of combining
with an indefinite or indeed an infinite amount of water, while in
other cases again, bodies (such as sugar for instance) exercise no
effect upon the water and do not seem to combine with, but only to
be dissolved in it. The former is an instance of a continuous and not
intermittent sort of combination; and though we need not anticipate
a recurrence of the controversy of Berthollet and Proust, yet this
shows us that the actions of quantity or mass so dwelt on by the
former are not without a great significance; and that the power that
can thus enable us to determine such important points in chemical
statics, is well worthy of the attention of the philosophic mind.

            ON   THE PHOSPHORESCENCE OF CHALK STREAKS.
Th;       phosphorescence of streaks made with chalk upon a warm
      tile is brought forward by Mr. Napier, in the March Number of
the Philosophical Magazine, as opposed to the views recently published
by Dr. Draper.       It seems, however, to originate in a totally foreign
cause.    If the tile be placed on the cap of a gold-leaf electroscope,
the leaves diverge as soon as the streak is made.         All writers on
phosphorescence have carefully distinguished between the emission
of light by phosphorescence and by electricity.      Thus, as Dr. Dra
per's paper states, a diamond rubbed on gold will emit light, but it
will also shine after exposure to the sun. In the former case, it will
attract a hair or other light body; in the latter it will not. When
ever friction is required for luminosity, we may reasonably suspect
electrical disturbance.     Thus two pieces of quartz or sugar, rubbed
together, shine; and the electroscope shows one to be positive and
the other negative.       Quicksilver in an exhausted tube will emit a
milky glow on the slightest motion, an experiment formerly described
by Homberg as a phosphorus. Pieces of mica suddenly split asunder,
a stick of sealing-wax snapped across, dry paper torn, or an air-gun
discharged in the dark, produce light; but none of these are cases
of what is meant by phosphorescence. Mr. Napier's experiment
belongs to the same class, and does not seem in any manner to bear
on the views of Dr. Draper.
OBSERVATIONS           ON NITROUS ACID AND    THE SOLUTION OF NITRO
                       SULPHURIC ACID.     BY M. GUINON.
  In searching for the    cause of an accident which happened to silk
coloured rose   by  ammoniacal cochineal, and by which it was sud
denly decolorized, this was found to have been due to the presence
of nitrous acid in the sulphuric acid employed. M. Guinon states,
that he was certain that, if the sulphuric acid had been pure, it would
not have altered the ammoniacal cochineal, even after several days
of contact; he had made the experiment frequently.         The nitrous
acid itself merely turns the colour of an orange-red, without destroy
ing   it. The reaction observed could then        be

nitrous acid, which is sometimes met with in the sulphuric acid of
commerce; and to verify this opinion, the author proceeded synthe
tically.
   Sulphuric acid was       made to absorb nitrous vapours by direct
action   and thus produced nitrosulphuric          acid [acide azotosulfu
rique], which exerted upon cochineal the immediate decolorizing
action, which had been accidentally remarked.           It is evident that in
this reaction it is by the nitrous acid which is formed that the mixed
nitrosulphuric acid acts. The slight stability of this acid,             ten                                       its

    The author states that this solution serves not only as a decolo
 rizer, but to superoxidize several metals, especially iron.
    Ammoniacal cochineal may be employed to detect riºridth of
 nitrous acid in a solution by its immediate decoloration.     It is a
 more special and certain reagent than the sulphate of iron.—Comptes

  ON    THE COMPOSITION                      OF NULLIPORES                        AND SOME COR ALLINES.
                                             BY M. DAMOUR.
   The author submits to the Academy the result of researches which
 he commenced last year on the composition of certain marine orga
 nized bodies, known by the name of Nullipores.             These marine pro
 ductions, now classed with the Algae, at first sight resemble mineral
 concretions.      They assume various forms; sometimes that of coral
 loid  branches,    cauliflowers, lichen, &c. They possess nearly the
 colour, hardness, and tenacity of calcareous matter.                They are
 easily pulverized.     When immersed in a weak acid, all the earthy
 matter which they contain dissolves with effervescence; there remains
 a skeleton of organic vegetable matter, retaining precisely the form of
 the original specimen, and presenting the cellular tissue peculiar to
 the marine algae. This organic matter exhales the peculiar allia
 ceous odour which characterizes marine vegetables.               It is spongy
 and  nearly   transparent,   and is reduced to a    very small bulk by drying.
 Treated with solution of     potash  or soda, it does not dissolve either cold
 or hot, but it becomes more transparent, and thus behaves like most ve
 getable tissues. It burns with flame, and usually leaves very little ash.
    The author states his obligation to MM. Deshayes and Michelin
 for the first specimens which served for this examination.              Lately
 M. Decaisne      supplied   him with     more,   from the collection of the
 Museum of Natural History, belonging to well-known species.
    The following table exhibits the results of the analyses of various
 species:—

  The number 1, obtained on the coast of Bréhat (Manche), forms
considerable ridges, which are worked for obtaining hydraulic lime.
The specimen employed for analysis was slightly disintegrated on
the surface, and, as it were, fossilized. It is to this circumstance
that the author attributes its containing so little organic matter.
No. 3 was obtained by M. Deshayes on the coast of Algeria. This
species is developed in great abundance on a vast extent of this
coast, and precisely on those places where the shock of the waves is
felt most strongly.  The numbers 4 and 5, from the collection of the
Museum, were sent to the author by M. Decaisne.            It is to be re
marked, that the two last contain mere traces of carbonate of mag
nesia, whilst the four others contain from 8% to 17 per cent. of this
carbonate.    In fact, the numbers 5 and 6 belong to families which
are  very  distinct from the preceding.        The earthy matter which
covers them does not       penetrate  to the interior of the plant.   The
numbers   1, 2,  3 and  4,  are  intimately   penetrated with calcareous
and magnesian matter.
   The foregoing analyses seem to indicate that the groups of Coral
linaceae act the same part in the vegetable kingdom that the Polypi
and the greater part of the Mollusks do in the animal kingdom.         By
means of their   organization,  these  plants  have the faculty of decom
posing the water of the ocean, and to extract, secrete, and incorpo
rate principally lime and magnesia converted into carbonate. The
development of these vegetables on certain coasts and in low lands,
and consequently the deposits of magnesian limestone which they
must occasion, seem also deserving of consideration in the study of
geological formations.—Comptes Rendus, Fevrier 1851.
on   sulphur ET of   NITROGEN,     AND on sulphu R INsolubLE IN
     SULPHURET     OF CARBON.       BY MM. FORDOS AND GELIS.
   In Graham’s ‘Manual of Chemistry' there is a compound de
scribed by the name of Gregory's sulphuret of nitrogen, which is
said to be formed of 12 equivs. sulphur and 1 of nitrogen. We have
attempted to reproduce this singular substance, but the results                 ob
tained have led us not to admit its existence. We nevertheless                  fol
lowed the directions of Dr. Gregory. We treated the chloride of
sulphur with liquid ammonia; and after having observed              the  all
peculiarities which accompany the reaction, and which have been
described with the greatest care        by
                                         M. Soubeiran, we obtained               a
                                                                        of by
yellow substance, possessing      all the characters assigned       Dr.
Gregory   to   the sulphuret of  nitrogen, and especially that     fur
nishing  an  amethyst-red liquor when treated with alcohol containing
a little potash.   This coloration however quickly disappears.
   As this   property  likewise belongs      to
                                              mixture
                                                  a            of
                                                          sulphuret              of
nitrogen and sulphur,  it   appeared probable that    was due
                                                          it     these  to
two substances; and we had recourse            sulphuret
                                                  to        carbon of            to
ascertain their presence. This liquid dissolved the greater portion

of the mass. On evaporating the solution, it left a residue consisting
of numerous octahedra of sulphur, coated with a small quantity of
the ordinary sulphuret of nitrogen, and in some cases with traces of
a golden yellow substance, sparingly soluble in sulphuret of carbon,
and which proved to be a compound of chloride of sulphur with
sulphuret of nitrogen.     Whenever this happened, the residue re
quired to be frequently treated with sulphuret of carbon in order to
exhaust it; and the property of being coloured amethyst-red by an
alcoholic solution of potash persisted for a long time; for the com
bination in question possesses this property, as well as the mixture
of sulphur and sulphuret of nitrogen.
   The residue insoluble in the sulphuret of carbon was dried, then
reduced to powder and washed with hot distilled water, in order to
remove a small quantity of muriate of ammonia which it still con
tained.   We then found by analysis that it contained no nitrogen,
water, hydrogen or chlorine; it then occurred to us that it might
be an oxide of sulphur.     To test the accuracy of this hypothesis,
we treated a certain quantity of the substance with fuming nitric
acid, in order to estimate the sulphur; the weight of the sulphate of
baryta obtained showed that it consisted entirely of sulphur.          But
we have stated above that it was insoluble in sulphuret of carbon;
it was therefore not ordinary, but a modified sulphur, analogous to
the amorphous modification of phosphorus examined by M. Schroetter.
   M. Deville published in 1848, in connexion with several important
observations on sulphur, the remarkable fact, that sulphur which
has experienced sudden cooling leaves, when treated with sulphuret
of carbon, an appreciable residue, varying from 0-11 to 0-35 of the
original weight. It was evident that the insoluble sulphur which we
had found in trying to prepare Dr. Gregory's sulphuret of nitrogen,
was the sulphur discovered by M. Deville in the flowers of sulphur
and the soft sulphur.    M. Deville however attributes this modifica
tion of the sulphur to sudden cooling; but this explanation, which
applied to the peculiar circumstances under which he observed                          it,
cannot be admitted       the case we have described,
                          in                                         as

rides of sulphur with water. This result clearly proves that            Dr.       in
Gregory's experiment the ammonia merely gives rise                 various   to
compounds, which mix with the sulphur and alter                   its
                                                           properties.

the formation of one of these modifications under water.

     To the albumen of two fresh eggs add three drachms of saturated
 solution of chloride of sodium, beat it up with a wooden fork into a
 very thick froth, let it stand for twelve hours.       Pour the liquor upon
 a flat   dish,  and let one surface of the   paper  remain in contact with
 the liquor for forty or fifty seconds; then lift the paper carefully and
 with an even motion, and pin up by one corner to dry for several
 hours. When perfectly dry, place it between two sheets of writing
 paper, and pass four or five times over it very quickly an iron, as
 hot as may be without scorching the paper. When cool, put it upon
a solution of nitrate of silver (two drachms to an ounce of distilled
 water) spread upon a glass plate, and let it rest there four or five
 minutes; then hang up to dry. When the impression is taken, fix
 in the usual way.
    By this method the picture becomes varnished; and a force, sharp
 ness, and brilliancy are produced not easily obtainable by other

    GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE AND PUBLICATION OF SCHOOL
              BOOKS AND ELEMENTARY WORKS OF SCIENCE.
    We would direct the attention of our readers to the correspondence
between Lord John Russell and Messrs. Longman and Co. and
 Mr. Murray, as recently published by them, copies of which we
 append to our present Number.
    The attempt to establish under the patronage of Government a
 monopoly of school-books to be produced at the public expense, is
 reprehensible, not merely as regards the just principles of trade, but
 as being entirely hostile to the interests of science, whether we con
sider the means of its advancement and diffusion, or the benefit of
those who are engaged in their promotion.
    The production of elementary works of the best kind, adapted to
the continually progressive state of the sciences, must ever be an
object of great importance, and should freely be left in the hands of
those men of science who are best able to supply them, and of whose
competence the scientific public are the best judges.
    The measure complained of tends directly to the establishment of
a   monopoly,     fostered by the irresponsible favoritism of some Board
or Commission (probably, as in many instances of late, under the
influence of forward quacks and pretenders who easily impose them
selves on members of the Government); and such favoritism and
adventitious aid must evidently tend to the discouragement and
eventual prohibition of works, however superior, which cannot con
tend against such unfair advantages.
    Nor must it be overlooked, that the public money thus to be ex
pended is in part levied upon those who come unaided into the field

of competition with a heavy duty on paper and other imposts to
contend with.
  As might be expected, some of the participators of this govern
ment patronage have had no scruple in appropriating the labours of
others; and Government has actually had to pay 600l. of public
money to compromise a case of piracy perpetrated under    sanction.                                                its

1.          important question, whether the direction of vibration
        in plane-polarized light is normal or parallel to the plane
of polarization, is equivalent to this —whether the velocity of
propagation of a rectilinear transverse vibratory movement in the
medium which transmits light in crystallized bodies is a function
of the direction of vibration only, or of the position of the plane
which includes the direction of vibration and the direction of trans
1722sston.
  The former of these views was adopted by Fresnel, as being
necessary to explain the phaenomena of polarization by reflexion;
and in Mr. Green's investigation of the laws of these phaenomena,
in which the conclusions of Fresnel are shown to agree either
exactly or approximately with the consequences of strictly mecha
mical principles, the same supposition is adopted.
   But if we follow the generally received theory, that the differ
ent velocities of differently polarized rays in crystalline bodies
are due solely to the different degrees of elasticity possessed by
the vibrating medium in different directions, Fresnel's supposition
must be abandoned and the opposite one adopted.            For if there
is any  proposition     more certain than others  respecting   the laws
of elasticity, it is this:—that the transverse elasticity of a medium,
or the elasticity which resists distortion of the particles, depends
upon the position of the plane of distortion, being the same for
 alldirections    of distortion      given plane.
                                        ina         This law      impli         is

account for the immense velocity of light, the masses of the
atomic nuclei must be supposed to be very small as compared
with the mutual forces exerted by them.
    In stating the third supposition of the hypothesis, the nuclei
are said to vibrate independently, or almost independently, of their
atmospheres; for the absolute independence of their vibrations
is probably an ideal case, not realized in nature, though ap
proached very nearly in the celestial space, where the atomic
atmospheres must be inconceivably rarefied.

inversely proportional to the corresponding velocities of trans
mission. Then will the velocity of transmission of any trans
verse vibratory movement be sensibly proportional to the reci
procal of a diameter of that ellipsoid, drawn parallel to the
direction of vibration.    And if a plane be drawn through the
centre of the ellipsoid parallel to a series of plane-waves, the two
axes of the elliptic section so made will represent in magnitude
 the reciprocals of the greatest and least normal velocities of
 transmission of waves parallel to that plane, and in direction, the
 corresponding directions of vibration.
    This agrees exactly with the construction given by Fresnel,
 on which his entire theory of double refraction is founded.
    The degree of symmetry and uniformity of arrangement of
 the atoms which is necessary in order that the mean interval
 may have a definite value, and that three axes of distribution
 may exist, is the same which is necessary to the existence of
 rectangular axes of elasticity in a solid body.           It must extend,
 round each    point, throughout   a space which is     large  as compared
 with the sphere of appreciable molecular action.
    The experiments of Sir David Brewster and of Fresnel on the
 action of compressed glass on polarized light, show that rays
 polarized in a plane normal to the direction of compression, that
 is to say, vibrations parallel to that direction, are accelerated.
 This indicates that the atmospheric load on each vibrating nucleus
 in that direction is diminished, probably by the displacement of
 a portion of the atmosphere out of that line.

LXII.     On the Magnetic Azes of Crystals, and their relation to
     Crystalline Form and to the Optic Aires. By Prof. Plücker
     and Dr. BEER+.
                                              Introduction.
1.
     To      the discovery of Faraday, that the magnet acts upon
                 all
                bodies      nature, attaches itself the new fact, that
                                    in
this action       modified
                     is           peculiar manner when the body
                                          in  a                                                                        is
crystalline.
     2.According          Faraday, bodies range themselves
                               to                                        two                                 in
great classes, the magnetic and the diamagnetic.                regard the                I
diamagnetic phaenomena originally described                 him just                 by                           as
                                                                                                                   I

                               as               induction, with this dif
ference only, that                  by
                            the induction       magnetic substances the
north   pole  excites    south apole, and the south pole        north pole;                   a
whereas         by
               the induction                   of
                                     diamagnetic substances the north
pole excites     north pole, and the south pole

be, that      magnetic substances molecular currents are excited
                in
which have the same direction             the inducing stream, whereas
                                                        as
in diamagnetic substances the molecular currents have               opposite                          an
direction.     Could we succeed          rendering   the induced currents

the  opinion,   that the coercive   force,   which varies   considerably
different magnetic substances, must also              exhibited      cases  be                        in
diamagnetic induction, and that               comparatively greater here

fests itself  particularly   therein,  that the polarity once conferred
does not vanish with the inducing stream.                 have proved this       I
with bismuth. The coercive force manifests itself also                    the                                 by
fact, that when       body possesses              high degree,

     uently also with the distance from them, than the diamagnetic
induction, is readily explained; a law whose validity receives
manifold support from the experiments detailed further on.
    4. With regard to the modification of magnetic and diamag
netic induction brought about by crystallization, I must refer
back to the question as it stood on the publication of the pro
gramme of this university, August 3, 1849, a complete transla
tion of which has found a place in the Annales de Chimie et de
 Physique.      It is there stated, that in crystals which belong to
the tesseral system, the common magnetic and diamagnetic action
is not modified; that in crystals with one optic axis, the latter
 is attracted or repelled according as the crystal is positive or
 negative, and that in crystals possessing two optic axes, the
 attraction or repulsion extends to both. Not without caution
 was the last assertion written down.          I was quite conscious that
 a foreign   admixture of iron     might   have been present in some of
 the experiments from which I had made deductions; and again,
 a theoretic difficulty presented itself in the fact, that the division
 of crystals with two axes into positive and negative is not an
 essential one, the difference disappearing in those crystals whose
 axes, as in the case of sulphate of iron, are at right angles to
 each other.      In the place of the former hypothesis I then tried
 to substitute    another,   that an action on Fresnel's three axes of
 elasticity takes place.       I will here cite the words of the pro
 gramme itself:-
     “Rejecta aliquamdiu hypothesi a nobis de actione magnetis
 in axes opticos posita (namque si invenire velis, ne anxius inter
 pretationem jam a te inventa explicantem retineas, vide) nobis
 problema proposuimus annon, pro illa hypothesi, phaenomena
 explicari possent e sola aetheris in crystallis distributione a Fresnel
 exposita.     Etenim illa linea media in crystallis positivis, in quibus
 attrahitur, minimae, atque in negativis, in quibus repellitur,
 maximac elasticitatis est axis.         Corpus fingamus inter polos    ita
 suspensum,   ut    circum gravitatis centrum   ei   libere rotandi data
 sit  facultas, atque circum idem centrum notam illam ellipsoi
 dicam superficiem descriptam, cujus radii vectores elasticitatum
 quadratis sunt aequi. Nonne, fortasse quaeris, tale corpus       ita diri
 gitur ut   minimus    ellipsoidis axis cum linea concidat  polos conjun
 gente :     Nonne,  si     circum verticalem tantum axem torqueri
 potest, eum situm petit, quo elasticitatis minoris directiones ante
 ceteras polis, adversae sunt      .
                                   .
                                   ..   .    Itaque haec hypothesis est
 relinquenda.” (P. 21.)
     Further experience since that time pronounces    it a   vain attempt
     endeavour  to                      of
                     refer the difference     magnetic actionin  different
    rections  through     the   crystalto   the different  density of  the
                                                                        all of
       in
     her    these directions....
                              I         at
                                      felt    that time the necessity
     lertaking the former observations anew, and        of   applying

and their relation to Crystalline Form and to the Optic Awes.                                           449
the means which an increased acquaintance with the subject
placed at my disposal.    It was necessary that the facts which
led to my hypothesis should be multiplied, and by new optic and
magnetic experiments rendered irrefragable.
   5. Beforehand, however,it was necessary to ascertain with greater
accuracy the nature of the force to which the phaenomena were
due.   I have stated the question with perfect distinctness in the
programme, but had not at the time an answer to           Whence                           it.
        arise, that  prism    tourmaline suspended horizontally
                                             is of

each other, but recedes from them when the poles are removed
to   greater distance, the mass

                                                each half retires      of
                                                                       far                          as
as    possible      the poles when the tourmaline
                     from                                      suspended                  is
from its middle; and when hung                      able      so
                                                            rotate round
                                                                      as   to   be    to
one end, the centre       gravity  of                   of
                                       the entire mass recedes from
the nearer and more strongly attracting pole.
      We have therefore first of all an attraction
      6.                                                     the mass of              of
the crystal  and  repulsion                  of
                                  certain direction
                                               a      through   the same.
This     the expression which describes the phaenomena
           is                                                         they                         as
exhibit themselves.      Quite identical therewith        the statement              is
that the crystal      differently attracted
                            is                     different directions;    in
 assuch         an
             action can      mechanically
                                        be   resolved into        uniform                      a
attraction       of
               the entire mass, and        attraction     repulsion
                                                               an                    or                 ofa
certain direction.                 Not   an    iota more    explained  is  the latter      by
assumption           as   long     as   we    do  not enter upon   the nature     the               of
active forces.

 nation which     have
                     I
 expressed the same modified conception           the programme:–           in
    “Quo modo enim       phaenomena    explicare  vis? Non displiceret
 nobis pomere,       aethere gyros Ampericos inductione, una aut
                          in

 quod idem, crystallum inductione magneticum, polos secundum
 axium opticorum directionem adipisci: nisi haec nova videndi
 ratio etiam attractionem aut repulsionem massae posceret, solo
 axium situ mutatam.       Quae actio diversa non observatur.”
      7.The last assertion refers    direct experiments which seemed
                                                       to
 to  speak against the assumption                                 of

phaenomena heretofore observed can            completely explained        be                                         by
calculation.
                                                                        byof

is,that    the same crystallization,

                                                               of
axes also correspond.    When the substance      the crystal   one                  of                          at

time is homogeneous and essentially (not by accidental mixture)
magnetic, at another time homogeneous and diamagnetic, the
attraction of the axis must be changed into repulsion, and vice
ºersa.
     14. As both ends of a thin iron bar become poles, we are
hereby furnished with a simple means of representing the de
portment of the crystals in the magnetic field. A prism of
tourmaline will be imitated in this way by an indifferent bar of
brass at right angles, to which a number of little magnetic bars
                A prism of staurolite will be completely imitated
                                                            i.
are fixed.
by fixing the little magnetic bars so that they shall           equally
inclined to the axis of the brass bar; the directions of the former
 indicate the two magnetic axes of the crystal.
     15. The mathematical theory assumes a different attraction of
 the mass of the crystal in different directions; and hence the
experiments      communicated    in (7), which show no perceptible
 difference in this respect, present at first sight a difficulty.   But
 it is easy  to see that in the neighbourhood    of the poles  the rela
tive difference may be weaker or may even disappear, while at
 greater distances it may decidedly exhibit itself.      Holding fast
 by the way of representing the matter given in the last paragraph,
 if we suppose the little magnetic bars shortened until their dimen
 sion in the direction of the axis exceeds but little the dimension
 perpendicular thereto, in the crystal thus imitated the magnetic
 induction will be in the direction of the axes, but near the poles
 the common magnetic induction will take place.
     16. Messrs. Tyndall and Knoblauch, in the memoirs referred
 to, of later date, have arrived at results very nearly similar to
 those mentioned in (12) and (13). Their reasoning would naturally
 have been different had my memoir of December 1849 been
 known to them.       In consequence of my new way of viewing the
  subject, many of my old opinions must be modified. This point,
 however, will be more suitably treated after the communication
  of the experimental investigations which myself and Dr. Beer
 have made together.
     While in many respects the views of the above-named           phy
  sicists agree with mine, their fundamental view is different.     The
  theory of Faraday, who first observed the attraction of the mag
  netic axes, and defined these axes (magnecrystallic axes) as stand
  ing perpendicular to the surfaces of cleavage (in bismuth, anti
  mony, arsenic, sulphate of iron, and sulphate of nickel), has been
  also adopted by them; being merely thereby modified, that they
  introduce the opposite deportment of magnetic and diamagnetic
  crystals as a new portion of the subject.     To decide how far the
  phaenomena coincide with this view, belongs to the discussion of
  the experiments.     From the first, however, it would appear that

                                                                    the

And these are the causes which, acting together, determine the

                                                 the important question,
whether every ultimate particle             mass     magnetic,

the above-named       physicists,       whether the same ather whose
                                                    or
oscillations produce light can produce magnetism and electricity
when otherwise excited.          By the latter assumption the all-pene
trating aether would transmit the action                 both       the same    of              in

            obtain the undeniable result, that the crystal                 negative              is

    The next crystals examined are nitrate                soda, which       ofnega                    is

impure spar examined first by Messrs. Tyndall and Knoblauch;
oxide of iron, strongly magnetic, axis attracted; beryl, magnetic,
negative, axis repelled; arseniuret of lead, axis repelled; diop
tase, negative,      axis repelled; bismuth, optic axis strongly
attracted; antimony, the optic axis stands as in bismuth, per
pendicular to the plane of most eminent cleavage, and was for
merly found to be repelled: the authors now suppose that the
repulsion was due to a slight admixture of iron; arsenic, optic
axis attracted; the specimens formerly experimented with con
tained iron; ice, optic axis attracted, crystal positive; quartz,
with a battery often of Grove’s cells, showed no action; the action
formerly observed was due to the contact of an iron hammer.
    The second class of crystals examined are those whose funda
mental form is the rectangular prism.
    Sulphate of nickel was found to be negative, optic axis re
pelled; molybdate of lead, vesuvian and arseniate of potash
also negative, optic axes repelled; zircon, positive, optic axis
attracted; yellow ferrocyanide of potassium shows no action;
acetate of copper and lime positive, optic axis attracted; uranite,
negative, optic axis attracted, perhaps analogous to the case of
antimony; one specimen of scapolite had                        its
                                                      optic axis attracted,
a  second    specimen   showed          no

Brewster     is negative.
    Crystals possessing two optic axes were next examined, com
 mencing with those whose fundamental form                  right rhombic

On certain Questions relating to the Theory of Probabilities.                                  459
represents the quantity of our belief beforehand that the grains
will be distributed in the proposed way. As a numerical ex
ample, suppose six grains thrown into a box divided into three
compartments;     the seven possible modes of distribution are
6,0,0;         1, 2, 4,0; 3, 3,0; 1, 1,4; 1, 2,3; 2, 2,2; and
                    5,0;
their respective probabilities are fractions whose common deno
                                                              -º-
minator is 243, and numerators 1, 12, 30, 20, 30, 120, 30. In
the general case, the probability of equal distribution, or of each
compartment containing                   r grains,       is
   3. Now it would of course be a gross fallacy in principle,
though it may often happen to produce small numerical errors,
to confound these à priori probabilities with the a posteriori pro
babilities which are the subjects of investigation in cases where
a particular distribution is known to eaist, or is asserted to have
happened.       And nothing can be objected to Professor Forbes's
remarks on this head, except that he appears to think that
mathematicians      are in the habit of committing the fallacy in
question, and even to doubt the possibility of treating such pro
blems mathematically at all. On this part of the subject so
much was said in the former paper that little need be here added.
There are two questions, however, which deserve further discus
sion, especially as one of them involves an apparent difficulty.
    4. The first question        what    is,
                                           the accountis    our surprise       of

equal distribution       the grains
                               of                 of a
                                        rice) has happened accidentally?
It   iscertainly not accounted for                    by
                                             comparison    a  the priori        of       a
probabilities       the possible symmetrical and unsymmetrical
                      of
events; because, although           the case supposed
                                             in              equal distri      an
bution    isreally less probable priori than many other possible

                      it   is        to
                                conceive other cases       which        thein                all
à  priori probabilities are equal, but          which our surprise
                                                               in                                  at
                                                                                                    a
 symmetrical event would         quite     great. For instance, suppose
                                         2, be           as
 100 counters marked                1,   3,
                                     &c. thrown into     box containing   a
 100 compartments similarly numbered. The probability that
 each counter will fall into the compartment marked with the
 corresponding number,          beforehand exactly the same
                                        is                              the                  as
 probability        of
                  any other determinate event.      Yet         had reason if       we
to   believe that such        distribution,
                                    a             any other following
                                                                or                                      a
 simple law, had really happened,            should       we

     5. The most obvious answer             this questionto     first sight         at
 would be, that            we
                        mentally   divide      the  possible  all
                                                               events into
 two parcels; one containing                   all
                                      the regular    symmetrical events,
                                                                     or
 and the other           all
                     the irregular events; and that the former parcel
                                                  2

460               Prof. Donkin on certain Questions relating to
 being much smaller than the latter, it is a priori much more
 likely that some irregular event will happen than some regular
 one. But it is immediately seen that this explanation is unsatis
 factory, because the division into parcels is perfectly arbitrary.
 We might just as well divide the events into a small and a large
 parcel on any other principle, and then be surprised at the oc
 currence of an event belonging to the smaller parcel. In fact,
 if this account of the matter were admitted, it would merely
 prove that the surprise felt on such occasions results from a fal
 lacy, and that a well-instructed person ought not to be surprised
 at all; a conclusion repugnant to experience and common sense.
 Nor is the difficulty removed by the supposition, that in the case
 of a regular event we involuntarily consider it as having been
predicted, or at least singled out and contemplated         beforehand.
 For the   probability  of an event is in no   way  altered by the fact
of   itshaving been predicted;        that      so happen after being
                                                              if    it
predicted, there          more reason for surprise,
                           is   no                        far      priori     so            as
                                                                                            a
probabilities only are concerned, than there would have been
without the prediction.
     6.
      I   conceive that the true answer       this question
                                                          to     that                     of is,         in

what    obviously true
          is                         in fact, that our surprise depends entirely
upon our knowledge               of   the causes which might have been sup
posed     produce the phaenomenon, and
           to                                                      of

                         much  surprised;   whereas,          could                   if     he

bability of the phaenomenon would be the same in both cases.
But in one case he would know that other causes might have
produced it much more easily than accident; in the other, he
would not know this.          It is to be observed, however, that in
fact, however strong the a priori evidence might be of the
absence of any cause but accident, it would be outweighed by the
evidence afforded by a certain degree of symmetry, of the inter
ference of some regulating cause.           So that the surprise could
never go beyond a certain point, at which it would be superseded
by a conviction that the phaenomenon was not accidental.
    7. I have thought it worth while to say so much upon this
question, because it seems to involve something more like a real
difficulty than any other connected with the subject.           The above
explanation appears to me to be perfectly satisfactory, and to be
equally in accordance with the mathematical theory and with
common sense.                 I
                       am far from supposing that there is anything
original in        it,
                  though     am not able
                                    I         refer       any place where
                                                                   to              to
the  difficulty     explicitly
                        is      mentioned and discussed.
    The second question alluded          above      little more than the
                                                          to                is
               that which has just been examined. Why
               of                                                                                      do

easily believe recorded events, which beforehand would have
enormous       priori improbability
               à                         such, for instance,
                                                        ?         any par                         as

general explanation goes, what has been said above will suggest
a  sufficient answer.     But will hardly

 putting for Q., the probability of throwing, in one trial with the
 s dice, r different doublets, and s—2r numbers not repeated.
 Now the calculation of this probability is easily seen to be merely
 the problem of art. 2 in a different form. In general, the pro
 bability of throwing a single numbers, b doublets, c triplets, &c.
 in one trial, will be
                  t(t–1)(t–2)...                (t-a-b-e-...                        + 1)

 (where s must not be confounded with the s of art. 2). In the
 case of r doublets and s—2r  single numbers,  the denominator
 of the second factor becomes

 possession of          all

   The sums, as we see, differ very little. In these cases, the
principal sections of the two spars were parallel when that of
the analyser was about 20 degrees to the left of zero.
     All
       the precautions which we have indicated being taken, and
the  analyser  being fixed in such a position that the image which
fell upon the pile was extinguished, the calorific action being at
the same time equal 0, a tube of glass, terminated by two parallel
glass plates and filled with an active liquid, the essence of tur
pentine, for example, or a syrup of sugar, was placed in the path
of the rays. The luminous image immediately reappeared, and
with it the thermoscopic action.         But both of them could be
again rendered 0 by a proper rotation of the analyser.
   In support of this assertion, we will cite some of the numbers
obtained by observing the rotation impressed upon the heat
which accompanies the green rays during their passage through
a tube 0.15 millim. in length, and filled with the essence of tur
pentine. The plane of primitive polarization being vertical, and
the line 0°–180° of the limb which measured the rotation of
                                          of all
the analyser being also vertical,         calorific action was extin
guished before the interposition          the active fluid when the
principal section   ofthe analyser was      90 degrees.

   After the  interposition   of
                               the  liquid,    deviationa   14°5 was      of
obtained for the same position       ofthe prism, whereas when the
principal section was    atthe zero     the division, only
                                         of                  deviation        a
of  5-5 was obtained. The luminous          image    and the calorific
action disappeared completely when the said section was          —32               at
degrees.
   These facts prove incontestably, that the plane       polarization    of
of the calorific rays, when transmitted across      optically       an
                                                                active
liquid, experiences  a rotationof bythe same kind and       the same          in
sense      as
         that experienced       the luminous rays. With regard
to the absolute   magnitude         of
                                this rotation, some difficulty lay                        in

   The law of lengths exhibits itself here also ; and we observe,
as in the case of light, that the absolute magnitude of the rota
tion increases with the refrangibility.
    The diminution is the same as long as we do not operate on
the rays immediately bordering upon the obscure portion of the
spectrum. Near this limit an apparent difference is exhibited,
which, however, is easy to be explained.           The calorific rotation
appears notably less than the optic rotation; in some experiments
with a column of turpentine 0.05 millim. long, the rotations of
light and heat have differed more than two degrees.
    This fact can also be proved in the following manner:—
    With a column of the essence 0:15 millim. long it was neces
sary, in order to extinguish the red image as effectually as pos
sible, to turn the analyser to +40 degrees from                 primitive                      its
                of In

a  deviation      0-6.      was necessary

this point, however, the luminous image was very visible.
    It  appears       to     us
                        that this difference may        accounted for            be                                in

                                                 to of of

obscure portion,             on
                         account                            its

and the angle corresponding            this portion was found.    For the
rotation  of   the luminous     portion,      the contrary, that  on   the                            of

amount of rotation with rays of different refrangibilities. We
filled a tube 0.10 millim. in length with a solution prepared in
this manner. The green and the red polarized rays experienced
in passing through it an equal rotation from right to left of
nearly 6; degrees.     The rotation of the calorific rays which
accompanied          them was also the same, as may be seen from the
following numbers:—

   It follows from this, that the deviations are the same at +40
degrees and at         -53

   The laws of the phaenomenon are therefore the same for both
agents, and the identity throughout the details is most minute.
Thus, with regard to the rotary power, that which is true for a
ray of the luminous spectrum is also true for the calorific ray
which accompanies         Now, according

474                On the Effect       of Fluid Friction in drying Steam.
Further, by applying the same procedure to heat proceeding
from different sources, we shall have a new method of ascertain
ing whether the differences in the reflexion of those rays from
the same metallic mirror are, or are not, a consequence of a cor
responding difference in the lengths of the undulations.
    The authors have also proved, that the relative quantities of
solar heat reflected from different mirrors, both glass and me
tallic, correspond with the relative quantities of solar light re
flected from the same mirrors; and that the formulae developed
by Fresnel for glass, and by M. Cauchy for metallic mirrors,
apply equally to the calorific and to the luminous phaenomena.
LXV.       Note on the Effect of Fluid Friction in drying Steam which
     issues from a High-pressure Boiler through a small Orifice into
     the open Air.    By Prof. W. Thomson *.
     a letter to Mr. Joule written last October, and since pub
 IN lished  in the Philosophical Magazinet, I pointed out that
 the remarkable discovery (made independently by Messrs. Ran
 kine and Clausius), that steam allowed to expand requires heat
to be added to it to prevent any part of it from becoming lique
fied, can only be reconciled with the known fact of the dryness
of steam issuing into the open air from a high-pressure boiler
through a small aperture, by taking into account the heat deve
loped by the fluid friction in the neighbourhood of the aperture.
I  may add, that the immediate mechanical effect of the work
done by the steam in pressing out, is the generation of                viva          vis
in  the fluid; and              all

476          Prof. Potter        on the      Solution       of the     Problem        of Sound.
I have   discovered these correct methods is open to discussion.
I believe  that my solution of the interesting case of diverging
streams of air has no competitor which can approximate to an
explanation of the facts.   In regard to the numerical velocity of
sound it is otherwise; and                       I
                                have to acknowledge a very great
oversight in the computations on which the close agreement with
the true velocity, stated at the end of my first paper on sound,
was based.    The error is this: using Poisson's numbers in cal
culation,       I
            omitted to see that the ratio of the density of mer
cury to the density of the air there given was for the temperature
of freezing, and of course the velocity of sound calculated there
from should have been compared with the experimental velocity
at the freezing-point. My theoretical velocity with these data
comes out thirty-two feet per second more than the experimental
result.
   Mr. Rankine, in his paper in the last Number, appears still to
misunderstand the bearing of the method on which Poisson's
solution of the problem of sound is obtained.
   We have a an unknown function of s, and of the same sign

of translation may be, and usually                 left out         is,

                               concentrated         the same points.   on
   It     had  always    appeared        me that the lenses generally the
                                                        to

         for     measuring the Intensity        of the   Photogenic         Rays.           481
most active were those in which the two foci were the most sepa
rated. Such a result seems obvious when it is corroborated by
the following facts and observations:—
    Sir John Herschel, from the commencement of the discovery
of photography, had expressed the opinion, that when lenses
were not achromatic, they had a greater photogenic power than
when achromatic, for the reason that in the former the photo
genic rays were separated from the red, orange and yellow rays,
endowed with an antagonistic action.
    M. Lerebours of Paris has proved, that, in throwing red,
orange or yellow rays on the photogenic part of the spectrum
formed on a Daguerreotype plate, the action was entirely im
peded or less rapid than when these last were insulated.
    I  have myself demonstrated, by a long series of experiments
 published in former memoirs, the antagonism of the red, orange
 and yellow rays; and I must not omit to mention, that Dr.
 Draper of New York, and Messrs. Fizeau and Foucault of Paris,
 have proved the same fact by some very conclusive experiments.
    All these observations tended to the conclusion, that the most
 active lenses were those in which the photogenic focus was the
 most separated from the visual focus; but we had no demon
 strable proof that the effect was a consequence of such a theory.
 This has induced me to endeavour to find some means by which
 the power of lenses having their foci separated could be com
 pared with those in which they coincide; and I have contrived
 an instrument which appears completely to fulfill this purpose,
 and several others not less useful.
    I shall now proceed to describe the instrument which        call a                  I
 Dynactinometer (see fig. 3),             its
                                  object being generally    measure               to
 the actinic power resulting both from the intensity
 radiation and from the construction of lenses.

 484     M. A. Claudet on     the Dynactinometer,    an Instrument
 mine beforehand the comparative sensitiveness of the plates which
 are to be used in the experiment with the dynactinometer.            By
 this means I can     try beforehand several   couples    of plates, and
keep them as it were stamped with their degree of sensitiveness
       I
until want to apply them to test the power of two lenses. The
 impression is made on one-half of the plate, leaving the other
 half for the image of the dynactinometer.
    After having operated in the two camerae obscurae, each sup
 plied with the lenses the power of which       I   wish to compare,   I
 submit the two plates, each impressed with both the photogra
phometer and dynactinometer, to the vapour of mercury, which
 developes the two images on each plate.
    The number of spots given by the photographometer will in
 dicate the sensitiveness of the plate; and in comparing the two
 images given by the dynactinometer, accounting for the differ
 ence of sensitiveness of each plate, if there is any, I am able at
 once to determine the comparative power of the two lenses.
    During a great number of experiments,         I have observed that
the power of the two lenses is not always in the same ratio.          It
 appears that some kind of light affects one lens more than
another; so that two different object-glasses, compared at
various times, do not always indicate the same proportion in
their power.
    A similar and as extraordinary an anomaly is observed in com
paring the power of different parts of the same lens through
equal apertures.      Generally, a given aperture on any extreme
zone of a lens has a greater photogenic power than the same
aperture on the centre or near it; and the power of these two
different parts is not always in the same ratio, although each
will give a visual image of the same intensity.
    Before  I  had ascertained this fact, I had observed that the
use of diaphragms reducing the aperture, say to #, #, or #, did
not always reduce the photogenic power in the same proportion.
Sometimes,     if I was able to obtain an impression in ten seconds
with the whole aperture of the lens,      I had no effect in twenty
seconds when      using a  diaphragm   reducing   the aperture exactly
one-half.
    Having mentioned this fact to several photographers, and
particularly to Mr. Malone, who in his photographic operations
is a most attentive observer, they have stated to me that they
had often met with the same anomaly in the Daguerreotype as
well as in the Talbotype processes.      I  have been struck with the
analogy existing between these various facts and my experiments
on the variation in the distance separating the two foci, and
from them     I am tempted to risk an hypothesis for the explana
tion of the cause of that variation.

           for    measuring the Intensity               of the      Photogenic            Rays.         485
   In comparing the difference between the two foci given by
rays refracted by several points of any object-glass,      have found                     I
that the difference is greater for the parts of the object-glass the
most distant from the centre.      This must be due to the imper
fection of the chromatic   correction, which imperfection is greater
for the most   oblique  pencils than for those which become gra
dually more parallel, as they are refracted from parts nearer
the centre of the lens.
   There is a certain proportion of       the rays           all
                                                        the spectrum,            of
which, when combined, possess           great photogenic power
                                                        as              a                                as
the pure insulated photogenic rays.         This condition happens
when the   atmosphere      pure  and the
                                   is     light perfectly white.
      In
      these  circumstances,   the proportion      yellow rays            of                         is

neutralize the photogenic action in the centre of the lens in a
different proportion.
   Therefore two different lenses of the same curvatures, and of
the same density and dispersion, may not manifest the same
degree of chromatic correction; and moreover, the chromatic
correction may comport differently in each glass according to the
variation in the colour of the light combined with the colour or
other properties of the glass itself+.
   From the preceding observations it follows, that the colour of
the glasses, the degree of their chromatic aberration in the
several points of the lens, may produce the same result; for
according to the chromatic correction of these various points,
more or less yellow rays and more or less photogenic rays may
be concentrated from the centre to the circumference, and the
neutralizing action of the yellow rays may consequently        be
greater in the centre of one lens than in the centre of another.
Then the separation of the two foci, in two object-glasses, may,
by the influence of the same light, undergo a change in an ano
malous direction.
   The general colour of light in different climates may also
modify the achromatism of the photogenic rays; and for this
reason the two foci may be more or less separated in Vienna or
Paris than in London, and a great difference may be observed
in using the same lenses in Europe or in America. We should
therefore be exposed to great errors if we were to be guided by
the fixed mode of compensation indicated beforehand on the tube
of the object-glass; and it is impossible to dispense with ascer
taining frequently the exact position of the photogenic focus by
means       of the focimeter.
      It
       is important to consider that the mathematical focus exists
only for one plane; nevertheless the objects placed beyond and
within that plane in a moderate limit can be represented with
sufficient correctness.    It is therefore possible to obtain a pass
able  image  at some distance from the mathematical focus, but that
distance must not be too great.       In taking portraits, the object
glass must represent at the same time parts situated in various
planes, in an interval of at least two feet.  It is impossible to
have an exact focus for      these   all
                                    parts; but none must      too              be

 $(uu) a parallel and equal force acting at a point whose distance
from the origin is u, it is required to determine the form of the
                                                    I
junction b. In what follows attach the usual signification to
 u-Fu', and by p(u0)+$(u'U') I mean the mechanical effect which
 is produced upon the rigid body by the simultaneous action of
the forces U and U' acting at the
points u andu'respectively. U+U'
means the resultant of U and U",
or the mechanical effect produced
by U and U' acting at the same
point.
    It is immediately obvious that
 $(u0) + p(u0')=p(u, U+U").
Hence q is distributive as regards U, and we may therefore put
                                       $(uu)=({(u))U.
   Again, suppose the two parallel and equal forces UU to act at
B  and C respectively, O being the origin, OB-u, OC=w': then
it is clear that these two forces produce the same effect as U at
D and U at O (BD and CD being parallel to OC and OB):
hence, expressing this by the assumed notation, we find
                  (*(u)) U+($(u) U-($(u-w'))U+U;
therefore
                              $(u) +        p(u)=            p(u +   u')   +   1,
Ol'
                 {{(u)-1}          +    (p(u')–1}             =  {{(u      +   u')–1}.
Whence       it    appears that the function                    p(u)—l          is   distributive; and
therefore,         by   properly assuming the units,                           we   may put
                            ºp(u)–1         p(u)=1
                                            =      u,   or                 +   u.
Hence
                                    $(u0)=(1+u) U;
or    themechanical effect produced         force                by   a             U    acting   at   the
point   u  represented
            is                         by
                           the symbol (1+u)                                    U.
   (IV.) Hence,      and if   a.two units
                                       8       be                    of

      (VI.). Itis important to observe, that the sign + between two
 lines has quite a different signification from the same sign be
 tween two forces.      u + u' represents the change of position pro
  duced in a  tracing  point  by causing it to describe the lines u and
  u' in succession, while U+U' means the mechanical effect pro
  duced by the two forces U and U' acting simultaneously at the
 same point.      u+u' may be called a geometrical sum, and U + U'
 a mechanical sum. It is easy to see that the parallelogram of
 forces amounts to this, viz. that, if u and u' represent U and U'
 respectively, u +u' will represent U+U'.        Hence the parallelo
gram of forces is a theorem which identifies the results of geo
metrical and mechanical addition. This suggests the necessity
of caution in attempting to prove the parallelogram of forces
symbolically; for it is clear that the proof must be vitiated by
any tacit assumption of the equivalence of geometrical and me
chanical addition.   If I mistake not, an error of this kind appears
to exist in some symbolical   proofs which have been given of this
 theorem.
      (VII.)    To find     the resultant           of two parallel           forces symbolically.
 Let XA be one of the forces acting at O, and X'A the other
 acting at P, OP being denoted by u; then the mechanical effect
 of the two forces is

latter; in this manner the above-mentioned rotation follows with
the same necessity as the rotation of a wheel immersed in a
stream which flows more strongly below than above.
   That this is the correct explanation is proved by observing
the phaenomena in the dark. An incomplete luminous circle is
then exhibited, which consists of two equal and opposite arches.
 One of these arches is caused by the light which accompanies
the outflow of negative electricity.    In consequence of the rapid
motion of the    disc, the luminous red point appears as a con
tinuous luminous arc. The opposite point, which at the same
time gives off positive electricity with a yellowish diffusive light,
originates the other arch in a similar manner; the latter appear
ing duller and wider than the former. The line which goes
through the middle of both arches and the centre of the needle
is not perpendicular to the disc, but obliquely inclined towards
its advancing particles. This line denotes the direction of max
imum attraction.
   The experiments succeed best when the disc has been tranquil
                                                     j,
for some time previous, and the surrounding air not too highly
electrified by the rapid motion. That a violent motion of the
disc should cause an irregular friction, and thereby an irregular
distribution of electricity over the surface,            in its turn
might affect the purity of the experiment, is easily conceivable.
The most suitable distance of the needle must be determined by
experiment. By observing these conditions the rotation may
be exhibited at any time without difficulty.     The same phaeno
menon can be exhibited with a cylindrical conductor, at the
extreme end of which the outflow of electricity by points is
effected.

An Introduction   to the Atomic Theory.   By   Charles DAUBENY, M.D.,
  F.R.S., &c., Professor of Chemistry     and Botany in the University   of
   Orford.
      ONSIDERING      the vast importance of the doctrine of definite
       proportions, very commonly termed, as in the present work,
the Atomic Theory, fewer publications directly and exclusively expla–
natory of the subject have appeared than might have been expected;
and Dr. Daubeny has laid, not merely the tyro in chemistry under
obligation, but many well acquainted with the leading facts of che
mical science, by presenting them with this publication.
   In his dedication of the work to the memory of John Dalton, the
author has accurately described the doctrine in question as “a theory
with respect to the mode of combination between bodies, which stands
foremost among the discoveries of the present age     for

subject to periodical laws, connecting them with the seasons of the
year and the hours of the day at the particular stations.
    In preparing for the press the hourly observations of the declina
tion in the years 1843, 1844 and 1845, at the same two stations, the
author found his previous opinions strongly confirmed;                and be
lieving that the evidence thus obtained of periodical laws is far too
systematic, and rests on a series of too long duration to make it pro
bable that it will be otherwise than confirmed by the continuation of
the observations in subsequent years, he has been induced to make it
the subject of a communication to the Royal Society; although it is
probable that the exact periods, and the mean numerical values of
the effects produced, or their proportions to each other in the dif
ferent seasons and at the different hours, may hereafter receive
 modifications.
     The disturbances which are the subject of this investigation
 have two leading characteristics,            1st, the irregularity of their
 occurrence, many days together frequently passing without any
 trace of them being discoverable; and 2nd, the large amount of
 deviation from a mean or normal position, to which the needle is
 subject during their continuance.          It is this last feature which has
 led to their general recognition, and to the establishment of the fact,
 that when they take place their influence usually extends simul
 taneously, or nearly so, over          parts  allthe globe of which observa  at
 tions have been made. The same feature still affords their best and
 most convenient distinguishing mark.
     Availing himself       this characteristic, the author separated from

globe.
    Several tables are given containing the distribution of the sepa
 rated observations,—1st, into the several months, and 2nd, into the
several hours, of their occurrence, the hours being those of local
time. This is done, first, in regard to the number of disturbed ob
servations in the several months and hours; a separate account being
taken of those which are easterly, and of those which are westerly
deflections; and second, in regard to the mean numerical values of
the deflections at the different hours, distinguishing easterly and
westerly, and taken on a daily average throughout the year. The
results of this analysis are carefully stated ; and are conclusive, in
the author's opinion, in manifesting the existence of periodical laws
in the times of occurrence and in the effects of the larger disturb
ances; these laws having points of remarkable analogy at both
stations, and showing a causal connexion to subsist between the
disturbances on the one hand, and the seasons of the year and hours
of the day on the other.
    The author remarks on the practical bearing which the establish

out various courses which the      propelled  air may be supposed to

siders that no sooner has the air struck upon the loose card, than it
is reflected, spreading partly, if not entirely, over     surface, and                         its

February 21, 1851.
   The observations detailed in this paper are similar to those de
scribed by the author in his former papers, and the results deduced
from them agree generally with those previously obtained.
   In the introductory remarks, the author states that he determined
the heights of the different rain-gauges above the level of the sea by
means of an excellent Aneroid barometer (previously compared with
a standard), and a standard barometer read simultaneously, or nearly
so, at the sea-level; and he gives the heights of the several stations
as thus estimated.
   The most important fact connected with these observations is
stated to be the discovery of a mountain station which promises to
yield nearly one-third more rain than the hamlet of Seathwaite in
Borrowdale, hitherto, with good reason, considered to be the wettest
spot in the three kingdoms.        This, the new station, “the Stye,” on
 Sprinkling Fell, is about a mile and a half distant from Seathwaite,
in a south-westerly direction, and 580 feet above               the extreme             it,   at

                                           were the S. democratica and S.
 mucronata.
    The author first describes their outward form, and shows that
 they are so different in appearance, and in some points of organiza

 other family) that they are different species. He then proceeds to
 describe the various organs in detail; first, however, discussing the
 proper nomenclature of the sides and ends of these animals, a sub
ject on which much confusion has prevailed.               Particular attention
 is called to the existence of an organ hitherto undescribed—a cylin
 drical, elongated body, like an internal shell,—here termed the “en
 dostyle," which lies in the dorsal sinus, and has hitherto been con
 founded with the “dorsal folds” of Savigny.             A peculiar system of

   The Pyrosomata increase by gemmation also, but the gemmae are
solitary and do not form chains, becoming developed like those of
the ordinary compound Ascidians between the pre-existing forms.
   In the next section, the zoological relations of the Salpa and
Pyrosomata, with the other Ascidians, are inquired into. The au
thor endeavours to show that there is no essential difference of or
ganization between the ordinary Ascidians and the Salpa, that the
two forms grade insensibly one into the other, and that there                                                  is,

                             of                               distinct in                  of

   Proceeding first to explain the simple causes of a solar eclipse, the
Lecturer remarked that the moon's distance from the earth is nearly
one four-hundredth part of the sun's distance, and that the moon's
diameter is very nearly one four-hundredth part of the sun's dia
meter, and that therefore, on the average, the sun's apparent
 diameter and the moon's apparent diameter are very nearly equal.
But in consequence of the elliptic forms of their orbits, the sun's
distance is liable to small variations, and the moon's distance to
very considerable variations: when the moon is at the most distant
part of her orbit, her apparent diameter is smaller than the sun's,
and if she happens at that time to be between a spectator and the
sun, she will be seen as a black disc covering the central part of
the sun and leaving a ring of light                 round          all
                                                               when the moon      ;                                         is   at

turned to the July sun; and thus the eclipse which occurred, if total
in 1833, would, if central, be total (not annular) in 1842; and so on
for four periods of nine years.
    The Lecturer then called attention to the great difference in the
directions of the shadow-paths across Europe, for the eclipses of 1842
and 1851 (the former being from W.S.W. to E.N.E. nearly, the
 latter from N.W. to S.E. nearly).       This arose in part from the
 circumstance that (as above explained) the former of these eclipses
 occurred when the node or end of the intersection-line of the planes
 of orbits, turned towards the July sun, was that at which the moon
 rises to the north of the ecliptic, the latter when it is that at which
 the moon is descending to the south of the ecliptic.      But the prin
 cipal cause of the difference is this; that the former eclipse occurred
 early in the morning, the latter in the afternoon: on placing a
 terrestrial globe in the proper position for July, with its north pole
 inclined considerably towards the sun, it is seen that, even if the
 moon moved precisely in the ecliptic, the path of her shadow across
 Europe before Europe came to the meridian would trend from the
 south to the north ; but if Europe had passed the meridian it would
 trend from the north to the south.
     Quitting the geometrical explanations, the Lecturer then pro
  ceeded to describe some peculiar phaenomena which had been observed
  in eclipses, and first, one which had been observed most distinctly
 in annular eclipses, and which is known by the name of “Baily's
 beads and strings.” When the preceding limb of the moon, tra
  versing the sun's disc, approaches very near the sun's limb, or when
 the following limb of the moon is in the act of separating from the
 sun's limb to enter on the sun's disc, the two limbs are joined for a
 time—(no one has estimated the duration with accuracy)—by alter
 nations of black and white points or strings. Phaenomena, evidently
  of the same class, have been observed in the transits of Venus and
  Mercury over the sun's disc; the black planet, when just lodged on
  the sun's disc, being pear-shaped, with its point attached to the black
  sky. The Lecturer was able to state, in his own experience at the
  Royal Observatory, that at the same transit of Mercury this phaeno
  menon was seen with some telescopes and was not seen with others.
  In the annular eclipse of 1836 observed at Königsberg, where the
  moon's limb but just entered completely on the sun's, and where con
  sequently it grazed along the sun's for many seconds of time, the
  phaenomenon appeared to resolve itself simply into points of light
  seen between lunar mountains.        The Lecturer expressed himself
  generally satisfied with Professor Powell's explanation, that the phae
  nomenon originates in that inevitable fault of telescopes and of the
  nervous system of the eye which tends to extend the images of lumi
 nous objects (producing what is generally termed irradiation), and
  thus enlarges the sun's disc towards the sky, towards the moon or
 planet, and towards the bottoms of      its
                                           hollows.
   In   describing the total eclipseof  1842 (which perhaps was better
 observed than any one preceding it), the Lecturer insisted  on  our obli
 gation to   M. Arago, who had prepared the preliminary notices, and

                                   Royal Institution.                                                511
had used his powerful personal influence in inducing persons to make
observations at numerous stations in the south of France; and had
afterwards collected and compared the observations.                 Besides these
French observations, and the observations made by astronomers
officially located in the path of the shadow, we have the observations
of M. Schumacher, who went to Vienna, of MM. Otto Struve and
Schidlowsky at Lipetsk (the former of whom was sent expressly by
the Russian government), of Mr. Baily, who went to Pavia, and of
the Lecturer himself, who went to the Superga (near Turin).
   It appears that, with M. Arago's telescope, the whole circum
ference of the moon was visible when the moon had entered on only
about two-thirds of the sun's diameter. Whatever may be the cause
of this unusual appearance, it seems to require the use of a telescope
with a small number of glasses in the highest state of polish.
   As the totality approached, a strange fluctuation of light was seen
by M. Arago and others upon the walls and the ground, so striking
that in some places children ran after it and tried to catch it with
                                                                  -
their hands.
   Of the awful effect of the totality, and of the suddenness with
which it came on, it is difficult to give an idea. The Lecturer cited
an expression from Dr. Stukely's account of the total eclipse of 1744,
observed on a cloudy day, “that the darkness came dropping like a
mantle:” and compared it with his own, in similar weather, “that
the clouds seemed to be descending.”             But     agree   all the descrip     in
tion of  livid countenances, indistinct and sometimes invisible horizon,
and general horror           appearance.

not simply the inventions            active human imaginations.

a  swarm    of   ants, who were     busily  carrying   their   burdens,   stopped
when the darkness came           on, and remained motionless till the light
reappeared.          another,              oxen,                the totality was

several places      areddish light was seen near the horizon.               heavy          A

 the moon, called the corona.      The Lecturer described the magical
 change, from the state of a very narrow lune of solar light (the
 contour of the moon being totally invisible) to the state of an entire
 dark moon surrounded by a ring of faint light, as most curious and
 striking.    The progress of the formation of the ring was seen by
his   companion,   and by some other persons; it commenced on the
 side of the moon opposite to that at which the sun disappeared.
 In the general decay and disease which seemed to oppress all nature,
 the moon and corona appeared almost like a local disease in that
 part of the sky.    In some places, the corona was seen as distinctly
double; it would appear that the ring which the Lecturer saw
 (whose breadth, by estimate of repeated duplication, he found to be
 about one-eighth part of the moon's diameter, or four minutes of arc
nearly) was the inner of the two rings seen by M. Arago and others.
The texture of the corona appeared in some places as if fibrous, or
composed of entangled thread; in some places, brushes or feathers
 of light proceeded from       One photometric estimate
                                      it.                     the quantity               of

seventh part       full moonlight.

    The Lecturer characterized the inquiry into the origin and locality
of   this corona     one   as the most interesting connected with the
                                      of
eclipse.        had been specially indicated by M. Arago (see the
Annuaire     du It

or  with the sun; but his recommendation had received very limited
attention.     The general tenor                 of
                                       the evidence went       prove that                 to
the corona belongs       the sun. This, however, was not the opinion
                                to
of  more ancient writers, who tacitly consider          the atmosphere   it   as                          of
the moon.

moon. The Lecturer          professed   himself    totally   unable        follow this              to
theory into details, remarking only that               the rapid passage  in        the                           of
moon's shadow                  he

required for the explanation.
   The Lecturer then adverted               that part   to   his subject          of
                                                                                 which                       of

  Atlantic  as one of the strongest inducements for Americans to visit
 Europe    in the coming summer, he invited attention to its course
 across Europe.      Entering Norway near Bergen, the shadow crosses
 both coasts of Norway, both coasts of Sweden, and the eastern
  coast of the Baltic ; then ranges through Poland and the south
 frontier of Russia across the sea of Azof through Georgia to the
 Caspian Sea.      It passes Christiania, Göteborg, Carlscrona, Danzig,
 Königsberg, Warsaw, and Tiflis. A great part of this course, espe
 cially that from Bergen to Königsberg, is very accessible by sea,
 and Warsaw by land.           The Lecturer trusted that many English
 travellers might be induced to observe this eclipse. If possible,
 stations should be chosen as well near the northern and southern
 boundaries of the shadow as near the centre. No particular skill in
 astronomical observation is required, the phaenomena being rather of
 a more generally physical kind ; and indeed, as far as the observa
 tions of the eclipse of 1842 showed, the travelling physicists had
 been more successful than the stationary astronomers.         The appa
 ratus required would depend on the special objects of the observer;
 a telescope and a watch might be considered indispensable in every
 case: for analysis of light, a common prism and a polariscope might
 be taken by some persons: photometry, actinometry, &c., might be
interesting to others, and appropriate instruments would be required:
other observers would be interested in meteorology.       The apparatus
which the lecturer considered it most important to perfectionate
 now, for use during the eclipse, is photogenic apparatus; it would
be impossible to set too high a value on a series of Daguerreotypes
or Talbotypes of the sun and corona taken during the eclipse."
    The Lecturer concluded by saying that a series of suggestions for
the observation, accompanied by a map, had been prepared by a
Committee of which he is a member, and were nearly ready to leave
the printer's hands: and he undertook to transmit a copy of these
suggestions to any person who would make application to him.

      is our   painful duty to record the death of Mr. Richard
                on the 11th of May, after a short illness, in the
seventy-third year of his age. He has been one of the editors
of this Magazine from the time the Annals of Philosophy were
incorporated with it—of which latter publication he was sole Con
ductor from the year 1821.            Mr. Phillips first attracted the
attention of the scientific world by his publication in 1805 of
“Analyses of the Bath-waters;” this was immediately followed
by the examination of other mineral waters, and he continued to
devote much of his attention to this then untrodden field of re

            Intelligence   and Miscellaneous   Articles.        515
search.   The scientific publications of that day contain many of
his analyses of rare and useful minerals.     In 1817 he was ap
pointed Lecturer on Chemistry at the London Hospital; he also
delivered several courses of lectures at the London Institution.
Soon after he was appointed by Government Professor of Che
mistry at the Military College, Sandhurst; he held the Chemical
Lectureship at Grainger's School of Medicine in Southwark for
many years, and was subsequently Lecturer at St. Thomas’s
Hospital. In 1822 Mr. Phillips was elected a Fellow of the
Royal Society, and published about this time a paper in their
Transactions in conjunction with Dr. Faraday: he often expressed
great pleasure in having been the first to introduce this distin
guished philosopher to the Society.
   In 1824 Mr. Phillips published his first Translation of the
Pharmacopoeia Londinensis, and from the celebrity which he had
acquired as a pharmaceutical chemist, he was consulted by the
College of Physicians, and employed by them in the examination
of the chemical preparations described in the edition of the
work issued by that body in 1836, which he also translated,
adding copious notes.     For the last twelve months he has been
engaged in further experiments for the College, and was em
ployed on the evening before his illness on his final work,+
a Translation of the recently issued London Pharmacopoeia, to
which he had devoted much time and labour, having collected
considerable additional information to be embodied in this Trans
lation, a part of which has already passed through the press
                           Fij
In  1839 Mr. Phillips was appointed Chemist and Curator to the
Museum of Practical Geology, now in Jermyn Street, which office
he held at the time of his death.      Scattered through the Trans
actions of the Royal Society and through the pages of the Annals
of Philosophy and the                    Magazine, will be found his
numerous contributions to science: all the chemical articles in the
“Penny Cyclopaedia” were contributed by him.
   Richard Phillips was one of the original founders of the Geo
logical Society, the intimate friend of Davy and Wollaston, and
enjoyed the personal friendship and esteem of the most celebrated
continental chemists.      He was for many years a member of the
Council of the   Royal  Society, and for the last two years President
of the Chemical   Society.    He has departed from among us, after
a long and active life, beloved and respected by    all
                                                      who knew him.
His remains were      deposited at the  Cemetery   atNorwood,   many
of his scientific friends attending.

ON    THE POLARIZATION                 OF THE CHEMICAL RAYS WHICH EXIST IN
                     SOLAR LIG    ht.     BY PROF. E. W.ARTMANN.
   It is well known that physicists have found in the solar spectrum,
produced by means of a good prism, three orders of radiations which
are in part superposed, the calorific, the colorific or luminous, and
the chemical.      The rays of the two first orders are susceptible of
polarization*, and consequently of extinction.             But the chemical
rays have not been examined in this respect; and the following ex
periments, made with the aid of a skilful artist of Lausannet, will
help to supply this deficiency. They were made on August 27, 1850,
from 2 to 3 o'clock in the afternoon, with a warm day and a clear sky.
   The polarizer was a Nicol's prism, 0.86 millim. long, 0.036 millim.
and 0.028 millim. wide.       It was contained in a tin tube blackened
inside.    Another similar tube contained the analyser, another Nicol's
prism, 0.07 millim. long, and the diagonals of which measured 0-03
millim. and 0.023 millim.       The two tubes, the total length of which
was one metre, turned one in the other, and intercepted all light except
that which was to be examined.
   First Experiment.—A prepared plate coated with silver was ex
posed to the vapour of iodine, afterwards to that of bromide of lime,
and again to that of iodine.       It thus acquires an exquisite photo
graphic sensitiveness.     It was employed in taking a Daguerreotype
portrait. The person who sat was in the shade. Against the exter
nal surface of the object-glass of the camera obscura, the two prisms
had been arranged, the principal sections of which formed an angle
of 45°. The impression obtained at the end of eighty seconds was
very clear and distinct.
   Second Experiment.—A silvered plate submitted to the same pro
cess was substituted for the first.        The principal sections of the
prisms were at right angles. After three minutes' exposure the effect
was absolutely null.             -
                                                              -
   Third   Erperiment.—Instead      of the person a lithograph was placed
in the sun on a plane nearly perpendicular to the rays which illu
mined         The experiment was continued for seven minutes, but the
            it.
effect was still null.
   Fourth Erperiment.—It was proved that,                   on
                                                       the contrary,       ex         an
posure      of
            four  minutes, under the same     conditions,  gave avery visible
image, when the angle        the principal sections was only 70°.
                                  of
  It   results from these  experiments,    that the chemical are polarized
like the luminous and the calorific rays under similar conditions.
The first were extinguished with the second;           was out

   Perhaps the following facts may facilitate the quantitative esti
mation of manganese. I find, contrary to what is stated in works
on chemical analysis, that carbonate of manganese is not decom
posable at ordinary temperatures by the oxygen of the atmosphere,
but remains permanently white if it have been precipitated without
an excess of carbonate of potash or carbonate of soda. When an
excess of either of these reagents is used in             precipitation, the           its

iron of Texas.    It also shows numerous large and small intermixed
grains of sulphuret of iron, which during the corrosion gave off the
odour of sulphuretted hydrogen.      Some chemical experiments made

method of separation is especially applicable in the analysis of the
remarkable double salt consisting of sulphurous acid combined with
the protoxide and peroxide of copper.     The composition of this salt,

            GENTLEMEN,
    MY     attention has lately been directed to a communication by
           Professor Forbes, in the Philosophical Magazine for De
    cember 1850, entitled “On the alleged Evidence for a Physical
    Connexion between Stars forming Binary or Multiple Groups,
    deduced from the Doctrine of Chances.”                            I
                                                    have read Professor
    Forbes's observations with great care and     interest;  and desire,
    both because the subject of them is important, and because it is
    closely related to a class of speculations in the pursuit of which
    I  have long been engaged, to offer a few remarks which have
    been suggested to me by the perusal of the paper.
        Iagree with Professor Forbes in thinking that “any abuse of
    the mathematical sciences, such as to give definite demonstra
    tions and results when no such demonstrations and results can
    in the nature of things be legitimately obtained, tends to weaken
    our confidence in mathematical conclusions generally;” and                                      I
    also agree with him that the evidence for final causes is of such
    a nature that “all attempts to base the proof of design on strictly
    & priori and geometrical ground should be received with scrupu
                                     I
    lous caution.” May add, that in calling the attention of mathe
    maticians to a supposed, and                   I
                                      think also real discrepancy be
    tween an alleged result of their science and the conclusions of
    common sense, Professor Forbes appears to me to have deserved
    their thanks : No one who values the science of mathematics
    upon the only just ground of estimation, as an instrument for
    the discovery of truth, can desire to shield       conclusions from   its
    the severest  scrutiny    reason.of     endeavour    To   this would        to   do

522                  Prof. G. Boole on the Theory                                of Probabilities,
fess (by implication) that there is some essential want of har
mony among the intellectual powers.       Upon either of these
grounds, and more especially upon the latter, this whole question
appears to me to deserve the most careful examination.   It would
be no rash assertion to say, that it is of far less importance to
know whether an a priori argument for the physical connexion
of the double stars is valid, than it is to know whether the human
mind is so constituted as to become of necessity the sport of                                                           its

        Let       us    consider,            first, what           is   the proper statement                      of   the
problem              considered                by   Mr. Mitchell; secondly, whether that
problem              admits          the principles
                                      of

be found 7

the probability that the law or manner of distribution was not
one whose consequences we should be altogether unable to fore
tell ?
   The first of the above questions certainly admits of a perfectly
definite numerical answer.    Let the value of the probability in
question be p.    It has then generally been maintained that the
answer to the second question is also p, and against this view
Prof. Forbes justly contends.     I am not sure that the abstract
                                   I
of Mitchell’s paper which have consulted warrants the conclu
sion that he held precisely this opinion; but it has been a pre
valent one, and to Prof. Forbes belongs the honour of having
first called it in question. Although the source of the fallacy is
not a matter of much importance,              I
                                      will venture to offer an ex
planation of it somewhat different from that of Prof. Forbes.
    Let us state Mr. Mitchell’s problem, as we may now do, in
the following manner:—There is a calculated probability p in
favour of the truth in a particular instance of the proposition,
If a  condition A has prevailed, a consequence B has not occurred.
Required the similar probability for the proposition, If a con
sequence B has occurred, the condition A has not prevailed.
   Now the two propositions are logically connected.        The one
is the “negative conversion” of the other; and hence if either
is true universally, the other is so. It seems hence to have been
inferred, that if there is a probability p in a special instance in
favour of the former, there is the same probability p in favour of
the latter.   But this inference would be quite erroneous.        It
would be an error of the same kind as to assert that whatever
probability there is that a stone arbitrarily selected is a mineral,
there is the same probability that a mineral arbitrarily selected
is a stone.   But that these probabilities are different will be evi
dent from their fractional expressions, which are—
       Number of stones which are minerals
     l           Number of stones
                                              -
          Number of non-minerals which are not stones
     2-
                        Number of non-minerals
It is true that if either of these fractions rises to 1, the other
does also ; but otherwise they will in general differ in value.
  Does then the problem, as above stated, admit of solution ?
I do  not say of such solution as will throw light upon the con
stitution of the heavens, but of such solution as will relieve from
all suspicion    inconsistency the theory    probabilities.

                 There remains then but the form

               and on   the   Distribution    of the Fived Stars.                  525
that the dependence of the numerical value of the probability
sought upon the numerical values of the probabilities given, is
founded solely on the logical connexion of the propositions. Or
the principle may be thus stated:—The probability sought is a
function of the probabilities given; but the form of that function
 depends only upon the logical connexion of the proposition whose
probability is sought with those propositions whose probabilities
are given.   There are then two conditions necessary toward the
 construction of a perfect method for the calculusof probabilities:—
   1. The prior construction of a general method for determining
the logical dependence of any proposition upon another given
proposition, or set of propositions.
   2. The deduction from that expression of the corresponding
relation among their probabilities.
   Let us consider these objects in succession.
   1.  In a hasty and (for this reason) regretted publication, en
titled “The Mathematical Analysis of Logic,” and in a paper
published in the Cambridge Mathematical Journal, entitled “The
 Calculus of Logic,” I have stated certain general laws of thought,
mathematical in their expression, and constituting, as I believe,
the true basis of formal logic. The actual development of those
laws in the works referred to is far too imperfect to meet the re
quirements of the case now under our consideration. But that
imperfection does not apply to the laws themselves. The results
of subsequent investigations authorize me to say that there exists
a general method, enabling us not only to educe any of the con
sequences of a system of propositions, but also to express in a
scientific form and order the connexion which any proposed pro
position bears to any other proposition, or system of propositions.
It is not needful that I should here fully explain how it is that
a logical dependence of this nature can exist where propositions
appear to be wholly or quite unconnected.       But    may remark,  I
that  by  the very conditions of thought   there arise certain rela
tions necessary à priori, e.g. the so-called principle of contradic
tion, “traorév 8eflavorórm rév dpxóvº,” the principle that a pro
position is true or false, &c., that these are implicitly involved
in the fundamental laws of the method, and that they render
possible the expression of the relation sought. By the solution.
thus obtained, the first object which we have in view may in                        all
cases   be   accomplished.                                                     -
  2.    The result  which we shall thus have arrived will express
                      at
the logical dependence    our final proposition upon those which
                              of
are involved    the

526          Prof. G. Boole on the Theory of Probabilities,
are subject to most of the laws of the symbols of arithmetical
quantity, satisfying however a peculiar law, to which the symbols
of quantity, as such, are not subject. Now have ascertained                 I
that in the formal relations which thus assimilate the laws of
thought in logic with the laws of thought in arithmetic, lies the
basis of a new and general theory of probabilities. Accordingly,
from the purely logical equation to which the present application
of our analysis has conducted us, there results a system of alge
braic equations determining the numerical value of the proba
bility sought.

            application.                                                                                      -

I  suppose that, from observations made upon the health                                                                of

                        the fraction       were free from both these
                                                                  r

respects cleanliness and ventilation: required the probability
that any house taken           random was      at    defective sanitary       in    a
condition.
     The solution             of    this problem would                         be   sufficiently simple              if
we were permitted      assume that the three events represented
                                    to

the prevalence     defective sanitary condition, were independent
                          of  a

cation by common sense, to those who may choose to undertake
the task, will be the more easy.
    Iwill now exhibit the results to which this method conducts
us when applied to Mr. Mitchell’s problem. That problem,
under a somewhat more general aspect, may be thus stated.
   Given the probability (p) of the truth of the proposition, If
the condition A is satisfied, the event B will not happen.
   Required the probability P of the proposition,       the event                               If
B does happen, the condition A has not been satisfied. The
result which I obtain is

                                             c(1—a)+a(1-p)”
where c and a are arbitrary constants, whose interpretation is as
follows: viz. a is the probability of the fulfilment of the con
dition A, c is the probability that the event B would happen if
the condition A were not satisfied.
   Let us apply this solution to Mr. Mitchell’s problem, and test
 its agreement with common sense.          The condition            that                         A    is,

of random distribution did not prevail, and c is the probability
on this hypothesis that such a double star as 3 Capricorni should
exist.   Hence c(1—a) is the probability of the whole hypothesis,
that the distribution of the stars was not a random one, and that
double stars should exist. In like manner, ap is the probability
that the principle of random distribution did prevail, and that a
double star like & Capricorni should not exist.

of an indicative law of  distribution, and the consequent  existence
of a double star, is greater than the probability in favour of a
random distribution, and a consequent absence of double stars,
then the probability in favour of an indicative law of distribution,
granting the existence of a double star, is stronger than the pro
bability against a double star, granting the hypothesis of a dis

LXXV.   On some new and curious applications                 of the Permanence of
  Impressions on the Retina.—Third Note.                     By M. J. PLATEAU+.
       order to give, by means of the phantascope or phenakisti
IN    cope,  the appearance of life and motion to the figures repre
sented, it is requisite to hold the rotating disc very near to one
of the eyes, the other being closed, and to look through the zone
of the apertures at the image of the disc in a mirror; this plan
is inconvenient, and moreover, it shows at once the whole series
of figures                  arranged on the surface of the disc, and
consequent      under every inclination,            I
                                            shall now describe a mo
              }
dification of the   apparatus,  by means of which the effect may be
observed    directly, by both  eyes, and by more than one person at
a time; a modification which, moreover, exhibits the figures only
when in a suitable position, and which, lastly, much increases the
illusion.    This modification consists in a combination of the
processes of the anorthoscope and the phenakisticope.
    Let us return to the first of these two instruments (see the
preceding Note, Phil. Mag. for June 1850), and suppose the
 velocities of the two discs to be in a contrary direction to each
 other. Then, as we have shown in that Note, if by Wa is de
 noted the velocity of the disc with the distorted figure, and by
 V, that of the black disc, the relation between the corresponding
 angular dimensions in the distorted figure and in the perfect
                                       We have shown that if the relation
figure, is equal to
                      §: + 1.
                       ??                                                           §:n
is not an entire number, the image produced in one revolution
of one of the slits is not superposed on the image which has
been produced in the preceding revolution of the same slit. But
this non-superposition, which must necessarily be avoided in the
anorthoscope, constitutes, on the contrary, one of the principles
 of the illusion now in question.
    Let us take Wa-1, and W,-4; in other words, let us sup
pose that the black disc revolves four times faster than the trans
parent disc.   The relation of the angular dimensions will then
be equal to # 4- 1 = #, and consequently the total angular width
of the distorted figure will be to that of the regular figure as 5
to 4. Let us draw the perfect figure in an angle occupying
gº of the circumference, which, according to the above value of
the relation between the angular dimensions, will give Tº for the
measure of the angle which the distorted figure should occupy.
This being done,      let   us

534      M.    J.       Plateau on           some new and curious applications                           of
of the flame and on the side facing the apparatus, is an opening
of 7 to 8 centimetres in height and 24 centimetres in width;
this iron chimney should, moreover, be surmounted with a
smoke-consumer, which prevents the light from illuminating the
ceiling of the apartment; lastly, no other lamp or light should
be left in the apartment.
   In my instrument the transparent discs have a diameter of 27
centimetres; the figures occupy a zone comprised between two
circumferences, the radii of which are respectively 12 and 5%
centimetres, so that the height of the zone is 6; centimetres.
As the paper, to be sufficiently transparent, must be thin, and
these discs have a somewhat large diameter,           have been obliged             I
to add to their solidity by pasting on the space comprised be
tween the interior limit of the zone and the centre a circle of
Bristol-board, and upon the space left beyond the exterior limit
of the zone, a circular band of the same substance.         The figures
were painted in water-colours; but in the dark parts the colour
was applied on both surfaces of the paper in order to increase
the strength of the tints, and, for a contrary reason, the parts
which should have the greatest light were covered with varnish.
I  will add, to complete the details relative to my apparatus, in
the first place, that the slits cut in the black disc, the edges of
which slits converge toward the centre of the disc, have at their
furthest extremity from the centre a width of 2 millimetres; in
the second place, the aperture in the screen is 65 millimetres
                                                                  milli

high, and 33 millimetres wide at             upper part, and                                        15

screen   isarranged,      distance its  the transparent disc
                                                        to        about                             is

another the relation desired for the stereoscope;                       these discs                    fix
to   two systems similar               that which we have described, and
                                                    to
suitably adapted                    to

   536        Mr. T. S.   Davies on Geometry and Geometers.
  have identically the same motion.         This last condition is easily
  fulfilled, by fixing on a common axis furnished with a single
  winch the two toothed wheels intended to turn the lower pinions
  of the two steel rods.
      Only one real difficulty presents itself, but it is considerable;
  this is to construct the figures of the two discs in such a manner
  that those of the one should have with those of the other the
  precise relation which the stereoscope requires.             Nevertheless
  this may be surmounted, by employing a process for which we
  are also indebted to the inventive genius of Mr. Wheatstone. To
  obtain a couple of drawings adapted to give, in the stereoscope,
  the representation, not of a simple perspective in outline, but of
  an object having rounded forms, such as a statue, and that with
 the shades and lights, Mr. Wheatstone conceived the idea of pro
 curing, by means of photography on paper, two projections of
 the object, by placing successively the photographs in two differ
 ent positions, so that the two projections should have between
 them the necessary relation. Now we might have executed in
 plaster, for example, the models of the sixteen modifications            of
 the regular figure, the image of which it is desired to produce
 in the combined apparatus under consideration; then take by
 means of the photographic apparatus a pair of drawings of each
 of these sixteen models; and lastly, place these drawings after
 suitable distortion on the two discs. Without doubt this would
be a tedious operation, and one which would require great care;
but we should be amply recompensed by the marvellous nature
of the results.

    [“Since the death of my lamented friend, her late husband Prof. T. S.
Davies, Mrs. Davies has forwarded me the above manuscript, his autograph.
In sending it to the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine for publication,
I  take the liberty of informing the readers of that Journal that several
notices respecting Professor Davies have recently appeared in print, among
which I may mention one published in No. 143         P the Mechanics' Maga
zine; another (by Thomas T. Wilkinson, Esq., F.R.A.S.) in No. 166 of
the Architect and Civil Engineer; and the first part of another (by my
brother Dr. John Cockle) in No. 18 of the Expositor. Mr. Wilkinson gives

                Mr. T. S.        Davies on Geometry and Geometers.                                              537
A  small number of copies only must have been printed, as have                                             I
never seen a single copy for sale or catalogued in any shape.
The work, in fact, to use a common expression, “fell still-born
from the press;” and it is not only generally unknown to mere
amateur geometers, but almost without exception to the working
geometers of the present day.                             I
                                  do not remember to have seen
it quoted even once in the periodicals more especially devoted to
geometry, so that it stands in almost the same position as it
would have done amongst the author’s MSS.       It is no wonder,
then, that the promised parts 2 and 3 never made their ap
pearance.
   Nevertheless this volume contains some of the most elaborate
and elegant geometry       the true spirit(in the ancients, but per   of
fectly unshackled         any anterior works) that exist
                                 as      to                     our                                        in
language,      probably
                  or         any language whatever.

and then    more difficult series (including amongst them, and
                a
indeed forming the simplest      them, the Apollonian series) with
                                                    of
the analyses prefixed      the constructions. The entire series
                                         to                                                                      is

equal angles with the two remaining lines given            position.”
                                                                                       of in    all

     Though         to
                  work      such difficulty “amusements” might
                         call   a             of

                 affectation,  yet     Mr. Swale am convinced by                 I
that the term might     used with perfect propriety: but

     Mr.

the same time, I am inclined to think that it was never suffi
ciently made known to the mathematical public; and probabl
the neglect of “agents” was the chief cause. This at least
know, that           I
                could not procure a copy two or three years after
either  through    the regular channels or any irregular channel
either—till Mr. Swale himself presented me with a copy several
years later.    I had meantime been at the trouble of transcribing
the entire book for my own use from a borrowed copy, that copy
itself having been obtained after much search.
    He, however, like many other mathematicians, ardent for the
promotion of their science, commenced a periodical to be pub
lished annually. This he called the “Apollonius.”          Probably
he  thought   the usual contributors to works of the class would
at least support the undertaking, so as to be, if not remunerative,
at least self-supporting. Whether this project failed for want of
business-tact, like the “Amusements,” in not being made suffi

  contributions (irregular as to time and place, as this would render
  them) to these works are both numerous and remarkable. Where
  ever we see the name of “Swale’’ we are sure to meet with
  something new and elegant, and often with specimens of un
 equalled resource and unexampled method of research.
     But why this eulogy on the author of works already in print :
  Simply, that I have been entrusted by his son with          perusal i.
 of a series of MSS., the remains of this extraordinary geometer,
 of which I think some account should be given in the present
 series of papers; and     Iconsidered it needful to introduce the
 subject by a short notice of the position which he occupied as a
 geometer, and this deduced from a reference to his published
 writings.     Had they been better known, this trouble might have
 been saved me; but the circumstances of their publication ren
 dered it necessary to give these preliminary notices, for the                 in
 formation of my readers.
     The life of a schoolmaster is seldom marked by any events of
 public interest, at least in this country; though on the other
 side of the Atlantic we have seen that there is no obstacle to his
 rising to the highest office of one of the most powerful nations
 in the world. With us, his history is that of officiating as
 “usher ” for a few years, “here and there and everywhere,”—
 marrying—toiling with a school of his own—for the most part
barely able to support his family, and at best (and this rarely)
 being able to scrape together by industry and oeconomy a few
hundreds to support himself and his wife in their age and decre
 pitude.     Nor does the life of this distinguished geometer furnish
any exception to the rule; though of the specialities of his early
life I am able to give no account.          I
                                            find from a memorandum
in one of his books, that his two eldest children were born at
Idle, a village in the West Riding, and the subsequent ones at
 Liverpool. His reputation in Liverpool as a teacher was very high,
and he had every prospect before him of securing a respectable
competence for his old age.       About 1828, however, he lost his
entire    savings  (about £1200) “by a dishonest relative;” and
from various notes it would appear that he was involved in further
liabilities for that person, which absolutely left him without
resources. This so preyed upon his mind and feelings, that he
sunk into a misanthropic state from which he never fully re
covered; though he was fast recovering when seized with his
last and fatal illness.
   For what reason does not appear, but      the MSS.all       date    of  a
priorto 1828 are absent.   From this period    the end to  his life,  of
they appear    to  complete—and each entry

  Mr.   Swale was not in the habit of putting down the demon
strations of the more simple of his constructions; and as those
which to him appeared simple and capable of easy recal at any
moment did not often appear so to others less rapid than him
self, many  of his operations that would have somewhat perplexed
a less able geometer to demonstrate are left unproved”.      The
present, indeed, scarcely deserves to be classed as amongst   the
difficult ones; but as a demonstration may be satisfactory to
some readers, I annex a sufficiently simple one.
    The line BH being found according to the construction, let C
be the centre of the circle according to Euclid's definition. Join
CB, CH : then it is required to prove that BCH is an equilateral
triangle, from which the conclusion follows at once.
   Join AC, PC, AP, PH, BL, PL.
   Then since P is the centre of the circle        ABL,      we have
                  HLB = ALB = #APB-cPB=CBP,
and since C is the centre of the circle        ABH,    we have
        HLB+HBL=AHB=APB=2CPB=2CBP.
Whence also  HBL =CBP= HLB.
   Add PHB+ PBH = LBH + PBH, or CBH = PBL.
   But PBL is an angle of an equilateral triangle by construction;
and hence also CBH is one angle of an equilateral triangle.
Moreover, since C is the centre of the circle CB=CH, and hence
CHB is another angle of an equilateral triangle. Whence also
the third angle HCB, etc.
   In an age like this, when science is so taxed to minister to art,
one would look for some improvement in the processes of prac
tical plane geometry.    There are two ways in which a work on
practical geometry might be composed.          One is to give each
construction at the place in a systematic course, where         de      its
monstration would   naturally and  easily flow from  the principles

 of the problems in his first four and his sixth books. The num

                               on the Velocity            of Light.                               545
shutter, and to fall upon the plane surface of a reflecting mirror
set perpendicular to the direction of the light, the latter will be
sent back along the path by which it entered.                 If the reflecting
surface be    oblique   to the direction of the     light,   the latter will be
reflected in some other direction; supposing a second reflecting
mirror to be set perpendicular to this latter direction, the light
will be reflected from this in the direction of the perpendicular,
will again strike the other mirror, and be finally sent back by
the latter through the aperture by which it entered.                     In this
case the   ray   suffers two reflexions from the intermediate            mirror;
and if it be true that light requires time in passing from one
point to another, these two reflexions cannot occur contempo
raneously.      A certain portion of time, however small, will be
required for the journey to and fro from one mirror to the other.
 Supposing, for instance, the mirrors to be placed six feet apart;
the light proceeding from the aperture is received upon the first
mirror and reflected by it on to the other; from this it is reflected
back again, and thus accomplishes a journey of twelve feet between
 its two reflexions        by
                          the first mirror. To this journey,            has been       as

extended paper upon this subject,      which            in
                                                announces that               he
has already obtained decisive results.
   We have thought that,                  for
                               the solution       capital question        of    a
like the present,  the proofs could not     too much multiplied,   be
and that  experiments   made under different circumstances could
not but contribute     render our knowledge

more certain.
   We have applied ourselves   the solution     to                              of  the question             as
proposed           by

two opposite theories regarding the nature of light be submitted
to a definite test ? We have adopted such measures as are cal
culated to exhibit in a striking manner the differences of the
phaenomena as deduced from the one or the other theory.
   As remarked in our preceding communication, the observation
was made simultaneously on two bundles of light; the one having
traversed the air, the other a column of water.
   For each of these bundles the path was as follows:—A tele
scope was so disposed that                         its
                                       object-glass was very near the
rotating mirror;        little
                           a    rectangular  prism was placed       the                          in
focus  of the telescope,       such inposition that the solar rays fall
                                                   a
ing upon      from convenient lateral opening near the eye-glass,
             it           a
were  totally  reflected towards the object-glass.
   Beyond the rotating mirror, and              distance which for the
                                                               at
                                                                a
ray that passed through water amounted               two metres, there   to
was   a fixed reflector designed      send back the light
                                                   to       the rota                    to
ting mirror       by normal reflexion.
                       a
   The focal distance              of
                            the telescope was such that the image                                     of
the little prism placed                  its
                                 focus formed itself distinctly upon
                                    at
the fixed reflector just mentioned.    After having been reflected
from     the light returned
       it,                       the rotating mirror, was sent                                        on
through the telescope, and                  on to
                                 passing the focus formed   image                            an
which   exactly  covered the prism.
   By the rotation             of
                          the mirror we give birth              number             to   a             of
images which succeed each other very rapidly, and the super
position     of
             which produces the sensation                            of
                                                      permanent image.    a
   When the rotation became          sufficiently  rapid,  the permanent
image was pushed forward           the direction        rotation, this de     of
viation being the result                 byof in
                                  the angular motion           the mirror           of
during the time occupied          the light      passing twice over the

space which separated        from the fixed mirror.
                                    it
   A  second similar fixed mirror was placed beside the former:                                       it
                us
permitted       tomake the experiment with air and water simul
taneously.
  If  the lengths traversed had been equal for both media, the
times occupied       passing them would

                                        the mirror would have been                                    in
the same ratio.
   Instead     equal lengths
                of                             we
                                    have adopted equivalent lengths;
that  is    say,
           to    lengths    traversed       the light     by equal times.          in
These lengths are very different, according           they are calculated as
from the one       the other theory. The length for water being
                     or                                                                               1,

548                    Mr. W.   J.    M. Rankine on         the   Law of      the
     If the    experiment be made by adopting the length                                 ; for air,
that of water being 1, according to the theory of emission the
times occupied by the two bundles of light in passing over these
spaces will be equal, and consequently      the deviations will be
equal.    By the other theory, on the contrary, the times occupied
by the light in passing through both media will be very different;
these times will be for water and for air in the ratio of 16 to 9,
and the deviations will be in the same ratio.
   To coincide with the one or the other theory, it will therefore
be sufficient to prove, either that the deviations are equal, or
that one is nearly double the other.
   If the equivalent lengths calculated from the theory of undu
lation be taken, the results will be similar, but inverse.
   According to the theory of emission, the deviations will be in
the ratio of 16:9; according to the other theory, they will be
                                                             -
equal.
     We have made these two experiments, and the results obtained
are very exact.    The phaenomena observed are altogether in ac
cordance with the theory of undulation, and in manifest oppo
          .
sition to the theory of emission.
   In the first arrangement the deviation is greater for water than
for air; it is nearly double.   The difference is sensible with a
velocity of 400 or 500 revolutions per second; with a velocity of
1500 revolutions it becomes quite evident.
   In the second arrangement the deviation is the same for air
and water; and whatever be the velocity of the mirror, there is
no sensible difference between the two deviations.
   These experiments have been made in the meridian room of
the observatory; the column of water was 2 metres long, and
WaS             in a crystal tube closed at the ends with glass.
This length is more convenient than that which we at first em
ployed, namely 3 metres. The light is less weakened, and, after
at its
    double passage, retains    intensity which may
                                              an         estimated              be
   double of that which was obtained with the tube of      metres.                   3
   The deviations were observed      distance of l'50 millim. from

        Compressibility             of Water at            different Temperatures.                                  549
pressibilities of distilled water at different temperatures (Comptes
Rendus, xix.) by an empirical formula, I was much struck on
unexpectedly finding that they followed sensibly this law:—
   The compressibility of water is inversely proportional to the
density multiplied by the temperature, as measured from the abso
lute zero of a perfect gas-thermometer, viz. a point 274°6 below
the ordinary zero of the Centigrade scale, and 462°28 below
that of Fahrenheit's scale.
   Hence the compressibility of water varies according to the
same law with that of a gas.

 LXXIX.           Description           of the         Gyreidometer, an Instrument suited to
     the exact Measurement                       of Newton’s Rings.                           By E. WILDE*.
                                                 [With a Plate.]
 A      FEW  years ago an instrument was constructed by Jericau,
                by giving a certain position to the glasses used in
             which,
the  experiment,  was peculiarly suited to the exhibition of the
coloured  rings of Newton. This end was accomplished by giving
a plate of glass with parallel surfaces a small inclination towards
a moveable plane which contained the convex lens. The arrange
ment permitted of the slow approach of the glasses, and the
alterations of the rings due to this approach were easily observed.
The instrument was named a gyreidoscope.
   In the gyreidometer the above convenient arrangement of the
glasses has been substantially retained.     To render the instru
ment suited, however, not only to the exhibition of the rings,
but also to their measurement, a different arrangement in other
respects had to be resorted                            to.
                                                                            is go

     In   homogeneouslight we obtain a great number of rings, even
when the radius is  only  a few feet long; and with such glasses,
by means of the gyreidometer, the properties of the colours can
be observed with sufficient accuracy. Were the bottom of the
case a, and of the slide b broken through beneath the place
where the lens rests, the instrument would be suitable to the
observation of the rings formed by transmitted light.    By it also
can be measured the rings formed between glass and metal, or
any other solid opake body; it being merely necessary to form
a lens from the body, and to set it in the place which the glass
lens has been supposed to occupy in the foregoing description.

        much time and attention to a series of pendulum experi
ments, similar to those of Foucault in Paris, and carefully re
cording the particulars of each, in order to obtain from actual
observation the true amount of angular motion of the plane of a
pendulum's vibration in this latitude (51° 27'), and compare it
with the results which mathematicians are endeavouring to obtain
from rigorous analysis.
    The lofty spire of St. Nicholas in this city, which rises to a
height of about 190 feet from the ground, was the building
selected for these experiments; and                   its

that is to say, the pendulum index at every vibration passes
within that distance of the pin in the centre of the circle. When
ever the ellipticity (or semi-conjugate axis) begins to exceed that
amount, I consider it time to stop the pendulum and commence
afresh.    The direction of the elliptic motion is also recorded:
when like that of the hand of a watch, it is called ‘direct,” and
marked + ; when the contrary, it is called ‘retrograde,’ and
marked with the sign —. The motion of the line of apsides of
these ellipses (as Mr. Sylvester has lately pointed out) is mixed
up with, and considerably affects the apparent amount                that                                    of,

of this question have been advanced by different writers. Still
there is difficulty, if not doubt, left upon the minds of many
persons, to whom a lucid explanation of the phaenomenon would
be a great relief and gratification.    It is for the assistance of
such individuals that                     I
                          have attempted in this paper a threefold
solution of the problem; the two first being perhaps more strict
and geometrical, the last more popular. In principle these solu
tions would be found identical with each other, as well as with
those that have been proposed by other writers.   The varied form
under which they appear will, it is hoped, recommend them
to different classes of readers.
   The nature of the experiment itself I need hardly describe, as
the details of it are so generally known.         In explaining the

be supposed to be made up of                                      -
      or, an angular motion about CA perpendicular to the table; and
      o, an angular                 motion about                     CB parallel           to the table,
Now with respect to this angular motion oz of the plane and
centre of the table about CB, it is evident that the plane of
vibration of the pendulum KDd partakes of it similarly and
equally, because the plane of vibration is always necessarily per
pendicular to the plane of the table.        And indeed if there were
no other motion than     this, the case would be precisely similar to
that at the equator;   the  plane   of the table would have no motion
            its
                                                    of its

                                           in
 be    no
        apparent motion         the plane       vibration. We would              of
therefore designate this motion we, which            each instant takes                   at
place about     axis  parallel
                         an        the  plane    the table,  tothe term            of                         by
equatoreal.
  It    the remaining angular motion
          is                                    which gives rise        the      to
                                                                                                                     its to

plane and about        own centre.  itsWere this the only motion, the
case    precisely
        is         similar                        to
                                that which would occur        the poles of                               at
the earth, and we shall therefore denominate               the polar mo                        it   as

   Now the plane        vibration does not evidently partake

    In the latitude of London this becomes 30.6 hours nearly,
 which will be about the time observed in an experiment carefully
 conducted; every possible source of disturbance, arising from
 imperfect centring of weight, accidental vibrations, currents,
 and apsidal motion, being removed.
    It has been well-observed by Mr. Sylvester, that although the
 plane of vibration does not partake of this polar motion, yet
 nevertheless the ball of the pendulum does, and hence it will
 rotate about its own axis in the same time as the
                                                                 table; the

        The third mode of exhibiting the reason of this phaeno
menon is a more popular one.
   At the north and south poles the case is clear enough. The
centre of the table being fixed directly over the pole of the earth,
will be stationary, while the table itself, being carried round by
the earth's rotation, will rotate about that centre once in twenty
four hours. The pendulum swinging freely over this centre will
continue to vibrate in                 its
                                 original direction, and thus the plane
of vibration will appear                    to

entertained by Prof. Potter himself; but as he now disclaims
that opinion, and attaches some mysterious meaning to the
terms “attributed cube,” “area for pressure,” &c., it rests with
him to explain by some argument better than the repetition of
a mere assertion, why he has changed his mind; and to give a
clearer definition than he has yet done, of the precise meaning
of his terms.

places do not seem to be more discrepant than would accord gene
rally with the differences of latitude. The experiment at Paris gave
about 11° 30', at Bristol 11°42', at Dublin rather more than 12°, at
York about 13°.
    To apprehend the theoretical principle, it is necessary to take
into account.—1st, the simple inclination of two successive positions
of the meridian of a place to each other after any interval of time;
2ndly, the independence of the motion of the ball of the pendulum,
of the rotation of the point of support; and 3rdly, that the ball,
though free in this sense, is not however wholly free, being continually
drawn down by gravity in a direction continually changing (rela
 tively to the original direction of vibration) as the earth revolves.
 Hence, though from the second cause the ball would have a ten
 dency always to preserve a motion parallel to                    original motion,      its
 and thus         deviate regularly from the meridian,
                  to                                                will (from the            it
 third cause) not preserve this exact parallelism, but will take                  in                                an
 termediate direction.         The exact determination of this direction
 cannot        be

    The lucid and able illustrations of the subject given by Professor
 Sylvester have thrown much light on the explanation.
    Modifications of the principle have been suggested by M. Chasles,
 on the idea of the difference of rotatory velocity between any two
 points on the same meridian; which difference, insensible as it might
seem to be for the minute length of a vibration, he shows will in
successive vibrations become sensible. This idea is nearly the same
as that announced by Laplace (Mécanique Céleste, vol.                            5), who                        iv.

mathematicians, and has been further carried out by M. Poinsot,

   Feb. 24, 1851–On several points of the Integral Calculus. By
Professor De Morgan.
   Some time ago, Mr. De Morgan communicated to the Society an
abstract of some unfinished views on the connexion between the or
dinary and singular solution of a differential equation.       The present
paper completes those views, and also contains sections on the solu
tion of differential equations by elimination, on the proof of the
number of constants which a solution may contain, and on the cri
terion of integrability of a function of r, y, and differential coefficients
of v.
   { On singular solutions.—As to equations of the first order, the
tests obtained in this paper may be described as follows:–
   Mr. De Morgan means by a singular solution any one which is
obtained by other process than integration, whether it be contained
in the integrated primitive, or not. When the singular solution is
not contained in the primitive, he calls it an extraneous solution.
   Let p(r, y, c)=0 be the primitive equation, giving c-b(w, y).
The differential equation then is
            y                         say-x(x, y)                                 º,         &c.

   Mr. De Morgan proposes the following geometrical illustration of
the connexion between the primaries and the singular.  Let c be the
third ordinate of a surface (usually denoted by z) having the equation
p(x, y, c)=0. The projections upon the plane of ry of sections
parallel to that plane are the primaries: the singular solution is the
base, upon the plane of ry, of a cylinder perpendicular to that
plane, and which always touches the surface.        By means of this
illustration, it may be made manifest that certain cases of singular
solution          which      have always                been   discarded         as     unmeaning,           are
limiting         of the kind which are admitted in analysis so soon as
               cases
the way up to the limit is clearly seen.
   Taking a general equation with two arbitrary constants, so that
a relation between those constants selects and designates a family
of curves, it is shown generally (without examination of exceptional
cases) how to find the families which have with their singular curves
contact of the second order. The equation of these singular curves
is a differential equation of the first order: but        singular solution      its
is the singular curve         family  of
                                       a                 of
                                         curves which have with        con                         it   a
tact of the third order.

theoretically in ascertaining what has since been confirmed by expe
riment, that provided the wire of the pendulum be round and homo
geneous, it may be made to turn round upon itself with tolerable
rapidity in either direction, without sensibly influencing the position
of the plane of oscillation, so that the experiment which we have just
described would perfectly succeed at the pole. This remarkable in
dependence of the plane of oscillation and of the point of suspension
is a mechanical phaenomenon dependent upon the inertia of matter,
which may be rendered evident in another form, by means of a very
simple experiment which led M. Foucault to the discovery.                         After
having fixed upon the arbor of a lathe and in the direction of its axis.
a round and flexible rod of steel, he set it in vibration by moving it

produced       aplane     oscillation, which          the persistence     by the visual                        of
impressions, was clearly delineated              space; and      in  remarked that                   he
      turning round with the hand the arbor which formed the support
of on
     this vibrating rod, the plane          oscillation was not disturbed, but

  ON THE ELECTRIC                   CURRENTS WHICH EXIST IN VEGETABLES.
                               BY PROF.    E. W.ARTMANN.
    For the two last years I have been engaged in the investigation of
the various physical phaenomena connected with vegetation, and I
have communicated at several meetings of the Société de Physique
et d'Histoire Naturelle of Geneva the results. The principal sub
jects of my observations were the influence of atmospheric electricity
and that of the battery on the development of plants; the influence
of electric currents and electro-magnetic induction on the circulation
of the sap and the direction of the organs; the permeability of dif
ferent vegetable parts to the rays of heat emanating from the sun or
from artificial sources, as well as their electric conductibility; the
polarizing and refractive properties of several tissues traversed by
luminous and calorific rays; the electric currents which exist in the
 soil and in the plants which vegetate in            &c.             it,
    The following are the conclusions                           to
                                                 which the examination has
led me:—
     1. The rheometer detects the existence of electric currents               all                   in
parts      vegetables, except those which are furnished with isolating
          of
 substances,        as
                   certain scales and various fruits          the Coniferae, or of
 which contain    scarcely  any   internal  humidity,   such     old bark, sca       as
rious hairs, &c.                                                                     *
     2. These currents exist night and day,             the sun       well in                 as     as   in
 the  shade;    they are not destroyed by aetherization          continued for
twenty-four hours, nor                   by
                                 the partial      total separation
                                                                or      the por                of

tral  parts  (pith  and  perfect  wood),      with the most external parts

toward the superior and inferior faces.              In numerous Cactuses, it
is from the    neighbouring    parts  toward the centre of the eye.
    6. The currents are feeble in flowers, and in the buds during
winter, whilst they are very marked in succulent fruits and in several
species of grain.
    7. In fruits, the direction of the axial currents varies with the
species.     The lateral currents proceed, in the greater number of
cases, from the superficial parts to the subjacent organs.
    8. Mushrooms exhibit in general two feeble currents; one directed
from the cap to the base of the stipes, the other laterally from the
centre to the periphery.
    9. A similar lateral current occurs in tubers.
    10. The strength of these different currents depends on that of
the vegetation, and the abundance of sap which bathes the parts of
the plant under examination.           It is in general greater in spring than
at any other period.
    11. When the soil and any part of a plant, visible or underground,
is placed in the circuit of the rheometer, we find a current directed
from the plant to the soil, which is thus positive with relation to                             it.
    12. The superficial layers          the soil are frequently positive rela
                                          of
tively  to  those which surround the spongioles.
    13. Currents are manifested also when two distinct plants are
placed  in   the circuit  of the rheometer, either             by
                                                            inserting       unoxi    an

needles into the   vegetable   organs   are often  very  considerable;    but they
 diminish with    rapidity,   and        in
                                     the end    generally  become almost null.
They result first from         electro-chemical action between the liquid

 substances brought into contact by the tearing                 of

 weak residual current (which            the normal current) owes
                                          is                                 origin  its

different concentration, and proceeds through them from the densest
to  the least dense liquid.
    15. The vegetable currents form very probably closed circuits.
The radical extremities          one part, and the foliaceous terminations
                                of

                 of an

other positive $.
    Currents from the pith and the wood to the bark, by the media

    These last currents show, that, in the act of vegetation, the earth
acquires continually an excess of positive electricity; the parenchyma
of the bark and a part of the wood, an excess of negative electricity,
which is transmitted to the air by means of the vapours of exhaled
Water.
    The leaves act like the green part of the parenchyma of the bark;
 that is to say, the sap which circulates in their tissues is negative
with relation to the wood, to the pith, and to the earth, and positive
 with regard to the cambium.
    The distribution of the ascending sap and the liquid of the cortical
 parenchyma leads to the belief that currents continually circulate in
vegetables from the bark to the pith.                               -

  AN INSTANCE      OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRICAL ACTION IN
                                 A FACTORY.
    My attention was recently directed to an instance of the develop
ment of electrical action in a factory of this city that seems worth
recording.
    The floors of this factory are laid with asphalt on arches of corru
gated iron. The arches are sprung between cast-iron cross-beams,
supported in the middle of their length by columns of the same mate
 rial; and at the ends by the side-walls of the building, as in other
fire-proof structures of the kind. It is observed, that when the ma
chinery of the factory is in action, there is a development of elec
tricity in some of the apartments, and so strong as to be troublesome
to the workers.        In one room especially, to which my attention was
 chiefly directed, the accumulation of the fluid is so considerable, that
 it has been found necessary to protect the work-people from the acci
 dental shocks they were now and again receiving, by connecting the
 machines with the iron columns of the building.
     In this room there is a cast-iron lathe-shears of about twenty-five
 feet in length, mounted with half-a-dozen small heads for wood
 turning. The spindles have consequently a high velocity, and are
 driven by leather belts in the usual way. The counter-shafts are
 suspended by gallowses from a continuous runner of plank, techni
 cally grounds, attached by bolts to the iron beams of the floor above;
 and derive their motion by leather belts passing to pulleys on the
 main line of shafting of the room. The shears are supported on iron
  standards, which rest on the asphalt floor.
     Some experimental observations were made on the electrical con
 dition of this machine when only three of the heads were in action.
  On breaking the connexion between the lathe and the column, by
 removing the wire with which they are usually connected for the pro
  tection of the workers, and allowing the electricity to accumulate for a
  few seconds, a pretty smart shock was experienced by the operator
  on his re-establishing the circuit by resting one hand on the shears
  and extending the other into contact with the column.        When the
  end of the connecting wire was held at a distance of about one
  twelfth of an inch from the column, the intermediate space was
  constantly luminous; at greater distances, the passage of the fluid
  was intermittent; but even at one-fourth of an inch the succession
  of sparks was very rapid. A very delicate multiplicator placed in
  the current was not sensibly affected ; and no deposition of copper
  from the solution of sulphate was effected by it in half-an-hour.
  But an electro-magnet, when placed in the current, acquired con
  siderable intensity, and acted powerfully on the needle of the mul
  tiplicator, and likewise on that of a tangent compass.

    Tried by the gold-leaf electroscope, the electricity was found to be
positive.  This was ascertained immediately after the instrument was
taken into the room; had the experiment been delayed, it is pro
bable that the fact would not have been satisfactorily determined, as
the instrument very soon became so excited by the opposite currents
in the room, that                     its
                      action was quite uncertain. And latterly, when
brought vertically within about two feet      one    the driving belts,            of            of
the motion             of
                the leaves became                                  so
                                      violent that about three-fourths
   the length            them was torn off, and adhered
of of
                  one     of                of                  the side                                         to
   the jar.   The excitation did not wholly disappear till several hours
after.
    Itmay seem somewhat contradictory that             these experiments                    in
the same current that affected the     electro-magnet    did not similarly
affect the needle      the  multiplicator.
                                      of      As this circumstance may
perhaps          be

                of                               transmitting the current       of

  Oxide of donarium contains 13:072 per cent. of oxygen; conse
quently theoxygen ratio in the silicic acid, oxide of donarium and water
is as 1 : 1:3, according to which the mineral, admitting oxide of
donarium to have the composition R• Os, will be represented by the
formula Do" Os SiO2+2HO, and the simplest name for the mineral
will be silicate of the oride of donarium.
    The hydrate of the oride of donarium has while moist a white
colour, but gradually turns yellow.                It forms a bulky precipitate,
which is   easily  collected    upon    a filter,  but is difficult to free entirely
from the precipitant,        especially    when potash or soda has been used.
When dried at the ordinary            temperature      of the air, it forms gum
like masses of a     yellow    colour,    which furnish a reddish powder. In
this state it forms a     pure   hydrate      of the oxide, which probably, like
the  peroxide    of iron,   is capable     of uniting with water in several pro
portions.    The water is       expelled     at a moderately-elevated tempera
ture. The    hydrate    dissolves at the ordinary temperature in                 acids,                is all

        MODE OF DISTINGUISHING ARTIFICIAL FROM NATURAL
                   CAMPHOR.   BY J. W. BAILEY.
      By the application of polarized light, the smallest portion of
natural  camphor  may   be distinguished from the artificial camphor
(chlorohydrate of camphene). If small fragments of each be placed
separately on glass slides, and a drop of alcohol added to each, they
dissolve and speedily recrystallize.    If the crystallization of the
natural camphor is watched by means of the microscope and po
larized light, a most beautiful display of coloured crystals is seen,
while with the artificial product nothing of the kind is witnessed.
